We describe an abstract, generic and extensible ontology, the Rover Context Model Ontology (RoCoMO), which is currently being designed and developed to model and represent context in an intelligent context-aware middleware system, called Rover II. The Rover Context Model (RoCoM) is the underlying context model for Rover II and is centered on four primitives that can be used to represent a situation: entity, event, activity and relationship. The ontology is expressed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and includes two components -- RoCoM Core Ontology and the RoCoM Application Ontology. We also illustrate its usage with the aid of a public safety application called M-Urgency that is currently deployed at the UMD campus.
