Selfies have become a prominent medium for self-portrayal on social media. Unfortunately, certain social media users go to extreme lengths to click selfies, which puts their lives at risk. Two hundred and sixteen individuals have died since March 2014 until January 2018 while trying to click selfies. It is imperative to be able to identify dangerous selfies posted on social media platforms to be able to build an intervention for users going to extreme lengths for clicking such selfies. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network based classifier to identify dangerous selfies posted on social media using only the image (no metadata). We show that our proposed approach gives an accuracy of $98%$ and performs better than previous methods.
