The Jasmin database machine is being implemented as part of a research project in distributed processing and database management A primary goal of the work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a practical multiprocessor database machine suitable for large database, high transaction-rate applications Key features of Jasmin are its configurable performance, its use of off-the-shelf parts, and its ability to handle distributed databases A uniprocessor prototype of Jasmin has already been completed and the multiprocessor version is planned for later this year In this paper we describe Jasmin's architecture and discuss the performance observed in the uniprocessor prototype
