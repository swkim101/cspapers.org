We address the problem of identifying important events in the past, present, and future from semantically-annotated large-scale document collections. Semantic annotations that we consider are named entities (e.g., persons, locations, organizations) and temporal expressions (e.g., during the 1990s). More specifically, for a given time period of interest, our objective is to identify, rank, and describe important events that happened. Our approach P2F Miner makes use of frequent itemset mining to identify events and group sentences related to them. It uses an information-theoretic measure to rank identified events. For each of them, it selects a representative sentence as a description. Experiments on ClueWeb09 using events listed in Wikipedia year articles as ground truth show that our approach is effective and outperforms a baseline based on statistical language models.
