A user-interface architecture, called FireWorks, is described. It consists of a domain-specific toolkit and frameworks for building information retrieval applications. The architectureâ€™s exrmessiveness is demonstrated bv first describing an , . example application, which is designed to help searchers coordinate access to multiple on-line sources. Second, FireWorks is compared to a similar architecture, called InfoGrid. The comparison focuses debate on what software abstractions are required for implementing a range of effective environments for information seeking.
