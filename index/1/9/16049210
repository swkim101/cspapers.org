Graphical models provide a broad probabilistic framework with applications in speech recognition (Hidden Markov Models), medical diagnosis (Belief networks) and artificial intelligence (Boltzmann Machines). However, the computing time is typically exponential in the number of nodes in the graph. Within the variational framework for approximating these models, we present two classes of distributions, decimatable Boltzmann Machines and Tractable Belief Networks that go beyond the standard factorized approach. We give generalised mean-field equations for both these directed and undirected approximations. Simulation results on a small benchmark problem suggest using these richer approximations compares favorably against others previously reported in the literature.
