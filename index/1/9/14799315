While the adoption of an implementation project for an operating systems course is certainly beneficial, non-trivial projects are inherently demanding in terms of student efforts and computer costs. This paper reports on a project which has been designed to keep the effort for an extensive simulation of a contemporary system within acceptable limits. The project involves both a hardware simulator and an operating system, and a considerable reduction of the overall effort could be achieved by enhancing the hardware with operating systems support features. The design criteria as well as the characteristics of the resulting hardware configuration and operating system are presented, and the value of the project as a teaching tool is discussed
