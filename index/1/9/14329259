Many sensor network applications generate large amounts of sensed data. These often need to be delivered reliably to the sink node for further processing. In such applications, high communication throughput allows for more data to be sensed. Intra-path interference is a problem in reliable forwarding of data and affects the end-to-end throughput. We show that using antennas that allow directional transmissions and receptions significantly reduces intra-path interference and enables high throughput forwarding of packet bursts over multiple hops using only one wireless channel.
