General circulation models are used to study the dynamics of the global ocean. Based on the Navier-Stokes equations, with the hypothesis of incompressibility and the Boussinesq approximation (the so-called primitive equations), and using a large number of gridpoints, their speed performance is a major bottle-neck. For these models parallelism is a promising technique to get reasonable completion times. Here a method of multitasking an ocean general circulation model is presented which divides the three-dimensional domain into horizontally or vertically independent slabs, depending on which term of the equations, and distributes the computations to different processors. In addition, at each time step an elliptic equation is solved in parallel. Synchronizations are performed between the processors by calls to a unique subroutine which establishes a barrier synchronization. An application is performed on a CRAY-2 showing a speed-up on the order of 3.5 using 4 processors, for a problem of the order of 100x100 horizontal gridpoints and 16 vertical levels, which is a common discretization for oceanic models. The vectorization is still efficient as the ratio of no-vector/vector is of the order of 13.
