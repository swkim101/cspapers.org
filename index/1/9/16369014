We have been experimenting at The George Washington University with our undergraduate and graduate courses in Data Structures. In particular, we are using a very modern text [HORO78] and a strong emphasis in lectures and projects on the practical application of data abstraction, and its relationship to both structured programming and machine efficiency. Student projects are subroutine packages written, in “real-world” programming languages, as faithful and modular implementations of the abstractions studied.
 Throughout the courses, attention is paid to the relationship between structured programming and data structures, and between these two and time/space efficiency considerations.
 After a preliminary discussion of data abstraction concepts, we present a case study, namely a sparse-matrix system, and some observations.
