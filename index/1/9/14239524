Algorithm scalability and the distributed nature of both data and computation deserve serious attention in the context of data mining. This paper presents PADMA (PArallel Data Mining Agents), a parallel agent based system, that makes an effort to address these issues. PADMA contains modules for (1) parallel data accessing operations, (2) parallel hierarchical clustering, and (3) web-based data visualization. This paper describes the general architecture of PADMA and experimental results.
