Feature location aims at locating pieces of code that implement a given set of features (requirements). It is a necessary first step in every program comprehension and maintenance task if the connection between features and code has been lost.We have developed a semi-automatic technique for feature location using a combination of static and dynamic program analysis. Formal concept analysis is used to explore the results of the dynamic analysis.We describe new experiences with our technique. Specifically, we investigate the gain of information and increase of costs when the system under analysis is profiled at basic block level rather than routine level as in our earlier work. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the scenarios used for the dynamic analysis (minimal versus combined scenarios).
