Our system design is a result of our HRI studies in USAR (see, for example, [Yanco and Drury 2004; Scholtz et al. 2004; Yanco et al. 2004]). A major influence on our design philosophy comes from the observation that users of USAR interfaces become so absorbed in the video display that they ignore all other information on the interface. We exploit this behavior in our design by placing important information on and around the main video display to make it difficult for users to overlook. A full description of the work can be found in [Baker et al. 2004].
