Video shot detection is the processor-intensive task of splitting a video into continuous shots, with hard or soft cuts as the boundaries. In this paper, we present a client-side onthe-fly approach to this challenge based on modern HTML5enabled Web APIs. We show how video shot detection can be seamlessly embedded into video platforms like YouTube using browser extensions. Once a video has been split into shots, shot-based video navigation gets enabled and more fine-grained playing statistics can be created.
