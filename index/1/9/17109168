In this paper, we proposed a new image encryption algorithm, that is based on Arnold cat map and logistic chaotic system to improve the security of the image transmission. An input image can be shuffled by iterative using Arnold cat map operations. But, after several iterations the shuffle image will return to the original image. It is obvious that we cannot using the Arnold cat map only to promise the system security. If we applied the logistic map algorithm to shuffled the original image. Then encrypted the shuffled results of the logistic map algorithm by the Arnold cat map. It will improve the system security largely.
