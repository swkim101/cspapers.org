Accounts are often shared by multiple users, eachof them having different item consumption and temporal habits. Identifying of the active user can lead to improvements ina variety of services by switching from account personalizedservices to user personalized services. To do so, we developa topic model extending the Latent Dirichlet Allocation usinga hidden variable representing the active user and assumingconsumption times to be generated by latent time topics. Wecreate a new dataset of composite accounts from real users totest the identification capabilities of our model. We show thatour model is able to learn temporal patterns from the whole setof accounts and infer the active user using both the consumptiontime and the consumed item.
