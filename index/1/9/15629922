In this paper, we propose the first real time rumor debunking algorithm for Twitter. We use cues from 'wisdom of the crowds', that is, the aggregate 'common sense' and investigative journalism of Twitter users. We concentrate on identification of a rumor as an event that may comprise of one or more conflicting microblogs. We continue monitoring the rumor event and generate real time updates dynamically based on any additional information received. We show using real streaming data that it is possible, using our approach, to debunk rumors accurately and efficiently, often much faster than manual verification by professionals.
