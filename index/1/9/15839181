A protection measure based on a simple model of a protection system is presented. The measure shows how closely a computer system adheres to the principle of minimum privilege. Its application to the operating system of the Cambridge University CAP computer is described and ways of bringing the operating system closer to a state of minimum privilege are discussed. The results of this work have demonstrated that the measure provides a useful tool for the designers of operating systems and other software.
 A module in a computer system has a repertoire of services it can perform; the services provided by a module are made available to other modules as functions. An original feature of the work described in this paper is the attention paid to functions in the context of protection in computer systems. The protection model and the protection measure are defined in terms of the objects accessible to a process and it is important to note that functions are considered to be objects.
