In this paper we propose TripBuilder, a new framework for personalized touristic tour planning. We mine from Flickr the information about the actual itineraries followed by a multitude of different tourists, and we match these itineraries on the touristic Point of Interests available from Wikipedia. The task of planning personalized touristic tours is then modeled as an instance of the Generalized Maximum Coverage problem. Wisdom-of-the-crowds information allows us to derive touristic plans that maximize a measure of interest for the tourist given her preferences and visiting time-budget. Experimental results on three different touristic cities show that our approach is effective and outperforms strong baselines.
