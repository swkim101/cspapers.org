Presents the N. mPc runtime environment consisting of the Ecologist, Simulated Memory Processor, Kernel, Command Interpreter, and Simulated Memory Manager. The Ecologist and Simulated Memory Processor assemble the hardware and software modules to form network simulations. The Kernel, Command Interpreter, and Simulated Memory Manager provide the runtime environment The Kernel performs all process scheduling, data structure manipulation, and manages simulation breakpoint and monitor functions. Simulated memories are handled by the Simulated Memory Manager. The interface between the simulation and the user is handled by the Command Interpreter which accepts commands from the user to examine or modify simulation states, to control simulation execution, or to set up data collection from executing simulations.
