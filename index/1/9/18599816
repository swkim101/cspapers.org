Binarization of grammars is crucial for improving the complexity and performance of parsing and translation. We present a versatile binarization algorithm that can be tailored to a number of grammar formalisms by simply varying a formal parameter. We apply our algorithm to binarizing tree-to-string transducers used in syntax-based machine translation.
