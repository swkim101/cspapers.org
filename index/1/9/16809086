The preliminary hardware description of CHOPP (Columbia Homogeneous Parallel Processor), a MIMD machine supporting a fully distributed host-less operating system is presented. The architecture is intended to permit implementation of machines with 10<supscrpt>5</supscrpt> to 10<supscrpt>6</supscrpt> processors. Issues of interconnection networks, throughput, and memory structure are treated.
