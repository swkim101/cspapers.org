In this paper, we propose a novel sentiment lexicon enhanced attention-based LSTM (SLEA-LSTM) model to improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment classification. Our method successfully integrates sentiment lexicon into deep neural networks via single-head or multi-head attention mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments on MR and SST datasets. The experimental results show that our model achieved comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.
