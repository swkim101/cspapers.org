The dominant approaches to information retrieval system design are based on rational theory and cognitive engineering. However, these theories as well as approaches in other disciplines, reviewed in this paper, do not account for communication, or interaction, among design participants which is critical to design outcomes. This research attempts to develop a descriptive design model that accounts for communication among users, designers, and developers throughout the design process. A pilot study has been completed and a preliminary model that represents a first step in understanding participants' evolving perceptions and expectations of the design process and its outcomes is described in this paper.
