This paper describes a medium, called Interactive e-Hon, for helping children to understand contents from the Web. It works by transforming electronic contents into an easily understandable "storybook world." In this world, easy-to-understand contents are generated by creating 3D animations that include contents and metaphors, and by using a child-parent model with dialogue expression and a question-answering style comprehensible to children.
