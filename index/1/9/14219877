In this article, we build dynamic models of 2D compliant links to evaluate injury level in a human-robot interaction. Safety is a premium concern for co-robotic systems. It has been studied that using compliant links in a robot can greatly reduce the injury level. Since most safety criteria are based on tolerance of acceleration of the operator's head during the impact, an efficient and yet accurate dynamic model of compliant links is needed. In this paper, we compare three dynamic models for calculating acceleration and head injury criterion: the compliant Beam-Spring-Mass (BSM) model, the Mass-Spring-Mass (MSM) model and the Link-Spring-Mass (LSM) model. For the MSM model and LSM model, we obtain analytic expressions of acceleration. While numerical results are achieved for the compliant BSM model. To develop the compliant BSM model, we compared three different methods: the Pseudo-Rigid-Body (PRB) model, the Finite-Segment-Model (FSM), and the Assumed-Mode-Method (AMM). Finally, all these models are validated by human-robot impact simulation programs built in Matlab. The acceleration from these simulations can be used to quantitatively measure the injury level during an impact.
