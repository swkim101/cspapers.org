Matching person names plays an important role in many applications, including bibliographic databases and indexing systems. Name variations and spelling errors make exact string matching problematic; therefore, it is useful to develop methodologies that can handle variant forms for the same named entity. In this paper, a novel person name matching model is presented. Common name variations in the English speaking world are formalized, and the concept of name transformation paths is introduced; name similarity is measured after the best transformation path has been selected. Supervised techniques are used to learn a similarity function and a decision rule. Experiments with three datasets show the method to be effective.
