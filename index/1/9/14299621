We propose an evaluation method of grasp stability which takes into account the elastic deformation of fingertips from the viewpoint of energy. An evaluation value of grasp stability is derived as the minimum energy which causes slippage of a fingertip on its contact surface. To formulate the evaluation value, the elastic potential energy of fingertips and the gravitational potential energy of a grasped object are considered. It is ensured that fingertips do not slip on grasped object surfaces if the external energy applied to the object is less than the evaluation value. Since our evaluation value explicitly considers the deformation values of fingertips, grasp stability is evaluated by taking into consideration the contact forces generated by the deformation. The effectiveness of our method is verified through numerical examples.
