In Secure message transmission (<b>SMT</b>) protocols two nodes in a network want to communicate securely, given that some of the nodes in the network are corrupted by an adversary with <i>unlimited computational power</i>. An SMT protocol uses multiple paths between the sender and a receiver to guarantee <i>privacy</i> and <i>reliability</i> of the message transmission. An (ε, Δ)-SMT protocol bounds the adversary's success probability of breaking privacy and reliability to ε and Δ, respectively. Rate optimal SMT protocols have the smallest transmission rate (amount of communication per one bit of message). Rate optimal protocols have been constructed for a restricted set of parameters.
 In this paper we use wire virtualization method to construct new optimal protocols for a wide range of parameters using previously known optimal protocols. In particular, we design, for the first time, an optimal 1-round (0, Δ)-SMT protocol for <i>n</i> = (2 + <i>c</i>)<i>t</i>, <i>c</i> ≥ 1/<i>t</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of paths between the sender and the receiver, up to <i>t</i> of which are controlled by the adversary. We also design an optimal 2-round (0, 0)-SMT protocol for <i>n</i> = (2 + <i>c</i>)<i>t</i>, <i>c</i> ≥ 1/<i>t</i>, with communication cost better than the known protocols. The wire virtualization method can be used to construct other protocols with provable properties from component protocols.
