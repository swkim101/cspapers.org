Topological sorting provides a partial ordering for a group of data items for which a partial linear ordering exists.
 Our use of the topological sorting algorithm has been in the logical organization of curriculum content. Curriculum content can vary from organizing a forty minute lecture to planning a four year sequence of courses. Application of topological sorting to the curriculum content results in a logical organization of the concepts, which may or may not be unique. Users of TOPSORT claim a major time savings in the long run. Backtracking to cover prerequisite concepts in teaching is reduced.
