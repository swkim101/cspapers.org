We consider methods of modifying LR(k) parsers [1] while preserving the ability of that parsing method to detect errors at the earliest possible point on the input. Two transformations are developed, and the methods of Korenjak [2] and DeRemer [3] are expressed in terms of these transformations. The relation between these two methods is exposed. Proofs are for the most part omitted, but can be found in [4].
