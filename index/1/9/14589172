This paper is about the modular compilation and distribution of a sub-class of Simulink programs [9] across networks using bounded FIFO queues. The problem is first addressed mathematically. Then, based on these formal results, a software library for the modular compilation and distribution of Simulink programs is given. The performance of the library is given. The value of synchronous programming for the next generation of traffic control is discussed. The adoption of these tools seems to be the natural candidate to address the needs of traffic engineers. As a case study we present an implementation in Simulink of a controller for coordinated traffic signals in an asymmetric peak hour traffic scenario and we evaluate its computational performance in a distributed environment.
