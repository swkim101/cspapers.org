The SCARA-Tau parallel manipulator was derived with the objective to overcome the limited workspace-to-footprint ratio of the DELTA parallel manipulator while maintaining its many benefits. The SCARA-Tau family has later been extended and a large number of variants have been proposed. In this paper, we analyse four of these variants, which together encompass the main differences between all the proposed SCARA-Tau manipulators. The analysed manipulator variants utilise an identical arrangement of five of the six linkages connecting the actuated arms and the manipulated platform and exhibit the same input-output Jacobian. The normalised reciprocal product between the wrench of the sixth linkage and the twist of the platform occurring without this linkage provides a measure on how effectively the sixth linkage constrains the manipulated platform. A comparison of the manipulator variants with respect to this measure demonstrates each variants suitability for specific applications.
