This paper focuses on proposing an easily-implemented control method for high-acceleration point-to-point motions. The control algorithm used here to handle the disturbances consists of a model-based feedforward controller, a pole-placement PD controller and a disturbance observer. Then, a fast time-domain identification technique is implemented to give the accurate model parameters, which can be directly utilized in the control algorithm. The method avoids the complicated parameters tuning process, which would be attractive in the industrial application. Experiments are carried out on a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving high-precision and fast positioning by reducing the tracking error and overshoot.
