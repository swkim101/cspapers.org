This paper presented a novel compliant actuator used for lower limb exoskeletons. The compliant joint consists of a series elastic actuator (SEA) and parallel elastic (PE) unit. SEA has various advantages as the actuator of assistive exoskeletons, such as low output impedance, impact absorption, precise force control and high stability. We designed and fabricated a novel SEA as the primary joint actuator which is compact, adjustable and low-cost. Meanwhile an additional elastic unit is installed in parallel with the SEA to improve energy utilization by storing and releasing energy during motion cycles. An adaptive stable controller is designed to realize the joint following motion to a virtual limb. The algorithm can identify and compensate the undetermined contact stiffness between the joint output and the virtual limb. Finally, the performance of the actuator is evaluated through motion tracking and energy-conservation experiments. Preliminary results indicate the validity of the design and imply its potential usage in lower limb exoskeletons.
