We propose translation-enabled memory prefetching optimizations or TEMPO, a low-overhead hardware mechanism to boost memory performance by exploiting the operating system's (OS) virtual memory subsystem. We are the first to make the following observations: (1) a substantial fraction (20-40%) of DRAM references in modern big- data workloads are devoted to accessing page tables; and (2) when memory references require page table lookups in DRAM, the vast majority of them (98%+) also look up DRAM for the subsequent data access. TEMPO exploits these observations to enable DRAM row-buffer and on-chip cache prefetching of the data that page tables point to. TEMPO requires trivial changes to the memory controller (under 3% additional area), no OS or application changes, and improves performance by 10-30% and energy by 1-14%.
