Forest planting currently is expensive and very labor intensive. In order to automatize forest planting, it is necessary to detect good planting spots automatically. In this paper, a method for automatic detection of planting spots is described. The information for the detection is deduced merely from stereo images. A continuous 3D reconstruction is performed and the planting spots are inferred using a 3D Implicit Shape Model and planting spot score boosting. The results of our method are promising: the precision of the detector is 94.8 % with a recall rate of 98.0 %.
