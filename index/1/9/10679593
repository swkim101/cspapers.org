A mobile robot system using NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) method is designed for automatic integrity evaluation of large size reservoirs and pipelines in industrial fields. The designed mobile robot can crawl on the outer surface of the reservoirs and the pipelines with different shapes and can detect defects such as pinholes, cracks and thickness reduction using EMAT (Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer). Automation of defect detection by mobile robot systems for these kinds of large-scale structures helps to prevent significant troubles of the structures without danger of human beings under harmful environment.
