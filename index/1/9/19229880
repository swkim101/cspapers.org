Next, we propose a learning objective motivated by our theoretical resultthat utilises k-way co-occurrences for learning word embeddings.Our experimental results show that the derived theoretical relationship does indeed hold empirically, anddespite data sparsity, for some smaller k(≤5) values, k-way embeddings perform comparably or better than 2-way embeddings in a range of tasks.
