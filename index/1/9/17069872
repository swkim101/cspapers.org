Using traditional mobile input devices results in decreasedeffectiveness and efficiency. To improve usability issues aportable Non-Keyboard QWERTY touch-typing paradigm that supportsthe mobile touch-typing user is presented and investigated. Itrequires negligible training time. Pressure sensors strapped to thefingertips of gloves detect which finger is depressed. A languagemodel based on lexical and syntactic knowledge transforms thedepressed finger stroke sequence into real words and sentences.Different mobile input QWERTY paradigms (miniaturised, floating andNon-Keyboard) have been compared with full-size QWERTY. Among themobile input paradigms, the Non-Keyboard fared significantlybetter, both regarding character error rate and subjectiveratings.
