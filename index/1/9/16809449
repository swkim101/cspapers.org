Many of today's complex systems are multi-threaded servers that effectively run forever and need to work under varying loads and environments. Understanding the behavior of such systems, both their normal behavior and any abnormal behavior, is a necessary step in their development, deployment, and use. We have developed a performance analysis framework that is targeted for such systems. The framework deals with a variety of performance issues including cpu usage, memory utilization, I/O behavior, thread interactions, and event handling. Data is collected within a fixed overhead set dynamically by the user. The tool's user interface shows the behavior of the system as it is happening and lets the user browse through the execution history.
