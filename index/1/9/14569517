We describe efficient constructions of small probability spaces that approximate the independent distribution for general random variables. Previous work on efficient constructions concentrate on approximations of the independent distribution for the special case of uniform boolean-valued random variables. Our results yield efficient constructions of small sets with low discrepancy in high dimensional space and have applications to derandomizing randomized algorithms.
