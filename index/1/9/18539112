Considering the new threats in medical robotics due to increasing complexity and autonomy, and the absence of dedicated standards, we present in this paper how we carried safety analyses for a rehabilitation robot. We combine several standards and research works for a safe design and to construct a safety case for regulatory bodies. We point out some challenges for standardization and future research.
