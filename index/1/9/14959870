Semijoin strategies are a technique for query processing in distributed database systems. In the past, methodologies for constructing minimum communication-cost strategies for solving tree queries have been developed. These assume point-to-point communication and ignore local processing costs and the limited communication capacity of the system. In this paper, query processing in bus or loop systems is considered. The definition of strategy is extended to allow for broadcast mode of communication. We then address the problem of finding the minimum response-time schedule for executing a given strategy in an m-bus system taking into account local processing and system capacity. It is shown that the problem is computationally intractable for general tree queries, even in a 1-bus system, and for special classes of tree queries in an m-bus system. However, there is a polynomial-time algorithm for simple queries in a 1-bus system.
