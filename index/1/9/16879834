This paper presents an overview of OLE DB, a set of interfaces being developed at Microsoft whose goal is to enable applications to have uniform access to data stored in DBMS and non-DBMS information containers. Applications will be able to take advantage of the benefits of database technology without having to transfer data from its place of origin to a DBMS. Our approach consists of defining an open, extensible Collection of interfaces that factor and encapsulate orthogonal, reusable portions of DBMS functionality. These interfaces define the boundaries of DBMS components such as record containers, query processors, and transaction coordinators that enable uniform, transactional access to data among such components. The proposed interfaces extend Microsoft's OLE/COM object services framework with database functionality, hence these interfaces are collectively referred to as OLE DB. The OLE DB functional areas include data access and updates (rowsets), query processing, schema information, notifications, transactions, security, and access to remote data. In a sense, OLE DB represents an effort to bring database technology to the masses. This paper presents an overview of the OLE DB approach and its areas of componentization.
