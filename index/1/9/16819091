We present a new algorithm for computing interprocedural aliases due to passing parameters by reference. This algorithm runs in O(<italic>N<supscrpt>2</supscrpt></italic>+<italic>NE</italic>) time and, when combined with algorithms for alias-free, flow-insensitive data-flow problems, yields algorithms for solution of the general flow-insensitive problems that also run in O(<italic>N<supscrpt>2</supscrpt></italic>+<italic>NE</italic>) time.
