A large amount of software development is performed by teams of individuals. To prepare students for these team efforts, many universities are beginning to offer computer science courses in which a software development team project is undertaken. The performance of these teams may be affected by many complex factors. This paper will describe some of our experiences from teaching several different types of project team courses. Factors which affect project team effectiveness will also be discussed.
