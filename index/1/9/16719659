Splitting off is a powerful tool for proving theorems and developing polynomial-time algorithms on graphs, especially for edge-connectivity problems. We present efficient algorithms for splitting off, leading to efficient algorithms for connectivity problems. We improve pr~ vious algorithms (baaed on submodular flow) to find a k-edge-connected orientation of an undirected graph or Multigraph. We also improve the beat bounds for the edge connectivity augmentation problem for undirected and directed multigraphs, and for the local connectivity y augmentation problem on undirected graphs and multigraphs, each by a factor n. We also give efficient algorithms for finding a well-balanced orientation of an undirected graph or Multigraph. Our approach mea a graph transformation that allows efficient computation of cuts that are variants of the minimum s, t-cut.
