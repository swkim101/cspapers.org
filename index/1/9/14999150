We report here on our experiments with POST (Part of Speech Tagger) to address problems of ambiguity and of understanding unknown words. Part of speech tagging, perse, is a well understood problem. Our paper reports experiments in three important areas: handling unknown words, limiting the size of the training set, and returning a set of the most likely tags for each word rather than a single tag. We describe the algorithms that we used and the specific results of our experiments on Wall Street Journal articles and on MUC terrorist messages.
