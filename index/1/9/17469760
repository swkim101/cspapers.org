Computing is currently characterized by an undesirable trend towards factionalism. Factionalism is the consequence of the immature evolutionary status of computing as an inexact science. The optimist (uniglots, rhythmists, stylizers, and communicants) and pessimist factions are described. An advocacy for a move from factionalism towards fraternalism is presented. The multidisciplinary nature of computing is discussed with its implications for alternative problem perspectives. The need for experimentalism in computing is emphasized. The proposed move from factionalism to fraternalism will encourage the balanced objectivity necessary for the further evolutionary development of computing as a formal discipline.
