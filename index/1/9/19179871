Our proposed CDCL SAT solving algorithm expSAT uses a novel branching heuristic expVSIDS. It combines the standard VSIDS scores with heuristic scores derived from exploration. Experiments with application benchmarks from recent SAT competitions demonstrate the potential of the expSAT approach for improving CDCL SAT solvers.
