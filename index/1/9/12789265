The exploitation of dominance relations in constraint optimization problems can lead to dramatic reductions in search space. We propose an automatic method to detect some of the dominance relations manually identified by Chu and Stuckey for optimization problems, and to construct the associated dominance breaking constraints. Experimental results show that the method is able to find several dominance relations and to generate effective dominance breaking constraints.
