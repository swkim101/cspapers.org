Mobile robotics has been labelled as a subject which has promised so much but produced so little. In response to this we present here various research and development issues which we are addressing in order to realise an internal post distributing mobile robot. To realise this application we have implemented a behavioural control system which is capable of recognising scenes within a known environment. The behaviours are defined as sensor data fuelled algorithms capable of dealing with both expected and unexpected situations. An algorithm for localising the mobile robot in the presence of uncertain odometric information is also presented. By tracking predicted features from the environment with a sonar range sensor, we show that the position of the vehicle can be accurately estimated whilst simultaneously building a map of the environment. We also present some mechanical concepts which we have considered for the distribution of post itself within an indoor environment.<<ETX>>
