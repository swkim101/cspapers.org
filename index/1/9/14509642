Computer networks have been introduced in almost all areas of business. Moreover, connecting local area netwotks through wide area netwotics has become quite popular. However, the software running on such an infrastructure still seldom use it. Most often the problem is the lack of expertise, on the part of the application programmers, in writing such applications. The IT industry as well as computer scientists have investigated and evaluated approaches that should help these programmers to make better use of the networks. This panel discussed certain solutions that help to better utilize the network. DSOM [l], OODCE [2], and COM [3] were the systems presented by the panelists.
