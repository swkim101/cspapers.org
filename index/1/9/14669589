This paper addresses the problem of training of operators for telemanipulation tasks. In particular, it describes the development of a physics based virtual environment that allows a user to train in the control of an innovative robotic tool designed for the retrieval of spent nuclear fuels. The robotic device is designed to adapt to very different environments, at the cost of an increased complexity in its control. The virtual environment provides realistic simulation of robot dynamics. The two most challenging tasks related to robot control have been identified and implemented in the simulation, leading to an effective tool for the training. The developed application is described in details and the outcome of one simulated intervention is proposed and analyzed in terms of user interaction and realism.
