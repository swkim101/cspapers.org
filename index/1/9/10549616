We consider the problem of answering queries from databases that may be incomplete. A database is incomplete if some tuples may be missing from some relations, and only a part of each relation is known to be complete. This problem arises in several contexts. For example, systems that provide access to multiple heterogeneous information sources often encounter incomplete sources. The question we address is to determine whether the answer to a specific given query is complete even when the database is incomplete. We present a novel sound and complete algorithm for the answer-completeness problem by relating it to the problem of independence of queries from updates. We also show an important case of the independence problem (and therefore ofthe answer-completeness problem) that can be decided in polynomial time, whereas the best known algorithm for this case is exponential. This case involves updates that are described using a conjunction of comparison predicates. We also describe an algorithm that determines whether the answer to the query is complete in the current state of the database. Finally, we show that our â€˜treatment extends naturally to partiallyincorrect databases.
