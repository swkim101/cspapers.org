The central idea behind this paper is that the discipline governing the exchange of messages between objects should be specifiable by the programmer in the form of an explicit law of the system. We show how, starting from a very primitive foundation, which presumes neither encapsulation nor inheritance, one can establish various forms of both, as well as other useful disciplines, simply by means of appropriate laws.
