In this paper, we will propose a data hiding method to embed the color information into the grayscale image and then only authorized users can recover the original color image. At the same time, according to the viewer's reliability, image owners can distribute the different embedding color image information. In other words, they will assign the more closer to the original image color information palette to the viewer with higher reliability and then the viewer can reconstruct the image is closer to the original image. On the contrary, they also can embed the different from the original image's color palette into the grayscale image when the viewer with lower reliability and then he gets the reconstructed image is obviously distorted. According to the experimental results, we can prove that our proposed scheme has the authority to reach the palette image reconstruction purpose.
