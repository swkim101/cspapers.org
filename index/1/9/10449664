In this ongoing work we perform the first systematic investigation of cross-platform (X-platform) malware. As a first step, this paper presents an exploration into existing X-platform malware families and X-platform vulnerabilities used to distribute them. Our exploration shows that X-platform malware uses a wealth of methods to achieve portability. It also shows that exploits for X-platform vulnerabilities are X-platform indeed and readily available in commercial exploit kits, making them an inexpensive distribution vector for X-platform malware.
