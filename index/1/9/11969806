The W3C web accessibility standards have now existed for over a decade yet implementation of accessible websites, software, and web technologies is lagging behind this development. This fact is largely due to lack of knowledge and expertise among developers and due to fragmentation of web accessibility approaches. It is an opportune time to develop authoritative practical guidance and harmonized approaches, and to research potential challenges and opportunities in future technologies in a collaborative setting. The EC-funded WAI-ACT project addresses these needs through use of an open cooperation framework that builds on and extends the existing mechanisms of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). This paper presents the WAI-ACT project and how it will drive accessibility implementation in advanced web technologies.
