The Robot Intelligence Kernel (RIK) is a portable, reconfigurable suite of perceptual, behavioral, and cognitive capabilities that can be used across many different platforms, environments, and tasks. The RIK coupled with a virtual 3D interface have been shown to dramatically improve human-robot interactions across a variety of navigation and exploration tasks.
