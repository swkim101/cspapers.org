We are investigating the possibility of constructing meaningful and computationally efficient approximate reasoning methods for the first order logic. In particular, we study a situation when only certain aspects of the domain are of interest to the user. This is reflected by an equivalence relation defined on the domain of the knowledge base. The whole mechanism is called domain abstraction and is demonstrated to lead to significant computational advantages. The domain abstraction discussed in the paper is only a very special case of the more general notion of abstraction which is discussed shortly here and is a subject of the currently ongoing research.
