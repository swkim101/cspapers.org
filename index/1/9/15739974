In this paper new procedures for the measurement of mobility parameters, such as contact pressure, and an analysis of a low-pressure wheel model on deformable terrain, are presented. Because the lunar surface is covered by regolith which implies an irregular and rough terrain, the rover has difficulty in moving. Therefore a new low-pressure wheel is recommended for high mobility performance and low power consumption with a less complex mechanism. A low-pressure wheel can change its contact shape and pressure distribution to account for terrain. The presented measurement is achieved by a new measurement instrument on the wheel, and we presented analysis model is conducted through analysis of terramechanics mobility dynamics of a low-pressure wheel with normal stress. These procedures are valuable for evaluating the longitudinal velocity of the low-pressure wheel on deformable terrain.
