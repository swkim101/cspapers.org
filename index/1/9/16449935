The cloud computing paradigm emerged with service oriented principles. In the cloud setting, organizations outsource their IT equipment and manage their business processes through virtual services that are typically exchanged over HTTP. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) depict the status of running services. SLAs represent operational contracts that allow providers to estimate their service avail- ability according to their resource capacity. The SLA data schema and content are operationally defined by the type, volume and relations of service elements that organizations operate on their physical resources. Current lack of a uniform SLA standardization leads to semantic and operational differences between SLAs, that are produced and consumed by different organizations. Such differences prohibit common business SLA practices in the cloud computing domain. Our research introduces systematic SLA data management to describe the formalization, storage and processing of SLAs over distributed computing environments. Services in scope are framed within the cloud computing context.
