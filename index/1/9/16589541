In this paper, design and integration of the ROBHAZ-DT3 are introduced which is a newly developed mobile robot system with double tracks. It is designed to curry out military and civilian missions in various hazardous environments. The rotational passive adaptation mechanism equipped between the front and rear body enables the ROBHAZ-DT3 to have good adaptability to uneven terrain including stairways. The passive adaptation mechanism reduces energy consumption in moving on uneven terrain as well as it offers simplicity in design and teleoperation. Based on this new design concept, dynamic simulation was conducted to determine the significant parameters such as optimal track size and allowable attack angle. Also dynamic effects in vehicle turning are investigated to assess proper load torque. The ROBHAZ-DT3 system developed was successfully experimented in stair climbing case.
