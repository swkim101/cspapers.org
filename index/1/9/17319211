This paper focuses on dehazing nighttime images. Most existing dehazing methods use models that are formulated to describe haze in daytime. Daytime models assume a single uniform light color attributed to a light source not directly visible in the scene. Nighttime scenes, however, commonly include visible lights sources with varying colors. These light sources also often introduce noticeable amounts of glow that is not present in daytime haze. To address these effects, we introduce a new nighttime haze model that accounts for the varying light sources and their glow. Our model is a linear combination of three terms: the direct transmission, airlight and glow. The glow term represents light from the light sources that is scattered around before reaching the camera. Based on the model, we propose a framework that first reduces the effect of the glow in the image, resulting in a nighttime image that consists of direct transmission and airlight only. We then compute a spatially varying atmospheric light map that encodes light colors locally. This atmospheric map is used to predict the transmission, which we use to obtain our nighttime scene reflection image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nighttime haze model and correction method on a number of examples and compare our results with existing daytime and nighttime dehazing methods' results.
