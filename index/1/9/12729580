This article addresses the fast solution of a Quadratic Program underlying a Linear Model Predictive Control scheme that generates walking motions. We introduce an algorithm which is tailored to the particular requirements of this problem, and therefore able to solve it efficiently. Different aspects of the algorithm are examined, its computational complexity is presented, and a numerical comparison with an existing state of the art solver is made. The approach presented here, extends to other general problems in a straightforward way.
