We present M.Sketch, a prototyping tool to support non-experts to design and build linkage-based mechanism prototype. It enables users to draw and simulate arbitrary mechanisms as well as to make physical prototype for testing actual movement. Mix of bottom-up and top-down sketching approaches, real-time movement visualization, and functions for digital fabrication can make the users to design the desired mechanism easily and effectively. M.Sketch can be used to design customized products with kinetic movement, such as interactive robot, toys, and sculptures.
