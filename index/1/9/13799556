Millions of people use social media to share information during disasters and mass emergencies. Information available on social media, particularly in the early hours of an event when few other sources are available, can be extremely valuable for emergency responders and decision makers, helping them gain situational awareness and plan relief efforts. Processing social media content to obtain such information involves solving multiple challenges, including parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information. These challenges can be mapped to information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. This work highlights these challenges and presents state of the art computational techniques to deal with social media messages, focusing on their application to crisis scenarios.
