This panel gives a non-standard view of the future of software engineering. Two of the speakers are recent Ph.D. graduates in computer science, with expertise in software engineering, who have taken academic positions; as people who will educate the next generation of software engineering practitioners and researchers, they provide a key vision of the future. The other two speakers are senior, having moved from the research community into a world in which they face the problems of engineering software on a daily basis. Collectively, along with interactions from the audience, these two often underrepresented perspectives provide a sense of the key directions in which software engineering— practice, research, and education—should and must go.
