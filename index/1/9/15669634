Haptic feedback plays a key role in surgeries, but it is still a missing component in robotic Minimally Invasive Surgeries. This paper proposes a dynamic model-based sensorless grip force estimation method to address the haptic perception problem for commonly used elongated cable-driven surgical instruments. Cable and cable-pulley properties are studied for dynamic modeling; grip forces, along with driven motor and gripper jaw positions and velocities are jointly estimated with Unscented Kalman Filter and only motor encoder readings and motor output torques are assumed to be known. A bounding filter is used to compensate for model inaccuracy and to improve method robustness. The proposed method was validated on a 10mm gripper which is driven by a Raven-II surgical robot. The gripper was equipped with 1-dimensional force sensors which served as ground truth data. The experimental results showed that the proposed method provides sufficiently good grip force estimation, while only motor encoder and the motor torques are used as observations.
