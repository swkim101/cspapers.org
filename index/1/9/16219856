A large portion of todayâ€™s Web traffic comes from mobiles devices. User experience of mobile Web pages has become an important factor that content providers and service providers want to improve. One metric for evaluating user experience is the mobile Web performance, specifically the page load time (PLT). While improving mobile Web performance has drawn increasing attention [2], most optimizations tend to overlook an important metric, energy. PLT and energy are distinct metrics; we observe in our experiments that these metrics may not always be correlated. Given the importance of battery life for mobile users, we argue that Web page optimizations should also be evaluated for their impact on energy consumption. However, examining the energy effects of a Web optimization is challenging, even if one has access to power monitors, for several reasons. First, Web page loads experience high variance due to network conditions and device scheduling. Our own experiments show that the energy consumption of a Web page can vary by about 30% under the same experimental setup. Second, Web pages can be highly complex since they are composed of distinct components, which are individual page load activities such as loading objects, parsing the page, or evaluating Javascript. There are also many levels of dependencies among those components during the page load process. Without detailed application-level semantics, it is hard to tease out the energy contribution of each component. Third, the page load process is short-lived, ranging from several milliseconds to a few seconds. Although different power models [3, 5] for mobile devices have been proposed, they do not work well for such short-lived applications. This is because such models require fine-grained resource monitoring, which incurs substantial overhead and impacts model accuracy.
