Live range splitting techniques improve global register allocation by splitting the live ranges of variables into segments that are individually allocated registers. Load/store range analysis is a new technique for live range splitting that is based on reaching definition and live variable analyses. Our analysis localizes the profits and the register requirements of every access to every variable to provide a fine granularity of candidates for register allocation. Experiments on a suite of C and FORTRAN benchmark programs show that a graph coloring register allocator operating on load/store ranges often provides better allocations than the same allocator operating on live ranges. Experimental results also show that the computational cost of using load/store ranges for register allocation is moderately more than the cost of using live ranges.
