Controlling spam remains a significant challenge. One primary cause of the spam problem is the way in which email addresses are typically used. To provide a fixed address at which they can be reached, most users treat their email IDs as permanent and only abandon them in rare circumstances. As a result, once a user's email address leaks to spammers, it is nearly impossible to entirely prevent them from sending messages to the user's inbox. Users usually has no recourse if they wish to retract the release of an email address to a certain party.
