A long-standing difficulty in the development of introductory courses in computer graphics is balancing the educational necessity of ensuring mastery of fundamental graphical concepts with the highly desirable goal of exciting and inspiring students to further study by enabling them to produce visually interesting programming projects. Recently, we have developed a modified curriculum predicated on the extensive integration of the OpenGL Shading Language with a more traditional pedagogical approach. We utilized this curriculum in the quarter-long, upper-division introductory graphics course taught in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Our experience indicates that making shading an integral part of the entry-level curriculum inculcates students with a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and mathematical concepts that underlie modern graphical systems, while simultaneously equipping them with the tools necessary to produce complex projects with state-of-the-art technology.
