We propose "marionette system" as a master slave teleoperation. The operation/display device which presents form and posture equivalent to the remote robot is named "marionette device". In the system, it is possible, making exact discrimination, to control flexibly the remote robot by using marionette device. Marionette system is the operation/presentation technique which not only enables to operate flexibly all movable joints but to discriminate correctly by checking the marionette device. Since the condition of the marionette device is made almost equivalent to the remote robot, the operator can check and operate the device as treating a doll for judgments of operation. Thus, we named the control system "marionette system." In this paper, we develop the humanoid-robot (HR) type device as an example of the remote control of the humanoid robot. When a humanoid robot is set as an operation target, it becomes easy to transpose and image a robot pattern from human motion. HR type device used as operation/display equipment enables intuitive approach in operation. In order to verify the validity of the proposed system, we have carried out various experiments comparing two types of device. One is conventional the method employing graphic simulators and a joystick, the other is a proposed control/display device employing humanoid type device. The effectiveness of the proposed system is confirmed by the experimental results.
