Commonly used Proportional-Integral-Derivative based UAV flight controllers are often seen to provide adequate trajectory-tracking performance, but only after extensive tuning. The gains of these controllers are tuned to particular platforms, which makes transferring controllers from one UAV to other time-intensive. This paper formulates the problem of control-transfer from a source system to a transfer system and proposes a solution that leverages well-studied techniques in adaptive control. It is shown that concurrent learning adaptive controllers improve the trajectory tracking performance of a quadrotor with the baseline linear controller directly imported from another quadrotor whose inertial characteristics and throttle mapping are very different. Extensive flight-testing, using indoor quadrotor platforms operated in MIT's RAVEN environment, is used to validate the method.
