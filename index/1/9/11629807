We investigate the use of the L∞ cost function in geometric vision problems. This cost function measures the maximum of a set of model-fitting errors, rather than the sumof-squares, or L2 cost function that is commonly used (in least-squares fitting). We investigate its use in two problems; multiview triangulation and motion recovery from omnidirectionalcameras, though the results may also apply to other related problems. It is shown that for these problems the L∞ cost function is significantly simpler than the L2 cost. In particular L∞ minimization involvesfinding the minimum of a cost function with a single local (and hence global)minimumon a convexparameter domain. Theproblem may be recast as a constrained minimization problem and solved using commonly available software. The optimal solution was reliably achieved on problems of small dimension.
