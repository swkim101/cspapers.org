This demo paper will discuss a search interface framework designed as part of the Semantic eScience Framework project at the Tetherless World Constellation. The search interface framework, S2S, was designed to facilitate the construction of interactive user interfaces for data catalogs. We use Semantic Web technologies, including an OWL ontology for describing the semantics of data services, as well as the semantics of user interface components. We have applied S2S in three different scenarios: (1) the development of a faceted browse interface integrated with an interactive mapping and visualization tool for biological and chemical oceanographic data, (2) the development of a faceted browser for more than 700,000 open government datasets in over 100 catalogs worldwide, and (3) the development of a user interface for a virtual observatory in the field of solar-terrestrial physics. Throughout this paper, we discuss the architecture of the S2S framework, focusing on its extensibility and reusability, and also review the application scenarios.
