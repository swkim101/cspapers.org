Text categorization is a crucial and well-proven method for organizing the collection of large scale documents. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-class text categorization method with global margin maximization. We not only maximize the margins among leaf categories, but also maximize the margins among their ancestors. Experiments show that the performance of our algorithm is competitive with the recently proposed hierarchical multi-class classification algorithms.
