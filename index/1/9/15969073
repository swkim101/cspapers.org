A biologically motivated model of cortical self-organization is proposed. Context is combined with bottom-up information via a maximum likelihood cost function. Clusters of one or more units are modulated by a common contextual gating Signal; they thereby organize themselves into mutually supportive predictors of abstract contextual features. The model was tested in its ability to discover viewpoint-invariant classes on a set of real image sequences of centered, gradually rotating faces. It performed considerably better than supervised back-propagation at generalizing to novel views from a small number of training examples.
