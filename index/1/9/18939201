In order to define meaningful limit values for human-robot collisions, we have come to the conclusion that only comprehensive collision tests with live test subjects will successfully lead to verified limit values. A literature survey about current approaches for limiting the consequences of hazardous contacts between humans and moving machines (including robots) showed that limit values are often specified without an appropriate injury severity or without considering the variety of the human body. In this article, we show why the injury onset is appropriate to limit the consequences of human-robot collisions, and how this onset can be quantified through collision tests with live test subjects. With our work we would like to present a promising method that can remedy the current lack of consensus regarding an appropriate injury severity and verified limit values.
