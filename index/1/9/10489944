Concept hierarchies greatly help in the organization and reuse of information and are widely used in a variety of information systems applications. In this paper, we describe a method for efficiently storing and querying data organized into concept hierarchies and dispersed over a DHT. In our method, peers individually decide on the level of indexing according to the granularity of the incoming queries. Roll-up and drill-down operations are performed on a per-node basis in order to minimize the required bandwidth for answering queries on variable aggregation levels. We motivate our approach by applying it on a large-scale Grid system: Specifically, we plan to apply our fully decentralized scheme that creates, queries and updates large volumes of hierarchical data on-line and replace the traditional centralized and strictly indexed information systems. Our extensive experimental results support this argument on many diverse configurations: Our system proves very efficient in skewed workloads, both over single and multiple hierarchy levels at the same time. It adapts to sudden changes in popularity and effectively stores and updates large amounts of data at very low cost.
