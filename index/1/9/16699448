Improvements in tracking performances are significant using generalized predictive control laws as machine tool feed drives control. Nevertheless, testing user-built control modules within a real CNC machine tool designed under a closed architecture is not straightforward. The creation of a virtual machining centre appears therefore as a solution to this problem. The paper presents developments of a three-axis machine tool simulator. It includes visualization facilities and allows relevant comparisons between different control strategies, proving to be a useful CACSD (computer aided control systems design) tool. Within this framework, the advantages of the predictive law can be easily underlined. Moreover, the advanced control structure fits the innovative demands of the open architecture
