Modern techniques for distributed information retrieval use a set of documents sampled from each server, but these samples have been underutilised in server selection. We describe a new server selection algorithm, SUSHI, which unlike earlier algorithms can make full use of the text of each sampled document and which does not need training data. SUSHI can directly optimise for many common cases, including high precision retrieval, and by including a simple stopping condition can do so while reducing network traffic. Our experiments compare SUSHI with alternatives and show it achieves the same effectiveness as the best current methods while being substantially more efficient, selecting as few as 20% as many servers.
