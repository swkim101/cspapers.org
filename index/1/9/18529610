The routing control of Benes networks has proven to be costly. This paper introduces a new approach to fast control of <italic>N</italic> × <italic>N</italic> 3-stage Benes networks of <italic>r</italic> × <italic>r</italic> crossbar switches as building blocks, where <italic>N</italic> = <italic>r</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt> and <italic>r</italic> ≥ 2. The new approach consists of setting the leftmost column of switches to an appropriately chosen configuration so that the network becomes self-routed while still able to realize a given family of permutations. This approach requires that, for any given family of permutations, a configuration for the leftmost column be found. Such a family is called compatible and the configuration of the leftmost column is called the compatibility factor. In this paper, compatibility is characterized and a technique to determine compatibility and the compatibility factor is developed. The technique is used to show the compatibility and find the compatibility factor of &OHgr;-realizable permutations, the permutations needed to emulate a hypercube, and the families of permutations required by FFT, bitonic sorting, tree computations, multidimensional mesh and torus computations, and multigrid computations. An O(log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> <italic>N</italic>) time routing algorithm for the 3-stage Benes will also be developed. Finally, as only 3 compatibility factors are required by the above families of permutations, it will be proposed to replace the first column by 3 multiplexed connections yielding a self-routing network with strong communication capabilities.
