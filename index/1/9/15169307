CSS is a widely used language for describing the presentation semantics of HTML elements on the web. The language has a number of characteristics, such as inheritance and cascading order, which makes maintaining CSS code a challenging task for web developers. As a result, it is common for unused rules to be accumulated over time. Despite these challenges, CSS analysis has not received much attention from the research community. We propose an automated technique to support styling code maintenance, which (1) analyzes the runtime relationship between the CSS rules and DOM elements of a given web application (2) detects unmatched and ineffective selectors, overridden declaration properties, and undefined class values. Our technique, implemented in an open source tool called Cilla, has a high precision and recall rate. The results of our case study, conducted on fifteen open source and industrial web-based systems, show an average of 60% unused CSS selectors in deployed applications, which points to the ubiquity of the problem.
