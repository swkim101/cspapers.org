We propose a new object decomposition method, called DMBRs, to improve the performance of spatial query processing. This method is suitable for complex spatial objects in real-world geographic applications. The basic idea is that a polygon is recursively divided into two subpolygons by splitting its MBR until a given constraint is satisfied. To increase the efficiency of the DMBRs method, an extension of an existing spatial indexing structure is presented. Since this new structure can prune a number of false hits quickly, the performance of spatial query processing can be improved. The proposed method is compared with traditional decomposition methods by an analytical study. This comparison shows that our decomposition method outperforms the traditional decomposition methods.
