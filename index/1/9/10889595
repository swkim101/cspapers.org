A unique architecture of winner search hardware has been developed using a novel neuron-like high functionality device called Neuron MOS transistor (or vMOS in short) [1,2] as a key circuit element. The circuits developed in this work can find the location of the maximum (or minimum) signal among a number of input data on the continuous-time basis, thus enabling real-time winner tracking as well as fully-parallel sorting of multiple input data. We have developed two circuit schemes. One is an ensemble of self-loop-selecting vMOS ring oscillators finding the winner as an oscillating node. The other is an ensemble of vMOS variable threshold inverters receiving a common ramp-voltage for competitive excitation where data sorting is conducted through consecutive winner search actions. Test circuits were fabricated by a double-polysilicon CMOS process and their operation has been experimentally verified.
