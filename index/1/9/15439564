Languages spoken by immigrants change due to contact with the local languages. Capturing these changes is problematic for current language technologies, which are typically developed for speakers of the standard dialect only. Even when dialectal variants are available for such technologies, we still need to predict which dialect is being used. In this study, we distinguish between the immigrant and the standard dialect of Turkish by focusing on Light Verb Constructions. We experiment with a number of grammatical and contextual features, achieving over 84% accuracy (56% baseline).
