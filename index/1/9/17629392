One key to success for high quality enterprise information systems development is to validate the customers' requirements sufficiently at the early stage. Scenarios are an effective means to an end because they make it possible to represent various situations of system usage. Most scenarios are defined by using a natural language or such a formal language as Unified Modeling Language (UML) and describe normal, alternative, and exceptional service flows from the point of view of system usage. As a result, scenarios make it easy for the customers to confirm their requirements intuitively because of the concreteness. On the other hand, based on the V-model, which is well-known software development process and denotes the correspondence of requirement analysis stage to integration test stage, it is desirable that the testers should test the system by using the test cases derived from the validated scenarios. We have proposed a UML-based requirements analysis (RA) model with automatic prototype system generation for enterprise Web application development. This paper proposes a way to efficiently create reliable test cases from the scenarios that have been validated by the customers using the prototype system which was generated by the RA model.
