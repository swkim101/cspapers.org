We study the following tiling problem in d dimensions: given a d-dimensional rectangular array of non-negative numbers and an integer p, partition the array into at most p rectangular subarrays so that the maximum weight of any subarray is minimized; the weight of a subarray is the sum of its elements. The rectangular tiling problem is motivated by applications in data mining, data partitioning, and video compression. Recently, Khanna, Muthukrishnan, and Paterson [SOD.4 â€˜981, showed that the tiling problem is NP-Complete and gave a 2.5-approximation algorithm for d = 2. In this paper, we extend their result to multidimensional arrays, and give an algorithm with approximation ratio ( z m), for d 2 2. The algorithm can be implemented to run in worst-case time O(N + plog N) time, where N is the size of the array, and the constant is of the order d!. We also obtain a similar algorithm for the dual tiling problem, where the goal is to compute a tiling of weight at most Mi using as few tiles as possible. Our algorithm yields an approximation factor (2d + 1). We implemented our algorithm and ran simulation tests on multidimensional arrays with random data. In our limited experiments, the algorithm always produced approximations close to two.
