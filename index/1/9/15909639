This paper presents the development of a new visual servoing control law using global information image. It consists in the use of the wavelet spatial coefficients as the visual signal to design visual controller. More precisely, we introduce the concept of multiple resolution interaction matrix that links the time-variation of wavelet coefficients to the robot spatial velocity and the associated task function controller. The proposed controller was successfully validated using a 6 degrees-of-freedom 3PPSR parallel kinematic manipulator in an eye-to-hand configuration. Experimental results show the accuracy, efficiency and show good behavior of such features.
