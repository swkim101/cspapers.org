An algorithm for efficiently managing the transfer of pages of information between main and secondary memory is developed and analyzed. The algorithm applies to time-shared computer systems that use rotating magnetic drums as secondary storage devices. The algorithm is designed to provide efficient system performance when referenced pages are predominantly pre-loaded. However, the algorithm also provides optimum results for systems where all pages are loaded on demand. The nature of the improved performance which can be derived from page pre-loading strategy is discussed. Simulation results are presented which plot system performance as a function of main memory size.
