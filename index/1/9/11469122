In this paper we investigate how to automatically determine if two document collections are written from different perspectives. By perspectives we mean a point of view, for example, from the perspective of Democrats or Republicans. We propose a test of different perspectives based on distribution divergence between the statistical models of two collections. Experimental results show that the test can successfully distinguish document collections of different perspectives from other types of collections.
