This paper describes a proprietary data transmission protocol developed for internodal trunks on the Northern Telecom SL-10#8482; Packet Switched Data Network. The protocol has been implemented and tested in the new Universal Trunk Processor. Two separate market forces dictated the protocol requirements. The first was a demand for high speed trunks in the T1 (1.54 Mb/s) and above range to cost effectively serve future networks. The second market force was the emergence of satellite data technology with its attendant high bandwidth and lower cost. A protocol with a large sequence number range and the ability to selectively retransmit more than one packet in error without impacting the flow of correctly received packets was required. None of the standard data protocols met these requirements.
