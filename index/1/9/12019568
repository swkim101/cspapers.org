In this paper, we propose a modal logic for reasoning about possibilistic belief fusion. This is a combination of multiagent epistemic logic and possibilistic logic. We use graded epistemic operators to represent agentsâ€™ uncertain beliefs, and the operators are interpreted in accordance with possibilistic semantics. We employ ordered fusion based on a level skipping strategy to resolve the inconsistency caused by direct fusion; that is, the level at which the inconsistency occurs is skipped. Here, we present the formal semantics and an axiomatic system for the logic.
