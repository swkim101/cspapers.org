Identifying crosscutting concerns is an important issue in the maintenance of software systems. It aims at refactoring the existing systems to use aspect oriented programming, in order to make them easier to maintain and to evolve. In this paper we present a new partitional clustering algorithm for identifying crosscutting concerns in existing software systems. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm using the open source case study JHotDraw, providing a comparison of the proposed approach with similar existing approaches.
