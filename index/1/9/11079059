Popular web templating languages embed general-purpose programming languages. The Extensible Templating Language was born out of questioning the fundamental assumption that the front-end markup-generating engine of a multi-tier web application requires all the power and expressiveness implied by that design. ETL restricts the set of language features to a useful subset that provide the necessary functionality without compromising the simplicity and understandability of templates. By forcibly limiting what can be done by templates, we ensure a better separation of presentation details from business logic. Furthermore, ETL improves the analyzability of source templates by using an XML-based representation where markup is intermingled with XML elements corresponding to programming constructs. This approach reduces the possibility of generating improper markup and facilitates tool-building including semantically-aware editors and debuggers. ETL runs inside of the Extensible Templating Language Server which is currently employed by InfoSpace to serve millions of requests per day using over sixty thousand ETL templates.
