This paper presents a stable control method for a hybrid haptic device comprising a brake and a motor. A review of stability condition via describing function analysis is first presented. The results show that while brakes are intrinsically stable, an active device is limited in terms of stiffness. The stability is however improved if the brake simulates a physical damping. Subsequently, the stability condition is obtained via passivity condition analysis. The results demonstrate that the stiffness is improved by engaging both actuators to create resistive forces and the passivity is respected assuming a passive virtual environment. An energy and a stiffness-bounding algorithms have been developed in order to assure the stability of the coupled system in this case. It has been tested and validated using a 1-DOF hybrid haptic device by the simulation of an unstable and an active virtual environments respectively . Experimental results show that the displayable stiffness is improved under stability conditions using the control method. Furthermore, it allows the hybrid system to simulate nonlinear and unstable virtual environments and the controller remains independent of the virtual environment model.
