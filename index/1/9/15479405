An experiment in collaborative learning was conducted in two introductory programming courses at Loyola College in Maryland. Data collected included background information on students; course evaluations; and before and after measures on programming knowledge and attitudes. The collaborative learning class showed more improvement pre-test to post-test than did the control class and rated the course somewhat higher. Attitudes of both groups towards the field of computing and towards the value of group discussion in class were more resistant to change.
