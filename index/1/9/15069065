This paper presents distributed algorithms for formation control of multiple robots in three dimensions. In particular, we leverage the mathematical properties of cyclic pursuit along with results from contraction and partial contraction theory to design distributed control algorithms ensuring global convergence to symmetric formations. As a base case we consider regular polygons as desired formations and then provide extensions to Johnson solid formations. Finally, we analyze the robustness of the control algorithms under bounded additive disturbances and provide performance bounds with respect to the formation error.
