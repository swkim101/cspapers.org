Bridging disparate realms of physical and cyber system components requires models and methods that enable rapid evaluation of design alternatives in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The diverse intellectual traditions of physical and mathematical sciences makes this task exceptionally hard. This paper seeks to explore potential solutions by examining specific examples of CPS applications in automobiles and smart buildings. Both smart buildings and automobiles are complex systems with embedded knowledge across several domains. We present our experiences with development of CPS applications to illustrate the challenges that arise when expertise across domains is integrated into the system, and show that creation of models, abstractions, and architectures that address these challenges are key to next generation CPS applications.
