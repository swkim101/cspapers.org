1. EXTENDED ABSTRACT There are potentially valuable nuggets of information hidden in large document collections. Discovering them is important for inferring new knowledge and detecting new trends. Data mining technology is giving us the ability to extract meaningful patterns from large quantities of structured data. Collections of text, however, are not as amenable to data mining. In this demonstration, we describe CDPRanking, a novel text mining system designed to detect interesting links and hidden information from large text corpora and expose previously unknown logic connections that connect facts, propositions or hypotheses.
