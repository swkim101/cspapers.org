Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMOMMT) denotes a class of problems in which a set of autonomous mobile robots equipped with limited-range sensors are used to keep under observation a (possibly larger) set of mobile targets. Robots cooperatively plan their motion in order to maximize the time during which each target lies within the sensing range of at least one robot.
