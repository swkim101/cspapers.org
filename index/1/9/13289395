Adding mobile devices to virtual environment and using them as interactive tool can enhance mobility and the sense of immersion.

The system let users directly interact with virtual environment through the manipulation of the objects displayed on the PDAs, which makes interaction more intuitive. In this paper, we introduce the main modules of the system, including the data transmission service module and display/interaction module.
