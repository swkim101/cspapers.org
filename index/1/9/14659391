Efficient data acquisition in WSNs has attracted significant interest. For example, TinyDB [2] introduced query dissemination and data aggregation trees. Later, a probabilistic model of the physical world is used in [1]. Recently, [3] argues that probabilistic models of the physical world used in acquisition may miss outliers and introduces spatio-temporal suppression-based methods. We classify these established approaches as query-and-data centric approaches for optimizing the data acquisition process.
