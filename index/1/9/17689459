This article introduces a new parallel language for modern MIMD parallel computers: ParCeL-3. Its computing model is based on cells, sort of ultra-light processes, and on the definition of multiple clocks to manage the cells. It allows to use several parallel programming paradigms to implement the cell communications, as message passing and memory sharing, depending of the algorithm need. This new computing model leads to a natural parallelization of Artificial Intelligence applications, in order to decrease both execution times and parallel development time overheads.
