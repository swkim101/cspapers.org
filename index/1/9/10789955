Consider a massive crowd who gathered together to convey their common voice to public, e.g., supporters of a team sitting together in a stadium, people doing a candlelight vigil in a public square, and so on. Imagine that they hold up their smartphone displays which collectively compose a huge public screen; the crowd's messages are now shown big on the top of them. We present CaaS [3], a mobile service to realize such an instant, massive, collective visualization with commodity smartphones and cloud services. In this demo, we demonstrate the collective localization feature of CaaS so that the audience can watch a given pattern or symbol collectively displayed on top of arbitrarily positioned phones (See the video demo, https://goo.gl/GfsORc).
