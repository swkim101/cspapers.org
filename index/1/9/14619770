One of the most pressing problems in computer science education at the undergraduate level today is providing effective laboratory facil i t ies to allow the theories of the classroom to be experienced through exercise. The problem wi l l reach crisis proportions as the demand for computer professionals continues and the education budgets fail to keep pace! We propose the personal :student workstation as a means of addressing this problem. We present a requirements model (functions students need to perform) as a layered set of capabilities to be provided on a personal student workstation. We group student tasks into levels of workstation function and therefore, levels of laboratory achievement. We report on current efforts to prototype such a workstation at Bentley Col lege.
