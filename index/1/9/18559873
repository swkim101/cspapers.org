Subspace clustering mines clusters hidden in subspaces of high-dimensional data sets. Density-based approaches have been shown to successfully mine clusters of arbitrary shape even in the presence of noise in full space clustering. Exhaustive search of all density-based subspace clusters, however, results in infeasible runtimes for large high-dimensional data sets. This is due to the exponential number of possible subspace projections in addition to the high computational cost of density-based clustering.
 In this paper, we propose lossless efficient detection of density-based subspace clusters. In our EDSC (efficient density-based subspace clustering) algorithm we reduce the high computational cost of density-based subspace clustering by a complete multistep filter-and-refine algorithm. Our first hypercube filter step avoids exhaustive search of all regions in all subspaces by enclosing potentially density-based clusters in hypercubes. Our second filter step provides additional pruning based on a density monotonicity property. In the final refinement step, the exact unbiased density-based subspace clustering result is detected. As we prove that pruning is lossless in both filter steps, we guarantee completeness of the result.
 In thorough experiments on synthetic and real world data sets, we demonstrate substantial efficiency gains. Our lossless EDSC approach outperforms existing density-based subspace clustering algorithms by orders of magnitude.
