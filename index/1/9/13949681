In many discrimination problems a large amount of data is available but only a few of them are labeled. This provides a strong motivation to improve or develop methods for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, boosting is generalized to this task within the optimization framework of MarginBoost. We extend the margin definition to unlabeled data and develop the gradient descent algorithm that corresponds to the resulting margin cost function. This meta-learning scheme can be applied to any base classifier able to benefit from unlabeled data. We propose here to apply it to mixture models trained with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Promising results are presented on benchmarks with different rates of labeled data.
