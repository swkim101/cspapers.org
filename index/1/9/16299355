Inside a Toulousian project on “Fault tolerant computing system”, we are interested by error confinement (hardware and software errors) and by error recovery at the operating system level.
 This paper discusses the principles of domains and the architecture of a capability machine (§ II). We detail management of scheduling and object sharing between processes, by monitors (§ III).Then we present error recovery mechanisms (reconfiguration, rollback) in a capability machine (§ IV).
