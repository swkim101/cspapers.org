This paper presents recent automatic control developments of the airship robot Karma of LAAS-CNRS. More precisely, it focuses on the lateral control strategy which is based on the decoupled dynamics. Using an external control loop to stabilize the longitudinal dynamics, a path following controller is proposed for driving the robot within the horizontal plane. The proposed strategy allows to consider the lateral slippage inherent in the blimp's dynamics.
