Process variation affects processor pipelines by making some stages slower and others faster, therefore exacerbating pipeline unbalance. This reduces the frequency attainable by the pipeline. To improve performance, this paper proposes ReCycle, an architectural framework that comprehensively applies cycle time stealing to the pipeline - transferring the time slack of the faster stages to the slow ones by skewing clock arrival times to latching elements after fabrication. As a result, the pipeline can be clocked with a period equal to the average stage delay rather than the longest one. In addition, ReCycle's frequency gains are enhanced with Donor stages, which are empty stages added to "donate" slack to the slow stages. Finally, ReCycle can also convert slack into power reductions.
 For a 17FO4 pipeline, ReCycle increases the frequency by 12% and the application performance by 9% on average. Combining ReCycle and donor stages delivers improvements of 36% in frequency and 15% in performance onaverage, completely reclaiming the performance losses due to variation.
