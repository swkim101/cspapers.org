This paper deals with problems related to the capture of a tumbling satellite by a space robot. The minimization of the base attitude deviation after the contact with the target is discussed from the viewpoint of angular momentum distribution. A new capturing strategy utilizing bias momentum is introduced. By using the null space of the coupling inertia matrix we present a method for angular momentum redistribution while following a desired trajectory.
