In this paper, we study the QR factorization of a square matrix of order n, through Givens rotations. The task allocation method developed among others by QUINTON, SAKHO and TCHUENTE, is used to parallelize the QR factorization scheme introduced by SAMEH and KUCK. This yields a solution which runs in optimal time T<supscrpt>*</supscrpt> = 3n-1, on an hexagonally connected array of size 5n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>/18 + 0(n), composed of programmable cells. This improves the best previously known solution introduced by COSNARD and ROBERT, and which runs in optimal time on an array of size 3n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>/8 + 0(n).
