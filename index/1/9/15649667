Neural network language models, or continuous-space language models (CSLMs), have been shown to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) when they are used for reranking n-best translations. However, CSLMs have not been used in the first pass decoding of SMT, because using CSLMs in decoding takes a lot of time. In contrast, we propose a method for converting CSLMs into back-off n-gram language models (BNLMs) so that we can use converted CSLMs in decoding. We show that they outperform the original BNLMs and are comparable with the traditional use of CSLMs in reranking.
