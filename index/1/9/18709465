In this paper we consider the unsupervised word discovery from phonetic input. We employ a word segmentation algorithm which simultaneously develops a lexicon, i.e., the transcription of a word in terms of a phone sequence, learns a n-gram language model describing word and word sequence probabilities, and carries out the segmentation itself. The underlying statistical model is that of a Pitman-Yor process, a concept known from Bayesian non-parametrics, which allows for an a priori unknown and unlimited number of different words. Using a hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes, language models of different order can be employed and nesting it with another hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes on the phone level allows for backing off unknown word unigrams by phone m-grams. We present results on a large-vocabulary task, assuming an error-free phone sequence is given. We finish by discussing options how to cope with noisy phone sequences.
