This paper describes using HyperTalkm to introduce the concepts studied in CS 1. Using a visual, object-oriented, yet easily accessible language enthuses the students and encourages them to use good programming practices later in the course. This paper briefly introduces HyperTalk and then describes how we introduce it in CS 1, some of the HyperTalk projects we use, how we move into Pascal from HyperTalk, and some preliminary observations on how this approach affects the students.
