Many recently emerging applications, such as network management, financial monitoring, sensor networks, stock tickers etc, fueled the development of continuous query processing techniques over data streams. In these applications, the data sources are typically distributed, e.g. the network hosts or routers in network management. Collecting all the data to a centralized server may not be cost-effective due to the high communication cost. Clearly, a distributed stream processing system is inevitable. Unlike traditional DBMS, where the processing in each node involves expensive I/O operations, stream processing systems often perform main memory operations. These operations are relatively inexpensive in comparison to the communication cost. As both the queries and data streams are continuous, a few existing work focus on minimize the communication cost, especially when the source nodes are connected by wide area network. In this paper, we focus on multi-way window join query. Let us look at an example drawn from the network management application.
