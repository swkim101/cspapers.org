Emails are examples of structured documents with various fields. These fields can be exploited to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of an Information Retrieval (IR) system that mailing list archives. In recent experiments of the TREC2005 Enterprise track, various fields were applied to varying degrees of success by the participants. In his work, using a field-based weighting model, we investigate the retrieval performance attainable by each field, and examine when fields evidence should be combined or not.
