Most current approaches to the design of the human-computer interface result in systems that are difficult for users to master. This can be attributed to the absence of several key features, including: interface modularity; adaptability to the individual user; direct support of user intentions; and an intelligent advising capability. An architecture for the interface which facilitates the attainment of these four criteria is proposed. The architecture relies upon production system rules and various kinds of knowledge bases to tailor the user-computer dialogue to the ongoing context of the interaction. A prototype of this architecture has been implemented in LOOPS for interfacing to the UNIX system, and has been shown to enhance substantially the performance of novice users of the system.
