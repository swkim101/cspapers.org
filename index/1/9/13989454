This video elaborates on a new active and controllable over-tube addition to the highly articulated robotic probe; the HARP. This over-tube allows the current HARP mechanism to double its overall length and allows it to perform more complex tasks. We explain the design concept of the current HARP and the novel over-tube mechanism and show two proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating the use of the active over-tube.
