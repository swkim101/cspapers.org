Formulations for the automatic synthesis of two- dimensional bistable, compliant periodic structures are presented, based on standard methods for topology optimization. The design space is parameterized using non- linear beam elements and a ground structure approach. A performance criterion is suggested, based on characteristics of the load-deformation curve of the compliant structure. A genetic algorithm is used to find candidate solutions. A numerical implementation of this methodology is discussed and illustrated using a simple example.
