This paper describes experiences with a course designed to introduce undergraduate students to the design and implementation of real-time systems for the monitoring and control of laboratory and industrial processes. A model railroad is suggested as an inexpensive process to control. A variety of laboratory exercises involving such a model railroad are presented.
