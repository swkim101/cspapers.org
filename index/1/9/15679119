Automatic analysis of sentiments expressed in large scale online reviews is very important for intelligent business applications. Sentiment classification is the most popular task of sentiment analysis, which is more challenging than traditional topic-based text classification. Basic features, such as vocabulary words, are not enough to classify sentiments well. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is introduced to discover more abstract features of sentiments. To capture full information of the features, large-size network can be constructed, but at the same time, large-size network tends to over fit the training data and even noise, which will reduce the generalization ability of the network. In this paper, L2-norm Deep Belief Network (L2DBN) is proposed, which uses L2-norm regularization to optimize the network parameters of DBN. L2DBN is first initialized by an unsupervised layer-wise training algorithm, and then fine-tuned by a supervised procedure. Network parameters are optimized using both classification loss and network complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed L2DBN outperforms the state-of-the-art method and the basic DBN on golden, noisy and heterogeneous datasets.
