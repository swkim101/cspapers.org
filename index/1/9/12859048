Researchers have been working on human face recognition for decades. Face recognition is hard due to different types of variations in face images, such as pose, illumination and expression, among which pose variation is the hardest one to deal with. To improve face recognition under pose variation, this paper presents a geometry assisted probabilistic approach. We approximate a human head with a 3D ellipsoid model, so that any face image is a 2D projection of such a 3D ellipsoid at a certain pose. In this approach, both training and test images are back projected to the surface of the 3D ellipsoid, according to their estimated poses, to form the texture maps. Thus the recognition can be conducted by comparing the texture maps instead of the original images, as done in traditional face recognition. In addition, we represent the texture map as an array of local patches, which enables us to train a probabilistic model for comparing corresponding patches. By conducting experiments on the CMU PIE database, we show that the proposed algorithm provides better performance than the existing algorithms.
