This paper presents a system capable of automatically acquiring subcategorization frames (SCFs) for French verbs from the analysis of large corpora. We applied the system to a large newspaper corpus (consisting of 10 years of the French newspaper 'Le Monde') and acquired subcategorization information for 3267 verbs. The system learned 286 SCF types for these verbs. From the analysis of 25 representative verbs, we obtained 0.82 precision, 0.59 recall and 0.69 F-measure. These results are comparable with those reported in recent related work.
