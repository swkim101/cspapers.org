This paper presents the idea of "behavioral templates" in scheduling. A behavioral template locks several operations into a relative schedule with respect to one another. This simple construct proves powerful in addressing: (1) timing constraints, (2) sequential operation modeling, (3) pre-chaining of certain operations, and (4) hierarchical scheduling. We present design examples from industry to demonstrate the importance of these issues in scheduling.
