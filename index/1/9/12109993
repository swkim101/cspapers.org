Motivated by Ajtai’s worst-case to average-case reduction for lattice problems, we study the complexity of computing short linearly independent vectors (short basis) in a lattice. We show that approximating the length of a shortest set of linearly independent vectors (shortest basis) within any constant factor is NP-hard. Under the assumption that problems in NP cannot be solved in DTIME(n p”‘y’og(n)) we show that no polynomial time algorithm can approximate the length of a shortest set of linearly independent vectors (shortest basis) within a factor of 2’“g’-‘(“), E > 0 arbitrary, but fixed. Finally, we obtain results on the limits of non-approximability for computing short linearly independent vectors (short basis). Our strongest result in this direction states that under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions, approximating the length of a shortest set of linearly independent vectors (shortest basis) within a factor of n/a is not NP-hard.
