Continued technology scaling with more pervasive use of multi-patterning has led to complex design rules and increased difficulty of maintaining high layout densities. Intuitively, emerging constraints such as unidirectional patterning or increased via spacing will decrease achievable density of the final place-and-route solution, worsening die area and product cost. However, no methodology exists for accurate assessment of design rules' impact on physical chip implementation. At the same time, this is a crucial need for early development of BEOL process technologies, particularly with FinFET or future vertical-device architectures where cell footprints can become much smaller than in bulk planar CMOS technologies. In this work, we study impacts of patterning technology choices and associated design rules on physical implementation density, with respect to cost-optimal design rule-correct detailed routing. A key contribution is an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based optimal router (OptRouter) which considers complex design rules that arise in sub-20nm process technologies. Using OptRouter, we assess wirelength and via count impacts of various design rules (implicitly, patterning technology choices) by analyzing optimal routing solutions of clips (i.e., switchbox instances) extracted from post-detailed route layouts in an advanced technology.
