This short paper presents some motivations behind the organization of the ACL/EACL01 "Workshop on Sharing Tools and Resources for Research and Education", concentrating on the possible connection of Tools and Resources repositories. Taking some papers printed in this volume and the ACL Natural Language Software Registry as a basis, we outline some of the steps to be done on the side of NLP tool repositories in order to achieve this goal.
