MedSpeakiRadiology is a product that allows radiologists to create, edit and manage reports using real-time, continuous speech recognition. Speech is used both to navigate through the application, and to dictate reports. The system is multi-modal, accepting input by either voice, mouse or keyboard. This paper reports on how we addressed the critical user need of high throughput in our interface design, and ways of supporting both error prevention and error correction with continuous speech. User studies suggest that for this task there was low tolerance for accuracy less than 100?40,but the additional time required for corrections was considered by many radiologists to be acceptable in view of the overall reduction in report turn around time.
