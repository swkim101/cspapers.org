Though programming is essentially a creative process, it has been realized by various researchers and practitioners (see for example, [CHEA79, DOD80, FLOY72, ROMA77, ROSS77, TEIC77]) that many aspects of program development can be automated to aid in developing programs that are reliable and maintainable. Such semi-automatic tools may be generally termed as program ~evelopment ~ystem(s) (or pals) and are expected to bridge the gap between ‘manual’ programming, where the programmer applies a methodology to develop a program in the absence of computer aids, and completely automated programming, which is an area of active research in Artificial Intelligence. It is also now generally accepted that the programmer should be provided with a variety of programming tools, both general purpose and application oriented, within a ~rogramming ~nvironment (or pe) [DOD80] which should provide flexible access to these tools . We view the pd. as a set of tools to be provided within such a pe and we shall, henceforth, refer to such a set of tools as pals/ pe or just pals.
