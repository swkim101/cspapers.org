High mobility and large payload capability are important abilities for wall climbing robots. The authors have proposed a new robot system anchor climber that could achieve both of these abilities. This robot system is composed of two or more child units and a parent unit. As child units of anchor climber, the authors have developed three types of special wall climbing robots, adhering mobile units (AM units) type A, B and C. In this paper, developments of other components of anchor climber, configuration of anchor climber with these components, basic systematic experiments with configured anchor climber, and new type of AM unit are described. From results of the experiments, it was confirmed that anchor climber had both high mobility and large payload capability.
