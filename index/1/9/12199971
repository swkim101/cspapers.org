Distributed cryptographic ledgers, such as the blockchain, are now being used in recordkeeping. However, they lack a key feature of more traditional recordkeeping systems needed to establish the authenticity of records and enable reliance on them for trustworthy recordkeeping. The missing feature is known in archival science as the archival bond -- the mutual relationship that exists among documents by virtue of the actions in which they participate. In this paper, we propose a novel data model and syntax using core web principles that can be used to address this shortcoming in distributed ledgers as recordkeeping systems.
