Let <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> be the class of all planar graphs with <i>n</i> labeled vertices, and let <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> be a graph drawn uniformly at random from <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>. In this paper we study the degree sequence of <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>. We show that with probability 1 -- <i>o</i>(1) the number of vertices of degree <i>k</i> in <i>P</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> is very close to a quantity <i>μ</i><sub><i>k</i></sub><i>n</i> that we determine explicitly, for all <i>k</i> ≤ <i>c</i> log <i>n</i> and an appropriate <i>c</i> > 0. A similar statement is true for random biconnected planar graphs as well.
 The main tool in our analysis is a framework that allows us under certain conditions to derive universal results about the degree distribution of random graphs from general classes with structural constraints. In particular, we address so-called critical graph classes, which due to their intricate structure have posed significant technical difficulties in the past.
