Course Web sites are fast becoming standard features of college courses. Some students expect all their courses to have such sites, just like they expect them to have syllabi. Course Web sites help professors communicate with students and students communicate with each other. They might summarize lectures, present assignments, serve as repositories of examples developed by students as well as the professor, and provide links to additional related information on the Web.This panel will discuss various aspects of course Web sites, focusing on their development, maintenance, and use. We will share experiences by presenting examples, highlighting successes and failures, and describing our hopes and concerns for the future. The panel will welcome comments from those in the audience with similar and even contradictory experiences. Our intention is to broaden participants' thinking on the implementation and use of course Web sites and spawn insights that might lead to more effective use of this important course component.
