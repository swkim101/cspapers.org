All mobile robots suffer from odometry error. Relative localization from odometry has both the systematic and the non-systematic errors. However, once a precise system error model and its parameters are given, the accuracy of odometry can be remarkably improved. Most previous works on this effort focused on the differential drive robots with little attention to the other types of mobile bases. In this paper, we analyze sources of odometry error and propose an error model for the synchro drive robot. We then describe a novel procedure to accurately estimate the error parameters of the derived error model and the covariance matrix of the synchro drive robot. However, this procedure is general for all mobile bases, so we also apply our method for the differential drive robots and show experiments. This new process uses the shape of the path, as opposed to just end points, to estimate the error parameters and covariance matrix. We happen to use the generalized Voronoi graph to generate this path. Experimental results validate the error model of the synchro drive robot and precise estimation ability of the proposed method for the synchro and the differential drive robots.
