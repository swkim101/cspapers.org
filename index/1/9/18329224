This paper describes the design and partial implementation of a real-time sound generation system currently being built at Carnegie-Mellon University. The overall design process is followed, and design decisions are discussed in the light of design goals and overall system constraints. The resulting system consists of a keyboard which is light controlled and an array of microprocessors functioning in a pipeline fashion.
