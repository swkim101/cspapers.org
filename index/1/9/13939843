Knowledge representation schemes are either based on a set of primitives or not. The decision of whether or not to have a primitive-based scheme is crucial since it affects the knowledge that is stored and how that knowledge may be processed. We suggest that a knowledge representation scheme may not initially have primitives, but may evolve into a primitive-based scheme by inferring a set of primitive meaning units based on previous experience. We describe a program that infers its own primitive set and discuss how the inferred primitives may affect the organization of existing information and the subsequent incorporation of new information.
