Surgical robots have undergone considerable improvement in recent years, but the intuitive operability, representing user inter-operability, has not been quantitatively evaluated. Thus, we propose a method for measuring brain activity to determine intuitive operability in order to design a robot with intuitive operability. The objective of this paper is to clarify the angle between the endoscope and the manipulator that facilitates users perceiving the manipulator as part of their body. In the experiments, while subjects controlled the hand controller to position the tip of the virtual slave manipulator on the target in the surgical simulator, we measured the brain activity through brain imaging devices. We carried out the experiment a number of times with the virtual slave manipulator configured in a variety of ways. The results show that activation of the brain is significant with the slave manipulator configured such that the angles are slanted with respect to the horizontal. We conclude that the body image affects hand-eye coordination, which is related to visual and somatic sense feedback.
