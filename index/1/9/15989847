An estimator of external generalized forces (force plus moments) acting on aerial platforms, and based on the momentum of the mechanical system, is proposed for the control of VToL UAVs together with a hierarchical architecture separating the translational and rotational dynamics of the vehicle. The closed-loop system equations are shaped as mechanical impedances, programmable through the controller gains, and forced by the residuals given by the estimation error. This arrangement allows the VToL UAVs to perform hovering and tracking tasks without a precise knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and in presence of external disturbances and unmodeled aerodynamic effects. Experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed control design.
