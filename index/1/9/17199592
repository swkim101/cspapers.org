In earlier work, we demonstrated the successful separation of the designs of crosscutting concerns into composition patterns [1]. In this paper, we demonstrate the mapping of crosscutting designs to two programming models that support similar approaches to separation within codeâ€”AspectJ [7] and Hyper/J [5]. We first illustrate the design of the Observer pattern using the composition pattern approach, and then map that design to the appropriate code.
