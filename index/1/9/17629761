We report on a longitudinal study of unconstrained handwriting recognition performance. After 250 minutes of practice, participants had a mean text entry rate of 24.1 wpm. For the first four hours of usage, entry and error rates of handwriting recognition are about the same as for a baseline QWERTY software keyboard. Our results reveal that unconstrained handwriting is faster than what was previously assumed in the text entry literature.
