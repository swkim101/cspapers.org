Significant research has been conducted in the field of Internet-based teleoperation. However, there is a lack of objective performance measures beyond completion time, which is dependent on several external factors to the system. This paper develops the concept of event-synchronization for supermedia enhanced Internet based teleoperation systems. Supermedia is the term used to refer to the different feedback streams; for example, video, haptic, temperature and others. This performance measure or system property is not affected by external factors; such as, the human operator and the communication characteristics. In addition, the design, which is based on Petri net theory, of systems satisfying this property is detailed. The experimental results obtained using a mobile manipulator bilateral teleoperation system, are given.
