Most existing recommender systems can be classified into two categories: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Hybrid recommender systems combine the advantages of the two for improved recommendation performance. Traditional recommender systems are rating-based. However, predicting ratings is an intermediate step towards their ultimate goal of generating rankings or recommendation lists. Learning to rank is an established means of predicting rankings and has recently demonstrated high promise in improving quality of recommendations. In this paper, we propose LRHR, the first attempt that adapts learning to rank to hybrid recommender systems. LRHR first defines novel representations for both users and items so that they can be content-comparable. Then, LRHR identifies a set of novel meta-level features for learning purposes. Finally, LRHR adopts RankSVM, a pairwise learning to rank algorithm, to generate recommendation lists of items for users. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the performance gain of our approach.
