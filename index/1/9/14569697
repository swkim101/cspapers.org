This paper investigates research specialisation of top ranked universities around the world. The revealed comparative advantage in different research fields are determined according to the number of research articles published. Subsequently, measures of research ubiquity and diversity, and research complexity index of each university, are obtained and discussed. The study is conducted on top-ranked universities according to Shanghai Jiao Tong Academic Ranking of World Universities, with bibliographical details extracted Microsoft Academic Graph data set and research fields of journals labelled with SCImago Journal Classification. Diversity-ubiquity distributions, relevance of RCI and university ranks, and geographical RCI distributions are examined in this paper.
