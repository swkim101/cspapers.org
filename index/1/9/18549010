Two semimetrics on probability distributions are 
proposed, based on a difference between features 
chosen from each, where these features can be in 
either the spatial or Fourier domains. The features are chosen so as to maximize the distinguishability of the distributions, by optimizing 
a lower bound of power for a statistical test using these features. The result is a parsimonious 
and interpretable indication of how and where 
two distributions differ, which can be used even 
in high dimensions, and when the difference is 
localized in the Fourier domain. A real-world 
benchmark image data demonstrates that the returned features provide a meaningful and informative indication as to how the distributions differ
