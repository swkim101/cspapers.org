We address two open problems involving algebraic execution of full-text search queries. First, we show how to correctly apply traditional database rewrite optimizations to full-text algebra plans with integrated scoring, and explain why existing techniques fail. Second, we show how our techniques are applied in a generic scoring framework that supports a wide class of scoring algorithms, including algorithms seen in the literature and user-defined scoring.
