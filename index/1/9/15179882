End-to-End programmability across radio, transport and compute resources is a key enabler for the fifth generation of mobile communication networks (5G). In our work we look into how SDN can realize the required cross-domain programmability, as well as slicing of resources towards multiple clients. We present design and implementation of a hierarchical, modular and programmable orchestration architecture across radio access networks and transport networks. We demonstrate how the developed multi-domain orchestration improves the service creation as well as resource utilization across the domains using real-time monitoring.
