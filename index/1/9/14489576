This work presents a system that makes use of the Microsoft Kinect to enable Point&Click interaction for the control of appliances in smart environments. A backend server determines through collision detection which device the user is pointing at and sends the respective control interface to the user's smartphone. Any commands the user issues are then sent back to the server which in turn controls the appliance. New devices can either be registered manually or using markers such as QR codes to identify them and get their position at the same time. The video demonstrates the interaction concept and our technical implementation.
