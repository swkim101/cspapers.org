The use of suitable examples is a key to teach abstract, theoretical concepts. Interactive computer software allows us to use such examples to create attractive learning environments that not only appeal to students, but also enhance knowledge transfer in class. However, developing such highly specialized systs is costly, resulting in only few of these tools being developed for higher education. This article introduces Info Traffic, a collection of new learning environments to support the introduction of fundamental concepts of computer science and mathatics in order to be of long-lived value. We describe the didactical concepts behind the interactive and concrete approach of Info Traffic, and illustrate th through two of its learning environments -- one targeted at propositional logic, the other at queueing theory.
