i By " micro-measurements " the sources for the lost cycles for vector operations are laid bare, resulting in a coarser " full mode~ and " mean model ". Characteristic parameters like effective mean cycle time, half performance length, wasting factor and architectural efficiency can be defined by the measured data. The weak points of the present supercomputers are relentlessly revealed. We discuss measurements for the IBM 3090/VF, Siemens/Fujitsu VP400-EX and CRAY Y-MP.
