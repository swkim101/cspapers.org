A microrobot consisting of a polymer binded aggregate of ferromagnetic particles is controlled using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) device in order to achieve targeted therapy. The primary contribution of this paper is the design of an adaptive backstepping controller coupled with a high gain observer based on a nonlinear model of a microrobot in a blood vessel. This work is motivated by the difficulty in accurately determining many biological parameters, which can result in parametric uncertainties to which model-based approaches are highly sensitive. We show that the most sensitive parameter, magnetization of the microrobot, can be measured using a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) force sensor, while the second one, the dielectric constant of blood, can be estimated on line. The efficacy of this approach is illustrated by simulation results.
