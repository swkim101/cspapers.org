This paper describes practical file access applications based on SAGA -- A <u>S</u>imple <u>A</u>PI for <u>G</u>rid <u>A</u>pplications-- for distributed storage resources over multi-file-system middleware. SAGA provides a high-level programming interface to bridge between network file-system middleware as well as accessing a local file-system. The Computing Research Center of KEK uses many data files from physics experiments. For example, large numbers of bubble chamber image files are shared between KEK and King's College in UK. Our research problem involves displaying a single bubble chamber image file that is divided and stored in the different kinds of file-systems. We use the two types of file-systems that are iRODS --The Integrated <u>R</u>ule-<u>O</u>riented <u>D</u>ata <u>S</u>ystem-- and Gfarm --<u>G</u>rid Data <u>F</u>arm--. To access the middleware, we are developing the SAGA adaptors for the iRODS and Gfarm file-systems. We present the technical details for the user environments and show the usability with real bubble chamber image files.
