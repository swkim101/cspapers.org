This paper explores the architecture of high-performance large scale multiprocessors using private caches for each processor. The caches reduce the average memory access time, but they also result in the well known cache coherence problem. Multiple copies of each memory location are allowed to exist but they must be kept consistent with each other. In this paper, we present a solution to the cache coherence problem specifically for shared bus multiprocessors that adapts dynamically to the reference pattern. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the high level of performance relative to other protocols particularly during intervals with high levels of sharing.
The paper then presents a coherence solution for large multiprocessor systems organized around a hierarchy of buses. One of the first solutions of this kind, the hierarchical protocol is an extension of the adaptive shared bus approach described in this paper.
