One view of expert system development separates the endeavor into two parts. First, a domain expert, with the aid of a knowledge engineer, articulates a procedure for performing the desired task in some external form. Next, the knowledge engineer operationalizes the external description within some computer language. This paper examines the nature of the processes that operationalize natural task descriptions. We exhibit a language based on a computational model of problem spaces for which these processes are quite simple. We describe the processes in detail, and discuss which aspects of our computational model determine the simplicity of these processes.
