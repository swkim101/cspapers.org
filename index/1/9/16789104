The world of machines is divided into a hierarchy of seven sub-worlds, ranging from algebra to causality. Separate representations and experts are constructed for each sub-world; these experts are then integrated into an expert system. The result is Mack, a system which produces qualitative models of simple machines from purely geometric representations.
