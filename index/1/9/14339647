The industrial use of ad hoc implementation methods for non-functional constrained tasks has sometimes resulted in unnecessary expensive projects. In some cases, ad hoc methods result in overly many iterations to be made and in some severe cases, total project breakdown. To be able to solve these problems a new method has been developed to derive end-to-end non-functional constraints, such as performance or resource utilization requirements, to task-level constraints and to promote this information to the implementation phase of the project. For a tool to be really useful it is important to be able to show the usability and potential cost reduction. To be able to show that a certain implementation method costs less in work hours than to use an ad hoc implementation method, a model for implementation simulation has been developed. As far as we know, no similar experiments has been done to compare implementation methods. I. I NTRODUCTION
