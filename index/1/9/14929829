Planar Catadioptric Stereo vision sensors (PCS) combine a pinhole camera with two or more planar mirrors. PCS have recently received an increasing attention since a stereo view can be easily obtained without the need of exact multi-camera synchronization and calibration. In this paper we present a rigorous analytical treatment of the imaging geometry of PCS, propose new mirror calibration algorithms and introduce new multi-view properties that can be used for eye-in-hand camera localization. The effectiveness of the algorithms is shown via extensive simulation and real-data experiments on a robotic manipulator.
