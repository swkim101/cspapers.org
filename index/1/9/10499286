Over the past decade, computing power has increased extraordinarily, enabling researchers to tackle large complex problems -- a great step forward in our ability to model the complex world. This increased capability resulted in massive amounts of data being produced and used by increasingly detailed simulations. It is the location, viewing, manipulation, storage, movement, sharing, and interpretation of this data -- now in hundreds of terabytes and growing -- that is causing major performance bottleneck. Data Intensive Computing has emerged as a topic to address the problem. The Advanced Virtual Engine Test Cell (AVETeC) Inc. and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) are under contract to establish, integrate and manage a test bed located at Department of Defense Major Shared Resource Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH, at AVETeC in Springfield, OH collaborating with Department of Energy, and NASA Goddard, Greenbelt, MD. This test bed environment will actively evaluate emerging technologies to improve data management.
