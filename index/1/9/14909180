In order for automated navigation systems to operate effectively, the route instructions they produce must be clear, concise and easily understood by users. In order to incorporate a landmark within a coherent sentence, it is necessary to first understand how that landmark is conceptualised by travellers --- whether it is perceived as point-like, line-like or area-like. This paper investigates the viability of automatically classifying the conceptualisation of landmarks relative to a given city context. We use web data to learn the default conceptualisation of those landmarks, crucially analysing preposition and verb collocations in the classification.
