Image matching is an essential task in many computer vision applications. It is obvious that thorough utilization of all available information is critical for the success of matching algorithms. However most popular matching methods do not incorporate effectively photometric data. Some algorithms are based on geometric, color invariant features, thus completely neglecting available photometric information. Others assume that color does not differ significantly in the two images; that assumption may be wrong when the images are not taken at the same time, for example when a recently taken image is compared with a database. This paper introduces a method for using color information in image matching tasks. Initially the images are segmented using an off-the-shelf segmentation process (EDISON). No assumptions are made on the quality of the segmentation. Then the algorithm employs a model for natural illumination change to define the probability of two segments to originate from the same surface. When additional information is supplied (for example suspected corresponding point features in both images), the probabilities are updated. We show that the probabilities can easily be utilized in any existing image matching system. We propose a technique to make use of them in a SIFT-based algorithm. The techniqueâ€™s capabilities are demonstrated on real images, where it causes a significant improvement in comparison with the original SIFT results in the percentage of correct matches found.
