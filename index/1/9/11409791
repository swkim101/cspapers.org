In the new Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) language processing system that is currently under development at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, the Montagovian semantics of the earlier GPSG system (see [Gawron et al. 1982]) is replaced by a radically different approach with a number of distinct advantages. In place of the lambda calculus and standard first-order logic, our medium of conceptual representation is a new logical formalism called NFLT (Neo-Fregean Language of Thought); compositional semantics is effected, not by schematic lambda expressions, but by LISP procedures that operate on NFLT expressions to produce new expressions. NFLT has a number of features that make it well-suited for natural language translations, including predicates of variable arity in which explicitly marked situational roles supercede order-coded argument positions, sortally restricted quantification, a compositional (but nonextensional) semantics that handles causal contexts, and a principled conceptual raising mechanism that we expect to lead to a computationally tractable account of propositional attitudes. The use of semantically compositional LISP procedures in place of lambda-schemas allows us to produce fully reduced translations on the fly, with no need for post-processing. This approach should simplify the task of using semantic information (such as sortal incompatibilities) to eliminate bad parse paths.
