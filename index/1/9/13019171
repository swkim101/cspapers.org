We demonstrate a web-based environment for development and testing of different pedestrian route instruction-giving systems. The environment contains a City Model, a TTS interface, a game-world, and a user GUI including a simulated street-view. We describe the environment and components, the metrics that can be used for the evaluation of pedestrian route instruction-giving systems, and the shared challenge which is being organised using this environment.
