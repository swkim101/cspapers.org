This paper proposes a prefix-tree structure, called CPS-tree (Compact Pattern Stream tree) that efficiently discovers the exact set of recent frequent patterns from high-speed data stream. The CPS-tree introduces the concept of dynamic tree restructuring technique in handling stream data that allows it to achieve highly compact frequency-descending tree structure at runtime and facilitates an efficient FP-growth-based [1] mining technique.
