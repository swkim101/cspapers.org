A different way of force control is presented, that is especially advantageous for position controlled robots. Instead of usual force control laws we rely on the well tuned position control loop and just use the force sensor to measure the target pose or to predict the desired trajectory. In combination with a compliant sensor we introduce an inherently stable framework of force control which almost inhibits all control errors. After an unexpected impact the force error is reduced independently from the sensor's bandwidth or delays in signal processing. Thus the (inevitable) impact force is more significant than the measured force control errors. The special case of a sensor that is mounted far away from a vertex-face contact is discussed, too.
