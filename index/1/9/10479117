We have collected the access logs for our university's web domain over a time span of 4.5 years. We now release the pre-processed data of a 3-month period for research into user navigation behavior. We preprocessed the data so that only successful GET requests of web pages by non-bot users are kept. The resulting 3-month collection comprises 9.6M page visits (190K unique URLs) by 744K unique visitors.
