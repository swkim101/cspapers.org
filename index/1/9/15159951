Research on learning suggests the importance of helping students organize their knowledge around meaningful patterns of information. This paper reports on a multi-institutional study to investigate how senior computer science majors articulate and organize their knowledge of programming concepts using a card-sorting technique adopted from knowledge acquisition. We show that card-sorts are an effective means of eliciting students' knowledge structures and suggest they can also be used to help students organize their knowledge throughout the curriculum.
