This paper describes the design and implementation of Ubiquity, a multilingual textual interface for the Firefox browser developed at Mozilla Labs. The Ubiquity interface facilitates rapid information retrieval and task execution in the browser, leveraging existing open web APIs. The importance of offering equivalent user experiences for speakers of different languages is reflected in the design of Ubiquityâ€™s new natural language parser, described here. This paper also aims to advocate the further development of equipotent multilingual interfaces for information access.
