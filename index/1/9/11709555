The proliferation and affordability of smart sensors such as webcams, microphones, etc., has created opportunities for exciting new classes of distributed services. While such sensors are inexpensive and easy to deploy across a wide area, realizing useful services requires addressing a number of challenges, such as preventing transfer of large data feeds across the network, efficiently discovering relevant data among the distributed collection of sensors and delivering it to interested participants, and efficiently handling static meta-data information, live readings from sensor feeds, and historical data.
