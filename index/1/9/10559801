Interaction tasks on a computer screen can technically be scaled to a much larger or much smaller sized input control area by adjusting the input device's control gain or the control-display (C-D) ratio. However, human performance as a function of movement scale is not a well concluded topic. This study introduces a new task paradigm to study the scale effect in the framework of the steering law. The results confirmed a U-shaped performance-scale function and rejected straight-line or no-effect hypotheses in the literature. We found a significant scale effect in path steering performance, although its impact was less than that of the steering law's index of difficulty. We analyzed the scale effects in two plausible causes: movement joints shift and motor precision limitation. The theoretical implications of the scale effects to the validity of the steering law, and the practical implications of input device size and zooming functions are discussed in the paper.
