Software environment emulation provides a means for simulating an operational environment of a system. This process involves approximation of systems' external behaviors and their communications with a system to be tested in the environment. Development of such an environment is a tedious task and involves complex low level coding. Model driven engineering is an avenue to raise the level of abstraction beyond programming by specifying solution directly using problem domain concepts. In this paper we propose a novel domain-specific modeling tool to generate complex testing environments. Our tool employs a suite of domain-specific visual modeling languages for modeling emulation environment at a high level of abstraction. These high level specifications are then automatically transformed to runtime environment for application integration testing, boosting development productivity and ease of use.
