Incremental Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms require, in general, precise knowledge of the camera linear and angular velocities in the camera frame for estimating the 3D structure of the scene. Since an accurate measurement of the camera own motion may be a non-trivial task in several robotics applications (for instance when the camera is onboard a UAV), we propose in this paper an active SfM scheme fully independent from the camera angular velocity. This is achieved by considering, as visual features, some rotational invariants obtained from the projection of the perceived 3D points onto a virtual unitary sphere (unified camera model). This feature set is then exploited for designing a rotation-free active SfM algorithm able to optimize online the direction of the camera linear velocity for improving the convergence of the structure estimation task. As case study, we apply our framework to the depth estimation of a set of 3D points and discuss several simulations and experimental results for illustrating the approach.
