Psychology and sociology research has shown that emotion information is a strong indicator for users' preferences. Meanwhile, with the fast development of online services, users are willing to express their emotion on others' reviews, which makes the emotion information pervasively available. Besides, recent research shows that the number of emotion on reviews is always much larger than the number of reviews. Therefore incorporating emotion on reviews may help to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems for recommender systems. In this paper, we provide a principled and mathematical way to exploit both positive and negative emotion on reviews, and propose a novel framework MIRROR, exploiting eMotIon on Reviews for RecOmmendeR systems from both global and local perspectives. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and further experiments are conducted to understand how emotion on reviews works for the proposed framework.
