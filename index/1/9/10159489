The Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW) focuses on the security challenges and opportunities raised by cloud computing. The ``cloud'' is a general term for aggregation of computing resources within an extensive, elastic environment typically marked by a high degree of resource virtualization and sharing among tenants. As a multi-faceted trend, cloud computing creates many and varied security and privacy requirements at the intersection of a broad range of disciplines. The goal of the workshop is to elucidate the security and privacy problems raised by cloud computing and foster understanding of the connection between research and practice in this vibrant and transformative area.
