We examined whether using problem-solving software tutors in Computer Science I can help improve the self-confidence of female students. We analyzed the data collected by five software tutors in spring 2006. We found that 1) the self-confidence of female Computer Science I students before using the software tutors was in many cases lower than that of male students, as has been stated in prior literature; 2) Using problem-solving software tutors improved the self-confidence of female students to be on par with that of male students when female students started with lower prior self-confidence. Since researchers have suggested that self-confidence is one of the factors contributing to the shrinking pipeline, problem-solving software tutors can be used to improve the retention of female students in Computer Science.
