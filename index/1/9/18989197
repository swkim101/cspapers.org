Question answering research has only recently started to spread from short factoid questions to more complex ones. One significant challenge is the evaluation: manual evaluation is a difficult, time-consuming process and not applicable within efficient development of systems. Automatic evaluation requires a corpus of questions and answers, a definition of what is a correct answer, and a way to compare the correct answers to automatic answers produced by a system. For this purpose we present a Wikipedia-based corpus of Whyquestions and corresponding answers and articles. The corpus was built by a novel method: paid participants were contacted through a Web-interface, a procedure which allowed dynamic, fast and inexpensive development of data collection methods. Each question in the corpus has several corresponding, partly overlapping answers, which is an asset when estimating the correctness of answers. In addition, the corpus contains information related to the corpus collection process. We believe this additional information can be used to post-process the data, and to develop an automatic approval system for further data collection projects conducted in a similar manner.
