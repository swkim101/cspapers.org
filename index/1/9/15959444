Such a tree is called the evolutionary computation we will permit in our model tree. We make the following (conventional) will be an experiment on species E, y, and z, assumptions about the evolutionary tree: where the result is the pair of species with the most recent common ancestor (where most 1. There is a single species from which all recent means farthest from the root). species evolve. Several other models have been proposed in the literature on phylogenetic trees (evo2.
