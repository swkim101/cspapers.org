This paper presents the contact-consistent elastic strips (CES) framework, a motion planning approach capable of producing complex multi-contact whole-body humanoid behaviors in dynamic environments. Planning multi-contact motions for humanoid robots is known to be non-trivial since it involves aspects of autonomous balancing, obstacle avoidance, ensuring global connectivity of the workspace and concurrent consideration of the kinematic and dynamic constraints. Previous works at motion planning for humanoid systems tend to focus on joint space planning and deal with obstacle avoidance and contact-point searching as the separated problems. CES framework, however, simultaneously considers all these requirements and constraints in task space while planning a valid sequence of contact-points and corresponding motions. This resulted in considerable improvements to efficiency and significantly reduced planning time. With the use of CES framework, complex multi-contact locomotion behaviors and real-time adjustments to the robot motions in 3D unstructured environments is possible. Several simulations are demonstrated to evaluate and verify the performance of CES framework.
