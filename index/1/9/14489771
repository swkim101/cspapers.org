Once the person's identity is established, the most important aspects of ubiquitous healthcare monitoring of elderly and chronic patients are location, activity, physiological and psychological parameters. Since smartphones have become the most pervasive computing platform today, it is only a logical extension to use the same in healthcare domain for bringing ubiquity. Besides smartphone, skeleton based activity detection and localization using depth sensor like Kinect make ubiquitous monitoring effective without compromising privacy to a large extent. Finally sensing mental condition is made possible by analysis of the subject's social network feed. This paper presents an end-to-end healthcare monitoring system code named UbiHeld (Ubiquitous Healthcare for Elderly) using the techniques mentioned above and an IoT (Internet of Things) based back-end platform.
