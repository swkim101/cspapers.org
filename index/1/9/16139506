This paper is devoted to a centralized mission planner for a group of marine robots. Mission is considered consisting of straight line segments (usually called tacks). The planner takes segments spatial configuration into account and solves a problem similar to the Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem (MTSP) in order to assign a sequence of segments to each vehicle. The contribution of this paper is in implementation details of the planner based on a specific mission mathematical model, its field test results and analysis for a group composed from an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).
