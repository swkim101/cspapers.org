We study a method of optimal data-driven aggregation of classifiers in a convex combination and establish tight upper bounds on its excess risk with respect to a convex loss function under the assumption that the solution of optimal aggregation problem is sparse. We use a boosting type algorithm of optimal aggregation to develop aggregate classifiers of activation patterns in fMRI based on locally trained SVM classifiers. The aggregation coefficients are then used to design a "boosting map" of the brain needed to identify the regions with most significant impact on classification.
