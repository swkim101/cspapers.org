The Semantic Binary Relationship Model (SBRM) is a first-order formalism which combines an organisationally simple basis (i.e. binary relationships) with the capabilities of semantic networks and logical integrity and deduction rules. The aim is to permit the efficient modelling of practical enterprises In a DBMS context, whilst accommodating the requirements of knowledge-based systems. The theoretical foundations of the SBRM are described, with particular attention to inheritance hierarchies and rule representation. The low-level unit of SBRM information is the triple. A 4Mbyte associatively-accessed triple store is being constructed, and will form the heart of a smart information machine based on the SBRM.
