A new concept for developing hexapod robots using eccentric wheels is proposed in this work. Compared with the RHex robot, the proposed hexapod robot can greatly reduce the bumping of the robot body in both smooth ground and rocky terrain. Also, the developed hexapod robot possesses significant advantages over those with common circular wheels in traversing rocky and uneven terrain. Also, the control of the proposed hexapod robot is simple because each eccentric wheel has only one degree of freedom. This work focuses on the kinematics analysis of the proposed hexapod robot. Two types of gaits respectively named as the alternating tripod gait and the hexapod gait are proposed. With the alternating tripod gait, the robot can move continuously. But the hexapod gait is helpful in overcoming the resistant torque caused by the weight on the eccentric wheels. Besides, the effect of the eccentricity on the motion of the robot is analyzed. The proposed hexapod robot can be used to detect the gas in underground mines.
