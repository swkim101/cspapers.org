Angle of arrival (AOA) has previously been used for outdoor positioning in aircraft navigation and for services like E911. For indoor positioning, the best schemes to date rely either on extensive infrastructure, or on sampling of the signal strength on a dense grid, which is subject to changes in the environment, like furniture, elevators, or people. We present an indoor positioning architecture that does not require a signal strength map, simply requiring the placement of special VOR base stations (VORBA). While our incipient realization of the AOA using 802.11 uses a base station with a revolving directional antenna, a non mechanical implementation would yield comparable performance, even with quantized angles. Performance of positioning with VOR base stations is evaluated though experimentation, simulation, and theoretical analysis.
