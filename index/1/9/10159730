We introduced an arcade-style gaming environment for use in a mixed undergraduate and graduate introductory artificial intelligence (AI) course. Our primary goal in this course was to provide students with a "significant learning experience" [3]. We achieved this goal by creating projects based in the game environment that illustrate several major AI topic areas. These projects were designed to be challenging, enjoyable, and to demonstrate AI programming in a realistic environment. Each of the projects was designed to be feasible for all the students yet flexible enough to allow the stronger students to explore alternative solutions. We evaluated our success in achieving these goals through student evaluations, comments, and exam grades.
