A system to improve the quality of human life is developed and proposed. A model-based approach is used where smart home residents, appliances, energy sources and correlations among them are comprehensively modeled. The model was integrated with activity recognition information that enables the system to suggest smart life tips that provide advice to residents in a non-intrusive way. A crowd-sourced large-scale survey of 1,000 subjects was conducted that enabled important tips for improving the quality of human life to be quantified. On the basis of the survey results, quantitative metrics and strategies were designed for presenting suitable tips in a timely manner depending on the lifestyle of subjects. The system was evaluated by (1) 34 actual subjects in virtual smart homes and (2) family members in an actual house in an experiment lasting more than one month in which actual sensors were deployed.
