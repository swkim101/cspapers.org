This paper presents an algorithm for implementing r ule filtering in active and trigger enabled databases. The algorithm generates one or more decision trees that determine what rules or triggers might be enabled b y an individual database element, reducing the number of rules or triggers that must be evaluated. The algo rithm operates by symbolically representing the space of database elements and subdividing the space based o n rule predicates. Regions of the state space repres nt particular combinations of enabled rules. Decision trees are then generated based on the subdivided state sp c . The trees have the important property that no indiv idual test is repeated. The ordered binary decision diag ram (BDD) data structure is used to represent and manipulate the state space.
