This paper discusses the steps that are required to produce computer programs that satisfactorily implement a computer application. It is a major contention that those steps impacted by structured programming are not the most critical to the development of a successful computer application. Successful computer applications depend more heavily on the statement of the problem, the conceptual solution, and software specification. Ample precedents for approaches to these more crucial steps can be found in good engineering practice and applied science. Heavy emphasis is placed on the purpose and use of software specifications.
