This work presents on-top, a new device identification method that exploits off-the-shelf capacitive touchscreens to extract its capacitive signatures. The method relies on a key observation that each capacitive touch screen has a unique capacitive signature which are caused by either the difference in touch sensing technologies or the imperfections of the sensor during its fabrication. In particular, the voltage pattern generated by commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) capacitive touchscreens during finger touch sensing are uniquely identifiable. Our preliminary evaluation with actual hardware prototype on 14 mobile touchscreens shows that on-top achieves a promising performance of 100% detection rate without any false positive. We also show that on-top can be used to securely trigger wireless communication while it consumes a very little amount of power (3.5 times lower than triggering using NFC and 2 times lower than using Bluetooth low energy (BLE)).
