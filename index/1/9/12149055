The joint velocity jump for redundant robots in the presence of locked-joint failures is discussed in this paper. First, the analytical formula of the optimal joint velocity with minimum jump is derived, and its specific expressions for both all joint failure and certain single joint failure are presented. Then, the jump difference between the minimum jump solution and the least-norm velocity solution is mathematically analyzed, and the influence factors on this difference are also discussed. Based on this formula, a new fault tolerant algorithm with the minimum jump is proposed. Finally simulation examples are implemented with a planar 3R robot and a 4R spatial robot, and an experimental study is also done. Study results indicate that the new algorithm proposed in this paper is well suited for real time implementation, and can further reduce the joint velocity jump thereby improving the motion stability of redundant robots in fault tolerant operations. Also, the fewer the possible failed joints are, the more obvious the effect of this new algorithm is.
