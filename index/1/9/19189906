The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities such as Wikipedia and the progress in scalable information extraction from Web and text sources has enabled the automatic construction of very large knowledge bases (KBs). Recent endeavors of this kind include academic research projects such as DBpedia, KnowItAll, Probase, ReadTheWeb, and YAGO, as well as industrial ones such as Freebase, the Google Knowledge Graph, Amazon’s Evi, Microsoft’s Satori, and related efforts at Bloomberg, Walmart, and others. These projects provide automatically constructed KBs of facts about named entities, their semantic classes, and their mutual relationships. They usually contain millions of entities and hundreds of millions of facts about them. Such world knowledge in turn enables cognitive applications and knowledge-centric services like disambiguating naturallanguage text, entity linking, deep question answering, and semantic search and analytics over entities and relations in Web and enterprise data. Prominent examples of how knowledge bases can be harnessed include the Google Knowledge Cards and the IBM Watson question answering system. This tutorial presents state-of-the-art methods, recent advances, research opportunities, and open challenges in the field of knowledge harvesting and its applications. Particular emphasis will be on the twofold role of KBs for big-data analytics: using scalable distributed algorithms for harvesting knowledge from Web and text sources, and leveraging
