This paper presents a novel information retrieval system that includes 1) the addition of concepts to facilitate the identification of the correct word sense, 2) a natural language query interface, 3) the inclusion of weights and penalties for proper nouns that build upon the Okapi weighting scheme, and 4) a term clustering technique that exploits the spatial proximity of search terms in a document to further improve the performance. The effectiveness of the system is validated by experimental results.
