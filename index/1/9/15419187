Autonomous vehicles operating in real-world industrial environments have to overcome numerous challenges, chief among which is the creation and maintenance of consistent 3D world models. This paper proposes to address the challenges of online real-world mapping by building upon previous work on compact spatial representation and formulating a novel 3D mapping approach - the Normal Distributions Transform Occupancy Map (NDT-OM). The presented algorithm enables accurate real-time 3D mapping in large-scale dynamic environments employing a recursive update strategy. In addition, the proposed approach can seamlessly provide maps at multiple resolutions allowing for fast utilization in high-level functions such as localization or path planning. Compared to previous approaches that use the NDT representation, the proposed NDT-OM formulates an exact and efficient recursive update formulation and models the full occupancy of the map.
