In this poster, we study the problem of Opinionated Blog Feed Retrieval which can be considered as a particular type of the faceted blog distillation introduced by TREC 2009. It is a task of finding blogs not only having a principle and recurring interest in a given topic but also having a clear inclination towards expressing opinions on it. We propose a novel probabilistic model for this task which combines its two factors, topical relevance and opinionatedness, in a unified probabilistic framework. Experiments conducted in the context of the TREC 2009 & 2010 Blog Track show the effectiveness of the proposed model.
