In this paper, the proposed LIPED (LIfe Profile based Event Detection) employs the concept of life profiles to predict the activeness of event for effective event detection. A group of events with similar activeness patterns shares a life profile, modeled by a hidden Markov model. Considering the burst-and-diverse property of events, LIPED identifies the activeness status of event. As a result, LIPED balances the clustering precision and recall to achieve better F1 scores than other well known approaches evaluated on the official TDT1 corpus.
