This poster describes our experiences, materials and plans using the Atmel AVR, a RISC microprocessor, for teaching beginning computer organization at the college level. In particular, we use this microprocessor, typically packaged into the Arduino, to give hands-on experience with: (1) Assembly language programming, including ISA (16 bit instructions), multiple types of branches, multiple addressing modes, (2) C language programming, (3) interrupt programming, (4) I/O programming, and (5) programming on-board components, e.g., timers/counters.
 Because I/O pins are exposed, it is easy to use logic analyzer or oscilloscope to observe actual signals. Students are charmed and motivated by the physicality of the platform. It is an easy to use platform with a large and enthusiastic user community.
