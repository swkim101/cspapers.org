In this interactive presentation, a Chinese named entity and relation identification system is demonstrated. The domain-specific system has a three-stage pipeline architecture which includes word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition, and named entity relation identitfication. The experimental results have shown that the average F-measure for word segmentation and POS tagging after correcting errors achieves 92.86 and 90.01 separately. Moreover, the overall average F-measure for 6 kinds of name entities and 14 kinds of named entity relations is 83.08% and 70.46% respectively.
