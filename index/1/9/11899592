Robotic devices have been shown to be efficacious in the delivery of therapy to treat upper limb motor impairment following stroke. However, the application of this technology to other types of neurological injury has been limited to case studies. In this paper, we present a multi degree of freedom robotic exoskeleton, the MAHI Exo II, intended for rehabilitation of the upper limb following incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). We present details about the MAHI Exo II and initial findings from a clinical evaluation of the device with eight subjects with incomplete SCI who completed a multi-session training protocol. Clinical assessments show significant gains when comparing pre- and post-training performance in functional tasks. This paper explores a range of robotic measures capturing movement quality and smoothness that may be useful in tracking performance, providing as feedback to the subject, or incorporating into an adaptive training protocol. Advantages and disadvantages of the various investigated measures are discussed with regard to the type of movement segmentation that can be applied to the data collected during unassisted movements where the robot is backdriven and encoder data is recorded for post-processing.
