Input and output are often viewed as complementary operations, and it is certainly true that the direction of data flow during input is the reverse of that during output. However, in a conventional operating system, the direction of control flow is the same for both input and output: the program plays the active role, while the operating system transput primitives are always passive. Thus there are four primitive transput operations, not two: the corresponding pairs are passive input and active output, and active input and passive output. This paper explores the implications of this idea in the context of an object oriented operating system.
