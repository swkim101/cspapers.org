This paper discusses a means for automatically supporting humans in information and task prioritizing. A new generic method based on the Competitive Task Model is described. Its implementation is able to calculate priorities of competing information entities, which provides a way of allocating tasks to the process operator. Due to a combination of dynamic states and information entities, it is usable as an adaptive control mechanism for attention and task allocation.
