There are many different forms of human-robot interactions, allowing a team of humans and robots to take advantage of skills of each team member. A developing area of research is focused upon the potential of robot swarms working in emergency settings. In particular we consider a swarm of robots that are capable of supporting and enhancing fire fighting operations co-operatively. This paper outlines some of the key characteristics of this emergency setting, robot swarms within it and the work conducted to develop effective human-robot interaction.
