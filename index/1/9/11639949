This paper is about dense depthmap estimation using a monocular camera in workspaces with extensive textureless surfaces. Current state of the art techniques have been shown to work in real time with an admirable performance in desktop-size environments. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, when applied to larger indoor environments, performance often degrades. A common cause is the presence of large affine texture-less areas like by walls, floors, ceilings and drab objects such as chairs and tables. These produce noisy and worse still, grossly erroneous initial seeds for the depthmap that greatly impede successful optimisation. We solve this problem via the introduction of a new non-local higher-order regularisation term that enforces piecewise affine constraints between image pixels that are far apart in the image. This property leverages the observation that the depth at the edges of bland regions are often well estimated whereas their inner pixels are deeply problematic. A welcome by-product of our proposed technique is an estimate of the surface normals at each pixel. We will show that in terms of implementation, our algorithm is a natural extension of the often used variational approaches. We evaluate the proposed technique using real datasets for which we have ground truth models.
