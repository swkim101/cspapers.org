This paper presents an analysis of inverse kinematics solutions for YH050 which is an industrial robot manipulator developed by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. We propose three methods: numerical approach, geometrical approach and combined approach. These approaches are addressed through theoretical explanation and experimental verification.
