Software engineers often need to identify design defects, recurring design problems that hinder the development process, to improve and assess the quality of their systems. However, this is diÂ±cult because of the lack of specifications and tools. We propose Decor, a method to specify design defects systematically and to generate automatically detection algorithms. With this method, software engineers analyse and specify design defects at a high-level of abstraction using a unified vocabulary and dedicated language for generating detection algorithms
