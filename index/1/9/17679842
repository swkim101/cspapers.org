To enable conversational QA, it is important to examine key issues addressed in conversational systems in the context of question answering. In conversational systems, understanding user intent is critical to the success of interaction. Recent studies have also shown that the capability to automatically identify problematic situations during interaction can significantly improve the system performance. Therefore, this paper investigates the new implications of user intent and problematic situations in the context of question answering. Our studies indicate that, in basic interactive QA, there are different types of user intent that are tied to different kinds of system performance (e.g., problematic/error free situations). Once users are motivated to find specific information related to their information goals, the interaction context can provide useful cues for the system to automatically identify problematic situations and user intent.
