An important aspect of product development is design for manufacturability (DFM) analysis that aims to incorporate manufacturing requirements into early product decisionmaking. Existing methods in DFM seldom quantify explicitly the tradeoffs between revenues and costs generated by making design choices that may be desirable in the market but costly to manufacture. This paper builds upon previous work coordinating models for engineering design and marketing product line decision-making by incorporating quantitative models of manufacturing investment and production allocation. The result is a methodology that considers engineering design decisions quantitatively in the context of manufacturing and market consequences in order to resolve tradeoffs, not only among performance objectives, but also between market preferences and manufacturing cost.
