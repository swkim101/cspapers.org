Construction enterprises win the project by construction project bidding .In present system of biding ,the threshold bidding cost directly impacts on bidding for quotation price of winning the tender, so it is very critical to design reasonable cost threshold in completive-bidding .There are many factors that influence the construction cost, which make construction cost to have the character of the uncertainty and the distribution of statistics. So, the mathematics statistic method and the capital-time value are introduced to design on the threshold bidding cost, then ,the dynamic model of threshold bidding cost is built , which can be tested by the error term. Finally, after the model is analyzed by real project, construction enterprises can improve the probabilities of wining the project by applying the model in practice. So the dynamic model of the threshold cost of bidding have an important practical guiding significance for construction enterprises tendering.
