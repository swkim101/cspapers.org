With the widespread adoption of social media and mobile devices, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence, a unique opportunity arises for tackling mental health problems. In this study, we investigate how usersâ€™ online social activities and physiological signals detected through ubiquitous sensors can be utilized in realistic scenarios for monitoring their mental health states. First, we extract a suite of multimodal time-series signals using modern computer vision and signal processing techniques, from recruited participants while they are immersed in online social media that elicit emotions and emotion transitions. Next, we use machine learning techniques to build a model that establishes the connection between mental states and the extracted multimodal signals. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using two groups of recruited subjects.
