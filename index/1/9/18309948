This video shows a Segway robot from the University of Texas at Austin competing in the finals of the 2007 Robocup @Home competition, which featured home assistant robots performing various challenging tasks. This demonstration combines a few tasks which will likely be performed by a future home assistant robot. The robot learns a human's appearance, follows the human with his back turned, distinguishes the human from a similarly clothed stranger, and adapts when it notices that the human has changed his clothing. For this task, we introduce a novel two-classifier architecture, using the subject's face as a primary identifying characteristic and his shirt as a secondary characteristic.
