There is a lot of limitations in the traditional process of mould design and manufacturing. With the development of the science and technology, especially in the field of the computer, CAE technology begins to be applied widely in the process of modern mould design and manufacturing. The results of CAE simulation analysis of injection molding can provide reliable and optimized reference data for mould design and manufacturing. Applying CAE simulation analysis technology of injection molding can not only increase the probability of success in mould test but also improve greatly the quality of mould design and manufacturing. In this paper, the injection molding process of mobile phone front shell is analyzed. The best position of gate is discussed by using the Moldflow software. The optimized design scheme of feed system is determined in view of the particular structure of the plastic part. Then the simulation flow analysis of injection molding is carried into execution. On the basis of CAE analysis of injection molding, the whole injection mould structure is designed and the working procedure of injection mould is stated.
