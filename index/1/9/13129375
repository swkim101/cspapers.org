A high-performance parallel system for processing databases is presented, which adopts a distributed memory architecture and has been successfully implemented on a transputer platform. In addition to developing and implementing a variety of rules and schemes for parallelizing database queries, general analytic models for distributed memory database processing have been formulated, which have been successfully validated against measurements. Experimental data also indicate that the system is able to attain near linear speedup for the join operation. We also demonstrate that a linear speedup is unattainable for distributed memory database systems, and an upper bound governing the maximum transaction rate is derived. The present system is also reconfigurable and adopts a novel processor allocation scheme based on equalizing the elapsed time among different cooperating processors, which is able to readjust the processing resources assigned to particular database tasks in accordance with changing demands on the system.
