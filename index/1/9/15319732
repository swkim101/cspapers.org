Developing mobile applications which communicate over multiple networking technology is a difficult task. First, developers usually have to maintain a different version of the application for each mobile platform they target. Recent trends in mobile cross-platform solutions may alleviate this issue. However, developers still need to program a variation of the application for each different network interface. In addition, the APIs for communicating over ad-hoc networking technologies (eg. wifi direct), are very different from the cloud APIs. Finally, developers need to write highly asynchronous code for communication. This is often written with callbacks which invert the control flow of the application leading to code which is hard to debug and maintain. This paper introduces Connect.js, a JavaScript library for writing multi-networked cross-platform mobile applications. Applications consists of distributed objects which communicate with one another by means of asynchronous messages via a special kind of reference which is transparent for the underlying network technology used. Connect.js also provides dedicated language constructs for structuring asynchronous code by means of future combinators.
