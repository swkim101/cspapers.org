Three dimensional computer applications such as CAD packages are often difficult to use because of inadequate depth feedback to the user. It has, however, been shown that audio feedback can help improve a user's sense of depth perception. This paper describes an experiment which evaluates the use of three different audio environments in a 3D task undertakeh by visually impaired users. The three audio environments map tonal, musical, and orchestral sounds to an (x, y, z) position in a 3D environment. In each environment the user's task is to locate a target in three dimensions as accurately and quickly as possible. This experiment has three important results: that audio feedback improves performance in 3D applications for all users; that visually impaired users can use 3D applications with the accuracy of sighted users; and that visually impaired users can attain greater target accuracy than sighted users in a sound-only environment.
