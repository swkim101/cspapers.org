To utilize the separate advantage of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and infrared images, in this paper, a fusion method based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform is proposed for SAR and infrared image fusion. Simulation experiments show that this method can yield fusion image with better visual quality than discrete wavelet transform and the obtained fusion image can preserve much information of edges and textures of SAR and infrared images.
