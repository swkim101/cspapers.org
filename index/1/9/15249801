Images represent an important and abundant source of data. Understanding their statistical structure has important applications such as image compression and restoration. In this paper we propose a particular kind of probabilistic model, dubbed the "products of edge-perts model" to describe the structure of wavelet transformed images. We develop a practical denoising algorithm based on a single edge-pert and show state-of-the-art denoising performance on benchmark images.
