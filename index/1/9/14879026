A one-dimensional visual tracking chip has been implemented using neuromorphic, analog VLSI techniques to model selective visual attention in the control of saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements. The chip incorporates focal-plane processing to compute image saliency and a winner-take-all circuit to select a feature for tracking. The target position and direction of motion are reported as the target moves across the array. We demonstrate its functionality in a closed-loop system which performs saccadic and smooth pursuit tracking movements using a one-dimensional mechanical eye.
