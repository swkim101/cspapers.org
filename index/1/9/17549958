This paper is a survey of some of the major semantic models that have been developed for automated semantic analysis of natural language. Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are based mainly on models of human cognitive processes such as Quillian's semantic memory, Simmon's Protosynthex III and others. All existing systems and/or models, more or less experimental, were applied to a small subset of English. They are highly tentative because the definitions of semantic processes and semantically structured lexicons are not formulated rigorously. This is due mainly to the fact that it is unknown whether a unique, consistent hierarchization of the semantic features of language is possible.However, the models described are significant contributions to an unexplored field called semantics. The progressive development of a sophisticated, semantically based system for automated processing of natural language is a realistic goal. It should not be neglected, despite the fact that it is difficult to predict when this goal will be achieved.
