The purpose of this paper is to show realization of passive walking of a biped robot emu that is composed of one body and two legs. The semi-passive walking means that a biped robot walks passively on gentle descent accompanying with attitude control of the body. In the beginning of this paper, we outline the formulation for the passive and semi-passive walking. We analyze, next, stability of the semi-passive walking to regard the system as a discrete dynamical system. Finally, we show some simulated and experimental results to verify the validity of the controlled system and the analysis.
