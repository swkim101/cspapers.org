The AN/1 network architecture employs compact LANs as integrated switching nodes. The multibussed nodal architecture imposes a natural hierarchy to the network interconnection problem. A nodal interconnection method is introduced as a generalization of hierarchical topology design techniques. Based on traffic and distance, a flat nodal topology is decomposed into several level, overlapped subnetworks. Each subordinate subnetwork communicates with its ordinate subnetwork via two formal gates. The traffic matrix for each subnetwork can be obtained. Linear programming techniques are used to determine bandwidth requirements. Perturbation procedures are applied to determine the appropriate groupings of LANs into subnetworks and the appropriate hierarchy. A flat topology may be returned if it is optimal.
