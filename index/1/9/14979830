In this paper, new methodologies for the estimation of the depth of a target with unknown dimensions, based on depth from focus strategies, are proposed. The image-based measurements are detailed, through the minimization of a new functional, deeply rooted on optical characteristics of the lens system, namely the point spread function. This work complements an inexpensive single pan and tilt camera-based indoor positioning and tracking system, resorting to complementary filters for depth estimation. A motivation example is provided, where the target dimensions are assumed as known. Then, an extension corresponding to an higher-order filter is presented, that tackles the problem at hand. To assess the performance of the proposed system, a series of indoor experimental tests for a range of operation of up to ten meter were carried out. A centimetric accuracy was obtained under realistic conditions.
