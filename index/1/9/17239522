As the number of processes and resources increases within a computer system, does the probability of that system's being in deadlock increase or decrease? This paper introduces Probabilistic Automata as a model of computer systems. This allows investigation of the above question for various scheduling algorithms. A theorem is proven which indicates that, within the types of systems considered, the probability of deadlock increases.
