Current search engines cannot effectively rank those relational data, which exists on dynamic websites supported by online databases. In this study, to rank such structured data, we propose a new model, Relaxed Dominant Relationship (RDR), which extends the state-of-the-art work by incorporating rank aggregation methods. We propose efficient strategies on building compressed data structure to encode the core part of RDR between items. Efficient querying approaches are devised to facilitate the ranking process and to answer the RDR query. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.
