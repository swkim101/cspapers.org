Until recently there are no common, convenient, and repeatable evaluation methods that could be easily applied to support fast turn-around development of automatic text summarization systems. In this paper, we introduce an information-theoretic approach to automatic evaluation of summaries based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence of distributions between an automatic summary and a set of reference summaries. Several variants of the approach are also considered and compared. The results indicate that JS divergence-based evaluation method achieves comparable performance with the common automatic evaluation method ROUGE in single documents summarization task; while achieves better performance than ROUGE in multiple document summarization task.
