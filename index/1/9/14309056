We present Pinstripe, a textile user interface element for eyes-free, continuous value input on smart garments that uses pinching and rolling a piece of cloth between your fingers. Input granularity can be controlled by the amount of cloth pinched. Pinstripe input elements are invisible, and can be included across large areas of a garment. Pinstripe thus addresses several problems previously identified in the placement and operation of textile UI elements on smart clothing.
