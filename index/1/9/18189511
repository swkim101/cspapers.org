Necessities for Software Quality Measurement and Assurance Technology have been increased.
B. Boehm and McCall proposed software evaluation criteria. Based on these studies, G. Murine developed Software Quality Metrics (SQM).
SQM was applied to several projects in NEC experimentally. An outline of the experiment will be presented and the results discussed.
Software Quality Measurement and Assurance Technology (SQMAT) was developed in NEC as a total technology for applying to various types and size of software projects, throughout the software life cycle.
