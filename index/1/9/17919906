Computational thinking is considered best practice for teaching computing and more broadly to solve problems and design systems, however as computing extends beyond the desktop (for instance increased integration of ubicomp technologies) so too must our educational methods. Exposure to ubicomp technologies is most accessible through the maker movement. With this in mind we argue we must move from computational thinking to computational making as an educational framework. Here we present a case study of children's making to support our vision for a broader conception of computational making.
