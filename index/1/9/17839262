In this paper, an innovative Recongurable Spherical Motion Generator (RSMG) is introduced to provide continuous spherical motion and force transmission. The mechanism enables unlimited workspace in 3-DOF spherical motion with rapid, continuous and precise motion capability. The conceptual design, as well as direct and inverse kinematics, are presented here. Singularities of the mechanism are analyzed. An actuation strategy is proposed such that the RSMG is capable of avoiding any types of singularities in order to produce unlimited spherical motion.
