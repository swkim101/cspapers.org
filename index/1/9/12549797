The Web Ontology Language (OWL) defines three classes of documents: Lite, DL, and Full. All RDF/XML documents are OWL Full documents, some OWL Full documents are also OWL DL documents, and some OWL DL documents are also OWL Lite documents. This paper discusses parsing and species recognition -- that is the process of determining whether a given document falls into the OWL Lite, DL or Full class. Wedescribe two alternative approaches to this task, one based on abstract syntax trees, the other on RDF triples, and compare their key characteristics.
