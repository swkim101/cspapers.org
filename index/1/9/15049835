In this paper, we wish to make three contributions to Naive Physics in the context of reasoning about devices. (1) We discuss some limitations of current qualitative simulation approaches with regard to a number of issues in understanding device behavior and point to the need for additional processes. (2) We introduce a new approach to deriving the behavior of devices called consolidation. In this approach, the behavior of a device is derived from the behavior of its components by inferring the behavior of selected substructures of the device. (3) We present an ontology of behavior and structure which is well-suited to the consolidation process. This ontology makes it possible to state rules of behavior composition, i.e., simple patterns of behavior and structure are used to infer additional behaviors.
