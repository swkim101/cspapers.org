Onomatopoeia is widely used in food reviews about food or restaurants. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a method to extract onomatopoeia including unknown ones automatically from food reviews sites. From the evaluation result, we found that we can extract onomatopoeia for specific foods with more than 46% precision; we find 18 unknown onomatopoeia, i.e. not registered in an existing onomatopoeia dictionary, in 62 extracted onomatopoeia. In addition, we propose a system that can present the user with a list of onomatopoeia specific to a restaurant she is interested in. The evaluation results indicate that an intuitive restaurant search can be done via a list of onomatopoeia, and that they are helpful for selecting food or restaurants.
