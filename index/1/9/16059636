We propose a novel rigorous approach for the analysis of Linsker's unsupervised Hebbian learning network. The behavior of this model is determined by the underlying nonlinear dynamics which are parameterized by a set of parameters originating from the Hebbian rule and the arbor density of the synapses. These parameters determine the presence or absence of a specific receptive field (also referred to as a 'connection pattern') as a saturated fixed point attractor of the model. In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis of the underlying nonlinear dynamics over the parameter space, determine the effects of the system parameters on the emergence of various receptive fields, and predict precisely within which parameter regime the network will have the potential to develop a specially designated connection pattern. In particular, this approach exposes, for the first time, the crucial role played by the synaptic density functions, and provides a complete precise picture of the parameter space that defines the relationships among the different receptive fields. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.
