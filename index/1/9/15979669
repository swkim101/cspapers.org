This paper describes the design of a dual processor VAX 11/780 built at the Purdue University Electrical Engineering School. It covers the conversion of a standard single processor VAX 11/780 into a dual processor system. A detailed description of hardware modifications performed and a parts list are included.
 The dual processor VAX is currently running a modified version of the UNIX (Fourth Berkeley Distribution) operating system. Because of licensing restrictions, operating system modifications will only be covered in general. Finally some performance evaluation will be discussed along with the problems encountered.
