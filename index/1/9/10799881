We show that if a flow network has Ic input/output terminals (for the traditional maximum-flow problem, k = 2), its external flow pattern (possible values of flow at the terminals) has two characterizations of size independent of the total number of vertices: a set of at most 2” inequalities in k variables representing flow values at the terminals, and a mimicking network with at most 22k vertices and the same external flow pattern as the original network. In the case that the underlying graph has bounded tree-width, we present a parallel algorithm that can compute these characterizations as well as an internal flow with any desired external flow pattern (including the maximum flow). The algorithm runs in O(logn) time on an EREW PRAM with O(n/logn) processors for constant k if an explicit decomposition of the graph is given; if not, the decomposition can be computed in NC. The maximum-flow problem for general networks is P-complete and therefore unlikely to be efficiently ‘Max-Planck-Institut fiir Informatik, D-66123 Saarbriicken, Germany.
