This paper describes an on-going study which applies the concept of transitivity to news discourse for text processing tasks. The complex notion of transitivity is defined and the relatioship between transitivity and information foregrounding is explained. A sample corpus of news articles has been coded for transitivity. The corpus is being used in two text processing experiments.
