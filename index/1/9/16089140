The main objective in XML Retrieval is to select the relevant elements of XML document instead of the whole document. Many open issues appear when considering Relevance Feedback (RF) in XML documents. They are mainly related to the form of XML documents, which mix content and structure information and to the new information granularity. In this paper, a new flexible method of relevance feedback in XML retrieval using two sources of evidence is described. We propose to use the context criterion to select terms to extend the initial query and to use generative structures to express structural constraints. Both approaches are applied in different combined forms. Experiments are carried out with the INEX evaluation campaign and results show the effectiveness of our approach.
