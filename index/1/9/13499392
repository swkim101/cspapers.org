For the development of medical micro-robotics and robotic manipulation of catheter it is necessary to ensure tissue integrity. In-vitro evaluation of tissue manipulation can be achieved using photoelastic stress analysis and vasculature modeling with photoelastic materials. In this research we propose epoxy resin as photoelastic material for vasculature modeling as it has a larger photoelastic coefficient than previously studied materials and it has a young modulus similar to human vasculature. A model of a saccular aneurysm with bleb was built with the purpose of measuring stress overshoots that enable to differentiate embolization techniques according to the respect for tissue integrity. During embolization using a coil with smaller size than the aneurysm dome diameter, an average area of 0.72 mm2 with stress above 90 kPa was measured. This area increased to 0.77 mm2 when the dome was touched with the release mechanism of the coil, and to 0.74 mm2 for embolization with larger size coil. The presented modeling material and measurement technique is useful for tissue respect quantification for micro-mechanisms evaluation.
