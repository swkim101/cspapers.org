We introduce the heap-on-top (hot) priority queue data structure that combines the multilevel bucket data structure of Denardo and Fox with a heap. Our data structure has superior operation bounds than either structure taken alone. We use the new data structure to obtain an improved bound for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. We also discuss a practical implementation of hot queues. Our experimental results in the context of Dijkstra's algorithm show that this implementation of hot queues performs very well and is more robust than implementations based only on heap or multilevel bucket data structures.
