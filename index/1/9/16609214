For legged devices, their ability of carrying payload is a necessity for a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we present a new approach of carrying payload by using a parallel elastic mechanism, which is able to carry payloads of at least 3 times of its bodyweight. Although the robot has no sensory feedback and consists of only two rigid bodies and one spring loaded joint, it is able to achieve efficient and stable forward hopping for a wide range of attached payload. The presented payload carrier ETH Cargo is based on the further development of our platform CHIARO for the payload range between 0 and 100kg. After parameter optimization using simulations, a series of real world experiments prove stable and high efficiency hopping of the prototype over a wide range of payloads.
