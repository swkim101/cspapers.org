Adversarial IR in general, and search engine spam, in particular, are engaging research topics with a real-world impact for Web users, advertisers and publishers. The AIRWeb workshop will bring researchers and practitioners in these areas together, to present and discuss state-of-the-art techniques as well as real-world experiences. Given the continued growth in search engine spam creation and detection efforts, we expect interest in this AIRWeb to surpass that of the previous three editions of the workshop (held jointly with WWW 2005, SIGIR 2006, and WWW 2007 respectively).
