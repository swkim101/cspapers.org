Synthesizing I/O requests that can accurately capture workload behavior is extremely valuable for the design, implementation and optimization of disk subsystems. This paper presents a synthetic workload generator for TPC-H, an important decision-support commercial workload, by completely characterizing the arrival and access patterns of its queries. We present a novel approach for parameterizing the behavior of inter-mingling streams of sequential requests, and exploit correlations between multiple attributes of these requests, to generate disk block-level traces that are shown to accurately mimic the behavior of a real trace in terms of response time characteristics for each TPC-H query.
