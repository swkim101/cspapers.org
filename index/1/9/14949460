This paper focuses on the problem of incorporating haptics-enabled teleoperation in minimally invasive tumor localization. Since the stiffness of a tumor is higher than that of the surrounding tissue, it can be identified as a hard nodule when palpated. Using a Tactile Sensing Instrument (TSI) developed at CSTAR, the distributed pressure profiles along the contacting surface can be measured during remote tissue palpation. The tumor can be detected by using a visualization software that creates a color contour map based on the magnitude of the pressure over the palpated area. The accuracy of this method depends on the uniformity of the force applied to the tissue. A haptics-enabled teleoperation system provides the surgeon with the opportunity to feel the interaction force between the instrument and tissue during Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). The objective of this research was to assess the feasibility of combining force feedback with tactile feedback in order to increase the overall performance of tumor localization. The teleoperation system used in this work consists of a Mitsubishi PA10 robot as the slave that is remotely controlled (over a dedicated network) through a 7 Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) haptic interface. A two-channel architecture, along with hybrid impedance control was utilized to form a bilateral teleoperation system in which the master is under force control and the slave is under position control. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of using force feedback in robot-assisted tactile sensing for tumor detection.
