We present GlossBoot, an effective minimally-supervised approach to acquiring wide-coverage domain glossaries for many languages. For each language of interest, given a small number of hypernymy relation seeds concerning a target domain, we bootstrap a glossary from the Web for that domain by means of iteratively acquired term/gloss extraction patterns. Our experiments show high performance in the acquisition of domain terminologies and glossaries for three different languages.
