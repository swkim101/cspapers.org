The dual frames method is a new tool for specifying and establishing semantic dependencies, which has been implemented in a parser of French called SABA. This method offers solutions to some typical problems of semantic parsing strategies - such as the difficulty of coping with different types of sentence structures and the amount of work needed to specify the vocabulary of a new domain - by providing a general and flexible tool which can handle all the kinds of meaningful terms which can appear in a sentence.
