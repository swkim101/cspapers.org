An extended record facility is described that supports multi-module records by providing:incremental and distributed record type definition, allowing field names of a record to be declared in different modules with different subscopes relative to the root record declaration.
field-level declaration of access to records by modules and procedures.
specification of record representation in terms of the underlying computer memory.

We also describe the uses of records that motivate these extensions as well as the compiler modifications required to implement this extended record facility.
From this work, we conclude that the extended record support can be added as a simple, natural extension to existing programming language designs and its implementation entails only modest additions to the compiler and linker with no significant compilation time cost.
