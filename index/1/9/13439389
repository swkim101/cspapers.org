In this paper, we use a sociocultural lens to provide an in-depth case study of a computer science program at a high school serving traditionally underserved youth. The study illuminates the contextual factors that supported dramatic programmatic growth, including the policy, curriculum, pedagogy, community, and school factors leading to student recruitment and retention in computer science. By focusing on computer science classroom practices and beyond, the study sheds light on the role multiple stakeholders can take in supporting computer science education in a K12 setting, and suggests strategies for program development in other K12 computer science settings.
