We propose a curriculum for a graduate professional degree in software engineering. After presenting the instructional objectives to be met by this curriculum, we present its underlying philosophy and assumptions. A number of suggestions are made for implementing the curriculum. In particular, we emphasize that this is a specific curriculum (for a Master's degree) which can serve as a starting point for the development of other software engineering curricula.
