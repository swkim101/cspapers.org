This paper addresses a novel tour discovery problem in the domain of travel search. We create a ranking of tours for a set of travel interests, where a tour is a group of city documents and a travel interest is a query. While generating and ranking tours, it is aimed that each interest (from the interest set) is satisfied by at least one city in a tour and the distance traveled to cover the tour is not too large. Firstly, we generate tours for the interest set, by utilizing the available ranking of cities for the individual interests and the distances between the cities. Then, in absence of existing methods directly related to our problem, we devise our novel techniques to calculate ranking scores for the tours and present a comparison of these techniques in our results. We demonstrate our web application Travici√≥n, that utilizes the best tour scoring technique.
