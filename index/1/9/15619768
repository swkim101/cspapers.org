Many information sources contain information that can only be accessed through search-specific search engines. Federated search provides search solutions of this type of hidden information that cannot be searched by conventional search engines. In many scenarios of federated search, such as the search among health care providers or among intelligence agencies, an individual information source does not want to disclose the source of the search results to users or other sources. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step federated search protocol that protects the privacy of information sources. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to address the research problem of protecting source privacy in federated text search.
