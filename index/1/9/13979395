This paper presents a knowledge-based approach to the specification, design, implementation, and evolution of database applications The knowledge base consists of 1) facts regarding database objects that are organized into a hierarchy of models, and 2) rules that specify the behavior of objects within a model and among modelsThe model hierarchy consists of database application data, database schemas, data model definitions, and system-related objects that control the user's interaction with the system The rules governing the behavior of objects are specified as explicit constraints on those objects User goals are transformed into conjectures that the inference engine must prove are satisfiable by interpreting all applicable constraintsThe semantic architecture of the PRISM system is described, together with the syntax and semantics of the constraint language PRISM is implemented in the C programming language and runs under the UNIX ** operating system
