Suction cups have long been used as a means to grasp and manipulate objects. They enable active control of grasp, enhance grasp stability, and handle some objects such as large flat plates more easily than standard graspers. However, the application of suction cups to object manipulation has been confined to a relatively small, well-defined problem set. Their potential for grasping a large range of unknown objects remains relatively unexplored. This seems in part due to the complexity involved with the design and fabrication of various materials comprising the grasper as well as actuators used to enable grasping. This paper introduces the design of a suction cup that is “self-selecting.” In other words, the suction cups comprising the grasper do not exert any suction force when the cup(s) are not in contact with the object, but instead exert a suction force only when they are in physical contact with the object. Since grasping is achieved purely by passive means, the cost and weight associated with individual sensors, valves, and/or actuators are essentially eliminated. Furthermore, the design permits the use of a central vacuum pump, thereby maximizing the suction force on an object and enabling some suction on surfaces that may prohibit tight seals. This paper presents the design, analysis, fabrication, and experimental results of such a “self-selecting” suction cup array.
