As distributed systems of computers play an increasingly important role in society, it will be necessary to consider ways in which these machines can be made to interact effectively. Especially when the interacting machines have been independently designed, it is essential that the interaction environment be conducive to the aims of their designers. These designers might, for example, wish their machines to behave efficiently, and with a minimum of overhead required by the coordination mechanism itself. The rules of interaction should satisfy these needs, and others. Formal tools and analysis can help in the appropriate design of these rules. 
 
We here consider how concepts from fields such as decision theory and game theory can provide standards to be used in the design of appropriate negotiation and interaction environments. This design is highly sensitive to the domain in which the interaction is taking place. Different interaction mechanisms are suitable for different domains, if attributes like efficiency and stability are to be maintained.
