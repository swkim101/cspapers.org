This work presents a low-cost wireless system design that serves as an interface to support the SoC with contactless testability feature. The communication hierarchy includes PHY, MAC, data exchange, and test wrapper functions. The wireless does not require external antennae and crystal reference, and therefore minimize the setup cost. The embedded all-digital timing generation achieves robust performance in the noisy environment. The whole wireless system occupies a small area. In a 0.18Âµm device-under-test, the active area of wireless front-end is 0.14mm2 and the gate count for digital processing is 112K. The maximum energy efficiency for uplink is 1.1nJ/bit and for downlink is 2.9nJ/bit when the wireless distance is set around 1cm. The prototype system includes test equipment and an SoC as the device-under-test. The SoC integrating logic, memory, and analog plug-in modules can be contactlessly tested. It is a low-cost platform controlled by a simple hand-held computer.
