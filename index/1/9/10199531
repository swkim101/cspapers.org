Project-based learning (PjBL) is a promising approach for supporting learning of computer programming by addressing the gap between the attainment of abstract knowledge and the application of this knowledge to authentic programming tasks. The World Wide Web has considerable potential to expand and improve PjBL environments. However, making implicit aspects of a programming task accessible to learners and instructors to support reflection and improvement can be challenging. This paper discusses the challenge of PjBL in programming education and outlines a set of key aspects and an analysis framework to inform design and analysis of PjBL programming in web-based environments, by exploiting the emerging field of Teaching and Learning Analytics. Based on the proposed analysis framework, the design of an empirical study is outlined, capitalizing on a novel web-based PjBL environment that makes complex cognitive processes accessible and affords the analysis of its effects on learning programming in multiple aspects.
