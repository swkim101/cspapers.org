While there is increasing interest in automatically recognizing the argumentative structure of a text, recognizing the argumentative purpose of revisions to such texts has been less explored. Furthermore, existing revision clas-siﬁcation approaches typically ignore contextual information. We propose two approaches for utilizing contextual information when predicting argumentative revision purposes: developing contextual features for use in the classiﬁcation paradigm of prior work, and transforming the classiﬁcation problem to a sequence labeling task. Experimental results using two corpora of student essays demonstrate the utility of contextual information for predicting argumentative revision purposes.
