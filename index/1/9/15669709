We presented a new learning approach to the application of service robots, which is based on learning by imitation. Service robots need to increase their set of actions, which would lead to the ability of adapting their behaviours. In contrast with traditional learning approaches learning by imitation presents considerable advantages; equip robots with the abilities to be efficient in applications requiring human interaction. The paper offers our experiences with the first stage of our approach. Experimental results show the feasibility of such an approach.
