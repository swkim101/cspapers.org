ions in RBE and the WYSIWIG process of programming starting from an example. Rendering By Example Rendering By Example (RBE) was proposed in [KZ95] as a declarative language to express a rendering of data, where a rendering is defined as a presentation of data with subsequent browsing and interaction semantics. A rendering of data consists of a set of screen widgets populated with data. Such rendering applications allow the browsing and interaction with the data in ways specific to that application. These application-specific rendering applications facilitate the user to find and assimilate the data. Rendering of data is widely used in most applications that have a GUI interface and therefore is not a new concept. But the novelty here is the process of constructing such rendering applications. Traditional programming using a state of the art GUI builder would require the following steps.
