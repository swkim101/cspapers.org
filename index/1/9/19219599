Domain adaptation propagates the knowledge from a source domain with rich information to the target domain. In reality, the source and target domains are mostly unbalanced in that the source domain is more resource-rich and thus has more reliable knowledge than the target domain. However, existing deep domain adaptation approaches often pre-assume the source and target domains balanced and equally, leading to a medium solution between the source and target domains, which is not optimal for the unbalanced domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Asymmetric Transfer Network (DATN) to address the problem of unbalanced domain adaptation. Specifically, our model will learn a transfer function from the target domain to the source domain and meanwhile adapting the source domain classifier with more discriminative power to the target domain. By doing this, the deep model is able to adaptively put more emphasis on the resource-rich source domain. To alleviate the scarcity problem of supervised data, we further propose an unsupervised transfer method to propagate the knowledge from a lot of unsupervised data by minimizing the distribution discrepancy over the unlabeled data of two domains. The experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DATN attains a substantial gain over state-of-the-art methods.
