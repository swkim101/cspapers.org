This paper deals with a synthesis of the activities of the French FEMTO-ST institute in the field of robotic microassembly. It deals with the tridimensional assembly of objects whose typical size is from 10 microns to 400 microns. We are especially focusing on the automation of micro-assembly based on several principles. Closed loop control based on microvision has been studied and applied on the fully automatic assembly of several 400 microns objects. Force control has been also analyzed and is proposed for optical Microsystems assembly. At least, open loop trajectories of 40 microns objects with a throughput of 1800 unit per hour have been achieved. Scientific and technological aspects and industrial relevance will be presented.
