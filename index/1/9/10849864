The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a network of communication between people-to-people, people-to-things and things-to-things. The security of these communications against all possible attacks is a significant part of todays security and privacy. Due to the design nature of IoT systems, IoT devices are easily accessible by attackers which increases the importance of their security against physical attacks. This workshop is dedicated to research on the design of cryptographic algorithms and implementations secure against physical attacks.
