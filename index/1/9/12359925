We propose an approach to incorporating dynamic models into the human body tracking process that yields full 3D reconstructions from monocular sequences. We formulate the tracking problem in terms of minimizing a differentiable criterion whose differential structure is rich enough for successful optimization using a simple hill-climbing approach as opposed to a multihypotheses probabilistic one. In other words, we avoid the computational complexity of multihypotheses algorithms while obtaining excellent results under challenging conditions. To demonstrate this, we focus on monocular tracking of a golf swing from ordinary video. It involves both dealing with potentially very different swing styles, recovering arm motions that are perpendicular to the camera plane and handling strong self-occlusions.
