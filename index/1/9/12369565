This paper presents a novel customer malling behavior modeling framework for an urban shopping mall. As an automated computing framework using smartphones, it is designed to provide comprehensive understanding of customer behavior. We prototype the framework in a real-world urban shopping mall. Development consists of three steps; customer data collection, customer trace extraction, and behavior model analysis. We extract customer traces from a collection of 701-hour sensor data from 195 in-situ customers who installed our logging application at Android Market. The practical behavior model is created from the real traces. It has a multi-level structure to provide the holistic understanding of customer behavior from physical movement to service semantics. As far as we know, it is the first work to understand complex customer malling behavior in offline shopping malls.
