This paper describes an algorithm that allows a number of 64 Kbps ISDN circuits running between the same pair of subscribers to be aggregated into a single wideband circuit. The algorithm permits flexible aggregation in the sense that the bandwidth of the wideband circuit may be changed by the addition or removal of 64 Kbps circuits without disturbing the flow of data on the wideband channel. The paper also describes an implementation of this algorithm in an apparatus that interfaces a LAN to a primary rate ISDN interface. This interface is built using an array of transputers, and can achieve high utilization of the bandwidth available on the primary rate channel.
