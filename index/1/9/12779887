Detecting and interpreting contacts is a crucial aspect of physical Human-Robot Interaction. In order to discriminate between intended and unintended contact types, we derive a set of linear and non-linear features based on physical contact model insights and from observing real impact data that may even rely on proprioceptive sensation only. We implement a classification system with a standard non-linear Support Vector Machine and show empirically both in simulations and on a real robot the high accuracy in off- as well as on-line settings of the system. We argue that these successful results are based on our feature design derived from first principles.
