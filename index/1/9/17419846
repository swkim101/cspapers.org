It is well known that the rolling shutter effect in images captured with a moving rolling shutter camera causes inaccuracies to 3D reconstructions. The problem is further aggravated with weak visual connectivity from wide baseline images captured with a fast moving camera. In this paper, we propose and implement a pipeline for sparse to dense 3D construction with wide baseline images captured from a fast moving rolling shutter camera. Specifically, we propose a cost function for Bundle Adjustment (BA) that models the rolling shutter effect, incorporates GPS/INS readings, and enforces pairwise smoothness between neighboring poses. We optimize over the 3D structures, camera poses and velocities. We also introduce a novel interpolation scheme for the rolling shutter plane sweep stereo algorithm that allows us to achieve a 7Ã— speed up in the depth map computations for dense reconstruction without losing accuracy. We evaluate our proposed pipeline over a 2.6km image sequence captured with a rolling shutter camera mounted on a moving car.
