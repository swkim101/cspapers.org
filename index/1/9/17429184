A compact, extended life, gas laser comprises a capillary tube with a transition portion having a reduced wall thickness. The laser includes a cathode which is cylindrical in a rearward cathode region and hemispherical in a forward cathode region. The configuration of the capillary tube and the cathode cooperate to inhibit short circuiting of the bore to cathode discharge path and thereby extend the life of the laser.
