This paper describes a chat room application suitable for teaching basic network programming and security protocols. A client/server design illustrates the structure of current scalable network services while a multicast version demonstrates the need for efficient simultaneous distribution of network content to multiple receivers (e.g., as required by video broadcasts). The system also includes implementations of two security protocols, one similar to Kerberos and another based on public key encryption.
