Design at 45nm technologies and below is a risky proposition because of the many design challenges involved: variability, leakage, verification complexity, poor analog device performance, etc. In this panel, experienced designers coming from different backgrounds talk about how they have overcome some of the design and CAD challenges in 45nm, what CAD challenges still exist and how the CAD community can help.
