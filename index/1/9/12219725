During the 1983-84 academic year, the University of Scranton instituted an experimental two semester discrete mathematics course for freshman students majoring in computer science. Approximately one-third of them were enrolled in this sequence while the remaining freshmen were enrolled in a traditional algebra-calculus mathematics sequence. At the end of the academic year the records of the freshman computer science majors were examined to see if there was any difference in performance between those who took discrete mathematics and those who did not.
There is a strong indication that students who take discrete mathematics make higher grades in computer science than do the students who take the algebra-calculus sequence of courses. There is no indication that students who take discrete mathematics are more (or less) likely to change majors during the freshman year than those who take a traditional mathematics course.
