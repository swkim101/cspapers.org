INTRODUCTION Various groups concerned about the quality of computer progr armrting instruction have attempted to define what preparation a teacher of computer programming should have. Professional societies formed several task forces which recommended programs of study; several states have developed standards for certification in teaching computer courses; and colleges/universities have designed programs of study for preparing computer teachers. These programs, however, vary greatly in conteng amount of required coursework, and rigor. Most computer programming teachers still come from the ranks of inservice teachers and there is ongoing concern on how to prepare thk type of teacher to teach prograrnrning as well as problem solving.
