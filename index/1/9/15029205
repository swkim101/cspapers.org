Heterogeneous multiprocessor SoCs (MPSoCs) are becoming very complex with greater demands for performance and low power. Advanced hardware techniques and involved software programming (>1000 registers) are employed to attain low/ultra-low power. Power management (PM) software development time is high. It is made worse with heavy rework when migrating across SoCs. In this paper we propose techniques to create a re-target-able software PM framework, independent of OS or file system, with auto-generated databases containing registers, clock tree and device power attributes from SoC IP-XACT specifications. These techniques helped achieve 90% reduction in migration time on Texas Instrument's automotive and industrial MPSoCs.
