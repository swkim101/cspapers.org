Abstract : Previous multi-document relationship extraction and fusion research has focused on single relationships. Shifting the focus to multiple relationships allows for the use of mutual constraints to aid extraction. This paper presents a fusion method which uses a probabilistic database model to pick relationships which violate few constraints. This model allows improved performance on constructing corporate succession timelines from multiple documents with respect to a multi-document fusion baseline.
