We report the development of a multi-modal, flexible tactile sensing skin based on polymer substrates and integrated micromachining technology with increased mechanical robustness relative to silicon tactile devices. This polymer-based tactile skin is very unique because it includes the following sensing modalities beyond surface roughness and contact force measurement: thermal conductivity, hardness, temperature, and its own curvature. These new modalities allow the demonstrated tactile sensors to characterize an object or a contact event in a more comprehensive fashion. Sensing is accomplished via thin film metal gold heaters, nickel RTD's (Resistance Temperature Device), and NiCr (nichrome) strain gauges. Experimental characterization of the sensors' performance and potential for application to robotics are presented.
