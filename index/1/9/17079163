We study a new type of graph queries, which injectively maps its edges to paths of the graphs in a given database, where the length of each path is constrained by a given threshold specified by the weight of the corresponding matching edge. We give important applications of the new graph query and identify new challenges of processing such a query. Then, we devise the cost model of the branch-and-bound algorithm framework for processing the graph query, and propose an efficient algorithm to minimize the cost overhead. We also develop three indexing techniques to efficiently answer the queries online. Finally, we verify the efficiency of our proposed indexes with extensive experiments on large real and synthetic datasets.
