This paper presents the architecture of a parallel computer called a pyramid machine. The system consists of a pyramidal array of processing elements, each of which executes the instructions broadcast by a controller. Each processing element except those on the outside of the array is directly connected to thirteen neighboring elements: eight on the same level, four on the next finer level and one on the next coarser level. The architecture combines features of tree machines and features of mesh-connected parallel computers. As a result it is able to rapidly perform computations of local and global processing. The main areas of application are image processing, graphics and spatial problem solving. The motivation, basic structure, and applications of the system are discussed.
