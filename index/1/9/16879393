Experience with the Manchester Dataflow Machine has highlighted the importance of efficient handling of stored data structures in a practical parallel machine. It has proved necessary to add a special-purpose structure store to the machine, and this paper describes the role of this structure store and the software which uses it. Some key issues in data structure handling for parallel machines are raised.
