We present an approach to view-based mobile robot localization using a X-slits image based rendering (IBR) method for creating novel views from a set of input images. The input images are acquired by a non-central catadioptric sensor mounted on a robot moving on a straight line. We propose to use the IBR for column ordering only, where occlusions in the horizontal direction are modeled and the sensor can be non-central. For the column matching between a query view at an unknown position and virtual views created by IBR, we use correlation of columns.
