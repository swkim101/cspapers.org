A general stability result for force-reflecting tele-operator systems with projection-based force reflection algorithms is established. It is shown that the closed-loop system's gain can be assigned arbitrarily by an appropriate choice of certain weighting function of the projection-based force reflection algorithm. In particular, this allows to achieve stability of the force-reflecting teleoperator system in presence of time-varying irregular delays for arbitrarily large force-reflecting gain and arbitrarily low damping and stiffness of the master. The proposed approach solves, to some extent, the trade-off between stability, manoeuvrability, and high force reflection gain in force-reflecting teleoperator system with network-induced communication constraints.
