This paper deals with the further development of the tube crawling robot "MORITZ", which was built at the Technical University of Munich. This robot can climb through pipes of different inclinations. It is improved in the recent research project, so that it also can manage tube junctions. After a brief introduction about problems concerning such a robot the used gait pattern is explained. Additionally some simulation results-showing the load at the robot during a motion through a tube crossing-are presented. Moreover the new developed joints in the central body as well as the sensors are described. The paper ends with a brief description of the crawler's control and its modifications for the new climbing maneuver in tube crossings.
