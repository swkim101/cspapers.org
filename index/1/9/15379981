A simple nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed for global finite-time regulation of robot manipulators without velocity measurements. A Lyapunov-based stability argument is employ to prove global finite-time stabilization. The proposed control algorithm does not involve the model parameters in the control law formulation and the control gains can be explicitly determined based on some well-known bounds extracted from the robot dynamics, and thus permits easy implementation. Simulations are included to demonstrate the expected properties of the proposed approach.
