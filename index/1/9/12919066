This paper presents the (cid:12)rst entropy estimator for DNA sequences that has both proven properties and excellent entropy estimates. Additionally our algorithm, the Grammar Transform Analysis and Compression (GTAC) entropy estimator, uses a novel data structure to repeatedly solve the longest non-overlapping pattern problem in linear time. GTAC beats all known competitors in running time, in the low values of its entropy estimates, and in the properties that have been proven about it.
