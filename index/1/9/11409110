Database programming languages provide powerful telationai structures and operators based on, for exampb, first-order predicate calculus. Language Constructs for database programming, including a tmnsaction concepC requite thsrefofâ€™e a predttteorbnted approach to con~m~lcy c~ntrool. A predicative optimistic concunency control is presented that attacks problems inhefwt in predtcate locking. Oniy those conflicts that achrally occurred between tnurractions Srs detected, and well-known query evaluation algorithms en9 applied instead of algorithms testing the diijointneas of certain m&icted cbsses of pmdiites. For that reason, this approach is an elegant solution to the phantom problem.
