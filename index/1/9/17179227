I. In troduc t ion Irreducible polynomials in Fp[X] are used to carry out the arithmetic in field extension of Fp. Computations in such extensions occur in coding theory [2], complexity theory [8] and cryptography [3] . Random polynomial time algorithms exist for finding irreducible polynomials of any degree over Fp [2, 8], and so as a practical matter the problem is solved. However, the deterministic complexity of the problem has yet to be established.
