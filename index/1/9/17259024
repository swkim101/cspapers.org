The BB1 blackboard control architecture has been proposed to enable systems to integrate diverse reasoning methods to control their own actions. Previous work has shown BB1's ability to integrate hierarchical planning and opportunistic focusing. We show how it can integrate goal-directed reasoning as well and demonstrate these capabilities in the PROTEAN system. We also compare BB1 with alternative control architectures.
