Web archives already hold more than 282 billion documents and users demand full-text search to explore this historical information. This survey provides an overview of web archive search architectures designed for time-travel search, i.e. full-text search on the web within a user-specified time interval. Performance, scalability and ease of management are important aspects to take in consideration when choosing a system architecture. We compare these aspects and initialize the discussion of which search architecture is more suitable for a large-scale web archive.
