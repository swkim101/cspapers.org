This paper describes the KomParse system, a natural-language dialog system in the three-dimensional virtual world Twinity. In order to fulfill the various communication demands between nonplayer characters (NPCs) and users in such an online virtual world, the system realizes a flexible and hybrid approach combining knowledge-intensive domain-specific question answering, task-specific and domain-specific dialog with robust chatbot-like chitchat.
