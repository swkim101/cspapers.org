Semantic soccer video analysis has attracted more and more attention recently. In this paper, we present a football event detection method by using multiple feature extraction and fusion. Instead of using low-level features, the proposed method is built upon visual, auditory features, text and audio keywords. Promising event detection results have been achieved. By using the proposed method, we have been able to detect the football events accurately. Experimental results have shown our proposed method is effective for football event detection.
