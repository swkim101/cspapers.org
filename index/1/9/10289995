Research within the laboratory is coordinated around the construction of integrated interface design environments and the exploration of new interaction and collaboration mechanisms. Our vision is to evolve a set of integrated human interface tools (HITS) into a general user interface design environment (GUIDE) with increasing support for the overall process of interface design. HITS and GUIDE are experimental vehicles for grounding, motivating, and coordinating our scientific and technological efforts. They are intended to serve as prototypes supporting the rapid implementation, exploration, and demonstration of new human interface concepts.
