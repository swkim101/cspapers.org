We conducted a series of experiments in which surveyed web search users answered questions about the quality of search results on the basis of the result summaries. Summaries shown to different groups of users were editorially constructed so that they differed in only one attribute, such as length. Some attributes had no effect on users' quality judgments, while in other cases, changing an attribute had a "halo effect" which caused seemingly unrelated dimensions of result quality to be rated higher by users.
