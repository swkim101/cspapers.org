Labeling image collections is a tedious task, especially when multiple labels have to be chosen for each image. In this paper we introduce a new framework that extends state of the art models in word prediction to incorporate information from unlabeled examples, using manifold regularization. To the best of our knowledge this is the first semi-supervised multi-task model used in vision problems. The new model can be solved using gradient descent and is fast and efficient. We show remarkable improvements for cases with few labeled examples for challenging multi-task learning problems in vision (predicting words for images and attributes for objects).
