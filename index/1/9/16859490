In this demo, we propose a proof-of-concept networking system for smart glasses, through which users can express their interest and connect to a target simply by a gaze. Our system iGaze is a visual attention driven networking suite: an iGaze glass (hardware) and a networking protocol VAN (software). Our glass is a low-cost head-mounted glass with a camera, orientation sensors, microphone and speakers, which are embedded with our software for visual attention capture and networking. A visual attention driven networking protocol (VAN) is carefully designed and implemented. In VAN, we design an energy efficient and highly accurate visual attention determination scheme using single camera to capture user's communication interest and a double-matching scheme based on visual direction detection and Doppler effect of acoustic signal to lock the target devices. iGaze has separated and modularized hardware and software design. It can run on top of existing networking protocols, e.g., Wi-Fi.
