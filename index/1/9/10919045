A problem with most text production and language generation systems is that they tend to become rather verbose. This may be due to neglection of the pragmatic factors involved in communication. In this paper, a text production system, COMMENTATOR, is described and taken as a starting point for a more general discussion of some problems in Computational Pragmatics. A new line of research is suggested, based on the concept of unification.
