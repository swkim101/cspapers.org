We propose a deterministic fault-tolerant and deadlock-free routing protocol in 2-dimensional (2-D) meshes based on dimension-order routing and the recently proposed odd-even turn model. The proposed protocol, called extended X-Y routing, does not use any virtual channels by prohibiting certain locations of faults and destinations. Faults are contained in a set of disjointed rectangular regions called faulty blocks. The number of faults to be tolerated is unbounded as long as nodes outside faulty blocks are connected in the mesh network. The extended X-Y routing can also be used under a special convex fault region called orthogonal faulty block, which can be derived from a given faulty block by activating some nonfaulty nodes in the block. Extensions to partial adaptive routing, traffic- and adaptivity-balanced using virtual networks, and routing without constraints using virtual channels and virtual networks are also discussed.
