We consider the average case behavior of onedmensional bin paekmg algorithms in the case where bins have unit capacity and item sizes are chosen according to the ‘ ‘dficrete uniform” distribution U~; k), 1 s j < k, where each item size in the set {llk,21k,..., ji k) has probability 1/j of beiig chosen. Note that for fixed j,k the distributions U{?nj;mk]’ approach the continuous distribution U(O, jlk] as m A W, where in U(O, jl k] the item sizes are chosen uniformly horn the half-open interval (O,jik]. In this paper, we show that average case behavior can differ substantially under the two types of distributions. We show that for all j, k, j < k-1, there exist on-line algorithms that have constant expected waste under U~; k], whereas no on-line algorithm can have less than C2(n1’2) waste under U(O, U] for any u s 1. Conmariwise, although the First Fit Decreasing (off-line) algorithm has constant expected waste under U(O, u] for all u < 1/2, there are many combinations j,k with j < k/2 such that First Fit Decreasing has t3(tI) expected waste under U(j;k). The constant of proportionality is maxtilzed for j = 6 and k = 13, in which case the expected waste k nl 624.
