The octree representation has been recently proposed as a tool for collision detection purposes. Nevertheless, the applications described only involve using an octree to model the -environment, but not the robot or other moving bodies. This situation is due to the relatively high cost of the octree rotation algorithms. In this paper, we present a method based on the simultaneous traversal of the environment tree and the octree of the mobile. This technique allows considerable savings in the number of nodes computed and leads to an efficient method for collision detection.
