In this paper we introduce tag expression, a novel form of preference elicitation that combines elements from tagging and rating systems. Tag expression enables users to apply affect to tags to indicate whether the tag describes a reason they like, dislike, or are neutral about a particular item. We present a user interface for applying affect to tags, as well as a technique for visualizing the overall community's affect. By analyzing 27,773 tag expressions from 553 users entered in a 3-month period, we empirically evaluate our design choices. We also present results of a survey of 97 users that explores users' motivations in tagging and measures user satisfaction with tag expression.
