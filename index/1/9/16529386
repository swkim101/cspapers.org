A new class of interconnection networks is proposed for processor to memory communication in multiprocessing systems. These networks allow a direct link between any processor to any memory module. The cost of these networks is considerably less than that of full crossbars. Moreover, the design and control of these networks is simple. The proposed networks and the full crossbars are analyzed with respect to the bandwidth and the cost.
