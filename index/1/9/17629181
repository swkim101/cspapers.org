The difficulties ordinarily experienced in designing and developing large software systems are greatly increased in the case of distributed data processing (DDP) systems. Thus there is an urgent need to support the software life cycle activities with effective prototyping tools and techniques. The Architecture Development System (ADS) is being developed for use in prototyping DDP systems within a distributed testbed. ADS features an interactive graphical user interface, a distributed runtime environment, and a prototyping framework based on the concept of abstract DDP objects with attributes and relationships. This paper presents the ADS prototyping features and the user interface to describe, synthesize, execute and analyze system representations. Then a discussion is presented of the applicability of ADS support to the distributed software life cycle. The current implementation status of ADS is also summarized.
