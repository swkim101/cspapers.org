In this paper we present the design and implementation of the xorbac component that provides a flexible RBAC service. The xorbac, implementation conforms to level 4a of the unified NIST model for RBAC and can be reused for arbitrary applications on Unix or Windows with a C or Tcl linkage. xorbac runtime elements can be serialized and recreated from RDF data models conforming to a well-defined RDF schema. Furthermore we present our experiences with xorbac for the deployment within the HTTP environment for a web-based mobile code system.
