In this pape r two methods of specification of program transformations a r e discussed: pattern replacement rules and procedural rules. Pattern replacement rules, as more readable, are used to describe various applications of program transformations. Four areas of application of program transformations in an instructional environment are identified: (I) indentation transformations, (2) equivalent transformations within the same language, (3) non-equivalent transformations within the same language, and (q) program translation. Examples of these transformations for general purlx)se programming languages, such as Pascal and Data Manipulation Languages, such as SOL are given, and the corresponding transformation rules are provided. The CAI system using general program transformation techniques is discussed.
