During social interaction, humans extract important information from tactile stimuli that improves their understanding of the interaction. The development of a similar capacity in a robot will contribute to the future success of intuitive human-robot interaction. This paper presents a method of touch sensing based on the principle of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) that can be used to implement a large, flexible and stretchable artificial sensitive skin for robots. A classifier based on the “LogitBoost” algorithm is used to classify the modality of six different types of touch on an experimental EIT-based skin. Experiments showed that the modality of touch was correctly classified in approximately 80% of the trials. This is comparable with the experimental accuracy of a human touch recipient. The classification accuracies show significant improvements from previous classification algorithms applied to different artificial sensitive skins.
