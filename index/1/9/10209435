Many underwater monitoring tasks, such as submarine life studies and pipeline inspections, are usually performed manually. Automated underwater monitoring has the potential to increase safety, improve timeliness, and decrease costs. We propose a hybrid solution of stationary sensor buoys and swarms of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and report on our current progress of its realization. Our solution is based on sensor network technology and a small mobile underwater robot developed in our institute.
