This paper is concerned with the problem of heterogeneous dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a novel joint inference scheme, which is able to leverage the consensus information between heterogeneous treebanks in the parsing phase. Different from stacked learning methods (Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins et al., 2008), which process the dependency parsing in a pipelined way (e.g., a second level uses the first level outputs), in our method, multiple dependency parsing models are coordinated to exchange consensus information. We conduct experiments on Chinese Dependency Treebank (CDT)and Penn Chinese Treebank(CTB), experimental results show that joint inference can bring significant improvements to all state-of-the-art dependency parsers.
