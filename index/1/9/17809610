This paper describes a vision-based technique for the detection of moving objects by a moving airborne vehicle. The technique, which is based on measurement of optic flow, computes the egomotion of the aircraft based on the pattern of optic flow in a panoramic image, then determines the component of this optic flow pattern that is generated by the aircraft's translation, and finally detects the moving object by determining whether the direction of the flow generated by the object is different from that expected for translation in a stationary environment. The performance of the technique is evaluated in field tests using an aerial rotorcraft.
