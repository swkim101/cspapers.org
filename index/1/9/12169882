The view is adopted that software requirements involve the representation (modeling) of considerable real-world knowledge, not just functional specifications. A framework (RMF) for requirements models is presented and its main features are illustrated. RMF allows information about three types of conceptual entities (objects, activities, and assertions) to be recorded uniformly using the notion of properties. By grouping all entities into classes or metaclasses, and by organizing classes into generalization (specialization) hierarchies, RMF supports three abstraction principles (classification, aggregation, and generalization) which appear to be of universal importance in the development and organization of complex descriptions. Finally, by providing a mathematical model underlying our terminology, we achieve both unambiguity and the potential to verify consistency of the model.
