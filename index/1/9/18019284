Several topics of theoretical and practical importance to the field of translator writing systems are presented in this paper. These are (1). implementation of generalized syntax-directed transduction (GSDT) on a finite-state tree transducer; (2). implementation of GSDT on a tree-walking pushdown store transducer; (3). transformation of the context-free grammar underlying a GSDT and the resulting transformation of the transduction elements of that GSDT; (4). tree transduction of parse trees between equivalent context-free grammars.
