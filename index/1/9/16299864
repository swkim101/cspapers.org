In artificial intelligence and pervasive computing research, inferring users' high-level goals from activity sequences is an important task. A major challenge in goal recognition is that users often pursue several high-level goals in a concurrent and interleaving manner, where the pursuit of goals may spread over different parts of an activity sequence and may be pursued in parallel. Existing approaches to recognizing multiple goals often formulate this problem either as a single-goal recognition problem or in a deterministic way, ignoring uncertainty. In this paper, we propose CIGAR (Concurrent and Interleaving Goal and Activity Recognition) - a novel and simple two-level probabilistic framework for multiple-goal recognition where we can recognize both concurrent and interleaving goals. We use skip-chain conditional random fields (SCCRF) for modeling interleaving goals and we model concurrent goals by adjusting inferred probabilities through a correlation graph, which is a major advantage in that we are able to reason about goal interactions explicitly through the correlation graph. The two-level framework also avoids the high training complexity when modeling concurrency and interleaving together in a unified CRF model. Experimental results show that our method can effectively improve recognition accuracies on several real-world datasets collected from various wireless and sensor networks.
