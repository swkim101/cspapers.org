This paper proposes a novel method of occupancy map building for large-scale applications. Although Gaussian processes have been successfully applied to occupancy map building, it suers from high computational complexity of O(n 3 ), where n is the number of training data, limiting its use for large-scale mappings. We propose to take a divide-and-conquer approach by partitioning training data into manageable subsets by combining a Dirichlet process mixture on top of a Gaussian process, which turns into an innite mixtures of Gaussian process experts. Experimental results with simulated data show that our method produces accurate occupancy maps while maintaining the scalability.
