We consider the class \( \sum^{k}_{3} \) of unbounded fan-in depth three Boolean circuits, for which the bottom fan-in is limited by k and the top gate is an OR. It is known that the smallest such circuit computing the parity function has \( \Omega(2^{\varepsilon n/k}) \) gates (for k = O(n1/2)) for some \( \varepsilon > 0 \), and this was the best lower bound known for explicit (P-time computable) functions. In this paper, for k = 2, we exhibit functions in uniform NC1 that require \( 2^{n-o(n)} \) size depth 3 circuits. The main tool is a theorem that shows that any \( \sum {2\over3} \) circuit on n variables that accepts a inputs and has size s must be constant on a projection (subset defined by equations of the form xi = 0, xi = 1, xi = xj or xi = \( \bar{x}_i \)) of dimension at least log(a/s)log n.
