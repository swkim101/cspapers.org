Sliceable floorplans attain nice properties. In particular, a number of NP-hard problems can be solved efficiently on sliceable floorplans. Most floorplanning algorithms/packages do not produce sliceable floorplans; besides, there are adjacency requirements that are inherently non-sliceable. Motivated by that, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for transforming an arbitrary floorplan into a sliceable one. We operate on a given sized floorplan to transform it into a sliceable one. Experimental results show that on industrial benchmarks the area increase, enforcing sliceability, is 6% on the average. The percentage of changes in the input adjacency graph (i.e., number of edge detention-addition divided by the total number of edges) is 7% on the average. The proposed algorithm can serve as a post-processor for other floor-planning algorithms. The proposed technique also provides new insights into the class of sliceable floorplans.
