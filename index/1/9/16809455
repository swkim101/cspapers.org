Multi-label data with high dimensionality arise frequently in data mining and machine learning. It is not only time consuming but also computationally unreliable when we use high-dimensional data directly. Supervised dimensionality reduction approaches are based on the assumption that there are large amounts of labeled data. It is infeasible to label a large number of training samples in practice especially in multi-label learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, namely Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Dimensionality Reduction (SSMLDR), which can utilize the information from both labeled data and unlabeled data in an effective way. First, the proposed algorithm enlarges the multi-label information from the labeled data to the unlabeled data through a special designed label propagation method. It then learns a transformation matrix to perform dimensionality reduction by incorporating the enlarged multi-label information. Extensive experiments on a broad range of datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach against other well-established algorithms.
