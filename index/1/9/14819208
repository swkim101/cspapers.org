We propose ring authentication in unconditionally secure setting. In a ring authentication system a sender can choose a set of users and construct an authenticated message for a receiver such that the receiver can verify authenticity of the message with respect to the user group chosen by the real sender. The sender will be unconditionally secure even if the receiver has corrupted up to c users and has access to up to â„“ past messages in the system. This functionality is similar to the one provided by ring signature systems with the difference that protection is against an adversary with unlimited power. (This also implies that the verification is not public and is by group members.) In ring signatures an adversary with unlimited computational power can always forge signed messages attributing them to groups of his choice. In our proposed systems the success chance of the adversary can be reduced to the required security of the system. We define model, propose a generic construction whose security is reduced to the security of its building blocks, and give concrete examples of this construction. The construction can also be used in computational setting resulting in ring authentication systems without public key cryptography.
