Document summarization is an important research issue and has attracted much attention from the academe. The approaches for document summarization can be classified as extractive and abstractive. In this work, we introduce an effective joint framework that integrates extractive and abstractive summarization models, which is much closer to the way human write summaries (first underlining important information). Preliminary experiments on real benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.
