A formal model of multilevel security systems is presented. We examine weaknesses of current security flow analysis mechanisms. A concept of expression flows is introduced, which allows us to use various techniques to certify systems that cannot be certified using current flow analysis techniques. We provide a method for generating static authorization requirements for systems in which authorization functions are only partially specified. We also attack the problem of using dynamic authorization functions for system certification.
