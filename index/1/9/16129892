This paper describes the implementation of MiniJava, a teaching-oriented programming language closely based on the Java language developed by Sun Microsystems [6]. The core of the MiniJava environment is a restricted subset of the standard Java release and is designed to reduce the intimidation factor introductory students experience when they encounter a system as large as the Java environment. The paper outlines the particular restrictions and extensions that define MiniJava along with pedagogical justifications for each.
