In this poster we present a CS curriculum aimed at "middle-years" students. In the U.S., this corresponds roughly to students aged 11-15. This MyCS curriculum provides a hands-on introduction to computer science through six distinct modules. Three programming modules use the Scratch environment to build computational sophistication and procedural intuition within an inviting development environment. Alternating with Scratch are three problem-solving modules whose activities deepen awareness and facility with computation through novel exercises. More than 25 classrooms and 900 students have participated in MyCS's pilot years within the Pomona, CA and Lihue, HI school districts. 2013-15 will see an expansion of its workshops, academic-year classes, and program evaluation. Course materials will be served by the OpenEdX platform both at HMC and on Amazon EC2. This poster shares our development and deployment of MyCS to date, and invites feedback from other institutions in their efforts to foster adolescents' computational identities.
