This paper discusses an online dynamic motion generation scheme for nonprehensile object manipulation by using a set of predefined motions and a trajectory deformation algorithm capable of incorporating positional and velocity boundary constraints. By creating optimal trajectories offline and deforming them online, computational complexity during execution is reduced considerably. As tight convex hulls of the deformed trajectories can be found, possible obstacles or workspace boundaries can be circumnavigated precisely without collision. The approach is verified through experiments on an inclined planar air-table for volleyball scenario using two 3-DoF robots.
