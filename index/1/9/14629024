Interesting program properties other than functional correctness can be addressed and proved using axiomatic logic. An information flow logic that defines the flow semantics of a parallel programming language is presented. Proofs in this logic can be used to certify programs with respect to information security policies. The flow logic can also be combined with correctness logics to form an even more powerful deductive system.
