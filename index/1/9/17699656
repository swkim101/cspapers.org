Queueing theoretic models of single and multi-processor computer systems have received wide attention in the computer science literature. Few of these models consider the effect of finite memory size of a machine and its impact on the memory scheduling problem. In an effort to formulate an analytical model for memory scheduling we propose four simple models and examine their characteristics using simulation. In this paper, we discuss some interesting results of these simulations.
