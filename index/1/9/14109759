Given an undirected graph, finding either a minimum 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph or a minimum 2-vertex-connected (biconnected) spanning subgraph is MaxSNP-hard. We show that for planar graphs, both problems have a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) with running time <i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>(1/ε)</sup>, where <i>n</i> is the graph size and ε is the relative error allowed.When the planar graph has edge costs, we approximately solve the analogous min-cost subgraph problems in time <i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>(γ/ε)</sup>, where γ is the ratio of the total edge cost to the optimum solution cost.
