The design of robot dedicated to person with disabilities necessitate users implication in all steps of product development: design solution, prototyping the system, choice of users interfaces, and testing it with users in real conditions. However, before any design of any system, it is necessary to understand and meet the needs of the disabled users. In this paper, we describe our research activity on the integration of a robotic arm in the environment of disabled people who have lost the abilities to use their proper arms to perform daily living tasks and who are able to use an adapted robot to compensate, even partly, the problems of manipulation of objects in their environments. This paper presents our contribution for designing adaptable, configurable and personalized robot system based on the Manus robot. Some preliminary evaluation results are also presented.
