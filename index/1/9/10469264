. In this paper, we propose a new reversible data hiding method based on canonical signed-digit (CSD) data representation. To increase the data hiding quality, the embedded data is represented by CSD. To embed data efficiently, the original image is divided into smaller blocks and transformed by an invertible integer transform, and then the CSD data are embedded by histogram modification. The invertible integer transform which calculates the mean and difference values of the adjacent pixels exploits the correlations among adjacent pixels in an image region. Based on the histogram of the difference values, we modify the difference values slightly to embed CSD data into the image. The CSD data representation has a minimum number of nonzero digits, thus it can decrease alteration of the pixels after data hiding. It is shown that the proposed reversible data hiding method not only can recover the original image without any distortion from the marked image after the hidden data have been extracted but also can achieve higher data hiding capacity compared with conventional methods.
