This demo presents WiSee, a novel human-computer interaction system that leverages wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi), to enable sensing and recognition of human gestures and motion. Since wire- less signals do not require line-of-sight and can traverse through walls, WiSee enables novel human-computer interfaces for remote device control and building automation. Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We integrate WiSee with applications and demonstrate how WiSee enables users to use gestures and control applications including music players and gaming systems. Specifically, our demo will allow SIGCOMM attendees to control a music player and a lighting control device using gestures.
