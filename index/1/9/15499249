With advances in sensing and positioning technology, fueled by the ubiquitous deployment of wireless networks, location-aware computing has become a fundamental model for offering a wide range of life enhancing services. However, the ability to locate users and mobile objects opens doors for new threats - the intrusion of location privacy. Location anonymization refers to the process of perturbing the exact location of users as a cloaking region such that a user's location becomes indistinguishable from the location of a set of other users. A fundamental limitation of existing location anonymization techniques is that location information once perturbed to provide a certain anonymity level cannot be reversed to reduce anonymity or the degree of perturbation. This is especially a serious limiting factor in multi-level privacy-controlled scenarios where different users of the location information have different levels of access. This paper presents ReverseCloak, a new class of reversible location cloaking mechanisms that effectively support multi-level location privacy, allowing selective de-anonymization of the cloaking region to reduce the granularity of the perturbed location when suitable access credentials are provided. We evaluate the ReverseCloak techniques through extensive experiments on realistic road network traces generated by GTMobiSim. Our experiments show that the proposed techniques are efficient, scalable and provide the required level of privacy.
