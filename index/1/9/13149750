This paper discusses a logic diagram subsystem which has recently been added to a comprehensive design automation system at the Sperry Division of the Sperry Rand Corporation. This step was taken to answer a number of needs that existed in the current system, specifically to simplify the data entry and checking task for large systems, and to capture engineering data at earlier stages of system development. With the addition of the logic diagram subsystem, data is now taken directly from original logic sketches in a single operation.
