Visual occlusion events constitute a major source of depth information. This paper presents a self-organizing neural network that learns to detect, represent, and predict the visibility and invisibility relationships that arise during occlusion events, after a period of exposure to motion sequences containing occlusion and disocclusion events. The network develops two parallel opponent channels or "chains" of lateral excitatory connections for every resolvable motion trajectory. One channel, the "On" chain or "visible" chain, is activated when a moving stimulus is visible. The other channel, the "Off" chain or "invisible" chain, carries a persistent, amodal representation that predicts the motion of a formerly visible stimulus that becomes invisible due to occlusion. The learning rule uses disinhibition from the On chain to trigger learning in the Off chain. The On and Off chain neurons can learn separate associations with object depth ordering. The results are closely related to the recent discovery (Assad & Maunsell, 1995) of neurons in macaque monkey posterior parietal cortex that respond selectively to inferred motion of invisible stimuli.
