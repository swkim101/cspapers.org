Much research on software testing and test techniques relies on experimental studies based on mutation testing. In this paper we reveal that such studies are vulnerable to a potential threat to validity, leading to possible Type I errors; incorrectly rejecting the Null Hypothesis. Our findings indicate that Type I errors occur, for arbitrary experiments that fail to take countermeasures, approximately 62% of the time. Clearly, a Type I error would potentially compromise any scientific conclusion. We show that the problem derives from such studiesâ€™ combined use of both subsuming and subsumed mutants. We collected articles published in the last two years at three leading software engineering conferences. Of those that use mutation-based test assessment, we found that 68% are vulnerable to this threat to validity.
