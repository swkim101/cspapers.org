This paper describes the idea of a wide area information system based entirely on audio information (Audioweb). We address two issues. First, we address the issue of adding hyperaudio links to audio documents non-intrusively (Le., without the need to modify the audio track). By doing so, audio documents can be linked together to form the AudioWeb. Secondly, we show how, based on the audio format discussed previously, a series of interfaces (browsers), that enable the user to navigate a web of audio documents, can be implemented.
