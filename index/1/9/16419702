Distributed memory parallel processors (DMPPs) have no hardware support for a global address space. However, conventional programs written in a sequential imperative language such as Fortran typically manipulate few, large arrays. The Oxygen compiler, developed as part of the K2 project, translates conventional Fortran code, augmented with code and data distribution directives, into C programs including SEND/RECEIVE communication primitives. The compiler directives, which are either supplied by the user, or for simple programs generated automatically, support a global name space through a run-time mechanism called data consistency analysis. We report in this paper the performance of seven parallel programs generated by Oxygen for three DMPPs, namely for a Parsytec Supercluster, an iWARP, and for the Fujitsu AP1000. All machines were configured as 8 x 8 tori.
