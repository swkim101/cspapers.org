We give a general unified method that can be used for L<sub>1</sub> closeness testing of a wide range of univariate structured distribution families. More specifically, we design a sample optimal and computationally efficient algorithm for testing the equivalence of two unknown (potentially arbitrary) univariate distributions under the Ak-distance metric: Given sample access to distributions with density functions p, q : I → R, we want to distinguish between the cases that p = q and ∥p - q∥<sub>Ak</sub> ≥ ∈ with probability at least 2/3. We show that for any k ≥ 2, ∈ > 0, the optimal sample complexity of the Ak-closeness testing problem is Θ(max{k<sup>4/5</sup>/∈<sup>6/5</sup>, k<sup>1/2</sup>/∈<sup>2</sup>}). This is the first o(k) sample algorithm for this problem, and yields new, simple L1 closeness testers, in most cases with optimal sample complexity, for broad classes of structured distributions.
