Most of our daily activities take place in the physical world, which inherently imposes physical constraints. In contrast, the digital world is very flexible, but usually isolated from its physical counterpart. To combine these two realms, many Mixed Reality (MR) techniques have been explored, at different levels in the continuum. In this work we present an integrated Mixed Reality ecosystem that allows users to incrementally transition from pure physical to pure virtual experiences in a unique reality. This system stands on a conceptual framework composed of 6 levels. This paper presents these levels as well as the related interaction techniques.
