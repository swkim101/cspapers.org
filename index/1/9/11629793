This demo presents Noah: a dynamic ridesharing system. Noah supports large scale real-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Taxis and trip requests are dynamically matched. Different from traditional systems, a taxi can have more than one customer on board given that all waiting time and service time constraints of trips are satisfied. Noah's real-time response relies on three main components: (1) a fast shortest path algorithm with caching on road networks; (2) fast dynamic matching algorithms to schedule ridesharing on the fly; (3) a spatial indexing method for fast retrieving moving taxis. Users will be able to submit requests from a smartphone, choose specific parameters such as number of taxis in the system, service constraints, and matching algorithms, to explore the internal functionalities and implementations of Noah. The system analyzer will show the system performance including average waiting time, average detour percentage, average response time, and average level of sharing. Taxis, routes, and requests will be animated and visualized through Google Maps API. The demo is based on trips of 17,000 Shanghai taxis for one day (May 29, 2009); the dataset contains 432,327 trips. Each trip includes the starting and destination coordinates and the start time. An iPhone application is implemented to allow users to submit a trip request to the Noah system during the demonstration.
