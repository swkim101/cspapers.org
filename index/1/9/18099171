There is enormous amount of multilingual documents from various sources and possibly from different countries describing a single event or a set of related events. It is desirable to construct text mining methods that can compare and highlight similarities and differences of those multilingual documents. We discuss our ongoing research that seeks to model a pair of multilingual documents as a weighted bipartite graph with the edge weights computed by means of machine translation. We use spectral method to identify dense subgraphs of the weighted bipartite graph which can be considered as corresponding to sentences that correlate well in textual contents. We illustrate our approach using English and German texts.
