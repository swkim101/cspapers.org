The purpose of our CSIP grant* was to develop an image processing laboratory that could be used in undergraduate courses and for undergraduate research projects. The results from three research projects are presented, The first experiment uses image processing techniques to extract the letters and numbers from license plates. First, a camera-recorder records the license plates on the rear of automobiles. Then, the images are digitized and processed. The processed images yield the correct results in about 90 percent of the licenses examined. The second experiment uses image processing techniques to calculate the acceleration (due to gravity) of a freely falling ball. First, the camcorder observes and records the motion of the falling ball. Then, the recorded images are played back into the computer and digitized. Next, two different programs are written to determine how far the center of the ball has traveled in a fixed amount of time. These programs use background extraction, edge detection, circle fitting algorithms, and Monte Carlo techniques to find the center of the ball. Once the center of the ball is located, the acceleration can be easily calculated. The third experiment uses image processing to calculate the horizontal and vertical velocity, and the pitch angle of an aircraft at touchdown. A program is written to find the position of an aircraft just prior to touchdown. Once this position is known the velocities and pitch angle are calculated.
