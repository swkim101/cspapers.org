Online recruiting systems have gained immense attention in the wake of more and more job seekers searching jobs and enterprises finding candidates on the Internet. A critical problem in a recruiting system is how to maximally satisfy the desires of both job seekers and enterprises with reasonable recommendations or search results. In this paper, we investigate and compare various online recruiting systems from a product perspective. We then point out several key functions that help achieve a win-win situation between job seekers and enterprises for a successful recruiting system. Based on the observations and key functions, we design, implement and deploy a web-based application of recruiting system, named iHR, for Xiamen Talent Service Center. The system utilizes the latest advances in data mining and recommendation technologies to create a user-oriented service for a myriad of audience in job marketing community. Empirical evaluation and online user studies demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed system. Currently, iHR has been deployed at http://i.xmrc.com.cn/XMRCIntel.
