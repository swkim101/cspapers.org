We deal with the competitive analysis of algorithms for managing data in a distributed environment. We deal with the file allocation problem ([C], [DF], [ML]), where copies of a file may be stored in the local storage of some subset of processors, copies may be replicated and discarded over time so as to optimize communication costs, but multiple copies must be kept consistent and at least one copy must be stored somewhere in the network at all times. We deal with competitive algorithms for minimizing communication costs, over arbitrary sequences of reads and writes, and arbitrary network topologies. We define the constrained file allocation problem to be the solution of many individual file allocation problems simultaneously, subject to the constraints of local memory size. We give competitive algorithms for this prblem on uniform networks. We then introduce distributed competitive algorithms for on-line data tracking (a generalization of mobile user tracking [AP1, AP3] to transform our competitive distributed data management algorithms into distributed algorithms themselves.
