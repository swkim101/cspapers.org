Artificial reasoners that represent uncertain knowledge = arguments are useful in the legal domain. A model of argumentation proposed by Toulmin has recently been the basis of a representation of knowledge in the domain of family law in Australia. The Toulmin model has limitations in that there is no way for a knowledge based system to construct a new argument to deal with an unanticipated situation. This paper outlines a model of argumentation which is based on the notion that an argument can be represented at a number of levels. The reasoning which generates an assertion is the biwe level. The justification for the reasoning used is the meta level. Reasoning about justifications involves the meta meta level. We demonstrate with the use of simple arguments how the meta-level can also be used to create an argument for a hypothetical case which had not previously been encountered or anticipated.
