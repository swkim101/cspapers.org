Users at the Boeing Company participated in a study which collected data throughobservation, verbal protocols, questionnaire, and interviews. Dsts analysis used four levels of relevance to assess the importance,and fkquency of use, of thirken criteria for relevance, and fourteen for non relevance, that are not topics or subject matters. Results showed that perceived precision ratios for tiltered information were higher then the ratios fbr non-falteredinfbrmatiorLbut not significantly and could still be improved even though most respondents were satisfied with these ratios. Developing methods to create and maintain useful profiles, and finding ways to incorporaterelevance as well as non-relevan= criteria into profdes, are neceswuy to improve the performanceof faltering medumisms.
