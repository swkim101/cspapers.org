The use of scripting languages to build web applications has increased programmer productivity, but at the cost of degrading dependability. In this paper we focus on a class of bugs that appear in web applications that are built based on the Model-View-Controller architecture. Our goal is to automatically discover data model errors in Ruby on Rails applications. To this end, we created an automatic translator that converts data model expressions in Ruby on Rails applications to formal specifications. In particular, our translator takes Active Records specifications (which are used to specify data models in Ruby on Rails applications) as input and generates a data model in Alloy language as output. We then use bounded verification techniques implemented in the Alloy Analyzer to look for errors in these formal data model specifications. We applied our approach to two open source web applications to demonstrate its feasibility.
