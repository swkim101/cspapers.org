In a previous experiment, we demonstrated that some users seem to significantly transform the instructions for a graph creation task before the y even begin to interact with the interface, and furthermore, that this can create considerable difficulty with an interface that does not require the transformation. In this paper, we desenbe a contrasting experiment, showing that subjects without pre-existing task transformations initially have considerable difficulty with an interface that requires them, but acquire the transformations relatively quickly. Kitajima and Poisonâ€™s LICAI model explains these effects as resulting from the problem representation being elaborated with task-specific schemata during the instruction comprehension process.
