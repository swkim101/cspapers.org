This paper provides valuable information about 3-D map construction using a tracked vehicle at Disaster City. Disaster City is a training facility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States. FEMA staff used our rescue robot Kenaf to conduct simulated emergency testing. Kenaf is a tele-operated tracked vehicle that has high mobility suitable for use in outside terrains and inside buildings. We equipped Kenaf with a 3-D laser scanner that can measure dense and wide angle 3-D shapes. We collected about 50 3-D mapping data sets during the tests. A part of these data sets can be accessed at our website. In this paper, we explain the Kenaf's tele-operation system, the 3-D mapping system, and the comments about the usability of the 3-D mapping from FEMA staff. In addition, we discuss about the limit of our mapping method on the basis of the trials at Disaster City. This information will be helpful for researchers in the robotics to improve their method of 3-D map construction and their tracked vehicles.
