Volumetric displays, which provide a 360Â° view of imagery illuminated in true 3D space, are a promising platform for interactive 3D applications. However, presenting text in volumetric displays can be a challenge, as the text may not be oriented towards the user. This is especially problematic with multiple viewers, as the text could, for example, appear forwards to one user, and backwards to another. In a first experiment we determined the effects of 3D rotations on text readability. Based on the results, we developed and evaluated a new technique which optimizes text orientation for multiple viewers. This technique provided 33% faster group reading times in a collaborative experimental task.
