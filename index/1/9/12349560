Whenever a group of specialists gather for a conference, the air is inevitably filled with reports of the latest projects and extrapolations to the concepts and systems of the future. The participants in these conferences return to their work only to discover that the gap between “the state of the art” and the techniques actually being used has seemingly widened. The breach between capability and usage seems particularly apparent in some areas of computer aided design. Why does this problem exist? Why is it that some engineers use the digital computer extensively while others do not? What can be done to encourage the orderly extension of computer aided design services to support additional areas of engineering effort? This paper will suggest several answers to these questions and will introduce the immediate application approach which appears to overcome many of the problems being encountered. In addition, examples of the immediate application approach at the Wichita Division of the Boeing Company will be presented and discussed.
