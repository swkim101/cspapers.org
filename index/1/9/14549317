This paper describes a haptic simulator that has been developed as an aid for the sensorimotor skill acquisition in dentistry. An important feature of the simulator is the ability to generate templates of position and force trajectories for the students to follow. Furthermore, the simulator has a mechanism, haptic playback, to help the students follow and learn these templates. Using this feature, the teacher can perform a procedure in the haptic simulator and record her actions. The trainee is then able to observe the recorded procedure and follow the correct trajectory in the position and force. Several haptic playback techniques are reviewed and the procedure implemented in the simulator is described in detail. We also describe hardware and software components of the simulator and their functionality.We conclude by describing the results of a preliminary classroom evaluation of the simulator.
