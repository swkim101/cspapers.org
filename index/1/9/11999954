The paper documents the principle and experiments of the “2mm dash” winner at NIST IEEE Mobile Microrobotics Challenge held at ICRA2010 in Alaska [1]. Submission is made for the special session “ICRA Robot Challenge: Advancing Research Through Competitions”. The new MagPieR microrobot was specially designed for breaking the speed record, providing a planar magnetic actuation with an optimised coils setup and a subsequent piezoelectric actuation for improved sliding condition. The paper describes the principle of actuation, the microrobot manufacturing flowchart and the assembly setup. Some simulations are provided with a first series of experimental data and conclusions.
