This paper discusses automatic input and interactive editing systems of logic circuit diagrams. Automatic input is based on pattern recognition, and interactive editing is executed through a graphic display. The system is implemented on a FACOM M-180 II and a PANAFACOM U-400. System overview, hardware configuration, pattern recognition algorithms, editing system, data-base, as well as current results are described.
