Many massive graphs (such as the WWW graph and Call graphs) share certain universal characteristics which can be described by so-called the “power law”. Here we determine the diameter of random power law graphs up to a constant factor for almost all ranges of parameters. These results show a strong evidence that the diameters of most massive graphs are about logarithm of their sizes up to a constant factor.
