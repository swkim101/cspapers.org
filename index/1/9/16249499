We present a method for automatically constructing macro-actions from scratch from primitive actions during the reinforcement learning process. The overall idea is to reinforce the tendency to perform action b after action a if such a pattern of actions has been rewarded. We test the method on a bicycle task, the car-on-the-hill task, the race-track task and some grid-world tasks. For the bicycle and race-track tasks the use of macro-actions approximately halves the learning time, while for one of the grid-world tasks the learning time is reduced by a factor of 5. The method did not work for the car-on-the-hill task for reasons we discuss in the conclusion.
