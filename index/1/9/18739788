Consider a binary string <b>x</b> of length <i>n</i> transmitted <i>m</i> times over a memoryless channel that randomly inserts, deletes and flips bits. We consider the problem of reconstructing <b>x</b> from the collection of <i>m</i> binary strings received at the output of the channel. We present an algorithm for this problem and show that, as <i>n</i> tends to infinity, for almost all transmitted strings, the algorithm is guaranteed to reconstruct the transmitted string with probability 1 - <i>o</i>(1), if the channel's flip probability <i>p</i> < 1/2, its insertion and deletion probabilities <i>qi,qd</i> = <i>O</i>(1/log <i>n</i>), and <i>m</i> = θ(log <i>n</i>). Our algorithm improves on [1] which applies to channels that only delete, and on [2] where <i>qi,qd</i> = <i>O</i>(1/(log <i>n</i>)<sup>2</sup>). We also show that to reconstruct most strings reliably over any channel with a constant flip probability <i>m</i> = Ω(log <i>n</i>) transmissions are necessary, and therefore our algorithm is efficient in this sense.
