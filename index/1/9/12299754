Recent work in 3D printing has focused on tools and techniques to design deformation behaviors using mechanical structures such as joints and metamaterials. In this poster, we explore how to embed and control mechanical springs to create deformable 3D-printed objects. We propose an initial design space of 3D-printable spring-based structures to support a wide range of expressive behaviors, including stretch and compress, bend, twist, and all possible combinations. The poster concludes with a brief feasibility test and enumerates future work.
