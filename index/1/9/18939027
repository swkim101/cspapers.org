The study of relevance has gained considerable attent ion recently in areas as diverse as machine learning and knowledge representation. In this paper, we focus on one particular area, namely relevance in the context of logical theories. We are interested in answering questions like: when is a sentence (or theory) relevant to a set of propositions, or, when is one set of propositions relevant to another given some background theory? The answers are given semantical ly in terms of a logic of belief and syntactically in terms of prime implicates. Furthermore, rather than merely adding yet another set of definitions of relevance to the many that already exist, we also show close connections to two others that were recently proposed, thus point ing to some common ground at least as far as logical relevance is concerned.
