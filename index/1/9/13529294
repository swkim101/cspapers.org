A truly scalable IP-lookup scheme must address five challenges of scalability, namely: routing-table size, lookup throughput, implementation cost, power dissipation, and routing-table update cost. Though several IP-lookup schemes have been proposed in the past, none of them do well in all the five scalability requirements. Previous schemes pipeline tries by mapping trie levels to pipeline stages. We make the fundamental observation that because this mapping is static and oblivious of the prefix distribution, the schemes do not scale well when worst-case prefix distributions are considered. This paper is the first to meet all the five requirements in the worst case. We propose scalable dynamic pipelining (SDP) which includes three key innovations: (1) We map trie nodes to pipeline stages based on the node height. Because the node height is directly determined by the prefix distribution, the node height succinctly provides sufficient information about the distribution. Our mapping enables us to prove a worst-case per-stage memory bound which is significantly tighter than those of previous schemes. (2) We exploit our mapping to propose a novel scheme for incremental route-updates. In our scheme a route-update requires exactly and only one write dispatched into the pipeline. This route-update cost is obviously the optimum and our scheme achieves the optimum in the worst case. (3) We achieve scalability in throughput by simultaneously pipelining at the data-structure level and the hardware level. SDP naturally scales in power and implementation cost. We not only present a theoretical analysis but also evaluate SDP and a number of previous schemes using detailed hardware simulation. Compared to previous schemes, we show that SDP is the only scheme that scales well in all the five requirements.
