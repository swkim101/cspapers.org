The increasing function and decreasing cost of personal computers is making practical a wide range of new types of data-intensive applications. This panel will examine the state-of-the-art and future trends of research in the area of data/information management for personal computing. Views of future information management tools will be discussed, such as the notion of a personal information workstation that allows end-users (nonexperts in database systems) to directly access, classify, search, browse, and edit (modify) a variety of information objects. Techniques and tools for personal information management have potential applicability in a wide spectrum of settings, including design engineering (software, VLSI, etc.), office information systems, and home computing. The panel will specifically focus on the following key questions: -What are the requirements for personal information management tools? -How does personal information management differ from large-scale, transaction-based database management? -Which technologies (hardware, software) should be central to research in this area? -What current research efforts are focusing on this area?
