We propose a plan-based approach for responding to user queries in a collaborative environment. We argue that in such an environment, the system should not accept the user's query automatically, but should consider it a proposal open for negotiation. In this paper we concentrate on cases in which the system and user disagree, and discuss how this disagreement can be detected, negotiated, and how final modifications should be made to the existing plan.
