The protocol discussed in this paper was developed by many members of the ARPANET community starting in 1969 and continuing through the present. Many individuals and institutions have been members of this community at one time or another over the years. A review of the documents, both working and published, written on the subject of this protocol reveals that the following individuals were among those who contributed to the protocol design: A. Bhushan, R. Braden, R. Bressler, J. Burchfiel, S. Carr, V. Cerf, B. Cosell, D. Crocker, S. Crocker, W. Crowther, J. Davidson, D. Dodds, W. Duvall, G. Grossman, R. Gumpertz, W. Hathaway, W. Kantrowitz, R. Long, J. McConnell, A. McKenzie, R. Merryman, J. Melvin, R. Metcalfe, E. Meyer, N. Mimno, L. Nelson, T. O'Sullivan, M. Padlipsky, K. Pogran, J. Postel, M. Reese, J. Rulifson. R. Schantz, R. Thomas, R. Tomlinson, D. Walden, R. Watson, D. Wells, J. Winett, and S. Wolfe. No doubt others also contributed to the design and dozens of other individuals contributed to the many implementations of the protocol. We acknowledge all of their contributions. Many of the above named individuals were offered an opportunity to collaborate on the writing of this paper. The authors are those who responded. We apologize for the oversight to any individual who would have liked to help write this paper but was not apprised of the opportunity.
