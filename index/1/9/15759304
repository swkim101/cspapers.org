HCI is a wide, varied, and complex field that covers a broad spectrum of research. We therefore believe that there is no simple answer to the question ‘what to study in HCI?’ To shed some light on it, however, we reflect on this question with the aid of data from past HCI conferences, present meta-analyses reports, and possible future research priorities. In our discussion, we argue that the current focus of HCI research is too focused on studying the usability of gadgets. Instead, we believe that researchers in the HCI field have the unique opportunity to combine fundamental research, usability design, and awareness of social issues to achieve real-world impact. As such, we suggest that researchers should aim their studies on human aspects that can solve various needs, problems, and societal challenges.
