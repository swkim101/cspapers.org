We present an innovative fault-tree analysis tool that we developed using a novel software architectural style that we call package-oriented programming (POP). The tool is largely implemented using multiple, tightly integrated, shrink-wrapped software packages as components. These packages are integrated using custom-coded integration mediators into a cohesive superstructure that provides much of the functioning required of many sophisticated modeling and analysis tools. In addition to serving as a proof of concept, the tool provides a test-bed for further research on the approach.
