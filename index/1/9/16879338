A new partitioning approach for very large circuits is described. We demonstrate that applying a recently developed analytical placement algorithm, that profits from a linear objective function, significantly improves the partitioning quality compared to the well-known eigenvector approach, which minimizes a quadratic objective function. For the first time, results of benchmark circuits with up to 100,000 cells are presented. The cut-size and the minimum ratio cut is improved up to 90%. The average improvement is about 50%.
