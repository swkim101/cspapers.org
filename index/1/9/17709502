This paper presents two approaches developed to control our CyCab mobile robot. The first one introduces the notion of virtual axle to determine a flat Inverse Kinematics Model; the second one, based on the Escape Lanes method, uses the Direct Kinematics Model. In the last part of this paper, a comparison between the two methods is carried out in order to validate the inverse model and to discuss the two methods respective advantages.
