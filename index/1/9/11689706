We present Portico, a portable system for enabling tangible interaction on and around tablet computers. Two cameras on small foldable arms are positioned above the display to recognize a variety of physical objects placed on or around the tablet. These cameras have a larger field-of-view than the screen, allowing Portico to extend interaction significantly beyond the tablet itself. Our prototype, which uses a 12" tablet, delivers an interaction space six times the size of the tablet screen. Portico thus allows tablets to extend both their sensing capabilities and interaction space without sacrificing portability. We describe the design of our system and present a number of applications that demonstrate Portico's unique capability to track objects. We focus on a number of fun applications that demonstrate how such a device can be used as a low-cost way to create personal surface computing experiences. Finally, we discuss the challenges in supporting tangible interaction beyond the screen and describe possible mechanisms for overcoming them.
