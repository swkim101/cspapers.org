We consider a polynomial analogue of the <italic>hidden number problem</italic> which has recently been introduced by Boneh and Venkatesan. Namely we consider the <italic>sparse polynomial approximation</italic> problem of recovering an unknown polynomial <italic>f(X) \in \F_p[X]</italic> with at most $m$ non-zero terms from approximate values of <italic>f(t)</italic> at polynomially many points <italic>t \in \F_p</italic> selected uniformly at random. The case of a polynomial <italic>f(X) = Î± X<italic> corresponds to the hidden number problem. The above problem is related to the <italic>noisy polynomial interpolation</italic> problem  and to the <italic>sparse polynomial interpolation</italic> problem which have recently been considered in the literature. Our results are based on  a combination of some number theory tools such as bounds of exponential sums and the number of solutions of congruences with the lattice reduction technique.
