The operation of complex real-world systems requires that multiple users cooperate in monitoring and controlling large amounts of information. The Courtyard system supports such cooperative work by integrating an overview on a shined large display and per-user detail on individual displays. Courtyard allows a user to move a mouse pointer between the shared and individual screens as though they were contiguous, and to access per-user detailed information on the userâ€™s individual display simply by pointing to an object on the shared display. Courtyard selects the detailed information according to the tasks assigned to the pointing user.
