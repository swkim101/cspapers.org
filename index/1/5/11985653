Embedded systems are developed within a cost-driven process, such that many purpose-build systems share a common embedded platform. For instance, a shared hardware device might be applied in various use cases with different software. Here, the bare hardware is considered as platform while the final hardware/software system is the product that implements a certain set of features. In this paper, we propose an efficient design space exploration methodology that optimizes a set of embedded platforms. For this purpose, we separate the exploration into two stages: (1) A set of candidate platforms is determined within an optimization framework that can cope with different system models, considering the optimization objectives and feature coverage. (2) The final set of target platforms is determined as subset of the candidates by minimizing the expected objectives like cost, area, etc. The experimental results give evidence that our modular approach is more flexible and scalable than state-of-the-art methodologies.
