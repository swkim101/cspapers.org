This paper outlines the integration of formal method techniques into a graduate advanced software engineering course. A formal method consists of a mathematical model and methodology to aid in the creation of the specification, design and verification of a software system. The justification for the introduction of a formal method not only stems from government and industry regulations/standards, but also from the national perception that the discipline of software engineering education lacks sufficient emphasis on mathematics and engineering science. This outline includes the objectives, teaching methods, group project, and evaluations of the experience from the instructor and students.
