Knowledge extraction for patent requests depends on analyzing current state of the art in multiple languages. Currently the process is usually limited to the languages the patent seeker knows. The paper describes a model for representing the patent request by a set of concepts related to existing multilingual knowledge ontology. The search for patent information is based on Fuzzy Logic decision support, allowing a multilingual search. The model was analyzed in assisting the decision process in the Korean Patent Office based on patents in the Korean, English, and Chinese languages.
