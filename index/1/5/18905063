We propose a Local Voronoi Decomposition (LVD) Algorithm which is able to perform a robust and online task allocation for multiple agents based purely on local information. Because only local information is required in determining each agent's Voronoi region, each agent can then make its decision in a distributive fashion based on its allocated Voronoi region. These Voronoi regions eliminates the occurrence of agents executing instantaneous overlapping tasks. As our method does not require a pre-processing of the map, it is also able to work well in a dynamically changing map with changing number of agents. We will show our proof of concept in the problem of exploration in an unknown environment. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our method significantly outperforms the competing algorithms: Ants Algorithm and the Brick&Mortar Algorithm. Our results also show that our method is near the theoretical best solution.
