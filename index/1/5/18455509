This paper approaches from an optimal control perspective the problem of fixed-time detection of mobile radioactive sources in transit by means of a collection of mobile sensors. Under simplifying assumptions on the geometry of the source, sensors, and surrounding environment, and with knowledge of the source's trajectory, it is shown that the optimal control problem admits an intuitive, analytic closed-form solution. This is facilitated by the availability of analytic expressions for bounds on the probabilities of detection and false alarm during a Neyman-Pearson detection test. The intuition derived from this analytic solution leads to a motion control law that steers suboptimally the sensors to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the suspected source, while navigating among stationary obstacles in their environment, making a step closer to a practical physical implementation.
