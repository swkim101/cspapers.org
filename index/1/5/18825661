Gamified services delivered on smart phones, such as Foursquare, are able to utilise the sensors on the phone to capture user contexts as a means of triggering game elements. This paper identifies and discusses opportunities 
and challenges that exist when using mobile sensors as input for game elements. We present initial findings from a field study of a gamified mobile application made to support the university orientation event for new students 
using game achievements. The study showed that overall the use of context was well received by participants when compared to game elements that required no context to complete. It was also found that using context could help validate that an activity was completed however there were still technical challenges when using sensors that led to exploits in the game elements, or cheating.
