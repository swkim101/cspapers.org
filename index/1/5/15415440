Spintronic memories are promising candidates for future on-chip storage due to their high density, non-volatility and near-zero leakage. However, the energy consumed by read and write operations presents a major challenge to their use as energy-efficient on-chip memory. Leveraging the ability of many applications to tolerate impreciseness in their underlying computations and data, we explore approximate storage as a new approach to improving the energy-efficiency of spintronic memories. We identify and characterize mechanisms in STT-MRAM bit-cells that provide favorable energy-quality trade-offs, i.e., disproportionate energy improvements at the cost of small probabilities of read/write failures. Based on these mechanisms, we design a quality-configurable memory array in which data can be stored to varying levels of accuracy based on application requirements. We integrate the quality-configurable array as a scratchpad in the memory hierarchy of a programmable vector processor and expose it to software by introducing quality-aware load/store instructions within the ISA. We evaluate the energy benefits of our proposal using a device-to-architecture modeling framework and demonstrate 40% and 19.5% improvement in memory energy and overall application energy respectively, for negligible (<; 0.5%) quality loss across a suite of recognition and vision applications.
