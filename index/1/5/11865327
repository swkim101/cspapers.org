Anonymity of ballots in electronic voting schemes usually relies on the existence of some kind of anonymous channel between voters and ballot collecting authorities. Currently, there exist solutions based on the mix concept, which allow for anonymous e-mail communications. However, integration of such solutions into the implementation of a voting scheme has some problems. In this paper we propose a large scale voting scheme based on the concurrent operation of multiple electronic electoral colleges, with no need for independent anonymous channels. Anonymity of ballots is assured by shu ing of ballot boxes by a set of mobile agents acting on behalf of a central voting authority. Our voting scheme is totally self-contained and suitable to be implemented over large internets.
