FaceKit is a toolkit for designing interfaces to object-oriented databases. It provides users with a set of tools for building custom interfaces with minimal programming. This is accomplished by combining techniques from the realm of User Interface Management Systems (UIMS) with a built-in knowledge about the specific kinds of techniques used by object-oriented databases. FaceKit allows users to create graphical constructs and interactive techniques by taking advantage of an object-oriented database environment and tools. Not only can database tools be used for creating an interface, but information about the interface being built is stored within a database schema and is syntactically consistent with all other schema information. Thus, an interface can deal with data and schema information, including information about another interface. This allows for easy reusability of graphical constructs such as data representations.
