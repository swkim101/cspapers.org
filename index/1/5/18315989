Pattern discovery has emerged as a direct result of increased data storage and analytic capabilities available to the data analyst. Without a massive amount of data, we do not have the evidence to support the discovery of the local deterministic structures that we call patterns. As such, pattern discovery is one of the few areas of data mining that cannot be considered simply as a 'scaling-up' of current statistical methodology to analyze large data sets. However, the philosophies of hypothesis testing and modeling in traditional statistics do lend themselves to forming a framework for pattern discovery, and we can also draw from ideas relating to outlier discovery and residual analysis to discover patterns. We illustrate an iterative strategy in a statistical framework by way of its application to one simulated and two real data sets.
