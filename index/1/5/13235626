Although refactoring tools have been integrated into numerous development environments over the past ten years, we have seen little variation in the human interfaces to refactoring tools -- when a refactoring fails, most tools present a textual error message. Existing interfaces can cause programmers to refactor slowly, conservatively, and in an error-prone manner. In this demonstration, we will show how our tools can help programmers overcome barriers to a successful refactoring.
