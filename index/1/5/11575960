Existing global microcode compaction algorithms have all been based on the assumption that the parallelism exploitation is constrained only by data dependency and resource limitation. However, the timing constraint also has great impact upon microcode compaction, thus it is highly necessary to study global microcode compaction under timing constraints. This paper conducts an analysis on the global timing problem, modifies the MO motion rules and presents an algorithm based on Trace Scheduling for global microcode compaction under timing constraints.
