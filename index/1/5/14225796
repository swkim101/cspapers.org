We consider questions about vertex cuts in graphs, random walks in metric spaces, and dimension reduction in L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>; these topics are intimately connected because they can each be reduced to the existence ofvarious families of real-valued Lipschitz maps on certain metric spaces. We view these issues through the lens of shortest-path metricson series-parallel graphs, and we discussthe implications for a variety of well-known open problems. Our main results follow.
 Every <i>n</i>-point series-parallel metric embeds into l<sub>1</sub><sup>dom</sup> with O(√ log n) distortion, matchinga lower bound of Newman and Rabinovich. Our embeddings yield an O(√log n) approximation algorithm for vertex sparsestcut in such graphs, as well as an O(√log k) approximate max-flow/min-vertex-cut theorem for series-parallel instances with<i>k</i> terminals, improving over the O(log n) and O(log k) boundsfor general graphs.
 Every <i>n</i>-point series-parallel metric embeds withdistortion D into l<sub>1</sub><sup>d</sup> with d = n<sup>1/Ω(D<sup>2</sup>)</sup>,matching the dimension reduction lower bound of Brinkman andCharikar.
 There exists a constant C > 0 such that if (X,d) is aseries-parallel metric then for every stationary, reversible Markovchain Z<sub>t</sub><sub>t=0</sub><sup>∞</sup> on X, we have for all t ≥ 0, E[d(Z<sub>t</sub>,Z<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>] ≤ Ct ·, E[d(Z<sub>0</sub>,Z<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>]. More generally, we show thatseries-parallel metrics have Markov type 2. This generalizesa result of Naor, Peres, Schramm, and Sheffield for trees.
