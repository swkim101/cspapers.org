Phase change memory is becoming one of the most promising candidates to replace DRAM as main memory in deep silicon regime. Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM outperforms single level cell (SLC) in terms of capacity while suffering from a weaker cell endurance. Wear leveling strategies are proposed to enhance the endurance but encounters more challenges with the aggravating process variation. Due to endurance variations, balanced write traffic cannot fully exploit the PCM endurance since the weak parts will be worn out sooner than others. In this work, considering process variation, we propose an SLC-enabled wear leveling scheme through dynamic and adaptive mode transformation from MLC to SLC. Instead of redistributing write operations, the proposed scheme dynamically transforms weak and write-dense parts into SLC mode for endurance benefits. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the endurance by 215% with 4% storage overhead while maintaining the capacity advantage of MLC, compared with the most related work.
