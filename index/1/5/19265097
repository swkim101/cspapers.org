With increasing concerns regarding CO2 concentrations in the earthâ€™s atmosphere options for CO2 capture are of interest. Large-scale stationary power systems offer opportunities to separate and capture large volumes of CO2 that would normally be exhausted to the atmosphere. Effectively capturing and delivering this CO2 for geological sequestration requires the compression of large volumes of gas with significant parasitic power consumption. For example, in a coal fueled integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant the CO2 compression penalty can represent about 4 % of the gross power. When 90 % CO2 capture is implemented in a precombustion decarbonization IGCC and CO2 is compressed to 2,200 psia, the auxiliary power load increases by about 40 %, compared to the non-capture case. Over 50 % of this increase is due to CO2 compression. Reducing this power requirement will improve overall plant efficiency and encourage CO2 sequestration at both existing and future power plants. To facilitate this opportunity for CO2 capture, and ultimately sequestration, the compression of large volumes of CO2 is required. This panel will present and discuss existing state-of-the-art techniques for the compression and delivery of large volumes of CO2, advanced concepts for CO2 compression and delivery, and integration opportunities for CO2 compression in large-scale fossil fuel power systems.
