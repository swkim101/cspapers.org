This paper outlines an efficient variation of the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP) on real hardware with an IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer. The paper compares the performance of two clock drift estimation techniques: Least Squares Linear Regression and the Kalman filter. In assessing the viability of time synchronization in an industrial setting, our reliance on real hardware gives confidence for the deployment in future products. The concrete result is a high time synchronization accuracy, with an achievable average error of 0.4 Î¼s, and a repetition interval of a few seconds, while using a star network topology.
