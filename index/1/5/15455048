Specialized computer architectures can provide better price/performance for executing image processing and graphics applications than general purpose designs. Two processors are presented that use parallel SIMD data paths to support common graphics data structures as primitive operands in arithmetic expressions. A variant of the C language has been implemented to allow high level language coding of user applications on these processors. High level programming support is designed into the processor architecture that implements parallel object data typing and parallel conditional evaluation in hardware.
