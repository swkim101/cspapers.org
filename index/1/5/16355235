Powertron is a web-based application that visualizes wireless sensor network deployment data. In this particular demo, we use Powertron to show application-level power data collected from more than 250 sensor nodes. In addition, we expose the routing layer of the deployment by providing real-time interactive visual representation of links, routes, and CTP-related statistics. We hope that the community will have feedback on how such a tool can be extended and generalized to fit a variety of wireless sensor network applications.
