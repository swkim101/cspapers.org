A new concept, Remote EXecution with During Construct (REXDC), is introduced. In addition to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functionality, it allows the client to execute cooperatively with the server during the call period. The During Construct (DC) is a unit where effective cooperation between the client and the server is provided. A mechanism is proposed to integrate the REXDC into a many-client and many-server environment. The mechanism provides a way to program different types of process to process communication and synchronization.
