This paper presents the kinematic calibration of a novel 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) cable-driven robotic arm (CDRA), aimed at improving its absolute positioning accuracy. This CDRA consists of three 'self-calibrated' cable-driven parallel mechanism (CDPM) modules. In order to account for any kinematic errors that might arise when assembling the individual CDPMs, a calibration model is formulated based on the local product-of-exponential formula and the measurement residues in the tool-tip frame poses. An iterative least-squares algorithm is employed to identify the errors in the fixed transformation frames of the sequentially assembled 'self- calibrated' CDPM modules. Both computer simulations and experimental studies were carried out to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed calibration algorithm. From the experimental studies, errors in the fixed kinematic transformation frames were precisely recovered after a minimum of 15 pose measurements.
