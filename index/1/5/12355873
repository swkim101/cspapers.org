This paper presents an annotation scheme for adding entity and event target annotations to the MPQA corpus, a rich span-annotated opinion corpus. The new corpus promises to be a valuable new resource for developing systems for entity/event-level sentiment analysis. Such systems, in turn, would be valuable in NLP applications such as Automatic Question Answering. We introduce the idea of entity and event targets (eTargets), describe the annotation scheme, and present the results of an agreement study.
