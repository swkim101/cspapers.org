We present a tool-supported framework for the engineering of service-based systems (SBSs) capable of self-verifying their compliance with developer-specified reliability requirements. These self-verifying systems select their services dynamically by using a combination of continual quantitative verification and online updating of the verified models. Our framework enables the practical exploitation of recent theoretical advances in the development of self-adaptive SBSs through (a) automating the generation of the software components responsible for model updating, continual verification and service selection; and (b) employing standard SBS development processes.
