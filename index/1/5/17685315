IBIS (Intent-Based Illustration System) generates illustrations automatically, guided by communicative goals. Communicative goals specify that particular properties of objects, such as their color, size, or location are to be conveyed in the illustration. IBIS is intended to be part of an interactive multimedia explanation generation system. It has access to a knowledge base that contains a collection of objects, including information about their geometric properties, material, and location. As the goals are interpreted by a rule-based control component, the system generates a precise definition of the final illustration. If IBIS determines that a set of goals cannot be satisfied in a single picture, then it attempts to create a composite illustration that has multiple viewports. For example, a composite illustration may contain a nested inset illustration showing an object in greater detail than is possible in the parent picture. Each component illustration is defined by its placement, size, viewing specification, lighting specification, and list of objects to be displayed and their graphical style.
