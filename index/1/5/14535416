The software process simulation research field has been growing in recent years. Much effort has been used for developing detailed software process simulation models. However, few studies are available characterizing the effect process simulation models could have when introduced to an organization. Furthermore, most published work in this area has been focused on the effect that the models have for project management. This motivates a study with focus on other categories of project staff, and evaluation of the benefits that could be gained by the introduction of a software process model. We describe an ongoing qualitative study evaluating the impact of the introduction of a software process simulation model in an industrial setting. The focus is to analyse the impact the model has among developers and testers in a specific organization, and to evaluate the model's suitability as a tool for gaining better understanding of the dynamic process behaviour among the study participants (Less)
