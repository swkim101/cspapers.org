Secure data transfer is often achieved by encryption. However, if transmitting across a Binary Symmetric Channel while an eavesdropper listens via a Wiretap Channel, the difference in signal quality can be exploited to improve the inherent transmission secrecy. If this exploitation involves the managed use of erasures, then the secrecy of a code transmitted across the channel can be improved whilst simultaneously reducing the volume of data that is transmitted.
