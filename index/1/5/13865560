In ambient intelligence environments, the information provided by robot's embedded sensors and physical or logical entities may be inaccurate and uncertain. The Dempster-Shafer evidence Theory (DST) gives a mathematical convenient framework for the evidential fusion representation and inference of uncertain information. However, DST yields counterintuitive results in high conflicting ambient intelligence situations. This paper aims to provide a new strategy to manage conflict in activity recognition process in the ambient intelligence applications. It addresses the challenge of uncertainty and proposes an evidential fusion model based on the management of conflicting situation to optimize decision making in activity recognition. The proposed approach gives intuitive interpretation for combining multiple sources in conflicting situations and avoids the problems of using The Dempster-Shafer rule of combination.
