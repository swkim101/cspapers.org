This paper proposes the locomotion control system for a biped locomotion robot. The propose control system is composed of motion generator system and motion control system. Motion generator system is composed of nonlinear oscillators, which generate the commanded trajectories of the joints as functions of phases of oscillators. Motion control system is composed of motors with controllers installed at joints, which control motions of joints. The oscillators tune the phases through the mutual interactions and the feedback signals from the touch sensors at the tips of the legs. As a result, the robot with the controller walks stably by changing its period of locomotion in a changing environment. The performance of the proposed control system is verified by numerical simulations and experiments.
