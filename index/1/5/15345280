There are many challenges to delivering a state-of-the-art user interface in a startup company, especially when the Product Manager is also the User Interface Designer. This design briefing describes the process of making incremental improvements to an existing product, given very limited time and resources, while also designing a new replacement product. Several well-known design techniques and strategies were used, and the relative success or failure of each approach is discussed. In addition, the design rationale for and evolution of the successful new user interface are presented.
