We present an O(n log n)-size fault-tolerant comparator network that remains a sorting network with probability at least 1 â€” l/poly(n) even if each comparator in the network fails independently with probability at most a constant. This result resolves a long-standing conjecture of Yao and Yao in the negative, and it disproves a conjecture of Feige, Peleg, Raghavan, and Upfal under a reasonable model. Our network clearly has an optimal size, and it can be modified to form a generalized comparator network with an optimal O(log n) depth. The previously best construction has a size of O(n log n log log n), which is due to Leighton and Ma.
