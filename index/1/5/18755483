This paper presents a novel method for automated manipulation of individual paper fiber bonds using a microrobotic platform, a computer vision algorithm and a robotic software framework. This is a challenging task due to the three-dimensional, heterogeneous and complex morphology of the fiber bonds. The goal is to automatically grasp the fiber bond, and break it by pulling apart the fibers it consists of. We present the components of the microrobotic platform, and the different rules utilized in detecting suitable grasp points from a 3D reconstruction of the bond generated from an image pair. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach with bond breaking experiments of seven fiber bonds. The time required for grasping and breaking of a bond is 10 - 15 seconds making the approach much faster than the current state-of-the-art testing, which is based on manual manipulation. The success rate of the tests is as high as 80 %.
