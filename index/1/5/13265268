Two major abstract data manipulation models, the relational calculus and relational algebra, were proposed in relation to Relational Model. However, these are known to be not powerful enough for dealing with advanced applications that require various complicated operations in various value sets. Also it is known that these are not suitable for describing traditional data processing applications. In this paper two extensions of the alpha expression, a pair of a relational calculus and a target list, are proposed. One is a extension that enables us to use various operators (including aggregate operators) in various value set in defining the relational calculus and target list. The second extension is introduction of imaginary tuples that enables us easy description and effective implementation of traditional data processing applications.
