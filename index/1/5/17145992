We consider a game between two persons where one person tries to chase the other, but the pursuer only knows an approximation of the true position of the fleeing person. The two players have identical constraints on their speed. It turns out that the fugitive can increase his distance from the pursuer beyond any limit. However, when the speed constraints are given by a polyhedral metric, the pursuer can always remain within a constant distance of the other person.We apply this problem to buffer minimization in an online scheduling problem with conflicts.
