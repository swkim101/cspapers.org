We demonstrate HUX (Handling Updates in XML) which provides a reliable and efficient solution for the XML view update problem. Given an update over an XML view, our U-Filter subsytem first determines whether the update is translatable or not by examining potential conflicts in both schema and data. If an update is determined to be translatable, our U-Translator subsystem searches potential translations and finds a "good" one. Our demonstration illustrates the working, as well as the performance, of the two sub-systems within HUX for different application scenarios.
