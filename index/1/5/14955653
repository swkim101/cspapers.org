This paper presents an unsupervised approach to aspect-based opinion polling from raw textual reviews without explicit ratings. The key contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, a multi-aspect bootstrapping algorithm is proposed to learn from unlabeled data aspect-related terms of each aspect to be used for aspect identification. Second, an unsupervised segmentation model is proposed to address the challenge of identifying multiple single-aspect units in a multi-aspect sentence. Finally, an aspect-based opinion polling algorithm is presented. Experiments on real Chinese restaurant reviews show that our opinion polling method can achieve 75.5% precision performance.
