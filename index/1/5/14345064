This paper describes a Wrapper Generator for wrapping high performance legacy codes as Java/CORBA components for use in a distributed component-based problem- solving environment. Using the Wrapper Generator we ave automatically wrapped an MPI-based legacycode as a single CORBA object, and implemented a problem- solving environment for molecular dynamic simulations. Performance comparisons between runs of the CORBA object and the original legacy code on a cluster of workstations and on a parallel computer are also presented.
