The area of clone detection (i.e., searching for duplicate fragments of source code) has received wide interest recently as indicated by numerous efforts in clone detection tool development. Additionally, some work has been done in the area of selecting and refactoring the detected clones. However, the actual refactoring of clones is typically separated from the initial clone detection and subsequent selection of clones, because the task is delegated to a refactoring tool. This research abstract describes an investigation that will bridge the gap between clone detection and refactoring by researching and developing a comprehensive clone detection and refactoring process that begins with the detection of clones and ends with their refactoring.
