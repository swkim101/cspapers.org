1. Introduction I___-This paper describes ISIS-II*, a constraint-directed reasoning system for the scheduling of factory job-shops. ISIS-II takes a heuristic search approach to generating schedules. The key features of ISIS-II's approach is that it can represent and use a variety of different types of constraints to guide the search, and is able to selectively relax conflicting constraints.
