Developing a learning suppliment to support the breadth-first computer science curriculum and taking advantage of emerging technologies to provide interactive, demand-driven simulations which enhance comprehension of abstract concepts in computer science resulted in the PACER (Personally Active Computing Exploration Resource) project. Development of this educational tool includes three fundamental objectives: simulation and experimentation, connection to supplementary information, and delivery to a wide audience across multiple computer platforms. All three objectives are required to support the educational demands of students who struggle with difficult theoretical material, seek access to information round-the-clock from home and work and use a variety of computer platforms. The PACER system meets learners' needs of repetition and visual simulation of complex ideas. It also offers the ability to pursue education from remote locations making accessible resources never before available. The interactive design of PACER encourages self-directed learning. It also challenges and supports commuting adults, students with disabilities, and traditional students to pursue fields of quantitative reasoning. Unlike traditional WWW-based learning environments, the PACER pages support interactive learning sessions as well as simulations with animation capabilities. The hierarchical organization of Web pages allows the PACER system to have learning modules that are inter-linked which in turn supports "demand-driven" learning. This feature allows PACER to be an active learning tool.
