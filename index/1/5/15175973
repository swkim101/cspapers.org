Let P be a set of n points in the plane. A k-tour through P is a tour in the plane that starts and ends at the fixed origin and visits at most k points of P. Our goal is to cover all the points of P by k-tours so as to minimize the total length of the tours. We give a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem whose running time is (k/~)Oikfâ€™sl + O(n log n). Thus, our scheme remains a PTAS when k has a nearly logarithmic dependence on n. This improves over the previous best known scheme which is a PTAS only when k = O(log log n).
