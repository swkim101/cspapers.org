In this paper we describe a Patricia tree-based B-tree variant suitable for OLTP. In this variant, each page of the B-tree contains a local Patricia tree instead of the usual sorted array of keys. It has been implemented in iAnywhere ASA Version 8.0. Preliminary experience has shown that these indexes can provide significant space and performance benefits over existing ASA indexes.
