In the paper an approach to implement efficiently a relational data base is presented. The appro- ach combines a new method of physical repre- sentation with a novel database machine (DBM) architecture. The dispersed representation assumes a relation consisting of three parts: the identification, value, and link (optionally). The parts are separated and the identification and link parts are converted to be expressed with pointers, and then the parts are dispersed among three memories: the IDENTIFICATION, VALUE, and LINK. The DBM architecture attempts to implement the dispersed representa- tion efficiently and uses modified cellular asso- ciative memories (CAM) to store and process the value and link parts. The modification consists in providing a CAM with a respond register called a global mark register (GMR) which can be readily loaded and unloaded externally.
