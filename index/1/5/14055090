The large scale of online classes and the diversity of the students that participate in them can enable new educational systems. This massive scale and diversity can enable always-available systems that help students share diverse ideas, and inspire and learn from each other. We introduce systems for two core educational processes at scale: discussion and assessment. To date, several thousand students in a dozen online classes have used our discussion system. Controlled experiments suggest that participants in more diverse discussions perform better on tests and that discussion improves engagement. Similarly, more than 100,000 students have reviewed peer work for both summative assessment and feedback. Through these systems, we argue that to create new educational experiences at scale, pedagogical strategies and software that leverage scale and diversity must be co-developed. More broadly, we suggest the key to creating new educational experiences online lies in leveraging massive networks of peers.
