BOLT is a block-oriented MOS Integrated Circuit design language which relies heavily on macro, define, and parameter default features in order to simplify the design specification. A compiler generates block, logic, and transistor level equivalents used in an integrated CAD system including logic simulators, timing verification, place and route software and other packages. To handle the rapidly changing custom MOS/LSI environment the device types are defined externally to the compiler.
