MELD combines concepts from data flow and object-oriented programming languages in a unique approach to tool reusability. MELD provides three units of abstraction — equations, classes and features — that together allow sufficient options for granularity and encapsulation to support the implementation of reusable tools and the composition of existing tools in parallel (i.e., interleaved) as well as in series.
