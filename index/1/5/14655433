Join processing in the streaming environment has many practical applications such as data cleaning and outlier detection. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the real-world data, it has become an increasingly important problem to consider the join processing on uncertain data streams, where the incoming data at each timestamp are uncertain and imprecise. Different from the static databases, processing uncertain data streams has its own requirements such as the limited memory, small response time, and so on. To tackle the challenges with respect to efficiency and effectiveness, in this paper, we formalize the problem of join on uncertain data streams (USJ), which can guarantee the accuracy of USJ answers over uncertain data, and propose effective pruning methods to filter out false alarms. We integrate the pruning methods into an efficient query procedure for incrementally maintaining USJ answers. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches.
