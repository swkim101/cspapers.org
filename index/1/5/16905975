Computer systems keep increasing in size. Systems scale in the number of processing units, memories and peripheral devices. This creates many and diverse architectural trade-offs that the existing operating systems are not able to address. We are designing and implementing, FenixOS, a new operating system that aims to improve the state of the art in scalability and reliability.
 We achieve scalability through limiting data sharing when possible, and through extensive use of lock-free data structures. Reliability is addressed with a careful re-design of the programming interface and structure of the operating system.
