This paper aims to develop further and systemize the theory of multiple belief change based on the previous work on the package contraction, developed by [Fuhrmann and Hansson 1994] and the general belief changes, developed by [Zhang 1996]. Two main representation theorems for general contractions are given, one is based on partial meet models and the other on nice-ordered partition models. An additional principle, called Limit Postulate, for the general belief changes is introduced which specifies properties of infinite belief changes. The results of this paper provides a foundation for investigating the connection between infinite nonmonotonic reasoning and multiple belief revision.
