We present a class of Wireless Resonant Magnetic Microactuator (WRMMA) that integrates a polymer spring/body structure with electroplated ferromagnetic masses. The new devices, which we call PolyMites as they are derived from our previous MagMites, are simpler, faster and cheaper to fabricate than the MagMite. Like their predecessor, they are capable of moving on planar surfaces in dry and wet environments. Their improved biocompatibility also extends their potential for biological applications. PolyMites are 500 μm in diameter and 55 μm in height. In air they have attained a speed of 13 mm/s, approximately 26 body lengths per second. PolyMites are capable of micromanipulation on a surface, which is demonstrated by pushing and releasing micro-objects such as polystyrene beads in water.
