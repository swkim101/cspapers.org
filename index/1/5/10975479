We present results that show that incorporating lexical and structural semantic information is effective for word sense disambiguation. We evaluated the method by using precise information from a large treebank and an ontology automatically created from dictionary sentences. Exploiting rich semantic and structural information improves precision 2‚Äê3%. The most gains are seen with verbs, with an improvement of 5.7% over a model using only bag of words and n-gram features.
