We present a concurrency control scheme using dynamic versioning for index-based data access in main memory database systems. This scheme enables read-only transactions read correct version without holding any locks or latches, while update transactions only obtain a few locks or latches without deadlocks. Efficient version management is designed to support high concurrency level and low space overhead. The interaction between dynamic versioning and indexing is considered so that all available versions can be accessed through indexing. Experiment results show that dynamic versioning can improve the performance in concurrent environment significantly.
