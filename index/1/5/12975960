A method is presented to display partial slip in precision grip of humans. Partial slip is important information for precision grip of humans, because the human controls grasping force by detecting expansion of the partial slip area. Therefore, a device that displays partial slip will make it easier for remote controlled mechanical hands to grasp objects, irrespective of the friction coefficient between the mechanical hand and object. To design the device displaying partial slip, we analyzed the deformation of a finger when in contact with a rigid plate using a finite element model. We also analyzed the deformation of the finger section model when in contact with the device that displays partial slip. As a result of the analyses, it is confirmed that there is a possibility in displaying partial slip using a tactile display device, which stimulates the finger through deformation of an elastic body.
