This paper introduces a new method for estimating the local neighborhood and scale of data points to improve the robustness of spectral clustering algorithms. We employ a subset of empty region graphs - the β-skeleton - and non-linear diffusion to define a locally-adapted affinity matrix, which, as we demonstrate, provides higher quality clustering than conventional approaches based on κ nearest neighbors or global scale parameters. Moreover, we show that the clustering quality is far less sensitive to the choice of β and other algorithm parameters, and to transformations such as geometric distortion and random perturbation. We summarize the results of an empirical study that applies our method to a number of 2D synthetic data sets, consisting of clusters of arbitrary shape and scale, and to real multi-dimensional classification examples from benchmarks, including image segmentation.
