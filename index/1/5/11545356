In this paper, we describe our experience in establishing a software development center in China with the purpose of supporting a major U.S. eCommerce website. We have established a set of development processes that fit our business needs to develop a large number of relatively small projects and release them in very short intervals. Our processes allow us to accurately monitor the project status, schedule resources, predict the delivery and assess the productivity. We believe only with such systems in place that businesses can ensure successful overseas software operations.
