So we often need to perform low-resolution person re-ID, where images captured by different cameras have great resolution divergences. Existing methods cope problem via some complicated and time-consuming strategies, making them less favorable in practice, and their performances are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we design a novel Discriminative Semi-coupled Projective Dictionary Learning (DSPDL) model to effectively and efficiently solve this problem. Specifically, we propose to jointly learn a pair of dictionaries and a mapping to bridge the gap across low(er) and high(er) resolution person images. Besides, we develop a novel graph regularizer to incorporate positive and negative image pair information in a parameterless fashion. Meanwhile, we adopt the efficient and powerful projective dictionary learning technique to boost the our efficiency. Experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of the proposed method to the state-of-the-art ones.
