We present a new efficient sampling method for approximating r-dimensional Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems, MAX-rCSP, on n variables up to an additive error εnr. We prove a newgeneral paradigm in that it suffices, for a given set of constraints, to pick a small uniformly random subset of its variables, and the optimum value of the subsystem induced on these variables gives (after a direct normalization and with high probability) an approximation to the optimum of the whole system up to an additive error of εnr. Our method gives for the first time a polynomial in ε—1 bound on the sample size necessary to carry out the above approximation. Moreover, this bound is independent in the exponent on the dimension r. The above method gives a completely uniform sampling technique for all the MAX-rCSP problems, and improves the best known sample bounds for the low dimensional problems, like MAX-CUT. The method of solution depends on a new result on t he cut norm of random subarrays, and a new sampling technique for high dimensional linear programs. This method could be also of independent interest.
