Automatic timeline summarization (TLS) generates precise, dated overviews over (often prolonged) events, such as wars or economic crises. One subtask of TLS selects the most important dates for an event within a certain time frame. Date selection has up to now been handled via supervised machine learning approaches that estimate the importance of each date separately, using features such as the frequency of date mentions in news corpora. This approach neglects interactions between different dates that occur due to connections between subevents. We therefore suggest a joint graphical model for date selection. Even unsupervised versions of this model perform as well as supervised state-of-theart approaches. With parameter tuning on training data, it outperforms prior supervised models by a considerable margin.
