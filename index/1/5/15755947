The robust execution of a planned trajectory is a critical issue in robotics. In this paper, we set the formal basis for a sensor-landmark-based motion planning approach. Our approach deals with inaccuracy of the map of the environment by producing motion features composed of a reference trajectory and of a set of pair sensor landmark over which the robot would control its motion. These motion features define along the trajectory closed-loop motion strategies for the robot. This approach enables us to produce secure motions by putting emphasis on landmarks that can represent a danger of collision. Our contribution is to state the problem in a generic formalism and to propose some simulations that show the relevance of our resolution approach.
