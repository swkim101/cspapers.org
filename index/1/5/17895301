Maintaining access efficiency to a data base as updates and/or usage patterns change often requires restructuring the data base. While analytical methods are available for determining the optimal point to restructure, they assume the mean access cost is a smooth function of time or the number of accesses and can be measured exactly at any point in time. The access cost in practice often varies, at least in the short run, In a random manner. This implies a nonzero probability of deciding the optimal reorganization point has been reached when in fact it has not. Determination of the optimal reorganization point must take into account the random behavior of the access cost and the probability (and cost) of deciding too early or too late to perform the reorganization. A technique for choosing the optimal reorganization point subject to random variation in the access cost is developed and some examples are presented.
