The semantic role labels of verb predicates can be used to define an event model for understanding text. In the system described in this paper, the events are extracted from documents that are summary reports about individual people. The system constructed for the event extraction integrates a statistical approach using machine learning over Propbank semantic role labels with a rule-based approach using a sublanguage grammar of the summary reports. The event model is also utilized in identifying patterns of event/role usage that can be mapped to entity relations in the domain ontology of the application.
