One of the serious problems for current web search engines is the poor retrieval accuracy. The accuracy does not mean the precision value in traditional IR any more. It should measure the number of most relevant documents in top n documents in result list. Owing to the huge volume of returned results, most of the time, the top n documents are what users really review. So in the web environment, the order of the results is very important, while the ordering is determined by the ranking mechanism. The poor ranking algorithm will result in the poor ordering. There are at least two significant problems with current ranking mechanisms.
