Instant Inkjet Circuits by silver nano-particle ink realized home-brew electric circuit fabrication. However, current method can support only single-layered patterns, and conventional inter-layer connection methods are not suitable. In this paper, we will evaluate various easy-to-use inter-layer connection methods by making via holes, especially the ones made by different drilling mechanisms. We show that the felting needle is the best candidate as it can establish good conductivity immediately after nano-particle ink is printed into the hole, without using any curing process.
