The processes for design and release of LSI chips, thermal conduction modules (TCMs), and boards on the IBM 3081 Processor are highly automated, using the Engineering Design System. This paper describes the automated and manual operations involved in the process of design and release of the various packaging levels to Manufacturing for fabrication and test. The Engineering Design System (EDS) includes a data base of programs and rules for the operations involved in designing and documenting a product. The design system contains all rules, definitions, and programming requirements for system design and complete data transfer to Manufacturing and testing.
