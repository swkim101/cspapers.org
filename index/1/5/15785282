Confusion has been found to hinder user experience with visualizations. If confusion could be predicted and resolved in real time, user experience and satisfaction would greatly improve. In this paper, we focus on predicting occurrences of confusion during the interaction with a visualization using eye tracking and mouse data. The data was collected during a user study with ValueChart, an interactive visualization to support preferential choices. We report very promising results based on Random Forest classifiers.
