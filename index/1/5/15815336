Classical cake cutting protocols either consider a one-dimensional resource, or allocate each agent several disconnected pieces. In practice, however, the two dimensional shape of the allotted piece is of crucial importance in many applications, e.g., squares or bounded aspect-ratio rectangles are most useful for building houses as well as advertisements. We thus introduce and study the problem of envy-free two-dimensional division wherein the utility of the agents depends on the geometric shape of the allocated pieces (as well as the location and size). In addition to envy-freeness, we require that the fraction allocated to each agent be at least a certain constant that depends only on the shape of the cake and the number of agents. We focus on the case where the allotted pieces must be square and the cakes are either squares or the unbounded plane. We provide algorithms for the problem for settings with two and three agents.
