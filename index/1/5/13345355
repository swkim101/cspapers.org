A laser micromanipulation is suitable for non contact manipulation of a microscopic object, such as a bacteria and microbe, in the closed space. Here we propose the Synchronized Laser Micromanipulation (SLM) for the trajectory control of the multiple targets by the single laser. We used the laser scanning system for high speed transportation of multiple objects. Condition for secure transportation was derived and verified through the experiment. Using the SLM, we can manipulate multiple microbeads with each designed trajectories. We assembled a band of 4 adhesive microbeads. Both ends are trapped, and it is manipulated by the SLM. It is possible to transport the microbe by the indirect manipulation of the assembled microstructure by the SLM. Experiment results are shown here.
