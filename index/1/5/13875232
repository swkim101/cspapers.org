Memory loss, common seen in elderly people, affects their social interaction in the daily life very much. This 3-year international project jointly funded by Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) investigates together the crucial issues behind the hyper aged societies. We aim at developing technologies and systems to provide information recall support for elderly people at the right time and at the right place.
