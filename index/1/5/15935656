Current programming languages and techniques realize many features which allow their users to extend these languages on a semantic basis: classes, functions, interfaces, aspects and other entities can be defined. However, there is a lack of modern programming languages which are both semantically and syntactically extensible from within the language itself, i.e., with no additional tool or meta-language. In this paper we present π as an approach that aims to overcome this lack. π provides an abstraction mechanism based on parameterized symbols which is capable of semantically and syntactically unifying programming concepts like variables, control-structures, procedures and functions into one concept: the pattern. We have evaluated the abstraction potential and the syntactic extensibility of π by successfully creating patterns for the aforementioned programming concepts. π could serve as a tool for designing new experimental languages and might generally influence the view we have on current programming concepts.
