This paper describes how we use a hypermedia system (KMS) for our collaborative work. Based on our experience with KMS and our previous research with the ZOG system at Carnegie Mellon University, we believe that a shared-database hypermedia system provides a powerful foundation for collaboration. In this paper, we show how the shared-database capability of KMS, plus particular aspects of its data model, address six of the fundamental issues facing designers of collaborative work systems.
