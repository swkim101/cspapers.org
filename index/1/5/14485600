How to control hand-off drops is a very important Quality-of-Service (QoS) issue in cellular networks. In order to keep the hand-off dropping probability below a pre-specified target value (thus providing a probabilistic QoS guarantee), we design and evaluate predictive and adaptive schemes for the bandwidth reservation for the existing connections' handoffs and the admission control of new connections.We first develop a method to estimate user mobility based on an aggregate history of hand-offs observed in each cell. This method is then used to predict (probabilistically) mobiles' directions and hand-off times in a cell. For each cell, the bandwidth to be reserved for hand-offs is calculated by estimating the total sum of fractional bandwidths of the expected hand-offs within a mobility-estimation time window. We also develop an algorithm that controls this window for efficient use of bandwidth and effective response to (1) time-varying traffic/mobility and (2) inaccuracy of mobility estimation. Three different admission-control schemes for new connection requests using this bandwidth reservation are proposed. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes to show that they meet our design goal and outperform the static reservation scheme under various scenarios.
