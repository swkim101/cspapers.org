Suppose that C is a bounded convex region. Let pl, . . . , p,, be points drawn from the uniform distribution over C and let M,” be the number of the points which are maximal. In this note we examine the asymptotics of E (M$‘) as n -t 00. We show, for example, that if C is planar then, either E (M$) = 0 (6) or E (Mz) = 0 (log n) , and give a simple geometric criterion that tells which of the two behaviors applies. This note also addresses the asymptotics of E (Mz) when C is a higher-dimension,al convex region, and discusses the asymptotic behavior of the higher moments of M,” as well. Some immediate algorithmic implications that follow from knowing E (M$) are also examined, e.g., the existence of heuristics for finding maxima that have fast expected running times when their input points are drawn from any of many different possible distributions.
