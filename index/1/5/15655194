In this paper, we propose a real-time control method for skating motion of humanoid robots. There are three problems for skating motion: (1) keeping dynamic balance, (2) adequately controlling foot force to suppress slipping at the foot, (3) controlling full-body motion in real-time. For solving these problems, we propose the Skating Motion Generator and the Skating Motion Stabilizer. In the Skating Motion Generator, we separate the slip suppression from motion generation for (3). The separation enables us to generate skating motions in real-time. In the Skating Motion Stabilizer, we adjust the sole pressure distribution of each foot to solve the contradiction between (1) and (2). We show the effectiveness of the proposed controller through the experiments, in which life-sized humanoid HRP-2 pushes the ground and skates on the skateboard. Applying the proposed controller, HRP-2 could successfully accelerate and skate on the skateboard at 0.5[m/s].
