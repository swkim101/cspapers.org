This paper presents low-level architectural features for supporting software systems which are organized as collections of concurrent processes in which processes may be created or destroyed and interprocess interaction paths may be established and closed over the course of system's operation. The interprocess interaction aspect of the mentioned systems is discussed in some detail and a suitable architecture is developed for a processor which provides for efficient coordination and communication between processes running on possibly different computers.
