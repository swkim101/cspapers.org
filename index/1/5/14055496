Development work on a computer program call­ ed HAPPINESS which solves basic probability prob­ lems phrased in English is presented. Emphasis is placed on (1) the application of heuristics to the examination of input language structure for the purpose of determining those phases richest in semantic content (2) the piecewise construction of combinatorial form­ ulas for problem solution The language analysis is accomplished in sever­ al discrete stages, involving simple sentence trans­ formation, keyword and semantic scanning, and syn­ tactic analysis based on a simplified context-free grammar. The descriptor list result of this analy­ sis is used as the basis for a four-stage solution procedure. A description of the implementation, and a dis­ cussion of its limitations, extensions, and applica­ tions, is also given.
