We have designed and implemented a software facility, called Agora, that supports the development of parallel applications written in multiple languages. At the core of Agora there is a mechanism that allows concurrent computations to share data structures independently of the computer architecture they are executed on. Concurrent computations exchange control information by using a pattern-directed technique. This paper describes the Agora shared memory and its software implementation on both tightly and loosely-coupled architectures.
