Traditional flow analysis techniques, such as the ones typically employed by optimizing Fortran compilers, do not work for Scheme-like languages. This paper presents a flow analysis technique — control flow analysis — which is applicable to Scheme-like languages. As a demonstration application, the information gathered by control flow analysis is used to perform a traditional flow analysis problem, induction variable elimination. Extensions and limitations are discussed.
The techniques presented in this paper are backed up by working code. They are applicable not only to Scheme, but also to related languages, such as Common Lisp and ML.
