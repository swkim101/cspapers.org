The Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter is an efficient formulation of multi-target state estimation that circumvents the combinatorial explosion of the multi-target posterior by operating on single-target space without maintaining target identities. In this paper, we propose a multi-target tracker based on the PHD filter that provides instantaneous state estimation and delayed decision on data association. For this purpose, we reformulate the PHD recursion in terms of single-target track hypotheses and solve a min-cost flow network for trajectory estimation where measurement likelihoods and transition probabilities are based on multi-target state estimates. In this manner, the presented approach combines global data association with efficient multi-target filtering. We evaluate the approach on a publicly available pedestrian tracking dataset to present state estimation and data association capabilities.
