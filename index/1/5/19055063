This demo presents the architecture of GENI (Global Environment of Network Innovations) [1] edge cloud computing network in the form of compute and storage resources, a mobile 4G LTE edge and a high speed campus network connecting these components. GENI's edge computing strategy proceeds by deploying self-contained packages of network, computing, storage resources, or GENI Racks [2] connected via high speed fiber to LTE BS(s) across twelve campuses in the US, all interconnected via a nationwide research network. The GENI mobile computing resource manager is based on the Orbit Management framework (OMF) [3] and provides seamless access to the edge computing resources via the GENI Portal for experimentation, scheduling, data collection and processing.
