SpiderBot is a cable suspended mobile robot that is designed to climb walls and hang from ceilings by shooting tethered plungers onto the surface. Removing the plungers, it reels in the web, aims, and repeats the process to climb farther. SpiderBots' design was inspired by the fictional character Spider-Man. The robot can be used for carrying equipment and sensors over a disaster area to help rescue forces. It can maneuver and serve as a moving platform inside building such as workshops and hangers without taking floor space. The robot can also move between floating vessels at sea and serve as a moving crane.
