We present a new, structured approach to text simplification using conditional random fields over top-down traversals of dependency graphs that jointly predicts possible compressions and paraphrases. Our model reaches readability scores comparable to word-based compression approaches across a range of metrics and human judgements while maintaining more of the important information.
