Over the last several years the Internet has experienced enormous growth in global ubiquity, implemented in a complex meshed interconnection across many service providers, while also experiencing significant shifts in workload profiles based on characteristics of new applications. In this growing phase systemic Internet performance is at risk. One of the approaches to address the global “complexity diameter” is to create satellite networks with world-wide coverage and performance characteristics resembling conventional terrestrial connections. In the case of Teledesic, a constellation of hundreds of Low Earth Orbit satellites is planned to create a global high performance “Internet in the sky,” that will enable affordable access to fiber-like telecommunications capability anywhere in the world. Offering this kind of global high quality communications services presents intriguing challenges in network architecture and performance analysis, including its integration into the global Internet community.
