However, most existing multi-view clustering methods only aim to explore the consistency or enhance the diversity of different views. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering method (CSMSC), where consistency and specificity are jointly exploited for subspace representation learning. We formulate the multi-view self-representation property using a shared consistent representation and a set of specific representations, which better fits the real-world datasets. Specifically, consistency models the common properties among all views, while specificity captures the inherent difference in each view. In addition, to optimize the non-convex problem, we introduce a convex relaxation and develop an alternating optimization algorithm to recover the corresponding data representations. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance over several state-of-the-arts.
