A new input device called the PadMouse is described and evaluated. The PadMouse consists of a two degree-of-freedom touchpad mounted on a regular mouse base. Like the regular mouse, the PadMouse allows for spatial positioning tasks to be performed by moving the device on a planar surface. In addition, when coupled with an interaction technique we call Marking Keys, users can use the touchpad to activate modifiers and commands. An experiment shows that up to 32 modifiers/commands can be quickly and accurately activated using this technique, making it a viable device for the non-dominant hand in two-handed user interfaces. Other uses for the PadMouse and design alternatives are also discussed.
