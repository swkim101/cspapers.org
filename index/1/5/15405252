Measuring the strength of passwords is crucial to ensure the security of password-based authentication. However, current methods to measure password strength have limited accuracy, first, because they use rules that are too simple to capture the complexity of passwords, and second, because password frequencies widely differ from one application to another. In this paper, we present the concept of adaptive password strength meters that estimate password strength using Markov-models. We propose a secure implementation that greatly improves on the accuracy of current techniques.
