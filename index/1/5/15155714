Over the past decade the sheer size and complexity of traditional operating systems have prompted a wave of new approaches to help alleviate the services provided by these operating systems. The emergence of micro-kernels and a plethora of non-traditional operating system models, both geared toward reducing the role of the OS, attest to the promise of practical alternatives. The problem with these methods is that the three-tiered system of software, operating system, and hardware is still preserved. Even though the operating system might find some reprieve by having to handle less work there is a nascent notion being triggered by these alternative approaches that the operating system as an abstract entity is no longer a necessity. We propose a radical method of computing where we take this notion to the extreme and push the operating system into the software and hardware levels. By doing so, we create a decentralized operating system environment known as Dispersed Operating System Computing (DOSC). We outline how the Dispersed Operating System paradigm works, its benefits, and immediate practical applications in today's world.
