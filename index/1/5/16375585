This paper aimed to automatically translating Python programs into traditional Chinese in order to help those who feel interested in learning computer programming but are not very good at English. The idea could also be helpful for those countries where English is not an official language in elementary or secondary schools. With a set of more than 70 English Python programs translated successfully, the current translated rate is about 62% out of 86% of Python identifiers found in these programs. A Tk-based GUI program is also provided to browse them conveniently. All source and translated programs were open to the public in Git Hub Website.
