Relation extraction suffers from a performance loss when a model is applied to out-of-domain data. This has fostered the development of domain adaptation techniques for relation extraction. This paper evaluates word embeddings and clustering on adapting feature-based relation extraction systems. We systematically explore various ways to apply word embeddings and show the best adaptation improvement by combining word cluster and word embedding information. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of regularization for the adaptability of relation extractors.
