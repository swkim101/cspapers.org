This paper addresses the design of an exciting introductory course for entering college students who have some programming background. The key innovation of the course is the introduction of material pertaining to experimental graph reduction and dataflow architectures for highly-parallel computers. The success of the course is attributed to interesting, well-integrated material and the use of visually-oriented interactive simulators for the architectures.
