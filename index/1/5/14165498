XML employs a tree-structured data model, and, naturally, XML queries specify patterns of selection predicates on multiple elements related by a tree structure. Finding all occurrences of such a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation for XML query processing. Prior work has typically decomposed the twig pattern into binary structural (parent-child and ancestor-descendant) relationships, and twig matching is achieved by: (i) using structural join algorithms to match the binary relationships against the XML database, and (ii) stitching together these basic matches. A limitation of this approach for matching twig patterns is that intermediate result sizes can get large, even when the input and output sizes are more manageable.In this paper, we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm, TwigStack, for matching an XML query twig pattern. Our technique uses a chain of linked stacks to compactly represent partial results to root-to-leaf query paths, which are then composed to obtain matches for the twig pattern. When the twig pattern uses only ancestor-descendant relationships between elements, TwigStack is I/O and CPU optimal among all sequential algorithms that read the entire input: it is linear in the sum of sizes of the input lists and the final result list, but independent of the sizes of intermediate results. We then show how to use (a modification of) B-trees, along with TwigStack, to match query twig patterns in sub-linear time. Finally, we complement our analysis with experimental results on a range of real and synthetic data, and query twig patterns.
