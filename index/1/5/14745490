The utility of miniature ground robots has long been limited by reduced locomotion capabilities compared to larger robots. Many avenues of research have been pursued to improve ground locomotion to alleviate this issue. In this paper, another option is explored in which a small ground robot is equipped with the ability to fly, allowing it to move to previously unreachable areas if necessary.
