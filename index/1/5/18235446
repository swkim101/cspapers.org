This paper describes an approach to silicon compilation of analog functional blocks and the physical assembly of mixed analog and digital blocks. The initial driving applications are High Voltage ASICs. Details of behavior to layout synthesis, or decompositions, are presented together with the results from an implementation of the compiler. The compiler has been used to compile CMOS operational amplifiers. Results and examples are given in which device sizes, bias currents and layout are obtained from performance specifications and process parameters.
