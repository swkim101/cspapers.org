Some formal representation Issues underlying the Interaction between an expert system and Its knowledge base are discussed. It is argued that a language that can refer both to the application domain and to the state of the knowledge base is required to specify and to question an incomplete knowledge base. A formal logical language with this ability is presented and its semantics and proof theory are defined. It is then shown how this language must be used to interact with the knowledge base.
