This paper addresses the problem of fast retrieval of data from XML documents by providing a labeling schema that can easily handle simple as well as complex XPATH queries and also provide for updates without the need for the entire document being re-indexed in the RDBMS. We introduce a new labeling schema called the "Z-Label" for efficiently processing XPATH queries involving child and descendant axes.The use of "Z-Label" coupled with the indexing schema provides for smooth updates in the XML document.
