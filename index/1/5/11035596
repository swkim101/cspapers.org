Previous work on Automatic Paraphrase Iden-tiﬁcation (PI) is mainly based on modeling text similarity between two sentences. In contrast, we study methods for automatically detecting whether a text fragment only appearing in a sentence of the evaluated sentence pair is important or ancillary information with respect to the paraphrase identiﬁcation task. Engineering features for this new task is rather difﬁcult, thus, we approach the problem by representing text with syntactic structures and applying tree kernels on them. The results show that the accuracy of our automatic An-cillary Text Classiﬁer (ATC) is promising, i.e., 68.6%, and its output can be used to improve the state of the art in PI.
