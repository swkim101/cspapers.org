Much of the present P2P-IR literature is focused on distributed indexing structures. Within this paper, we present an approach based on the replication of peer data summaries via rumor spreading and multicast in a structured overlay.We will describe Rumorama, a P2P framework for similar-ity queries inspired by GlOSS and CORI and their P2P-adaptation, PlanetP. Rumorama achieves a hierarchization of PlanetP-like summary-based P2P-IR networks. In a Rumorama network, each peer views the network as a small PlanetP network with connections to peers that see other small PlanetP networks. One important aspect is that each peer can choose the size of the PlanetP network it wants to see according to its local processing power and bandwidth. Even in this adaptive environment, Rumorama manages to process a query such that the summary of each peer is considered exactly once in a network without churn. However, the actual number of peers to be contacted for a query is a small fraction of the total number of peers in the network.Within this article, we present the Rumorama base protocol, as well as experiments demonstrating the scalability and viability of the approach under churn.
