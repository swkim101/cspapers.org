In this paper, we show how to model the matching problem as a problem of joint inference. In opposite to existing approaches, we distinguish between the layer of labels and the layer of concepts and properties. Entities from both layers appear as first class citizens in our model. We present an example and explain the benefits of our approach. Moreover, we argue that our approach can be extended to generate correspondences involving complex concept descriptions.
