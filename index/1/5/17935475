We present decidability results for the verification of cryptographic protocols in the presence of equational theories corresponding toxor and Abelian groups. Since the perfect cryptography assumption is unrealistic for crypto graphic primitives with visible algebraic properties such as xor, we extend the conventional Dolev-Yao model by permitting the intruder to exploit these properties. We show that the reachability problem is NP-complete for the extended intruder theories in the cases of xor and Abelian groups. This result follows from a normal proof theorem. Then, we show how to lift this result in the xor case: we consider a symbolic constraint system expressing the reach ability (e.g., secrecy) problem for a finite number of sessions. We prove that such constraint system is decidable, relying in particular on an extension of combination algorithms for unification procedures. As a corollary, this enables automatic symbolic verification of cryptographic pro tocols employingxor for a fixed number of sessions.
