Educational quizzes are a powerful and popular tool to test the knowledge acquired by a learner and also to deepen her/his knowledge about a specific subject in an informal and entertaining way. Their production is a time-consuming task that can be automated by taking advantage of existing knowledge bases available on the Web of Linked Open Data (LOD). For these quizzes to be useful to learners, they must be generated according to the knowledge and skills defined by official educational standards for each subject and school year. This paper shows an approach to generate quizzes automatically according to the official French educational standards, from two different knowledge bases. Likewise, we show an evaluation of both knowledge bases.
