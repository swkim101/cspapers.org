We consider the power of cryptographic primitives, denoted f cryptogates, defined as follows: Alice and Bob have inputs x and y, respectively. Given a possibly probabilistic function, f (x ,y) , the f-cryptogate computes z +-f (x ,y ) and either broadcasts z to both parties (the symmetric case) or sends z exclusively to Bob (the asymmetric case); neither party learns more than what is provided by the f cryptogate. We say that an f-cryptogate is complete if, using information-theoretic notions of reductions, security and privacy, one can use the cryptogate to perform secure two-party computation. We give a number of characterizations of the complete f cryptogates, depending on the adversary model, whether the output of f is probabilistic or deterministic, and whether the cryptogate is symmetric or asymmetric. For active adversaries, who may violate the protocol, we characterize the complete asymmetric f-cryptogates for deterministic f. For passive adversaries, who always follow the protocol, we characterize the complete symmetric and asymmetric f-cryptogates for all deterministic and probabilistic f. Our characterizations for asymmetric cryptogates generalizes a recent theorem of Beimel, Malkin and Micali.
