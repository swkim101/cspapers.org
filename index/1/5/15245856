In this paper, we present a novel smartphone application designed to easily capture, visualize and reconstruct homes, offices and other indoor scenes. Our application leverages data from smartphone sensors such as the camera, accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer to help model the indoor scene. The output of the system is two-fold; first, an interactive visual tour of the scene is generated in real time that allows the user to explore each room and transition between connected rooms. Second, with some basic interactive photogrammetric modeling the system generates a 2D floor plan and accompanying 3D model of the scene, under a Manhattan-world assumption. The approach does not require any specialized equipment or training and is able to produce accurate floor plans.
