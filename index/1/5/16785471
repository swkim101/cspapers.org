RSSI-based indoor localization is getting much attention. Thanks to a number of researchers, the localization accuracy has already reached a sufficient level. However, it is still not easy-to-use technology because of its heavy installation cost. When an indoor localization system is installed, it needs to collect RSSI data for training classifiers. Existing techniques need to collect enough data at each location. This is why the installation cost is very heavy. We propose a technique to gather data efficiently by using machine learning techniques. Our proposed algorithm is based on multi-task learning and Bayesian optimization. This algorithm can remove the need to collect data of all location labels and select location labels to acquire new data efficiently. We verify this algorithm by using a Wi-Fi RSSI dataset collected in a building. The empirical results suggest that the algorithm is superior to an existing algorithm applying single-task learning and Active Class Selection.
