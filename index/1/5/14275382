This paper provides an analysis of the performance of an access control scheme recently proposed by Eswaran, Hamacher, and Shedler for a local bus network. The control scheme is simple and asynchronous, and provides for collision-free communication among ports of the network. It is also efficient in the use of the bus bandwidth, in the sense that there is only a small fraction of time during which the bus is idle when there is at least one packet available for transmission. The performance analysis emphasizes the characteristics of bus access response times at the individual ports.
