A shared bilingual word embedding space (SBWES) is an indispensable resource in a variety of cross-language NLP and IR tasks. A common approach to the SB-WES induction is to learn a mapping function between monolingual semantic spaces, where the mapping critically relies on a seed word lexicon used in the learning process. In this work, we analyze the importance and properties of seed lexicons for the SBWES induction across different dimensions (i.e., lexicon source, lexicon size, translation method, translation pair reliability). On the basis of our analysis, we propose a simple but effective hybrid bilingual word embedding (BWE) model. This model (HYBWE) learns the mapping be-tween two monolingual embedding spaces using only highly reliable symmetric translation pairs from a seed document-level embedding space. We perform bilingual lexicon learning (BLL) with 3 language pairs and show that by carefully selecting reliable translation pairs our new HYBWE model outperforms benchmarking BWE learning models, all of which use more expensive bilingual signals. Effectively, we demonstrate that a SBWES may be induced by leveraging only a very weak bilingual signal (document alignments) along with monolingual data.
