When road-level localization cannot satisfy people's need for convenience and safety driving, lane-level localization becomes a corner stone. In this paper, we propose a vehicle Lane-Level Localization (L^3) system, which utilizes smartphone sensors to real-time locate the vehicle on lane-level on highways. The system is based on the observation that each type of lane change has its unique pattern on the vehicle's lateral acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L^3 is both accurate and robust in real driving environments.
