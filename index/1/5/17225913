Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are today employed in a variety of applications, ranging from speech recognition to bioinformatics. In this paper, we present the List Viterbi training algorithm, a version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm based on the List Viterbi algorithm instead of the commonly used forward-backward algorithm. We developed the batch and online versions of the algorithm, and we also describe an interesting application in the context of keyword search over databases, where we exploit a HMM for matching keywords into database terms. In our experiments we tested the online version of the training algorithm in a semi-supervised setting that allows us to take into account the feedbacks provided by the users.
