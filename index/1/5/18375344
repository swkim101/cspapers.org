THE POWER OF BUTTERFLY-TYPE NETWORKS RELATIVE TO OTHER PROPOSED MULTI- COMPUTER INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS IS STUDIED, BY CONSIDERING HOW EFFICIENT- LY THE BUTTERFLY CAN SIMULATE THE OTHER NETWORKS. SIMULATION IS REPRESENT- ED FORMALLY VIA GRAPH EMBEDDINGS, SO THE TOPIC HERE BECOMES: HOW EFFICIENT- LY CAN ONE EMBED THE GRAPH UNDERLYING A GIVEN NETWORK IN THE GRAPH UNDERLY- ING THE BUTTERFLY NETWORK? THE EFFICIENCY OF AN EMBEDDING OF A GRAPH ''G'' IN A GRAPH ''H'' IS MEASURED IN TERMS OF: THE ''DILATION'', OR, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT ANY EDGE OF ''G'' IS "STRETCHED" BY THE EMBEDDING; THE EXPANSION, OR, THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF VERTICES OF ''H'' TO THE NUMBER OF VERTICES OF ''G''. THREE GENERAL RESULTS ABOUT EMBEDDINGS IN BUTTERFLY-TYPE GRAPHS ARE ESTABLISHED HERE, THAT EXPOSE A NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS BY BUTTERFLY-TYPE NETWORKS, WHICH ARE OPTIMAL (TO WITHIN CONSTANT FACTORS): 1) ANY COMPLETE BINARY TREE CAN BE EMBEDDED IN A BUTTERFLY GRAPH, WITH SIMULTANEOUS DILA- TION O(1) AND EXPANSION O(1). 2) ANY N-VERTEX GRAPH HAVING A (SQUARE ROOT OF 2-BIFURCATOR) OF SIZE (S = OMEGA(LOG N)) CAN BE EMBEDDED IN A BUTTERFLY GRAPH WITH SIMULTANEOUS DILATION O(LOG S) AND EXPANSION O(1). 3) ANY EMBED DING OF A PLANAR GRAPH ''G'' IN A BUTTERFLY GRAPH MUST HAVE DILATION (OMEGA(LOG SIGMA(G)/PHI(G)): SIGMA(G) IS THE SIZE OF THE SMALLEST 1/3-2/3 VERTEX-SEPARATOR OF G; PHI(G) IS THE SIZE OF G''S LARGEST INTERIOR FACE. COROLLARIES INCLUDE: A) O(LOG LOG N) AND EXPANSION O(1) EMBEDDED IN THE BU
