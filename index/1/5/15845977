This paper proposes a method for event tracking on broadcast news stories based on distinction between a topic and an event. A topic and an event are identified using a simple criterion called domain dependency of words: how greatly a word features a given set of data. The method was tested on the TDT corpus which has been developed by the TDT Pilot Study and the result can be regarded as promising the usefulness of the method.
