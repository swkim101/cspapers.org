Emerging indoor mobile computing environments seek to provide a user with an advanced set of communication-intensive applications, which require sustained quality of service in the presence of wireless channel error, user mobility, and scarce available resources. In this paper, we investigate two related approaches for the management of critical networking resources in indoor mobile computing environments:&bull; adaptively re-adjusting the quality of service within pre-negotiated bounds in order to accommodate network dynamics and user mobility.&bull; classifying cells based on location and handoff profiles, and designing advance resource reservation algorithms specific to individual cell characteristics.Preliminary simulation results are presented in order to validate the approaches for algorithmic design. A combination of the above approaches provide the framework for resource management in an ongoing indoor mobile computing environment project at the University of Illinois.
