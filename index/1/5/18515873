Recently, many instruments and systems related on the biological technology have been developed. Particularly, various researches for biological cell injection have been carried out. Generally, excessive contact force occurring when an end-effector and a biological cell contact might make a damage on the cell. Unfortunately, the excessive force could easily destroy the membrane and tissue of the cell. In order to overcome the problem, we have proposed a new injection system for biological cell manipulation. The proposed micro injection system can measure force in bio cell injection. Moreover it can transmit a measured force to operator by haptic device. In this research, we developed a micro end-effector for measurement of the injection force and a haptic device for transmission of bio cell injection force. Consequently, the proposed injection system could safely manipulate the biological cells without any damage. This paper presents the introduction of our new injection system and the design concept of the new micro end-effector and the haptic device. Through a series of experiments the proposed injection system shows the possibility of application for precision manipulation of the biological cell such as DNA.
