Bring your own device policies allow private phones to be used in corporate environments. Solutions with multiple operating system personalities aim at solving the tension between the user's needs and the corporate's security policies. These solutions succeed at isolating personal and corporate information at the data level. But thorough research of the security requirements on the user interface to handle different environments on one device is missing. In this work we define a threat model and derive the pre-requisites for a practical and secure user interface for mobile devices. We designed an UI framework which provides the mechanisms to handle multiple environments on a mobile device. Our design is applicable to several different virtualization solutions. We implemented a prototype that runs on a real device and evaluated it in terms of usability and security.
