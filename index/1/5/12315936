This paper proposes a novel context-aware method for analyzing sentiment at the level of individual sentences. Most existing machine learning approaches suffer from limitations in the modeling of complex linguistic structures across sentences and often fail to capture nonlocal contextual cues that are important for sentiment interpretation. In contrast, our approach allows structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and global contextual information. Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization. The context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited. Experiments on standard product review datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings.
