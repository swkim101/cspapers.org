We design and implement a novel embedded software engine, called EUI, to understand user intents from usage data within mobile devices. By developing the EUI engine in mobile devices, we expect to move towards "proactive" devices for mobile personalized services. To this end, we seek to embed the Open Directory Project (ODP) into mobile devices, and build a robust classifier with the embedded ODP. Thus, the EUI engine classifies the usage data within mobile devices into some ODP categories. Our implementation handles some challenging issues in embedding the ODP and building a robust classifier. The demonstration shows that our implementation understands the semantics of the usage data effectively.
