With increasing wireless communication applications, assigning dedicated spectral resource to each application is becoming impractical. Cognitive radios are emerging as a possible solution for enabling coexistence among networks and higher spectrum utilization by opportunistically using spectral holes through dynamic spectrum access schemes [1]. Since the spectral environment for a node can be highly dynamic and unstable due to mobility and spectrum sharing with other networks, medium access schemes must be flexible and adaptable in order to provide a stable and high Quality of Service (QoS). Classically, protocols are implemented in a monolithic fashion which restricts reconfigurability required in a dynamic spectrum access paradigm and mobile environment. One common approach for reconfiguration is by appropriately setting the parameters of a particular protocol such as the selection of the modulation and coding schemes in LTE [2]. MultiMAC [3] switches among a few pre-defined standalone protocols based on QoS requirements. Although these approaches aim at providing flexibility, the design choice is limited to the subset of the tunable parameter values and pre-selected options. In our demonstration, we will use a toolchain for runtime protocol realization (TRUMP) [4] which is built based on Decomposable MAC Framework [5]. It enables flexible adaptation of MAC behaviour on-the-fly resulting from spectral and network dynamics, mobility and varying QoS application demands. Reconfiguration at individual nodes may lead to possibly incoherent MAC schemes in a neighbourhood. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a cooperative mechanism where coexistence of different MAC solutions is allowed in the same network without disruption in communication links. Furthermore, the cooperative scheme allows the neighbouring nodes to adapt their MAC behaviour in order to maximize the performance characteristics. This is achieved through a controlling mechanism which monitors the MAC behaviour of its neighbours and disseminates this information. Demo This demonstration will provide an opportunity to the audience to interactively change the protocol configuration at individual nodes, spectral conditions and/or the network topology and correspondingly observe the resulting performance characteristics. The demonstration will show how our cooperative scheme enables MAC reconfiguration in a network neighbourhood. The demo will also show that our cooperative scheme allows nodes to reconfigure
