We demonstrate a new ad hoc routing method that can handle transience such as node-mobility, obstructions and node failures. It has controlled management overhead, and is platform-independent (our demo includes phones, routers, and laptops running different operating systems). It achieves reliability and flexibility at the expense of throughput. It is ideal for scenarios where the reliability of connectivity is critical and bandwidth requirements are low. For e.g., disaster relief operations and sensor networks. Along with applications, we exhibit measurements to illustrate the advantages of our approach in dealing with transience.
