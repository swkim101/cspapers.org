The flickering lights of content playing on TV screens in our living rooms are an all too familiar sight at night --- and one that many of us have paid little attention to with regards to the amount of information these diffusions may leak to an inquisitive outsider. In this paper, we introduce an attack that exploits the emanations of changes in light (e.g., as seen through the windows and recorded over 70 meters away) to reveal the programs we watch. Our empirical results show that the attack is surprisingly robust to a variety of noise signals that occur in real-world situations, and moreover, can successfully identify the content being watched among a reference library of tens of thousands of videos within several seconds. The robustness and efficiency of the attack can be attributed to the use of novel feature sets and an elegant online algorithm for performing index-based matches.
