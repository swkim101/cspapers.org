Citation Recommendation is useful for an author to find out the papers or books that can support the materials she is writing about. It is a challengeable problem since the vocabulary used in the content of papers and in the citation contexts are usually quite different. To address this problem, we propose to use translation model, which can bridge the gap between two heterogeneous languages. We conduct an experiment and find the translation model can provide much better candidates of citations than the state-of-the-art methods.
