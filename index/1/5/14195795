In this paper, we address the problem of recovering the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera or a group of cameras in a setting overlooking a traffic scene. Unlike many other settings, conventional camera calibration techniques are not applicable in this case. We present a method that uses certain geometric primitives commonly found in traffic scenes in order to recover calibration parameters. These primitives provide needed redundancy and are weighted depending on the significance of there corresponding image features. We show experimentally that these primitives are capable of achieving accurate results suitable for most traffic monitoring applications.
