The problem of getting the right data to the right place within a reasonable amount of time is one of the most challenging and important tasks facing the designer (and, in some cases, the user) of a large-scale general-purpose parallel machine. This is because the processors comprising a parallel machine need to communicate with each other (or with a common shared memory) in a tightly constrained fashion in order to solve most problems of interest in a timely fashion. Supporting this communication is often an expensive task, in terms of both hardware and time. In fact, most parallel machines devote a significant portion of their resources to handling communication between the processors and the memory.
