Daily work such as household chores are generally boring and monotonous and tend to be thought of as routine work. Work songs have been written and sung by workers to reduce their labor load. In addition, text-to-song synthesizer software such as Yamaha's VOCALOID is commonly used by a wide variety of computer music creators. We developed a real-time music synthesizer called -- conteXinger -- that sings lyrics based on the listener's context, including the use of home appliances (such as a vacuum cleaner, refrigerator, microwave oven, or dish washer), and Internet information (such as SNS messages, Web news, and weather reports). By presenting the synthesized music to a user through a home audio system or headphones, our system entertains users who may be bored from their everyday work routine.
