In this work we leverage the advantages of the Chord DHT to build a content-based publish-subscribe system that is scalable, self-organizing, and well-performing. However, DHTs provide very good support only for exact-match, equality predicates and range predicates are expected to be very popular when specifying subscriptions in pub/sub systems We will thus also provide solutions supporting efficiently subscriptions with range predicates in Chordbased pub/sub systems.
