Today, software components are traded on markets in form of services. These services can be service compositions consisting of several services. If a software architect wants to provide such a service composition in the market for trade, she needs to perform several tasks: she needs to model the composition, to discover existing services to be part of that composition, and to analyze the composition's functional correctness as well as its quality, e.g., performance. Up to now, the architect needed to find and use different tools for these tasks. Typically, these tools are not interoperable with each other. We provide the tool SeSAME that supports a software architect in all of these tasks. SeSAME is an integrated Eclipse-based tool-suite providing a comprehensive service specification language to model service compositions and existing services. Furthermore, it includes modules for service matching, functional analysis, and non-functional analysis. SeSAME is the first tool that integrates all these tasks into one tool-suite and, thereby, provides holistic support for trading software services. Thus, it contributes to the acceptance and success of a service market.
