Infomaster is an information integration system that provides integrated access to multiple distributed heterogeneous information sources on the Internet, thus giving the illusion of a centralized, homogeneous information system. We say that Infomaster creates a virtual data warehouse. The core of Infomaster is a facilitator that dynamically determines an efficient way to answer the user's query using as few sources as necessary and harmonizes the heterogeneities among these sources. Infomaster handles both structural and content translation to resolve differences between multiple data sources and the multiple applications for the collected data. Infomaster connects to a variety of databases using wrappers, such as for Z39.50, SQL databases through ODBC, EDI transactions, and other World Wide Web (WWW) sources. There are several WWW user interfaces to Infomaster, including forms based and textual. Infomaster also includes a programmatic interface and it can download results in structured form onto a client computer. Infomaster has been in production use for integrating rental housing advertisements from several newspapers (since fall 1995), and for meeting room scheduling (since winter 1996). Infomaster is also being used to integrate heterogeneous electronic product catalogs.
