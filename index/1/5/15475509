Information spreads across social media, bringing heterogeneous social networks interconnected and diffusion patterns varied in different topics of information. Studying such cross-population diffusion in various context helps us understand trends of information diffusion in a more accurate and consistent way. In this study, we focus on real-world news diffusion across online social systems such as mainstream news (News), social networking sites (SNS), and blogs (Blog), and we analyze behavioral patterns of the systems in terms of activity, reactivity, and heterogeneity. We found that News is the most active, SNS is the most reactive, and Blog is the most persistent, which governs time-evolving heterogeneity of these systems. Finally, we interpret the discovered crowd phenomena from various angles using our previous model-free and model-driven approaches, showing that the strength and directionality of influence reflect the behavioral patterns of the systems in news diffusion.
