The spring-mass locomotion paradigm is showing great promise as a template for agile and efficient robots. Efficiency and stability are enabled by the passive generation of locomotion patterns, rather than enforced by the control system. However, as leg designs develop more articulation and complexity, a problem arises: how do we implement a chosen set of passive dynamics in complex hardware? We present compliance and impact inertia analyses in a “visually tactile” way, allowing complex and redundant mechanism designs to be easily evaluated. The patterns shown here begin a framework for the comprehensive design of agile, highly dynamic robots.
