Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions concerning the values taken by the input features. It has been shown that rule ensembles for classification can be learnt optimally and efficiently using hierarchical kernel learning approaches that explore the exponentially large space of conjunctions by exploiting its hierarchical structure. The regularizer employed penalizes large features and thereby selects a small set of short features. In this paper, we generalize the rule ensemble learning using hierarchical kernels (RELHKL) framework to multi class structured output spaces. We build on the StructSVM model for sequence prediction problems and employ a œÅ-norm hierarchical regularizer for observation features and a conventional 2-norm regularizer for state transition features. The exponentially large feature space is searched using an active set algorithm and the exponentially large set of constraints are handled using a cutting plane algorithm. The approach can be easily extended to other structured output problems. We perform experiments on activity recognition datasets which are prone to noise, sparseness and skewness. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms other approaches.
