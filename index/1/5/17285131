A generation method of scenarios using differential information between normal scenarios is presented. Behaviours of normal scenarios belonging to the same problem domain are quite similar. We derive the differential information between them and apply the information to generate new alternative/exceptional scenarios. Our method will be illustrated with examples. This paper describes (1) a language for describing scenarios in which simple action traces are embellished to include typed frames based on a simple case grammar of actions, (2) introduction of the differential scenario, and (3) examples of scenario generation using the differential scenario.
