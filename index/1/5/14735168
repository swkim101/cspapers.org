We tackle the problem of photometric stereo under near point lighting in this paper. Different from the conventional formulation of photometric stereo that assumes parallel lighting, photometric stereo under the near point lighting condition is a nonlinear problem as the local surface normals are coupled with its distance to the camera as well as the light sources. To solve this non-linear problem of PS with near point lighting, a local/global mesh deformation approach is developed in our work to determine the position and the orientation of a facet simultaneously, where each facet is corresponding to a pixel in the image captured by the camera. Unlike nonlinear optimization schemes, the mesh deformation in our approach is decoupled into an iteration of interlaced steps of local projection and global blending. Experimental results verify that our method can generate accurate estimation of surface shape under near point lighting in a few iterations. Besides, this approach is robust to errors on the positions of light sources and is easy to be implemented.
