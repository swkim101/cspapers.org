In the last years many logics of nonmonotonicity have been developed using various different formalisms and axiomatizations which makes them very difficult to compare. We develop a classification scheme for these logics using only a few simple concepts and axioms based on conditional logics, properties of partial preorders of possible states (worlds) and centering assumptions. Our framework (the P-Systems) allows us to discuss the similarities, main differences and possible extensions of these logics in a simple and natural way.
