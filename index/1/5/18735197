This paper presents a teaching model based on information technology-applied instructions. The new education tool, interactive response system (IRS), was applied in this model. Advantages and difficulties in applying the system were described first. Then two styles of teaching models were developed in this study. The first is the "IRS with peer-discussion model (IRS-PDM) ", and the second is the "IRS with incentives-instruction model (IRS-IIM) ". Both of these two education models were implemented in the formal and informal education place. The results indicated that the information technology-applied education model with the interactive response systems can effectively increase the learning effect than the traditional teaching methods.
