We address the problem of middleware design for constructing ATM LAN based distributed industrial plant monitoring and control systems. In particular, we present a real-time client-server programming model based on a uniform ATM network. This model is being realized in our middleware called MidART. The middleware provides a set of industrial application specific but network transparent programming abstractions and application programming interface (API) that support individual application QoS requirements. In order to achieve on-demand transmission of plant data, we have developed a concept called selective real-time channels to be supported by MidART. We present the design and protocols of selective real-time channels and describe how QoS requirements of applications are guaranteed.
