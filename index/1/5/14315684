Decentralized online social networks (OSNs) typically rely on the existence of a public key infrastructure (PKI), but certificate authorities (CAs) cannot scalably identify all of the members of an OSN. Our system, LoKI, uses the ubiquity of mobile devices to exchange secrets during real-world meetings that can be used for the purposes of identification in-band, allowing each user to easily discover the keys of many one-hop relationships in the OSN. We measure the frequency of such real-world meetings among OSN users with data sets crawled from Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare. We quantify the resources consumed on the mobile devices in terms of storage and battery based on traces that reveal the number of mobile devices expected to be seen under normal activity. Lastly, we describe a rendezvous service that enables background peer-to-peer (P2P) communication on non-rooted Android phones, which we believe to be a practical and necessary service for many mobile peer-to-peer systems.
