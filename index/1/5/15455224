An experimental system of programs is described which places logic gates on a chip, globally wires the gates and then optimizes the power required to drive them. Further power reductions are realized by using power-oriented placement improvement techniques. A companion paper describes how the optimization is accomplished by using the timing requirements of the chip as constraints and assigning delays to the logic gates so that these constraints are met and the power is minimized.
