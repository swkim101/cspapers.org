In this paper, we analyze and solve the problem of image-based visual servoing system under large initial pose error. In this case we must consider camera field of view and the violation of the assumption of image-based visual servoing. Control-law is derived from linear approximation of the image error between the gripper and the target object. To solve this problem, we propose a unified image-based control strategy with a new image space named as virtual image plane (VIP). And next we propose an image-based control-law by decoupling the translation and rotation motion of the large pose error The remarkable property of our method is that we only use the combination of the image features in the 2D image space. Finally we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system through experiments using a six-DOF robot equipped with a stereo camera.
