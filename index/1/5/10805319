In this paper, we propose a first application of data mining techniques to propositional satisfiability. Our proposed mining based compression approach aims to discover and to exploit hidden structural knowledge for reducing the size of propositional formulae in conjunctive normal form (CNF). It combines both frequent itemset mining techniques and Tseitin's encoding for a compact representation of CNF formulae. The experimental evaluation of our approach shows interesting reductions of the sizes of many application instances taken from the last SAT competitions.
