Botnets constitute a serious security problem. A lot of effort has been invested towards understanding them better, while developing and learning how to deploy effective counter-measures against them. Their study via various analysis, modelling and experimental methods are integral parts of the development cycle of any such botnet mitigation schemes. It also constitutes a vital part of the process of understanding present threats and predicting future ones. Currently, the most popular of these techniques are "in-the-wild" botnet studies, where researchers interact directly with real-world botnets. This approach is less than ideal, for many reasons that we discuss in this paper, including scientific validity, ethical and legal issues. Consequently, we present an alternative approach employing "in the lab" experiments involving at-scale emulated botnets. We discuss the advantages of such an approach over reverse engineering, analytical modelling, simulation and in-the-wild studies. Moreover, we discuss the requirements that facilities supporting them must have. We then describe an experiment in which we emulated a 3000-node, fully-featured version of the Waledac botnet, complete with an emulated command and control (C&C) infrastructure. By observing the load characteristics and yield (rate of spamming) of such a botnet, we can draw interesting conclusions about its real-world operations and design decisions made by its creators. Furthermore, we conducted experiments with sybil attacks launched against it and verified their viability. However, we were able to determine that mounting such attacks is not so simple: high resource consumption can cause havoc and partially neutralise them. Finally, we were able to repeat the attacks with varying parameters, in an attempt to optimise them. The merits of this experimental approach is underlined since by the fact that it would have been difficult to obtain these results by other methods.
