Kernel-based regularized learning seeks a model in a hypothesis space by minimizing the empirical error and the model's complexity. Based on the representer theorem, the solution consists of a linear combination of translates of a kernel. This paper investigates a generalized form of representer theorem for kernel-based learning. After mapping predefined features and translates of a kernel simultaneously onto a hypothesis space by a specific way of constructing kernels, we proposed a new algorithm by utilizing a generalized regularizer which leaves part of the space unregularized. Using a squared-loss function in calculating the empirical error, a simple convex solution is obtained which combines predefined features with translates of the kernel. Empirical evaluations have confirmed the effectiveness of the algorithm for supervised learning tasks.
