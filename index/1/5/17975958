Mapping and classification of chemical compound names are important aspects of the tasks of BioNLP. This paper introduces the architecture of a system for the syntactic and semantic analysis of such names. Our system aims at yielding both the denoted chemical structure and a classification of a given name. We employ a novel approach to the task which promises an elegant and efficient way of solving the problem. The proposed system differs significantly from existing systems, in that it is also able to deal with underspecifying names and class names.
