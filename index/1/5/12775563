The paper studies the problem of a group of hexagonal-shaped metamorphic modules enveloping a static one-cell target. A distributed reconfiguration strategy is proposed for each module to achieve the objective. The strategy guarantees that the system successfully evolves without collisions despite of the absence of centralized planning and global information exchange. The correctness of the algorithm is verified theoretically. An upper-bound of converging time based on the proposed algorithm is provided as well. Simulations well validate the results we obtain.
