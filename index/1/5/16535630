The proposed research effort explores the development of active cells - simple contractile electromechanical units that can be used as the material basis for larger articulable structures. Each cell, which might be considered a “muscle unit”, consists of a contractile Nitinol SMA core with conductive terminals. Large numbers of these cells might be combined and externally powered to change phase, contracting to either articulate with a large strain or increase the stiffness of the ensemble, depending on the cell design. Unlike traditional work in modular robotics, the approach presented here focuses on cells that have a simplistic design and function, are inexpensive to fabricate, and are eventually scalable to sub-millimeter sizes, working towards our vision of robot structures that can be custom-fabricated from large numbers of general cell units, similar to biological structures.
