Undergraduate teaching assistants have been used in many classes, over many years, and at many institutions. The literature primarily focuses on the practice in a university environment with large classes. We focus instead on the use of undergraduate teaching assistants in the small college, small class environment. We have been employing students in this capacity for over 15 years and have gained some insight on how best to use these undergraduate teaching assistants in the small classroom setting. We believe these conclusions can inform the design of other undergraduate teaching assistant programs.
