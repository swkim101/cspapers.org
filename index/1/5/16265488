As the rate of cloud computing adoption grows, so does the need for consumption assistance. Enterprises looking to migrate their IT systems to the cloud require assistance in identifying providers that offer resources with the most appropriate pricing and performance levels to match their specific business needs. In this paper, we present Smart Cloud Broker - a suite of software tools that allows cloud infrastructure consumers to evaluate and compare the performance of different Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings from competing cloud service providers, and consequently supports selection of the cloud configuration and provider with the specifications that best meet the user's requirements. Using Smart Cloud Broker, prospective cloud users can estimate the performance of the different cloud platforms by running live tests against representative benchmark applications under representative load conditions.
