Many program analyses can be reduced to graph reachability problems involving a limited form of context-free language reachability called Dyck-CFL reachability. We show a new reduction from Dyck-CFL reachability to set constraints that can be used in practice to solve these problems. Our reduction is much simpler than the general reduction from context-free language reachability to set constraints. We have implemented our reduction on top of a set constraints toolkit and tested its performance on a substantial polymorphic flow analysis application.
