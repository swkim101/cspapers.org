In object tracking, change of objects aspect is the most important cause of failure. This paper proposes a modified template matching approach to solve this problem without a priori learning of object views. This method permits to track non-rigid objects in real-time by employing a weighted template, which is dynamically updated, and a hierarchical framework that integrates all the components of the tracker. The capability of the tracking system to handle partial occlusions and target distortions is demonstrated for several video sequences.
