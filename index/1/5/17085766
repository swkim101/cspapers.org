A new architecture is proposed for the effective use of program memory in highly parallel applications. This architecture is particularly suited (but not limited) to being built with standard microprocessors. This architecture utilizes a combination of the state switching idea of the SIMD organization and the multiple data stream idea of MIMD organizations. Through scheduling, the program segments are broadcast at the times required to achieve efficient utilization of the parallel processing array. Relationships are developed to determine, for a given application, if this architecture is more cost effective than comparable SIMD and MIMD organizations.
