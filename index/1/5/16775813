This poster introduces MoveLoc, a system that locates a moving object without carrying any devices from detecting Doppler shifts reflected off the moving object. It works even if the object walking or running in different directions without any training. MoveLoc does not require the user to carry any communication devices, yet its accuracy exceeds current moving object localization systems using Radio Signal Strength(RSS). We implement the system and evaluate the performance on moving person by experiments. Experimental result shows that MoveLoc achieves an average location accuracy of 0.69 meters and reduces the equipment deployment density compared with other known wireless moving object localization approaches using RSS.
