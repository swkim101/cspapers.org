Adaptively Controlled Explicit Simulation (ACES) is a timing simulation methodology for integrated circuits and systems. The paper presents the use of event driven simulation and partitioning to enhance the ACES simulation environment by exploiting the latency present in integrated circuits. ACES also uses an improved, adaptively controlled explicit integration approximation which overcomes the stability problems encountered in earlier explicit techniques. Piecewise linear models are used for nonlinear devices allowing efficient simulation of MOS, BiMOS and bipolar circuits.
