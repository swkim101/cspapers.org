Solving technical problems with complex systems and integrating the many technologies employed in these multifaceted structures has been a recurring theme in Smart Cities research. This paper presents an analysis of the reason this problem has been so well explored but persists with no solution widely available. The problem is viewed as a combination of Smart City needs, governance, and increasingly technically difficult decisions. The paper describes the requirements that must be met to develop a framework that can address this seeming intractable and expanding integration concern, identifies the governance processes that can be used to address this problem, and to manage integration in Smart Cities, The solution proposed is a formalized accepted and managed technology regulated environment introduced by governance groups composed of city planners/managers, citizen, stake holders, and technology delivery organizations. The solution requirements dictate the establishment of a standard that would guide the development and usage of automated, autonomous components, integrating dynamically with software agents. All of this working to rapidly optimize shared resources through error handling processes executing largely at no cost except those of processing time, meeting safety guidelines, satisfying operational monitoring needs, and meeting post issue liability guidelines. This technical standard would obligate developers and vendors to meet safety standards and accept liability for malfeasance. As initiating steps, Smart City managers must come together and establish a basic understanding of the goals and regulations, and the methodologies for implementing them.
