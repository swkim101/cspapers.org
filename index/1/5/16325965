Previous studies have reported significant educational benefits from the use of pair-programming, in which two students program together at the same computer. Here, we report the results of a controlled study designed to measure the effects of pair-programming on the development of individual programming ability. Our findings indicate significant improvements in individual programming skill for students with lower SAT scores. Additionally, we found that all students are more likely to complete the course successfully when using pair-programming.
