A number of code transformations for embedded multimedia applications is presented in this paper and their impact on both system power and performance is evaluated. In terms of power the transformations move the accesses from the large background memories to small buffers that can be kept foreground. This leads to reduction of the memory related power consumption that forms the dominant part of the total power budget of such systems. The transformations also affect the code size and the systemâ€™s performance which is usually the overriding issue in embedded systems. The impact of the transformations to the performance is analyzed in detail. The code parameters related to the performance of the system and the way they are affected by the transformations are identified. This allows for the development of a systematic methodology for the application of code transformations that achieve an optimal balance between power and performance.
