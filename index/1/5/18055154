This paper describes work in progress to use clustering to create a lexicon of words that engage in the lexico-semantic relationship known as grading. While other resources like thesauri and taxonomies exist detailing relationships such as synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy, we do not know of any thorough resource for grading. This work focuses on identifying the words that may participate in this relationship, paving the way for the creation of a true grading lexicon later.
