The close relationship between programming language syntax, context-free grammars (abbreviated cfgs), parsing, and compiling is well-known and is extensively discussed in [1]. Unfortunately, many of the problems about programming languages, one might wish to solve, are equivalent to undecidable grammar problems. Two especially important such problems are (1) the emptiness of intersection problem, i.e. determining if the intersection of the languages generated by a pair of grammars is empty, and (2) the grammar class membership problem, i.e. determining for a fixed class of grammars r and a grammar G, if G is an element of T.
