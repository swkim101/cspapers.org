Adaplex is an integrated language for programming database applications. It results from the embedding of the database sublanguage DAPLEX in the general purpose programming language Ada. This paper provides an overview of the DDM: a distributed database manager (DDM) that supports the use of Adaplex as an interface language. The important technical innovations we have incorporated in the design of this system include:1. An advanced data model that captures more application semantics than conventional data models.2. Support for flexible data distribution options that improve locality of reference and efficiency of query processing.3. Extensive query optimization that combines compile time access path optimization with run time site selection.4. Efficient transaction management that reduces transaction conflicts and improves the resiliency of replicated data.5. Robust, incremental recovery management that provides for automatic recovery from certain "catastrophic" failure conditions.
