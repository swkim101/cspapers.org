To achieve high-rate image data compression while maintainig a high quality reconstructed image, a good image model and an efficient way to represent the specific data of each image must be introduced. Based on the physiological knowledge of multi - channel characteristics and inhibitory interactions between them in the human visual system, a mathematically coherent parallel architecture for image data compression which utilizes the Markov random field Image model and interactions between a vast number of filter banks, is proposed.
