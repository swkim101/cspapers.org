This paper presents a novel method for trajectory generation based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) treated from a control theoretical perspective. We extended the key ideas from the original DMP formalism by introducing a velocity convergence mechanism in the reformulated system. Theoretical proof is given to guarantee its validity. The new method can deal with complex paths as a whole. Based on this, we can generate smooth trajectories with automatically generated transition zones, satisfy position- and velocity boundary conditions at start and endpoint with high precision, and support multiple via-point applications. Theoretic proof of this method and experiments are presented.
