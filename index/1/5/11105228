The Eden distributed system has been running at the University of Washington for over two years. Most of the principles and implementation ideas of Eden have been adequately discussed in the literature [4]. This paper presents some of the experience that has been gained from the implementation and use of Eden. Much of this experience is relevant to other distributed systems, even though they may be based on different assumptions.
