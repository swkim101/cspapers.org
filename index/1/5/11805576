Face recognition is one of the most popular research problems on various platforms. New research issues arise when it comes to resource constrained devices, such as smart glasses, due to the overwhelming computation and energy requirements of the accurate face recognition methods. In this paper, we have prototyped a robust and efficient sensor-assisted face recognition system on smart glasses by exploring the power of multimodal sensors including the camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. Evaluation shows that the prototyped system is up to 10% more accurate than the state-of-the-art face recognition methods while its computational cost is in the same order as an efficient benchmark method (e.g., Eigenface).
