This work addresses the optimal selection of propulsion components for a multi-rotor aerial vehicle (MRAV), for a given payload, payload capacity, number of rotors and flight duration. A steady state model is developed for motors, propellers, electronic speed controllers (ESC), and batteries, using a simplified analysis. Based on technical specifications of batteries, motors and ESCs, component functional parameters are expressed as a function of an equivalent length. Propeller models are developed using experimental data. An optimization program is developed, which calculates the optimal design vector, employing as objective function the energy consumption or the vehicle diameter. Using this program, the influence of the payload and of the number of rotors on the design vector and the MRAV size is studied. The results obtained by the program were compared successfully to existing commercial MRAVs.
