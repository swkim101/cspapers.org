The utilization of large scale parallel event simulators such as SST/macro requires that skeleton models of underlying software systems and architectures be created. Implementing such models by abstracting the designs of large scale parallel applications requires a substantial manual effort and introduces the hazards of human errors. We outline an approach for the automatic extraction of SST/macro skeleton models from large scale parallel applications. Our methodology for deriving SST/macro skeleton models is based on the use of extensible and open-source ROSE compiler infrastructure. The SST/macro skeleton models are then combined with appropriate models of the network and hardware configurations.
