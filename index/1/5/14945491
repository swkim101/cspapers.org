UNIX turns 40 this year: many happy returns! Four decades is a vast period for the computing industry: systems from the 1970s now seem rudimentary and primitive. And yet, the early versions of UNIX were epitomes of sophisticated concepts packaged into elegant systems. UNIX' influence has been so powerful that it reverberates down to affect us in the 21st century. 
 
The history of the development of UNIX has been well documented, and over the past decade or so, efforts have been made to find and conserve the software and documentation artifacts from the earliest period of UNIX history. This paper details the work that has been done to restore the artifacts from this time to working order and the lessons learned from this work.
