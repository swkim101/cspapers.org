The information available in languages other than English on the World Wide Web is increasing significantly. To cross language boundaries between different languages, dictionaries are the most typical tools. However, the general-purpose dictionary is less sensitive in genre and domain and it is impractical to manually construct tailored bilingual dictionaries or sophisticated multilingual thesauri for large applications. Corpus-based approaches, which do not have the limitation of dictionaries, provide a statistical translation model to cross the language boundary. The objective of this research work is to mine English/Chinese parallel documents automatically from the World Wide Web and generate a crosslingual concept space automatically for cross-lingual information retrieval. The alignment method is developed based on dynamic programming to identify the one-to-one Chinese and English title pairs for building parallel corpus. The Hopfield network is then employed to generate the cross-lingual concept space based on the statistical correlation analysis of the semantics (knowledge) embedded in the bilingual press release corpus. The research output consisted of a thesaurus-like, semantic network knowledge base, which can aid in semantics-based cross-lingual information management and retrieval.
