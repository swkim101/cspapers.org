We are investigating the claim that object- oriented analysis (OOA) requirements models can be changed, reused, and integrated more easily than other kinds ofrequirements models. In thispaper, we describe one part of that investigation: an experiment involving an OOA method in which the requirementsfor an automated teller machine (ATM) system are changed and the effects on the model are assessed.
