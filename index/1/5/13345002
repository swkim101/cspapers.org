There are a number of data manipulation requirements common to most decision support (DSS) systems; these requirements are currently being addressed through the use of sophisticated decision support engines working in conjunction with the RDBMS. Since RDBMSS are the preferred data storage layer for DSS, there is an opportunity to provide many of the most frequent data manipulation requirements within the database. Recommendations on how decision support functionality should be partitioned between the RDBMS engine and the DSS application will be presented.
