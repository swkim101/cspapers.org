An omni-directional anchoring mechanism is presented that can withstand forces greater than 100 N on natural rock surfaces. The anchor builds upon previous development of microspine toes for climbing robots. This work utilizes an opposed octagonal scissor configuration with rows of 30 toes on each lever arm, splayed around a central housing. This anchor design is being developed for the Lemur IIb mobile robot. The anchor can also be used to support a coring drill. The work enables both mobility and sampling in microgravity environments, like the surface of Near Earth Asteroids.
