We analyze various stochastic processes for generating permutations almost uniformlv at random in distributed and parallel systems. All our protocols are simple, elegant and epling, and for the third one we prove the existence of a non-Markovian coupling. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial applications of non-Markovian coupling for proving rapid m&g of Markov chains. We annlv our analvsis in diverse areas. We develon a simple permutation network of a polylogarithmic depth generating permutations with almost uniform distribution. A simple EREW PRAM algorithm generating random permutations in time O(log log n) with O(nlogâ€™(r) n) processors follows. We improve technique of cryptographic defense against traffic analysis by showing that the underlying stochastic urocess converees in time Oflonnl finstead of ~olvlogarith-mic time) and <hereby dram&i&lly reduce the she bf a security parameter. Other applications include load sharing in distributed systems, design of fault resistant systems, and parallel algorithms generating random permutations for models with restricted concurrent writes/reads.
