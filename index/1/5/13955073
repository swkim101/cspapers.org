DAGger is a clustering algorithm for uncertain data. In contrast to prior work, DAGger can work on arbitrarily correlated data and can compute both exact and approximate clusterings with error guarantees.
 We demonstrate DAGger using a real-world scenario in which partial discharge data from UK Power Networks is clustered to predict asset failure in the energy network.
