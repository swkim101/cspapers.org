We introduce a method of partitioning for massively-parallel hardware accelerated functional verification. Our approach augments classical hypergraph partitioning to model temporal dependencies that maximize parallelization within the instruction memories of the machine. Simulation depth is further reduced by optimizing path criticality and cut directionality. Our techniques are demonstrated on an industrial accelerator containing 262,144 parallel processors, and benchmarked across designs containing up to 200 million gates.
