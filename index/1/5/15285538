In this talk, we highlight two topics on security from our lab. First, we address the problem of Internet traffic classification (e.g. web, filesharing, or botnet?). We present a fundamentally different approach to classifying traffic that studies the network wide behavior by modeling the interactions of users as a graph. By contrast, most previous approaches use statistics such as packet sizes and inter-packet delays. We show how our approach gives rise to novel and powerful ways to: (a) visualize the traffic, (b) model the behavior of applications, and (c) detect abnormalities and attacks. Extending this approach, we develop ENTELECHEIA, a botnet-detection method. Tests with real data suggests that our graph-based approach is very promising. Second, we present, MyPageKeeper, a security Facebook app, with 13K downloads, which we deployed to: (a) quantify the presence of malware on Facebook, and (b) protect end-users. We designed MyPageKeeper in a way that strikes the balance between accuracy and scalability. Our initial results are scary and interesting: (a) malware is widespread, with 49% of our users are exposed to at least one malicious post from a friend, and (b) roughly 74% of all malicious posts contain links that point back to Facebook, and thus would evade any of the current web-based filtering approaches.
