COMPUCON, “<underline>Compu</underline>ter Aided Information System for Component <underline>Con</underline>struction”, utilizes the Heathkit concept in its development incorporating a 'circuit board' into which are plugged a series of program modules. Three dimensional graphic representations are generated in conjunction with pertinent physical, performance, and cost criteria. Three configurations are developed and compared, assisting in the evaluation of tradeoffs between the physical form, cost and performance data.
