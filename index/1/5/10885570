A design method of inverse optimal tracking controllers is proposed for nonholonomic mobile robots with two actuated wheels. In the inverse optimal control approach, a controller is designed by using a control Lyapunov function and Sontag's formula. The controller minimizes some meaningful cost dependent on the controller which is not given in advance, and the designed system has a stability margin which guarantees robustness with respect to input uncertainties. The robust property is a very important issue for real applications. Several simulation and experimental results show the ability of the proposed controller by comparing with an existing method.
