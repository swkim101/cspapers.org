This paper compares the performance of an SQL solution that implements a relational data model with a document store named MongoDB. We report on the performance of a single node configuration of each data store and assume the database is small enough to fit in main memory. We analyze utilization of the CPU cores and the network bandwidth to compare the two data stores. Our key findings are as follows. First, for those social networking actions that read and write a small amount of data, the join operator of the SQL solution is not slower than the JSON representation of MongoDB. Second, with a mix of actions, the SQL solution provides either the same performance as MongoDB or outperforms it by 20%. Third, a middle-tier cache enhances the performance of both data stores as query result look up is significantly faster than query processing with either system.
