A key role of virtualization is to give an illusion that a consolidated workload runs on a dedicated machine although the underlying resources are actively shared by multiple workloads. Technical advances have enabled a virtual machine (VM) to exercise many shared resources of a machine in a transparent and isolated manner. However, such an illusion of resource dedication has not been supported for the last-level cache (LLC), although the LLC is the largest on-chip shared resource with a significant performance impact. In this paper, we propose vCache-architectural support to provide a transparent and isolated virtual LLC (vLLC) for each VM and interfaces to manage the vLLC. More specifically, this study first proposes architectural support for the guest OS of a VM to index the LLC with its guest physical address instead of a host physical address. This in turn allows that the guest OS transparently view its vLLC and preserve the effectiveness of its page placement policy. Second, this study extends the architectural support for each VM to keep its vLLC strongly isolated from other VMs. Such resource dedication is critical to offer performance isolation and preserve vLLC transparency for each VM in a highly consolidated machine. With little hardware overhead, vCache can facilitate various unchartered vLLC capacity-based services for the public clouds while providing up to 17% higher performance than a traditional virtualized system.
