This paper presents the Tact hand-an anthropomorphic, open-source, myoelectric prosthetic hand that was designed for use by people with transradial amputations in developing countries. This hand matches or exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art myoelectric prosthetic hands, but costs two orders of magnitude less ($250) and is easy to manufacture with a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts. We describe our design process, evaluate the Tact hand with both qualitative and quantitative measures of performance, and show examples of using this hand to grasp household objects.
