Nonmonotonic formalisms and belief revision operators have been introduced as useful tools to describe and reason about evolving scenarios Both approaches have been proven effective in a number of different situations. However, little is known about their relationship Previous work by Winslett has shown some correlations between a specific operator and circumscription In this paper we greatly extend Winslett's work by establishing new relations between circumscription and a large number of belief revision operators. This highlights similarities and differences between these formalisms Furthermore these connections provide us with the possibility of importing results in one field into the other one.
