We present an approach to Arabic automatic diacritization that integrates syntactic analysis with morphological tagging through improving the prediction of case and state features. Our best system increases the accuracy of word diacritization by 2.5% absolute on all words, and 5.2% absolute on nominals over a state-of-theart baseline. Similar increases are shown on the full morphological analysis choice.
