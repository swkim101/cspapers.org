We propose a weighted variational model to estimate both the reflectance and the illumination from an observed image. We show that, though it is widely adopted for ease of modeling, the log-transformed image for this task is not ideal. Based on the previous investigation of the logarithmic transformation, a new weighted variational model is proposed for better prior representation, which is imposed in the regularization terms. Different from conventional variational models, the proposed model can preserve the estimated reflectance with more details. Moreover, the proposed model can suppress noise to some extent. An alternating minimization scheme is adopted to solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with its algorithm. Compared with other variational methods, the proposed method yields comparable or better results on both subjective and objective assessments.
