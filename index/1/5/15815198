The Vienna Development Method (VDM) has been employed by Dansk Datamatik Center (DDC) on a large-scale, industrial Ada compiler development project. VDM is a formal specification and development method in that it insists on the initial specifications and all design steps being expressed in a formal (mathematically based) notation.
 This paper gives an overview of how VDM was used in the various steps of the DDC Ada project, and we guide the reader through the steps involved from the initial formal specification of Ada down to the actually coded multipass compiler. Finally we report on the quantitative and qualitative experiences we have gained, both as regards the technical suitability of VDM for the project and as regards the implications on software management and quality assurance.
