In this work, we use a large text corpus to order nouns by their level of specificity. This semantic information can for most nouns be determined with over 80% accuracy using simple statistics from a text corpus without using any additional sources of semantic knowledge. This kind of semantic information can be used to help in automatically constructing or augmenting a lexical database such as WordNet.
