The digital design process will go through a major change over the next several years. Semiconductor process technology has started to allow IC complexities of todayâ€™s complete systems, resulting in scaling of circuit boards into single ICs. Core-based design, also known as IP-based (Intellectual Property) design or Systemon-a-chip design, is seen as the only viable solution to handle the increasing design complexity with short product design duration. This paper presents an analysis of Core-based Design in the context of a proposed lifecycle.
