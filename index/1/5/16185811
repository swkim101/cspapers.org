To reduce this expensive computational complexity, we apply Kronecker products to handle the matrix completion problem. In particular, we propose using Kronecker factorization, which approximates a matrix by the Kronecker product of several matrices of smaller sizes. Weintroduce Kronecker factorization into the soft-impute framework and devise an effective matrix completion algorithm.Especially when the factorized matrices have about the samesizes, the computational complexity of our algorithm is improved substantially.
