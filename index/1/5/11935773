Given a health-related question (such as "I have a bad stomach ache. What should I do?"), a medical self-diagnosis Android inquires further information from the user, diagnoses the disease, and ultimately recommend best solutions. One practical challenge to build such an Android is to ask correct questions and obtain most relevant information, in order to correctly pinpoint the most likely causes of health conditions. In this paper, we tackle this challenge, named "relevant symptom question generation": Given a limited set of patient described symptoms in the initial question (e.g., "stomach ache"), what are the most critical symptoms to further ask the patient, in order to correctly diagnose their potential problems? We propose an augmented long short-term memory (LSTM) framework, where the network architecture can naturally incorporate the inputs from embedding vectors of patient described symptoms and an initial disease hypothesis given by a predictive model. Then the proposed framework generates the most important symptom questions. The generation process essentially models the conditional probability to observe a new and undisclosed symptom, given a set of symptoms from a patient as well as an initial disease hypothesis. Experimental results show that the proposed model obtains improvements over alternative methods by over 30% (both precision and mean ordinal distance).
