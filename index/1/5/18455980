The peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have many applications due to their virtues: high scalability and low cost. The systems using super-peers (SPs), which deal with all queriesÂ¿ instead of ordinary-peers (OPs), run more efficiently. So how to choose SPs from all peers is a key, but also a difficult problem because of the systems' heterogeneity and dynamic. In this paper a novel mechanism for the selection of SP is proposed. The selection strategy is based on the dynamic distribution of peers and files in all clusters, and the capacity of the peer is taken into consideration. Through the simulation, the result shows the selection efficiency is improved and the load unbalance among SPs is relieved.
