Dialogue topic tracking is a sequential labelling problem of recognizing the topic state at each time step in given dialogue sequences. This paper presents various ar-tiﬁcial neural network models for dialogue topic tracking, including convolutional neural networks to account for semantics at each individual utterance, and recurrent neural networks to account for conversational contexts along multiple turns in the dialogue history. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models can signiﬁcantly improve the tracking performances in human-human conversations.
