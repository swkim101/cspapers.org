A technique is described for prototyping a system directly from a specification. The technique uses the logic programming language Prolog and involves translating the specification into a Prolog form. This is used in conjunction with a set of functions, also written in Prolog, which provide an operational interpretation of the semantics of the specification language, and a user interface which allows the user to exercise the specification and examine its behaviour.
