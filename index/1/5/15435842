All known scheduling algorithms that optimally schedule task sets on multiprocessor platforms, are partially or completely based on the notion of proportionate fairness introduced by Baruah et al. in 1993 [1]. One could therefore think that there is no other solution to guarantee the optimality than to use the proportionate fairness property. We want to prove the opposite and we propose an alternative. In this paper we present an algorithm which is a multiprocessor generalization of EDF and where tasks do not have to follow any fairness property. We conjecture that this algorithm optimally schedules any set of periodic tasks with implicit deadlines and could easily be extended to the schedule of sporadic tasks.
