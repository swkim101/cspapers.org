Mobile phone with high accessibility and usability is regarded as the ideal interface for the users to monitor and control the approaching smart home environment. Moreover, networking technologies and protocols have been advanced enough to support a universal monitoring and controlling interface on smart phones. This paper presents HouseGenie, an interactive, direct manipulation application on mobile, which supports a range of basic home monitoring and controlling functionalities as a replacement of individual remotes of smart home appliances. HouseGenie also addresses several common requirements that may be behind the vision, such as scenario, short-delay alarm, area restriction and so on. We demonstrate that HouseGenie not only provides intuitive presentations and interactions for smart home management, but also improves user experience comparing to present solutions.
