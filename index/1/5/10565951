Let MWT(n) be the weight of a minimum-weight triangulation of n points chosen independently from the uniform distribution over [0, 112. Previous work [ll] has shown that E(MWT(n)) = e(&). In this paper we develop techniques for proving that v actually converges to a constant in both expectation and in probability. An immediate consequence is the development of an O(n2) time algorithm that finds a triangulation whose competive ratio with the MWT is, in a probabilistic sense, exactly one. The techniques developed to prove the above results are quite general and can also prove the convergence of certd;n typis of probabilistic recugrence equations a;d other Euclidean Functionak. This is illustrated bv usine them to prove the convergence of the weight of MWTs Gf random points in higher dimensions and a sketch of how to use them to prove the convergence of the degree probabilities for Delaunay triangulations in 9?â€˜.
