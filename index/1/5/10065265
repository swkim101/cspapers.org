Personal Communication Systems (PCS) enable people to communicate independent of their location. For tracking the location of mobtie users the system must maintain a Location Management mechanism, which maps user ad&ases to their current location. The increasing population of mobfle users leads to congestion problems in these systems, and motivatw the development of more ficient management sdemw. This work pr=ents a novel hierarchical Location Management scheme, in which every level of the hierarchy reprwents a partition to geographic regions. Within each level of the hierarchy the system records the location of every mobile user to a c@ain degree of accuracy. The degree of accuracy is incre=ed as we go down the levek until we reach the node to which the mobile user is attached. We develop distributed procedures for locating the mobile users (termed the Sear& operation) and updating the system location records (termed the Update operation) with user movements. The proposed scheme guarantew upper bound on the procedures costs: The amortized compltity of the mobile user update operations is O(Move. log Move), where Move is the total geographic distance that the mobile user has traveled. The upper bound of a search operation is ~mear with the distance between the search originator and the target node. These upper bounds do not depend on the network size. Therefore, the proposed scheme is attractive for the next generation of PCS. The management system is &o suitable for supporting anycaat and territory rwtricted users.
