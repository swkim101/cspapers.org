Although force control algorithms have been studied for three decades, this technology is not largely exploited in industry yet. The present paper proposes a position-based adaptive force control strategy, that relies on a novel method for the on line estimation of the environment stiffness. The control design is targeted to industrial controller structures and it is theoretically proven to be robust to time varying estimation errors of the environment stiffness and joint friction disturbances. The estimation algorithm succeeds in identifying the environment stiffness even in presence of geometrical irregularities of the contact surface during motion. The identification and control approaches are experimentally validated on an industrial robot equipped with a force sensor.
