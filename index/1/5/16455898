Advances in ubicomp technology are enabling the devel-opment of products that move in affective ways. However, there is insufficient empirical knowledge to encourage such designs. As research through design, we built three proto-types of standing-type kinetic products to conduct user experience (UX) field studies with visceral, behavioral, and reflective perspectives. Tasks, the users' body reactions, and their feelings were measured and interpreted to uncover features of a desirable UX with moving products. The find-ings and discussions contribute to the ubicomp community by expanding the design space for moving products and inspiring the community with practical applications.
