A major in computer applications for small, liberal arts colleges is proposed in this article. The proposed program has characteristics to allow students to engage in a breadth of study, to integrate knowledge from a variety of fields, and to apply what is studied to their career lives. By emphasizing an inter-disciplinary approach to higher education, small, liberal arts colleges are able to interweave general education courses into the computer applications major without making large demands for additional staff. Furthermore, students who earn their computer majors in such an interdisciplinary context can be expected to furnish employers with diversity and flexibility in problem solving -- just the sort of new blood many companies and entire industries are crying for.
