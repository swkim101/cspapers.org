In order to construct three-dimensional shape models of large-scale architectural structures using a laser range finder, a number of range images are taken from various viewpoints. These images are aligned using post-processing procedures such as the ICP algorithm. However, in general, before applying the ICP algorithm, these range images must be aligned roughly by a human operator in order to converge to precise positions. The present paper proposes a new modeling system using a group of multiple robots and an on-board laser range finder. Each measurement position is identified by a highly precise positioning technique called Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), which utilizes the characteristics of the multiple-robot system. Thus, the proposed system can construct 3D shapes of large-scale architectural structures without any post-processing procedure or manual registration. ICP is applied optionally for a subsequent refinement of the model. Measurement experiments in unknown and large indoor/outdoor environments are carried out successfully using the newly developed measurement system consisting of three mobile robots named CPS-V. Generating a model of Dazaifu Tenmangu, a famous cultural heritage, for its digital archive completes the paper.
