Nowhere is t h e tension between the two areas of our field--computatlon and llnguistlcs--more apparent than in the issues that arise in connection with parsing natural language input. This panel addresses those issues from both computational and linguisric perspectives. Each panelist has submitted a position paper on some of the questions that appear below. The questions are loosely grouped in three sections. The first concentrates on the computational aspect, the second on the linguistic aspect, and the third on their interactions.
