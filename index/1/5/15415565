We describe a novel semantic search engine for scientific literature. The Camtology system allows for sentence-level searches of PDF files and combines text and image searches, thus facilitating the retrieval of information present in tables and figures. It allows the user to generate complex queries for search terms that are related through particular grammatical/semantic relations in an intuitive manner. The system uses Grid processing to parallelise the analysis of large numbers of papers.
