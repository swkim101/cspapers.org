Users and administrators of a small computer often desire more service than it can provide. In a network environment additional services can be provided to the small computer, and in turn to the users of the small computer, by one or more other computers. An operational system for providing such “resource sharing” is described; some “fundamental principles” are abstracted from the experience gained in constructing the system; and some generalizations are suggested.
