To tackle this problem while achieving tractability, we generalize ABox abduction from the classical semantics to an inconsistency-tolerant semantics, namely the Intersection ABox Repair (IAR) semantics, and propose the notion of IAR-explanations in inconsistent DL ontologies. We show that computing all minimal IAR-explanations is tractable in data complexity for first-order rewritable ontologies. However, the computational method may still not be practical due to a possibly large number of minimal IAR-explanations. Hence we propose to use preference information to reduce the number of explanations to be computed.
