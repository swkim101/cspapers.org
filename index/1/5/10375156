Many queries are submitted to search engines by right-clicking the marked text (i.e., the query) in Web browsers. Because the document being read by the searcher often provides sufficient contextual information for the query, search engine could provide much more relevant search results if the query is augmented by the contextual information captured from the source document. How to extract the right contextual information from the source document is the main focus of this study. To this end, we evaluate 7 text component extraction schemes, and 5 feature extraction schemes. The former determines from which text component (e.g., title, meta-data, or paragraphs containing the selected query) to extract contextual information; the latter determines which words or phrases to extract. In total 35 combinations are evaluated and our evaluation results show that noun phrases extracted from all paragraphs that contain the query word is the best option.
