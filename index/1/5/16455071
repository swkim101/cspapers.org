Developing hands-on programming projects for a course on operating systems is a challenge. A wide variety of methods have been used and reported on at past SIGCSE meetings. A good summary of some of these projects can be found in [5]. One approach is to build a rudimentary operating system kernel from the bottom up. This approach necessarily involves some architecture-dependent coding. In this paper, the author describes his experience with such a project sequence based on the Intel protected mode architecture.
