In this paper, we address a relatively new and interesting text categorization problem: classify a political blog as either liberal or conservative, based on its political leaning. Our subjectivity analysis based method is twofold: 1) we identify subjective sentences that contain at least two strong subjective clues based on the General Inquirer dictionary; 2) from subjective sentences identified, we extract opinion expressions and other features to build political leaning classifiers. Experimental results with a political blog corpus we built show that by using features from subjective sentences can significantly improve the classification performance. In addition, by extracting opinion expressions from subjective sentences, we are able to reveal opinions that are characteristic of a specific political leaning to some extent.
