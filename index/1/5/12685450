This paper describes Ariel, a system for analyzing voltage drops and current density in the power networks of CMOS VLSI circuits. Three main parts, a Magic-based resistance extractor, a Rsim-based current simulator, and a network analyzer, work in tandem to examine the current/voltage characteristics of the power networks with a minimum of manual effort from the designer. The performance of the system on several chips is given.
