Fuzzy duplicate detection aims at identifying multiple representations of real-world objects stored in a data source, and is a task of critical practical relevance in data cleaning, data mining, or data integration. It has a long history for relational data stored in a single table (or in multiple tables with equal schema). Algorithms for fuzzy duplicate detection in more complex structures, e.g., hierarchies of a data warehouse, XML data, or graph data have only recently emerged. These algorithms use similarity measures that consider the duplicate status of their direct neighbors, e.g., children in hierarchical data, to improve duplicate detection effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel method for fuzzy duplicate detection in hierarchical and semi-structured XML data. Unlike previous approaches, it not only considers the duplicate status of children, but rather the probability of descendants being duplicates. Probabilities are computed efficiently using a Bayesian network. Experiments show the proposed algorithm is able to maintain high precision and recall values, even when dealing with data containing a high amount of errors and missing information. Our proposal is also able to outperform a state-of-the-art duplicate detection system on three different XML databases.
