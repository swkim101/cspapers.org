Large archives of historical questions and associated answers have been accumulated. Retrieving relevant historical answers that best match a question is an essential component of a CQA service. Most state of the art approaches are based on bag-of-words models, which have been proven successful in a range of text matching tasks, but are insufficient for capturing the important word sequence information in short text matching. In this paper, a new architecture is proposed to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between questions and answers. It utilises a similarity matrix which contains both lexical and sequential information. Afterwards the information is put into a deep architecture to find potentially suitable answers. The experimental study shows its potential in improving matching accuracy of question and answer.
