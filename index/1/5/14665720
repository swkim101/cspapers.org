The growing availability of on-line hardware and software with computer graphics capabilities provides the catalyst for developing more powerful design automation systems needed by the fourth generation and beyond.
 This paper will describe the design philosophy, implementation, advantages and limitations of a “design facility” which is currently in its initial period of operation at the Hughes Aircraft Company. The term “design facility” is used here to denote an integrated hardware/software system which forms an operational base for the preparation, modification, and production of the design of a particular set of products. In this case, the products will be the various physical elements of a digital system, each of which has precision artwork requirements.
