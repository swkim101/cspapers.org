Certain applications require that the output of an information extraction system be probabilistic, so that a downstream system can reliably fuse the output with possibly contradictory information from other sources. In this paper we consider the problem of assigning a probability distribution to alternative sets of coreference relationships among entity descriptions. We present the results of initial experiments with several approaches to estimating such distributions in an application using SRIâ€™s FASTUS information extraction system.
