Time synchronization is essential for a number of network applications. As the era of ubiquitous computing is ushered in, high precision time synchronization of nodes in wireless networks is required. High precision time synchronization can enable a variety of extensions of applications. This paper includes the design and implementation of the precision time protocol over low rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANpsilas). To achieve high precision in LR-WPANpsilas, we analyze the factors of latency and jitter in wireless environments, and we aim to minimize these factors. In addition, this paper presents experiments and the performance evaluation of the precision time protocol in LR-WPANpsilas. The result is that we established for nodes in a network to maintain their clocks to within a 50 nanosecond offset from the reference clock.
