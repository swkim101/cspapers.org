Curriculum concerns of the computer science discipline continue to require refinements in this rapidly changing field. We have established curriculum guidelines and we have two years experience in the accrediting process of the CSAB. Remarks such as “I do not consider the topic of … to be in the computer science discipline” and “At least the topic of … is not a capstone course” are being made. The goal of this panel is to provide an open, probing platform for a discussion of the subject of a capstone course.
