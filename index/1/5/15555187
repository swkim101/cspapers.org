In this paper, we propose a novel approach of image annotation byconstructing a hierarchical mapping between low-level visualfeatures and text features utilizing the relations within and acrossboth visual features and text features. Moreover, we propose a novelannotation strategy that maximizes both the accuracy and thediversity of the generated annotation by generalizing or specifyingthe annotation in the corresponding annotation hierarchy.Experiments with 4500 scientific images from Royal Society ofChemistry journals show that the proposed annotation approachproduces satisfactory results at different levels of annotations.
