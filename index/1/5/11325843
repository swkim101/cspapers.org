Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) has emerged as a powerful tool for assisting disabled people and for augmenting human performance. Up so far, no studies have succeeded in the power augmentation for the multi-DOFs robot based on EEG signals, especially for the complex shoulder joint. In this work, we propose an electromyography (EMG) estimation method based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals to realize the power assistance. The positions of the electrodes where the motion information of shoulder joint is effectively and exactly extracted are discussed, and a linear model that correlates the EMG to the EEG signal is constructed utilizing motion-related features extracted from multi-location EEG measurements. The constructed model is used to estimate the human muscular activity of shoulder joint from EEG using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The proposed approach is experimentally verified, and an average correlation coefficients are as high as about 0.90 for different subjects are obtained between the estimated and the actually measured EMG signal. Our results suggest that the estimation of EMG based on EEG is feasible. This demonstrates the potential of using EEG signals to support human activities via brain-machine interface.
