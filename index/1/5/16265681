We discuss algorithms for generation within the Lambek Theorem Proving Framework. Efficient algorithms for generation in this framework take a semantics-driven strategy. This strategy can be modeled by means of rules in the calculus that are geared to generation, or by means of an algorithm for the Theorem Prover. The latter possibility enables processing of a bidirectional calculus. Therefore Lambek Theorem Proving is a natural candidate for a 'uniform' architecture for natural language parsing and generation.
