This paper addresses the problem of impedance control for flexible joint robots based on a singular perturbation approach. Some aspects of the impedance controller, which turned out to be of high practical relevance during applications are then addressed, such as the implementation of nullspace stiffness for redundant manipulators, the avoiding of mass matrix decoupling and the related design of the desired damping matrix. Finally, the proposed methods are validated through measurements on the DLR robot.
