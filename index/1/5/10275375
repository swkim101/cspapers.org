In this paper, we introduce a domain model ing tool that supports users in the incremental and modular development of verified models of planning domains. It relies on a logic-based concept for systematic domain model construc tion that provides well-defined, safe operations for the union, extension, and refinement of al ready existing models. The system is equiped with a deductive component. It automati cally performs the proofs necessary to guaran tee both the consistency of single models and the safety of operations on models. By means of detailed examples, it is shown how the sys tem has been used for the structured develop ment of a model for a complex, safety-critical planning domain.
