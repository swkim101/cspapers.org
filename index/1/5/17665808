To enable robotic sensing for tasks with requirements on weight, size, and cost, we develop an ultra-tiny line laser range sensor based on the Time-of-Flight (TOF) principle. With delicate circuit design and optical attachments, we create a sensor as small as 35[mm] × 27[mm] × 30[mm] and as light as 20[g]. The line sensor samples 272 pixels (256 effective pixels) uniformly distributed within the measurement field of view customizable using different laser lenses. The optimal measurement range of the sensor is 0.05[m] ~ 2[m]. Higher sampling rates can be achieved with a shorter range. The sensor can also extend its range to 3[m] with reduced accuracy. We model the overall errors of the sensor and formulate calibration methods, achieving repeatable accuracy and measurement bias both within 2[cm] with our tested ambient lighting conditions and measurement ranges. The sensor is applicable to range sensing tasks including humanoid hand-eye measurement, UAV safe landing, tiny robot range sensing, and object detection.
