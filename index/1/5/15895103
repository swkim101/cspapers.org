We present an algorithm designed to solve the problem of maintaining communications within a group of robotic explorers. The rovers we consider are equipped with communication hardware that is effective only over a limited range and requires direct line of sight to function. The paper presents the algorithm used to solve this problem and some details of our implementation. We also present the results of an experimental analysis of the algorithm's performance characteristics in a simulated multi-rover environment.
