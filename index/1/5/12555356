The shift of the software architecture community towards architectural knowledge has brought along some promising research directions. In this workshop we discuss the issues that lead to the application of architectural knowledge in research and industrial practice as well as presenting ongoing research and new ideas to advance the field. We expect to examine the state of the art and practice and gauge future challenges and trends. This year's workshop has a strong emphasis on documenting, sharing, and reusing architectural rationale and design intent.
