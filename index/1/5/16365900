Secure provenance that records ownership and process history of data objects is vital to the success of data forensics in cloud computing, yet it is still a challenging issue today. In this paper, to tackle this unexplored area in cloud computing, we proposed a new secure provenance scheme based on the bilinear pairing techniques. As the essential bread and butter of data forensics and post investigation in cloud computing, the proposed scheme is characterized by providing the information confidentiality on sensitive documents stored in cloud, anonymous authentication on user access, and provenance tracking on disputed documents. With the provable security techniques, we formally demonstrate the proposed scheme is secure in the standard model.
