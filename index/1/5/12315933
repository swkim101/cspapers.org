With internet-connected, SCADA and cyber-physical systems becoming the next battlefield for crime and warfare, technologies for defending and attacking these systems are growing in prevalence. For entities with significant asset collections that are prospectively vulnerable to this type of an attack, autonomous response, retaliation and attack capabilities are necessary to respond to a growing threat from numerous sectors. This paper presents a command and control technique for cyberwarfare based on the Blackboard Architecture. It discusses the utility of this approach and proposes a distributed command system that can run across multiple nodes of various types.
