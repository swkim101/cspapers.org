We present Watch Commander, a gesture-based invocation system for rectangular smartwatches. Watch Commander allows the user to invoke functions easily and quickly by using Bezel to Bezel-Swipe (B2B-Swipe). This is because B2B-Swipe does not conflict with other swipe gestures such as flick and bezel swipe and can be performed in an eyes-free manner. Moreover, by providing GUIs that display functions assigned with B2B-Swipe, Watch Commander helps the user memorize those functions.
