However, it treats all samples independently, and ignores the fact that, in many real situations especially when data are in high dimensional space, samples typically lie on low dimensional manifolds of the feature space and thus a sample can be related to its neighbors by being represented as a linear combination of other samples on the same manifold. This linear representation, which is usually sparse, reflects the structure of underlying manifolds. It has been extensively explored in the recent literature and proven to be critical for the performance of classification. To benefit from both the underlying low dimensional manifold structure and the large margin classifier, this paper proposes a novel method called Sparsity Preserving Support Vector Machine(SP-SVM), which explicitly considers the sparse representation of samples while maximizing the margin between different classes. Consequently, SP-SVM inherits both the discriminative power of support vector machine and the merits of sparsity. A set of experiments on real-world benchmark data sets show that SP-SVM achieves significantly higher precision on recognition task than various competitive baselines including the traditional SVM, the sparse representation based method and the classical nearest neighbor classifier.
