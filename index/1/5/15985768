The "Hacker Curriculum" exists as a mostly undocumented set of principles and methods for learning about information security. Hacking, in our view, is defined by the ability to question the trust assumptions in the design and implementation of computer systems rather than any negative use of such skills.
 Chief among these principles and methods are two useful pedagogical techniques: (1) developing a cross-layer view of systems (one unconstrained by API definitions or traditional subject matter boundaries) and (2) understanding systems by analyzing their failure modes (this approach works well with learning networking concepts and assessing software vulnerabilities). Both techniques provide a rich contrast to traditional teaching approaches, particularly for information security topics.
 We relate our experience applying Hacker Curriculum principles to education and training programs for undergraduates, including the Secure Information Systems Mentoring and Training (SISMAT) program and the Cyber Security Initiative at Dartmouth College, which allows undergraduates to perform supervised red team activities on Dartmouth's production systems.
