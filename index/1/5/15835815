Researchers have proposed various approaches to detect concurrency bugs and improve multi-threaded programs, but performing evaluations of the effectiveness of these approaches still remains a substantial challenge. We survey the existing evaluations and find out that they often use code or bugs not representative of real world. To improve representativeness, we have prepared JaConTeBe, a benchmark suite of 47 confirmed concurrency bugs from 8 popular open-source projects, supplemented with test cases for reproducing buggy behaviors. Running three approaches on JaConTeBe shows that our benchmark suite confirms some limitations of the three approaches. We submitted JaConTeBe to the SIR repository (a software-artifact repository for rigorous controlled experiments), and it was included as a part of SIR.
