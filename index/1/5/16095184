An indexing structure called triple-node hierarchy is proposed for enhancing query processing in object-oriented database systems. The proposed structure provides eecient support for object references along an aggregation hierarchy by maintaining direct mapping between objects of interested pairs of classes. The intermediate classes along the object path are maintained separately for update purpose. We show that the proposed structure can achieve better performance compared to the previously known methods. The superior performance is also demonstrated by a set of simulations based on a cost model that we have developed. With some mod-iication, the proposed structure can also provide fast support for object navigation in an integration of aggregation and inheritance hierarchies. Our results show that the extended triple-node hierarchy performs better than the best previous method known to us.
