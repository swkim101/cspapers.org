This paper illustrates both challenges and benefits found in expanding a traditional game concept to a situated environment with a distributed set of wireless sensing modules. Our pervasive game equivalent of the Whac-A-Mole game, Whac-A-Bee, retains the find-and-seek aspects of the original game while extending the location, the number of players, and the time-span in which it can be played. We discuss the obstacles met during this work, and specifically address challenges in making the game robust and flexible enough for large and long-term deployments in unknown territory.
