As the prevalence of software increases, so does the complexity and the number of requirements associated to the software project. This presents a dilemma for the developers to clearly identify and prioritize the most important requirements in order to deliver the project in given amount of resources and time. A number of prioritization methods have been proposed which provide consistent results, but they are very difficult and complex to implement in practical scenarios as well as lack proper structure to analyze the requirements properly. In this study, the users can provide their requirements in two forms: text based story form and use case form. Moreover, the existing prioritization techniques have a very little or no interaction with the users. So, in this paper an attempt has been made to make the prioritization process user interactive by adding a second level of prioritization where after the developer has properly analyzed and ranked the requirements on the basis of quality attributes in the first level, takes the opinion of distinct userâ€™s about the requirements priority sequence. The developer then calculates the disagreement value associated with each user sequence in order to find out the final priority sequence.
