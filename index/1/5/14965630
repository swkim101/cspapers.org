In this paper, we propose a coordinated motion control algorithm of dual manipulators for handling of an almost rigid object but with non-negligible deformation. By the proposed algorithm, an almost rigid object with non-negligible deformation, such as a cardboard box, a plastic case, etc., is held and manipulated by dual manipulators stably without producing any vibrations. By defining apparent dynamics of dual manipulators for the interface force between the object and its environment and the dissipative dynamics for the internal force applied by the manipulators to the object independently, stable manipulation is achieved. Experimental results illustrate that the vibratory motion of the manipulated object caused by non-negligible deformation is eliminated by the proposed control algorithm while the apparent dynamics of the manipulated object is realized.
