We present the design and implementation of a lightweight remote attestation scheme for embedded devices that combines software attestation with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In contrast to standard software attestation, our scheme (i) is secure against collusion attacks to forge the attestation checksum, (ii) allows for the authentication and attestation of remote provers, and (iii) enables the detection of hardware attacks on the prover.
