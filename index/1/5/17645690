This paper reports on our experiences with in-lab programming tests (i.e., using a compiler and IDE) in a large undergraduate data structures course in C for non-specialists. By adding a suite of in-lab programming tests to our regular assessments (midterm, final exam, programming homework, etc.), we expected students to improve significantly in these areas: (1) programming ability as measured by final exam grades on programming-related questions, (2) confidence in programming ability, and (3) contributions/effectiveness in pair programming partnerships. Goal (1) was not met. Although Goal (2) was met, improved confidence did not translate into improved performance. Goal (3) was partially met. We present data gathered from in-lab programming test assessments, final exam programming assessments, and post-course surveys, including a two-year follow-up survey.
