Microprocessors, in some sense, symbolize the universe in design techniques. Virtually all general and special test techniques are applicable to some section of a microprocessor. What are some of the key companies doing for microprocessor testing today? Is there really a difference between verification and testing of a microprocessor? How much of testing can we afford to do? How do the various fault models really stack up against actual failures? What is an adequate coverage number? How effective are built-in self-test (BIST) techniques? Can we really tolerate the performance hit from BIST techniques? Is there a convergence of ideas on how to do BIST? What are the major companies doing for fault simulation, test pattern generation? Is tester performance keeping up with the advances in design? How severe is the pin count problem of the testers? What are the future challenges?
