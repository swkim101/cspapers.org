Recent attention has been given to graphic display routines that allow the programmer to observe the effects of applications programs on various data structures. Much of the work reported in the literature has involved the animation of specific algorithms and has necessitated manual effort by programmers on an application by application basis. Results of initial work in developing a general purpose tool for the display of data structures have already been published. In order to make the tool more widely used and more flexible it is necessary that some type of automatic processing be provided to allow for the generation of the graphic display routines themselves. Initial work in this area and further avenues of research are discussed.
