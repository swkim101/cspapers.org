Some aggregate and grouping queries are conceptually simple, but difficult to express in SQL. This difficulty causes both conceptual and implementation problems for the SQLbased database system. Complicated queries and views are hard to understand and maintain. Further, the code produced is sometimes unnecessarily inefficient, as we demonstrate experimentally using a commercial database system. In this paper, we examine a class of queries involving (potentially repeated) selection, grouping and aggregation over the same groups, and propose an extension of SQL syntax that allows the succinct representation of these queries. We propose a new relational algebra operation that represents several levels of aggregation over the same groups in an operand relation. We demonstrate that the extended relational operator can be evaluated using efficient algorithms. We describe a translation from the extended SQL language into our algebraic language. We have implemented a preprocessor that evaluates our extended language on top of a commercial l This research was supported by a grant from the AT&T Foundation, by a David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship in Science and Engineering, by a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, by NSF grants IRI-9209029, CDA-90-24735, and by an NSF Young Investigator award.

We demonstrate that on a variety of examples, our implementation improves performance over standard SQL representations of the same examples by orders of magnitude.
