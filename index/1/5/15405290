We consider a very basic problem in cryptography: reducing a week one-way function to a strong one-way function. This problem was first solved by Yao. It has been observed that Yao’s reduction only slightly preserves the security of the original function. Since then, the problem of presenting a ‘security-preserving’ reduction from any weak one-way function into a strong one, has remained open. Progress towards solving this question has been shown by Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Levin, Venkatesan and Zuckermen in [8], who presented such a reduction for the crw in which the original function is a permutation. Using techniques from [14], they extended this reduction to a regular function, assuming that the preimage size of the original function can be efficiently computed. In this paper we make another step towards the solution of this problem. We present a securitypreserving reduction from any regular weak one-way function to a strong one-way function (i.e., even if the preimage size is unknown or herd to compute). Our techniques also give a security-preserving construction from any regular one-way function to a function that is one-way on an efficiently semplable distribution for which it is almost always poly-to-one, a result perhaps of independent interest.
