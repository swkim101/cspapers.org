Multi-Stud Tensioning Machine (MSTM) is a specialized equipment used to open/seal the cover of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) during nuclear power plant maintenance. The tensioning residual values of the 58 studs are monitored for procedure evaluation. It is time-consuming for human operators to place the measurement meters into working positions. In order to reduce labor intensity and eliminate radiation exposure time, we develop a robot-assisted automatic measurement system to achieve meter placement and real-time data monitoring. The Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based distributed control scheme realizes high-speed data acquisition and coordinated control of the 58 node robots. The control software performs data analysis and sends emergency stop signals to the MSTM control PLC. The proposed system is validated in China Nuclear Power Technology Research Institute. Total operation time decreases from over 580 s to less than 120 s.
