This paper explores the feasibility and proposes a method on how to obtain high frequency real-time controllers operating in loop with physical robot hardware over a geographically adjacent and bounty hunting cloud server architecture. Having the cloud in the loop has many purposes including increasing computation, decreasing “on robot” power usage, reducing overall robot weight etc. Today when robots use the cloud in loop it is typically for sharing information, high level planning, and other non-real-time tasks. All of the balancing and stability algorithms stay onboard the robot. What if we could run high frequency real-time loops over the cloud? The better question is how would we do that? As with any real-time system latency is a big factor in the application and operation frequency. This paper shows that with a geographically adjacent and bounty hunting server approach it is feasible to obtain high frequency real-time control in loop with with a physical robot over the cloud. The feasibility of such a system running in-loop on humanoids and wheeled robots are explored and tested.
