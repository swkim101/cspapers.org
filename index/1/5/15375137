We describe an approach to simultaneous tokenization and part-of-speech tagging that is based on separating the closed and open-class items, and focusing on the likelihood of the possible stems of the openclass words. By encoding some basic linguistic information, the machine learning task is simplified, while achieving state-of-the-art tokenization results and competitive POS results, although with a reduced tag set and some evaluation difficulties.
