Execution traces can be significantly compressed using their referencing locality. A simple observation leads to a technique capable of compressing execution traces by an order of magnitude; instruction-only traces are compressed by two orders of magnitude. This technique is unlike previously reported trace compression techniques in that it compresses without loss of information and, therefore, does not affect trace-driven simulation time or accuracy.
