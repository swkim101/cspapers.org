This paper describes a simple graphics library designed for a CS 1 course using ANSI C as its programming language. The library can be implemented easily on a variety of hardware platforms, providing a reasonable level of portability. Implementation currently exist for compilers on the Apple Macintosh, the IBM PC, and Unix workstations; the source code for each of these implementations is publicly available by anonymous FTP from the Roberts.C.CS1 area on host aw.com. In addition, the public distribution includes a fully standard implementation that generates a PostScript representation of the graphical image.
