This tutorial discusses a framework for incremental left-to-right structured predication, which makes use of global discriminative learning and beam-search decoding. The method has been applied to a wide range of NLP tasks in recent years, and achieved competitive accuracies and efficiencies. We give an introduction to the algorithms and efficient implementations, and discuss their applications to a range of NLP tasks.
