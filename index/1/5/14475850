A general principle is given for detection of the 3D structure and motion from an image sequence without using point-to-point correspondence. The procedure consists of two stages: (i) determination of the "flow parameters" from "features" without using correspondence and (ii) computation of the 3D structure and motion from these flow parameters. The first stage is done by solving equations of functionals, and the second stage is described in analytical expressions.
