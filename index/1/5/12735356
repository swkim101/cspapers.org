A research project applying artificial intelligence techniques to the development of integrated robot systems is described. The experimental facili ty consists of an SDS-940 computer and associated programs controlling a wheeled vehicle that carries a TV camera and other sensors. The primary emphasis is on the development of a system of programs for processing sensory data from the vehicle, for storing relevant information about the environment, and for planning the sequence of motor actions necessary to accomplish tasks in the environment. A typical task performed by our present system requires the robot vehicle to rearrange (by pushing) simple objects in its environment. A novel feature of our approach is the use of a formal theorem-proving system to plan the execution of high-level functions as a sequence of other, perhaps lower level, functions. The execution of these in turn requires additional planning at lower levels. The main theme of the research is the integration of the necessary planning systems, models of the world and sensory processing systems into an efficient whole capable of perf orming a wide range of tasks in a real environment.
