This paper analyzes two analytical mobility models for their suitability to handover modeling and to the estimation of signaling cost. Some insufficiencies of the often employed Hong/Rappaport model are detected. Here, an infinite mean dwell time occurs which is not suitable for performance evaluation of mobile communications systems. Therefore, handover modeling is not possible. To prevent infinite dwell times, an universal condition for the velocity distribution is derived. The biased sampling formula of the velocity distribution fulfills our universal condition. Finally, the consequences of the biased sampling of the velocity for the signaling traffic are discussed for the modified Hong/Rappaport model and a highway model. In contrast to the analytical calculations without consideration of biased sampling, we detect a significant increase of signaling traffic. It is shown that the probability density function of the velocity of the boundary-crossing subscribers is given by the biased sampling formula. Thus, for handover modeling and the exact estimation of signaling traffic the biased sampling formula of the velocity has to be taken into account in analytical calculations in any case.
