This research presents a prototype of a direct-driven, optimized and light-mass hand exoskeleton that is designed to fit over the dorsal side of the hand, thus retaining palm free for interaction with real/virtual objects. The link lengths of the proposed Hand EXOskeleton SYStem (HEXOSYS) TT have been selected based on an optimization algorithm. In an attempt to make the design human hand compatible, the actuators of HEXOSYS II have been chosen as a result of series of experiments on human hands of various sizes. The system based on an optimum under-actuated mechanism provides 3 DOF/finger. The resultant motion of the exoskeleton allows the wearer to perform flexion/abduction as well as passive abduction/adduction. Simple and under-actuated mechanisms together with compact mechanical design lead to realize a light mass robotic system. The first prototype of HEXOSYS II has been fabricated. Comprising of four fingers, which are enough to accomplish most of our daily life activities, the system weighs 600 grams.
