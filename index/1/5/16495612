In this paper, we discuss issues involving temporal data fragmentation, temporal query processing, and query optimization in multiprocessor database machines. We propose parallel processing strategies, which are based on partitioning of temporal relations on timestamp values, for multi-way joins (e.g., complex temporal pattern queries) and optimization alternatives. We analyze the proposed schemes quantitatively, and show their advantages in computing complex temporal joins.
