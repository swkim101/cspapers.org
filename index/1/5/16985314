This paper introduces a personalization method for image retrieval based on the learning of personal preferences. The proposed system indexes objects based on shape and groups them into a set of clusters, or prototypes. Our personalization method refines corresponding prototypes from objects provided by the user in the foreground, and simultaneously adapts the database index in the background.
