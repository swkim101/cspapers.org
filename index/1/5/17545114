In this paper, a novel decentralized multilateral structure is proposed for the dual user systems in the presence of communication delay. The proposed structure utilizes adaptive impedance control approach in order to overcome the destructive effect of the time-delay on system desired-objectives, which is a disregarded issue in the previous studies on dual user system. The proposed control strategy, which utilizes three desired impedance surfaces defined in the paper, satisfactorily brings the system hybrid matrix close to the ideal one that guarantees the system stability and transparency. The controller is designed in a way that eliminates the necessity of the delay estimation as one of its outstanding characteristics; consequently, the unknown communication time-delay can be handled via this structure while previous studies have disregarded the issue of time delay in dual user system. Furthermore, the adaptive structure of the controller promises to overcome the uncertainties on robot's dynamics. In addition, the efficiency of the controller in guaranteeing the system stability in the presence of unknown communication delay is investigated through passivity theory and the presented analysis illustrates complete independency of the closed-loop system stability on time delay value applying the proposed controller. Experimental results performed on a delayed dual user system demonstrate validity of the proposed scheme.
