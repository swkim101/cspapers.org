Low power is widely considered as a key benefit of 3D ICs, yet there have been few thorough design studies on how to maximize power benefits in 3D ICs. In this paper, we present design methodologies to reduce power consumption in 3D ICs using a large-scale commercial-grade microprocessor (OpenSPARC T2). To further improve power benefits in 3D ICs on top of the traditional 3D floor-planning, we study the impact of block folding and bonding styles. We also develop an effective method to place face-to-face vias for our 2-tier 3D design for power optimization. With aforementioned methods combined, our 3D designs provide up to 20.3% power reduction over the 2D counterpart under the same performance.
