This paper, divided in two Parts, considers the problem of realizing a 6-DOF closed-loop motion simulator by exploiting an anthropomorphic serial manipulator as motion platform. After having proposed a suitable inverse kinematics scheme in Part I [1], we address here the other key issue, i.e., devising a motion cueing algorithm tailored to the specific robot motion envelope. An extension of the well-known classical washout filter designed in cylindrical coordinates will provide an effective solution to this problem. The paper will then present a thorough experimental evaluation of the overall architecture (inverse kinematics + motion cueing) on the chosen scenario: closed-loop simulation of a Formula 1 racing car. This will prove the feasibility of our approach in fully exploiting the robot motion capabilities as a motion simulator.
