This paper offers an Embodied Construction Grammar (Feldman et al. 2010) representation of caused motion, thereby also providing (a sample of) the computational infrastructure for implementing the information that FrameNet has characterized as Caused_motion 1 (Ruppenhofer et al. 2010). This work specifies the semantic structure of caused motion in natural language, using an Embodied Construction Grammar analyzer that includes the semantic parsing of linguistically instantiated constructions. Results from this type of analysis can serve as the input to NLP applications that require rich semantic representations.
