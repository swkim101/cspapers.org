This paper describes an automated sewing system that focuses on sewing of curved edge segments. The sewing cell includes an industrial sewing machine as well as three industrial robots that handle the parts during the sewing process. Based on experiences from previous work, several improvements are presented that address issues with previous implementations. The main contribution concerning the control system is a model-based generation of the feed-forward velocity for the robot tool movement, based on a geometric description of the parts. This approach increases performance, especially in the case of curved fabric, as well as robustness in case of faulty sensor data. Additionally, this paper describes hardware upgrades that address mechanical challenges that were described in former publications. Finally, the paper presents experiments comparing the model-based control approach with the former control system based on constant feed-forwards velocity and setpoints.
