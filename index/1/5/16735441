An experiment is described that analyzes differences in BASIC test scores between a group of 58 non-business and 104 business majors. All students were given four weeks of instruction in BASIC and took a common BASIC examination testing their knowledge of language rules and their ability to read programs.
 Analysis of multiple covariance was used to statistically adjust BASIC test scores for performance on a computer concepts examination and age. The results showed no significant difference between the scores of the non-business and business majors on the BASIC examination.
 These findings are important since they provide empirical evidence that the ability to understand programming language is independent of students' academic direction. Thus, the benefits of programming experience appear to be realizable for both business and non-business students.
