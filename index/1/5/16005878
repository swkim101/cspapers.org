Management of multihierarchical XML encodings has attracted attention of a number of researchers both in databases [8] and in humanities[10]. Encoding documents using multiple hierarchies can yield overlapping markup. Previously proposed solutions to management of document-centric XML with overlapping markup rely on the XML expertise of humans and their ability to maintain correct schemas for complex markup languages.We demonstrate a unified solution for management of complex, multihierarchical document-centric XML. Our framework includes software for storing, parsing, in-memory access, editing and querying, multihierarchical XML documents with conflicting structures.
