In this paper, a novel mechanism of remote actuation was proposed and its mechanical problems were discussed. This mechanism consists of leverage and parallelogram mechanism and transmits 3 d.o.f translational and 3 d.o.f rotational motions from the input to output. Such a remote actuation is significantly useful for robotic assist around MRI where the strong and precise magnet is used for imaging, because mutual effect between MRI and robot are inverse proportional to the distance. In this paper, the basic ideas of mechanism were introduced firstly. The discussions of its stiffness and workspace conclude their trade-off. Our new idea of workspace control for mechanical safety is preliminary discussed.
