This paper presents an algorithm for the formation of configurations connecting processors to memory and I/O devices on rectangular SW banyan networks with equivalent processor resources as the base nodes and equivalent memory and I/O resources as the apex nodes. Given a set of resource configuration requests, the algorithm always finds a partition of the network that meets the requests in space and time complexity linear with respect to the number of resources in the network.
