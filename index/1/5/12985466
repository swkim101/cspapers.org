Video is a complex information space that requires advanced navigational aids for effective browsing. The increasing number of temporal video annotations offers new opportunities to provide video navigation according to a user's needs. We present a novel video browsing interface called TAV (Temporal Annotation Viewing) that provides the user with a visual overview of temporal video annotations. TAV enables the user to quickly determine the general content of a video, the location of scenes of interest and the type of annotations that are displayed while watching the video. An ongoing user study will evaluate our novel approach.
