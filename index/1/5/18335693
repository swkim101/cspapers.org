Finding all justifications of an OWL entailment is an important reasoning service for explaining logical inconsistencies. In this paper, we consider finding all justifications of an entailment in OWL pD* fragment, which is a fragment of OWL that makes possible decidable rule extensions of OWL. We first propose a novel approach to find all justifications of OWL pD* entailments using TMS and show the complexity of this approach. This approach is limited by the hardware capabilities of standalone systems. In order to improve its scalability to handle large scale semantic data, we optimize the proposed approach by exploiting the MapReduce technology. We implement our approach and the optimization, and do experiments on synthetic and real world data sets. Evaluation results show that our approach has the ability to scale to more than one billion triples.
