Double Sense Multiple Access In wireless ad hoc networks, it is a challenging problem to design an efficient media access control (MAC) protocol that can completely avoid the interference from the hidden terminals, which are defined as the terminals beyond the communication range of the transmitter but within that of the receiver. In [1], Haas and Deng have proposed the dual busy tone multiple access (DBTMA) protocol where the transmitter and the receiver can clear other packet transmissions in their communication ranges by broadcasting two different busy tone (BT) signals. To avoid the still possible packet collisions due to the propagation delay, a mandatory waiting time is inserted between the successful reception of a ready-to-send (RTS) packet and the transmission of a data packet. In addition, all terminals are required to keep sensing the BT signals, even while they are transmitting packets. In this paper, we propose and analyse a novel dual channel random access protocol, called “Double Sense Multiple Access” (DSMA), for solving the hidden terminal problem. Two time-slotted channels are used for transmitting control (e.g. RTS) and data packets separately. Under DSMA, a transmitter will sense the BT signals twice before sending the data packet to the receiver. In doing so, the transmitter can identify if it is the intended transmitter for sending a data packet and, therefore, the possible data packet collisions due to propagation delay can be completely avoided. Compared with DBTMA, our DSMA protocol has the following advantages: (1) higher channel efficiency by completely avoiding the collisions between control and data packets; (2) higher power efficiency by setting lower data rate, i.e. lower transmission power, in the control channel; (3) shorter transmission delay by removing the “mandatory waiting time” in DBTMA; and (4) less complexity and cost by reducing the “keep sensing” requirement in DBTMA to “sense twice” in DSMA.
