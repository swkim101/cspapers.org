By comparison to some other sensory cortices, the functional properties of cells in the primary auditory cortex are not yet well understood. Recent attempts to obtain a generalized description of auditory cortical responses have often relied upon characterization of the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), which amounts to a model of the stimulus-response function (SRF) that is linear in the spectrogram of the stimulus. How well can such a model account for neural responses at the very first stages of auditory cortical processing? To answer this question, we develop a novel methodology for evaluating the fraction of stimulus-related response power in a population that can be captured by a given type of SRF model. We use this technique to show that, in the thalamo-recipient layers of primary auditory cortex, STRF models account for no more than 40% of the stimulus-related power in neural responses.
