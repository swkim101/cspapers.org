A CAD environment requires a significantly different model of transaction from that developed for typical data-processing applications. A viable model of CAD transaction must allow a group of cooperating designers to arrive at a design without being forced to wait over a long duration. It must also allow a group of designers to collaborate on a design with another group by assigning subtasks. In this paper, we provide both an intuitive description and a formal development of a new model of CAD transactions.
