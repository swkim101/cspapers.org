This paper addresses the problem of teaching the topic of concurrency to Computer Science undergraduates. It is suggested that a small set of introductory lectures on the subject could be of benefit, and the paper outlines some of the considerations involved in devising such a ‘mini-course’. A detailed breakdown of the contents of the lectures is given, and a couple of examples of the parallel programming exercises are presented. Some comments on the effectiveness of the approach conclude the paper.
