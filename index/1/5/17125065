An unscented predictive motion planning algorithm of a nonholonomic system using output feedback is presented. A two-wheeled robot is selected as the example nonholonomic system. A predictive motion planning scheme is used to find the suboptimal control inputs. In addition to the nonholonomic constraint, state estimation and collision avoidance chance constraints are incorporated to the predictive scheme. The closed form of the probabilistic constraints is solved by utilizing the unscented transform of the motion model. Numerical simulation results demonstrate a high level of robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the presence of disturbances, measurement noise and chance constraints.
