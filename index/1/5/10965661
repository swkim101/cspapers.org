Finding new academic methods for research problems is the key task in a researcher's research career. In order to help new researchers carry out their researches in a more convenient way, we describe a novel recommendation system called AMRec to recommend new academic methods for research problems in this paper. Our proposed system first extracts academic concepts (Tasks and Methods) and their relations from academic literatures, and then leverages the regularized matrix factorization model for academic method recommendation. Preliminary evaluation results are also reported and discussed.
