The problem of interestingness of discovered rules has been investigated by many researchers. The issue is that data mining algorithms often generate too many rules, which make it very hard for the user to find the interesting ones. Over the years many techniques have been proposed. However, few have made it to real-life applications. Since August 2004, we have been working on a major application for Motorola. The objective is to find causes of cellular phone call failures from a large amount of usage log data. Class association rules have been shown to be suitable for this type of diagnostic data mining application. We were also able to put several existing interestingness methods to the test, which revealed some major shortcomings. One of the main problems is that most existing methods treat rules individually. However, we discovered that users seldom regard a single rule to be interesting by itself. A rule is only interesting in the context of some other rules. Furthermore, in many cases, each individual rule may not be interesting, but a group of them together can represent an important piece of knowledge. This led us to discover a deficiency of the current rule mining paradigm. Using non-zero minimum support and non-zero minimum confidence eliminates a large amount of context information, which makes rule analysis difficult. This paper proposes a novel approach to deal with all of these issues, which casts rule analysis as OLAP operations and general impression mining. This approach enables the user to explore the knowledge space to find useful knowledge easily and systematically. It also provides a natural framework for visualization. As an evidence of its effectiveness, our system, called Opportunity Map, based on these ideas has been deployed, and it is in daily use in Motorola for finding actionable knowledge from its engineering and other types of data sets.
