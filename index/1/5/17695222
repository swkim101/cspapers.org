The disambiguation algorithm presented in this paper is implemented in SemLinker, an entity linking system. First, named entities are linked to candidate Wikipedia pages by a generic annotation engine. Then, the algorithm re-ranks candidate links according to mutual relations between all the named entities found in the document. The evaluation is based on experiments conducted on the test corpus of the TAC-KBP 2012 entity linking task.
