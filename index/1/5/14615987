Random-access systems (RAS) for collision-type channels have been studied extensively under the assumption of an infinite population which generates a Poisson arrival process. If the population is finite and if the (practically desirable) free-access channel-access protocol is used, then it is shown that the specification of a channel-exit protocol is crucial for the stability and the fairness of the RAS. Free-exit and blocked-exit protocols are analyzed and it is concluded that the p-persistent blocked-exit protocol provides the mechanisms to assure stability and fairness for a wide range of arrival process models.
