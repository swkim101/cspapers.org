Extreme-scale computing poses a number of challenges to application performance. Developers need to study application behavior by collecting detailed information with the help of tracing toolsets to determine shortcomings. But not only applications are "scalability challenged", current tracing toolsets also fall short of exascale requirements for low background overhead since trace collection for each execution entity is becoming infeasible. One effective solution is to cluster processes with the same behavior into groups. Instead of collecting performance information from each individual node, this information can be collected from just a set of representative nodes. This work contributes a fast, scalable, signature-based clustering algorithm that clusters processes exhibiting similar execution behavior. Instead of prior work based on statistical clustering, our approach produces precise results nearly without loss of events or accuracy. The proposed algorithm combines low overhead at the clustering level with log(P) time complexity, and it splits the merge process to make tracing suitable for extreme-scale computing. Overall, this multi-level precise clustering based on signatures further generalizes to a novel multi-metric clustering technique with unprecedented low overhead.
