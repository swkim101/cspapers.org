This paper discusses experiences in utilizing an HP-2000 system as the framework for teaching computer programming and statistics. The statistical approach relies upon the binary model; this model is developed by each student using the random function generator. Although empirically heuristic, such an approach provides a useful intellectual base for developing all other statistical notions more formally. Student experiences in researching the role of computer science and/or statistics in their career choices led three students to select Computer Science as a major at California State University, Northridge.
