Discrete event simulation has been a constant source of inspiration for language designers. The present interest in Object-Oriented Programming (O.O.P.) can be traced back to the Simula 67 language. In return, simulation languages are currently getting back many advantages from the ongoing research in O.O.P. One of the main present research trends is the possibility of concurrently executing a simulation program composed of a set of interacting and communicating objects. Conditions which will make this possible are discussed together with some induced problems. More precisely this paper presents some experiments in object-oriented simulation that reveal the great flexibility of the Smalltalk-801 programming system for building evaluation environments.
