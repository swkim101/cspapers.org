We describe the motivation, focus, and organization of SESENA11, the 2nd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Sensor Network Applications. The workshop took place under the umbrella of ICSE 2011, the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, in Honolulu, Hawaii, on May 22, 2011. The aim was to attract researchers belonging to the Software Engineering (SE) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) communities, not only to exchange their recent research results on the topic, but also to stimulate discussion on the core open problems and define a shared research agenda.
