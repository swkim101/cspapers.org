One of the difficulties in introducing students to the variety of approaches used in knowledge engineering and neural networks in particular, is getting them to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Toy problems can be helpful but they often have little transfer to the real world problems encountered in the field. They tend to gloss over the very real limitations of existing tools and do little to challenge students to discover improved techniques. To this end we suggest the use of a single substantial problem from the published literature throughout a course as different approaches are presented.
