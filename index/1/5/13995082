Theoretical and experimental results have indicated that automatic decompositions can discover modest amounts of parallelism. These investigations have tended to ignore the practical problems of language run-time organization, such as synchronization, communication, memory organization, resource management, and input/output. This paper describes a language implementation effort which combines the investigation of implicit and explicit parallel decomposition facilities with the practical considerations of system organization on a multiprocessor computer, Cm*.
