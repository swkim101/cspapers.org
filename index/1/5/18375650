This paper describes language constructs for creating a very high-level language as a tool for computer system design. In order to describe the complexity of a computer system, this language permits descriptions in a heirarchical manner at different levels of system detail and at various cross-sections of system structure. It allows descriptions of system hardware, system software, and the interactions between system hardware and software.
