A natural class of “hypercubic” sorting networks is defined. The regular structure of these sorting networks allows for elegant and efficient implementations on any of the so-called hypercubic networks (e.g., the hypercube, shuffle-exchange, butterfly, and cube-connected cycles). This class of sorting networks contains Batcher's <italic>O</italic>(lg<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> <italic>n</italic>)-depth bitonic sort, but not the <italic>O</italic>(lg <italic>n</italic>)-depth sorting network of Ajtai, Komlo´s, and Szemere´di. In fact, no <italic>o</italic>(lg<supscrpt>2</supscrpt> <italic>n</italic>)-depth compare-interchange sort was previously known for any of the hypercubic networks. In this paper, we prove the existence of a family of 2<supscrpt>O((lg lg <italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt>1/2</supscrpt>)</supscrpt> lg  <italic>n</italic>-depth hypercubic sorting networks. Note that this depth is <italic>o</italic>(lg<supscrpt>1+ε</supscrpt> <italic>n</italic>) for any constant ε > 0.
