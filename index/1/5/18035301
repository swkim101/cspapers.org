In this paper, we propose a new weakly supervised abstractive news summarization framework using pattern based approaches. Our system first generates meaningful patterns from sentences. Then, in order to precisely cluster patterns, we propose a novel semisupervised pattern learning algorithm that leverages a hand-crafted list of topic-relevant keywords, which are the only weakly supervised information used by our framework to generate aspect-oriented summarization. After that, our system generates new patterns by fusing existing patterns and selecting top ranked new patterns via the recurrent neural network language model. Finally, we introduce a new pattern based surface realization algorithm to generate abstractive summaries. Automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our new methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/jerryli1981
