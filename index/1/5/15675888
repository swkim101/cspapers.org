This paper presents the InCense research toolkit to facilitate researchers with little or no technical background to implement a sensing application for mobile phones. To reach this end, InCense provides a GUI and an interactive ontology to enable users to define the configuration of the sensing application, i.e. what sensing components to add, and the flow of the sensing session. We illustrate the ease of use of the InCense platform through a scenario in which both opportunistic and participatory sensing paradigms are used.
