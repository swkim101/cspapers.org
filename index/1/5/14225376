Success with computer graphics depends upon the users as much as the system itself. This paper outlines procedures for selecting and successfully using an interactive computer graphics system. Ford Motor Company's experience with computer graphics is reviewed, followed by a brief description of the various types of graphics systems that are available. INITIAL PREPARATION examines the techniques used to evaluate graphic systems including formation of an evaluation team, and application analysis. GRAPHICS EVALUATION describes the methods used to test a graphics system, including benchmark specification and human engineering considerations. COMPUTER SYSTEM EVALUATION examines other factors in system selection: programming, communications, documentation, and service. SYSTEM START UP addresses site preparation, people preparation, system acceptance, and operator selection. Finally, operator TRAINING and SYSTEM MANAGEMENT are discussed.
