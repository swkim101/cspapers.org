This paper presents performance comparison among five strategies for mobile support. The major facilities that are required for a network protocol to support mobile hosts are location management and packet forwarding. Based on this observation, we consider five basic strategies which use distinct methods to achieve these facilities and compare their performance. These five strategies are Broadcast Kotification (BN), Broadcast Forwarding (BF), Broadcast Query (BQ), Default Forwarding (DF), and Default Query (DQ). As a result of analytical evaluation and comparison, it is shown that under different network conditions, such as number of routers, network topology, migration/communication ratio, data/control packet size ratio, different strategies produce minimum network traffic. In short, DF and DQ show the best performance in scalability, while BF and BQ are efficient for frequent migration. On the other hand, BN is suitable for a small network which has hosts with rare migration.
