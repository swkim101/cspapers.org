We present a quantum algorithm that verifies a product of two <i>n</i> × <i>n</i> matrices over any integral domain with bounded error in worst-case time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>5/3</sup>) and expected time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>5/3</sup>/ min(<i>w</i>, √<i>n</i>)<sup>1/3</sup>), where ω is the number of wrong entries. This improves the previous best algorithm [3] that runs in time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>7/4</sup>). We also present a quantum matrix multiplication algorithm that is efficient when the result has few nonzero entries.
