This paper addresses the design and performance analysis of partial-multiple-bus interconnection networks. One such structure, called processor-oriented partial-multiple-bus (or PPMB), is proposed. It serves as an alternative to the conventional structure called memory-oriented partial-multiple-bus (or MPMB) and is aimed at higher system performance at less or equal system cost. PPMB's structural feature, which distinguishes itself from the conventional, is to provide every memory module with B paths to processors (where B is the total number of buses). This in contrast to the mere B/g paths provided in the conventional MPMB structure (where g is the number of groups), suggests a potential for higher system bandwidth. This potential is fully fulfilled by the load-balancing arbitration mechanism suggested, which in turn highlights the advantages of the proposed structure. As a result, it has been shown, both analytically and by simulation, that a substantial increase in system bandwidth (up to 20%) is achieved by the PPMB structure over the MPMB structure. In addition to the fact that the cost of PPMB is less than, or equal to, that of MPMB, its reliability is shown to be slightly increased as well.
