This paper describes an experiment designed and conducted by undergraduate students as part of a senior research project in Computer Science. The experiment tested whether the program comprehension of a set of Fortran 77 programs can be predicted by the Oviedo/Van Verth model of program complexity. In the study, student programmers were asked to demonstrate their ability to understand programs through use of the cloze procedure. Three different kinds of Fortran 77 programs were used at three different levels of complexity determined by the model. It was hypothesized that program comprehension would decrease, i.e. the number of incorrect answers would increase, as the complexity of the programs increased. Due to a variety of reasons, the results were inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the experiment, the method selected, and implications for future experiments.
