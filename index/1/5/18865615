This paper introduces a clustering approach, XML Clustering using Frequent Substructures (XCFS) that considers both the structural and the content information of XML documents in clustering. XCFS uses frequent substructures in the form of a novel representation, Closed Frequent Embedded (CFE) subtrees to constrain the content in the clustering process. The empirical analysis ascertains that XCFS can effectively cluster even very large XML datasets and outperforms other existing methods.
