As more computing power becomes available to individuals and more access to databases is available through internetworking, it becomes a challenge—both technically and sociologically—to try to keep ahead of the increased opportunity for violation of security and privacy. We have a dual role in this field. On the one hand, we must help our organizations and customers understand the real security and privacy exposure risks in systems they are implementing, and we must push our technology and its advance. On the other hand, we must avoid overselling our solutions and must argue against implementation where our knowledge of the risks suggests those risks are too great. This symposium and the proceedings are aimed at helping us address both of those roles by including advances and new ideas as well as concerns and difficulties with what we have.
