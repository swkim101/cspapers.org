In real-life, information retrieval consists of sessions of one or more query iterations. Each iteration has several subtasks like query formulation, result scanning, document link clicking, document reading and judgment, and stopping. Each of the subtasks has behavioral factors associated with them. These factors include search goals and cost constraints, query formulation strategies, scanning and stopping strategies, and relevance assessment behav-ior. Traditional IR evaluation focuses on retrieval and result presentation methods, and interaction within a single-query session. In the present study we aim at assessing the effects of the behavioral factors on retrieval effectiveness. Our research questions include how effective is human behavior employing search strategies compared to various baselines under various search goals and time constraints. We examine both ideal as well as fallible human behavior and wish to identify robust behaviors, if any. Methodologically, we use extensive simulation of human behavior in a test collection. Our findings include that (a) human behavior using multi-query sessions may exceed in effectiveness comparable single-query sessions, (b) the same empirically observed behavioral patterns are reasonably effective under various search goals and constraints, but (c) remain on average clearly below the best possible ones. Moreover, there is no behavioral pattern for sessions that would be even close to winning in most cases; the information need (or topic) in relation to the test collection is a determining factor.
