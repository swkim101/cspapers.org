Automatic detection of significant places is an important concept in many emerging context-aware applications. Providing such detection energy-efficiently poses a crucial challenge on mobile devices with limited battery capacity [1]. Several solutions have been proposed to address the problem, but no comparison between them has yet been published running on mobile devices, making it hard for researchers and developers to provide suitable trade-off solutions between accuracy and energy efficiency in an informed manner. To close this gap, we investigate the impact of four common types of energy efficiency strategies on a fingerprint-based algorithm for place sensing based on WiFi measurements, namely SensLoc [2]. Using experimental prototypes on the Android platform, we show that in empirical evaluation only one of the strategies, namely sample rate management, affects the energy usage in a positive manner. The three other investigated strategies show either no effect or use more energy than the baseline implementation. This results stands in contrast to the conclusion of previous simulation based results [2]. Based on our experimental results, we question the viability of purely model-based validation of energy efficiency.
