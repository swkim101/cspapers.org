Nowadays enterprise collaboration is becoming essential for valuable innovation and competitive advantage. This col- laboration has to be brought a step forward from technical collaboration till collective smart exploitation of global intel- ligence. Morfeo Open Source Community implements it as an open innovation schema of collaboration among SME's, universities, research centres, public administration and ma- jor corporations. Its disruptive contribution to the state of the art is to manage the collaboration licensing the shared technology as open, with an OSI accepted license. The main results of this innovation model are the development of SOA open software standards, the increase of OSS quality, the creation of an OSS services provider ecosystem, with an im- portant impact in the local economical development and the dissemination of the R&D&i activities among a broader set of organizations. Now Morfeo, with established relation- ship in Spain and EU, is involved defining new cooperation schemas in Ibero-America. The aim is to define a network of Morfeo Office in several countries to coordinate the global community.
