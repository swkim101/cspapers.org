Someone coined the term “Harvard-ization” to describe the goal of many American colleges and universities. If this is your goal, you pick out the best university you know, and do your best to imitate it. Over the course of the 20th century, Georgia Tech was guilty of its share of “Harvard-ization.” We added the requisite graduate programs and developed a solid research agenda, and in the process we advanced from a very good regional school to one with a national presence. Yet the path we trod through the 20th century was largely blazed before us by the likes of MIT and Harvard.
