We present and demonstrate INFRAME++, a novel system that enables concurrent, dual-mode, full-frame communication for both users and devices. It achieves unobtrusive screen-camera data communication without affecting the primary video-viewing experience for human users. It leverages the capability discrepancy and distinctive features of the human vision system and devices (modern display and camera). We have implemented INFRAME++ as a PC-phone application. Both communication will be realized through multiplexed videos frames which will be displayed on a modern monitor (120FPS) and captured by a smartphone camera for data decoding. In this demonstration (Figure 1), we will show that INFRAME++ can yield normal video-viewing experience for humans, and high-rate data communication for devices (up to 300 kbps). User participation will be welcome in this live demo.
