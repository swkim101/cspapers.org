This paper presents a flexible and efficient approach to deriv ing indirect implications in logic circuits. Indirect implica tions are essential in ATPG, equivalence checking, and netlist optimizati on. Contrary to other methods, our approach is based on a graph model f a circuitâ€™s clause description called the implication grap h. It combines both the flexibility of SAT-based techniques and high e fficiency of structure based methods. As the proposed algorithms oper ate only on the implication graph, they are independent of the chosen logic. Computation of indirect implications is performed by simpl e and efficient graph algorithms. Experimental results for various a pplications relying on indirect implications demonstrate the efficienc y of our approach.
