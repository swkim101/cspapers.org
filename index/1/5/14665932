A method is presented for matching two scene descriptions, each of which consists of a set of measured feature vectors with estimated uncertainties. The two scenes differ by a transformation that depends on a few unknown parameters. The method performs a search by sequentially matching features of one scene to those of the other scene, solving for the transformation parameters by means of a generalized least-squares adjustment, computing the probabilities of these matches by means of Bayes theorem, and using these probabilities to prune the search. An example is given using scene descriptions of the Martian surface in which the features are rocks approximated by ellipsoids.
