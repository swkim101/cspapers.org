During OOPSLA’91, there was a unique activity called “Parallel Universes” where several methodology experts were asked to demonstrate their problem solving approaches upon a problem they had never seen, in front of an audience. This paper presents a partial solution developed by this author as well as a brief tutorial of his methodology. Space limitations prohibit a complete discussion of this disciplined approach to object-oriented design. For further information about the approaches used, please contact the author.
