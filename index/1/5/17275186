The distance to monotonicity of a sequence of n numbers is the minimum number of entries whose deletion leaves an increasing sequence. We give the first deterministic streaming algorithm that approximates the distance to monotonicity within a 1 + e factor for any fixed e > 0 and runs in space polylogarithmic in the length of the sequence and the range of the numbers. The best previous deterministic algorithm achieving the same approximation factor required space Ω([EQUATION]n) [9]. Previous polylogarithmic space algorithms were either randomized [10], or had approximation factor no better than 2 [8]. 
 
We also present space lower bounds for this problem: Any deterministic streaming algorithm that gets a 1 + e approximation requires space Ω(1/e log2 (n)) and any randomized algorithm requires space Ω(1/e log2(n)/log log(n)).
