Inspired by that, we introduce Boltzmann Entropy to measure crowd motion in optical flow field so as to detect abnormal collective behaviors. As a result, the collective crowd moving pattern can be represented as a time series. We found that when most people behave anomaly, the entropy value will increase drastically. Thus, a threshold can be applied to the time series to identify abnormal crowd commotion in a simple and efficient manner without machine learning. The experimental results show promising performance compared with the state of the art methods. The system works in real time with high precision.
