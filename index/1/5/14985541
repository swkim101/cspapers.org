In this paper, we envision a scenario where mobile devices perform at least part-time spectrum sensing in a collaborative fashion under the control of a central server. The goal is to create an adequate `radio environment map' for the `white spaces' that will be useful for spectrum management decisions. We lay out the research challenges, describe a prototype implementation using a DTV receiver dongle interfaced with an Android-based mobile device, and present preliminary performance measurements.
