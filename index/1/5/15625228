This paper presents a novel approach for haptic object recognition with an anthropomorphic robot hand. Firstly, passive degrees of freedom are introduced to the tactile sensor system of the robot hand. This allows the planar tactile sensor patches to optimally adjust themselves to the object's surface and to acquire additional sensor information for shape reconstruction. Secondly, this paper presents an approach to classify an object directly from the haptic sensor data acquired by a palpation sequence with the robot hand - without building a 3d-model of the object. Therefore, a finite set of essential finger positions and tactile contact patterns are identified which can be used to describe a single palpation step. A palpation sequence can then be merged into a simple statistical description of the object and finally be classified. The proposed approach for haptic object recognition and the new tactile sensor system are evaluated with an anthropomorphic robot hand.
