This paper examines general transmission networks, of which I/O subsystems are a special case. By using the maximum entropy principle, we answer questions such as what is the probability that a path to a given node is free when that node is ready to transmit. Systems with both dynamic and fixed path selection mechanisms are treated. Approximate methods for large networks are proposed, and numerical examples are given.
