In this paper we introduce an experimental application to demonstrate the usage of context-based awareness cues in status updates, especially in SNS's (Social Networking Services). The presented application allows users to add different descriptions of context information to their Twitter messages and Facebook status updates in a narrative format. We have also developed an adapted version of the system including conference-specific context-types such as the timetable of the presentations and indoor-location detection using Bluetooth beacons. One goal for the demonstrator is to explore the practical use of context abstractions in a conference setup and synthesize interesting insight based on the usage patterns during the event.
