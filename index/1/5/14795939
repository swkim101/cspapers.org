This paper presents a novel architecture for building special-purpose agents for solving the information capture and access problem in large, unstructured data environments with uncertainty in data representation and interpretation. The key idea is to recognize and use underlying structure in such environments using simple components with specified performance guarantees connected by effective communication protocols. This paper brings together ideas from systems and theory: the design of mobile robots in unstructured physical environments, work in electronic libraries and know bets, topology, as well as the rich research in information retrieval and filtering to design a concrete software architecture for solving a wide range of highlevel user queries in multi-media environments.
