Our MT systems integrate many advanced concepts from the fields of computer science, linguistics, and AI: specialized languages for linguistic programming based on production systems, complete linguistic programming environment, multilevel representations, organization of the lexicons around "lexical units", units of translation of the size of several paragraphs, possibility of using text-driven heuristic strategies.We are now beginning to integrate new techniques: unified design of an "integrated" lexical data-base containing the lexicon in "natural" and "coded" form, use of the "static grammars" formalism as a specification language, addition of expert systems equipped with "extralinguistic" or "metalinguistic" knowledge, and design of a kind of structural metaeditor (driven by a static grammar) allowing the interactive construction of a document in the same way as syntactic editors are used for developing programs. We end the paper by mentioning some projects for long-term research.
