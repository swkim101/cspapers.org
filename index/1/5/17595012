From its beginnings, artificial intelligence has borrowed freely from the vocabulary of psychology. The use of the word "intelligence" to label our area of research is a case in point. Other terms referring originally to human mental processes that have consider able currency in AI are "thinking," "comprehending," and, with increasing frequency in the past five years, "understanding." Infact, these terms are probably used more freely in AI than in experimental psychology, where a deep suspicion of "mentalistic" terminology still lingers as a heritage of behaviorism.
