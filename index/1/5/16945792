This paper presents an approach to combine rank aggregation techniques using a soft computing technique -- Genetic Programming -- in order to improve the results in Information Retrieval tasks. Previous work shows that by combining rank aggregation techniques in an agglomerative way, it is possible to get better results than with individual methods. However, these works either combine only a small set of lists or are performed in a completely ad-hoc way. Therefore, given a set of ranked lists and a set of rank aggregation techniques, we propose to use a supervised genetic programming approach to search combinations of them that maximize effectiveness in large search spaces. Experimental results conducted using four datasets with different properties show that our proposed approach reaches top performance in most datasets. Moreover, this cross-dataset performance is not matched by any other baseline among the many we experiment with, some being the state-of-the-art in learning-to-rank and in the supervised rank aggregation tasks. We also show that our proposed framework is very efficient, flexible, and scalable.
