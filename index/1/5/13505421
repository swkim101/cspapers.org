In this paper, we propose a new index of dynamic manipulability for humanoid robot to estimate dynamic ability to change configuration by using remaining redundancy, while prior task is being controlled, e.g., face and eyes being directed to some object. Several indexes have been proposed so far to measure statical and dynamical capability of robot manipulator. For example, Dynamic Manipulability Ellipsoid (DME) describes a distribution of hand acceleration produced by normalized joint torque. On the other hand, Reconfiguration Manipulability Ellipsoid (RME) denotes a distribution of each link velocity produced by joint angular velocity. This paper shows new index of Dynamic Reconfiguration Manipulability (DRM) combined dynamic manipulability and reconfiguration manipulability, and we have adopted the DRM to a humanoid robot, exhibiting how the DRM indicates directly the configuration-changeability of walking humanoid robot.
