We consider the prediction of three human behavioral measures ‐ lexical decision, word naming, and picture naming ‐ through the lens of domain bias in language modeling. Contrasting the predictive ability of statistics derived from 6 different corpora, we find intuitive results showing that, e.g., a British corpus overpredicts the speed with which an American will react to the words ward and duke, and that the Google n-grams overpredicts familiarity with technology terms. This study aims to provoke increased consideration of the human language model by NLP practitioners: biases are not limited to differences between corpora (i.e. “train” vs. “test”); they can exist as well between corpora and the intended user of the resultant technology.
