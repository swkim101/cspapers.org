This paper is concerned with error processing for parallel producer-consumer interactions such as encountered in the desing of multi-process operating systems. Solutions to resynchronization problems that occur when a consumer process detects errors in information received from a producer process are presented. Fundamental properties of this error processing are discussed. It is shown that explicit error processing results in an increase in program complexity and a decrease in the ease of understanding a program.
