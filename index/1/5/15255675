Translating out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms is a great challenge for the Cross-lingual Information Retrieval and Data-driven Machine Translation systems. Several approaches have been proposed to mine translations for OOV terms from the web, especially from pages containing mixed languages. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically translate OOV terms on the fly through cross-lingual query expansion. The proposed approach does not require any web crawling and has achieved an inclusion rate of 95% and overall translation accuracy of 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art OOV translation techniques.
