This paper proposes a novel object manipulation method to regulate the position and attitude of an object in the task space with dynamic stability by using a triple soft-fingered robotic hand system. In our previous works, a dynamic object grasping method without use of any external sensing, called “the Blind Grasping”, has been proposed. Although stable grasping in a dynamic sense has been realized by the method, a simultaneous object position and attitude control has not yet been treated, so far. In this paper, instead of using any information of the real object position and attitude, virtual data of object position and attitude are introduced by defining a virtual frame. By using the virtual information, a control signal to regulate the virtual object position and attitude without use of any external sensing is designed. The usefulness of our proposed control method even under the existence of nonholonomic rolling constraints is illustrated through a numerical simulation result.
