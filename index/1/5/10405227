Several works have shown that relationships between data points (i.e., context) in structured data can be exploited to obtain better recognition performance. In this paper, we explore a different, but related, problem: how can these inter-relationships be used to efficiently learn and continuously update a recognition model, with minimal human labeling effort. Towards this goal, we propose an active learning framework to select an optimal subset of data points for manual labeling by exploiting the relationships between them. We construct a graph from the unlabeled data to represent the underlying structure, such that each node represents a data point, and edges represent the inter-relationships between them. Thereafter, considering the flow of beliefs in this graph, we choose those samples for labeling which minimize the joint entropy of the nodes of the graph. This results in significant reduction in manual labeling effort without compromising recognition performance. Our method chooses non-uniform number of samples from each batch of streaming data depending on its information content. Also, the submodular property of our objective function makes it computationally efficient to optimize. The proposed framework is demonstrated in various applications, including document analysis, scene-object recognition, and activity recognition.
