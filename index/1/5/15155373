In this paper, a novel four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) hybrid parallel platform manipulator is presented. The movable platform of the parallel manipulator can translate along two directions and rotate around two axes respectively. The kinematics model is formulated, which describes the inverse kinematic transformation and forward kinematic transformation. A 5-axis parallel machine tool based on the 4-DOF parallel manipulator is presented in this paper.
