Extracting faceted taxonomies from the Web has received increasing attention in recent years from the web mining community. We demonstrate in this study a novel system called DFT-Extractor, which automatically constructs domain-specific faceted taxonomies from Wikipedia in three steps: 1) It crawls domain terms from Wikipedia by using a modified topical crawler. 2) Then it exploits a classification model to extract hyponym relations with the use of motif-based features. 3) Finally, it constructs a faceted taxonomy by applying a community detection algorithm and a group of heuristic rules. DFT-Extractor also provides a graphical user interface to visualize the learned hyponym relations and the tree structure of taxonomies.
