Modern computer displays tend to be in fixed size, rigid, and rectilinear rendering them insensitive to the visual area demands of an application or the desires of the user. Foldable displays offer the ability to reshape and resize the interactive surface at our convenience and even permit us to carry a very large display surface in a small volume. In this paper, we implement four interactive foldable display designs using image projection with low-cost tracking and explore display behaviors using orientation sensitivity.
