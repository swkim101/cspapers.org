We discuss the problem of ranking instances. In our framework each instance is associated with a rank or a rating, which is an integer from 1 to k. Our goal is to find a rank-predict ion rule that assigns each instance a rank which is as close as possible to the instance's true rank. We describe a simple and efficient online algorithm, analyze its performance in the mistake bound model, and prove its correctness. We describe two sets of experiments, with synthetic data and with the EachMovie dataset for collaborative filtering. In the experiments we performed, our algorithm outperforms online algorithms for regression and classification applied to ranking.
