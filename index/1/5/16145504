We demonstrate PolyPoint, a high-fidelity RF-based indoor localization system that achieves 28~cm accuracy indoors and tracks a fast-moving quadcopter with only 56~cm average error. PolyPoint uses ultra-wideband signals to achieve high precision RF time-of-flight estimates between nodes. To further improve accuracy, PolyPoint exploits two forms of diversity: frequency diversity, which leverages several ultra-wideband channels to improve channel response, and antenna diversity, which adds three antennas at 120 degree offsets to mitigate the effects of antenna polarization and nulls. PolyPoint introduces an efficient, novel ranging protocol that maximizes these diversity sources with a minimal number of packets. Additionally, this work introduces a new hardware platform that provides ranging and localization as a service. The minimal TriPoint module integrates an ultra-wideband transceiver and microcontroller with firmware that implements the protocol. The TriTag carrier board adds Bluetooth and batteries to create a complete mobile tag, and the TriBase anchor platform integrates a TriPoint with an Intel Edison to act as anchors for the system.
