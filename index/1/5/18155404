In 2010 a new annual symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI) was launched as part of the AAAI annual meeting. The event was held in cooperation with ACM SIGCSE and has many similar goals related to broadening and disseminating work in computer science education. EAAI has a particular focus, however, as the event is specific to educational work in Artificial Intelligence and collocated with a major research conference (AAAI) to promote more interaction between researchers and educators in that domain. This panel seeks to introduce participants to EAAI as a way of fostering more interaction between educational communities in computing. Specifically, the panel will discuss the goals of EAAI, provide an overview of the kinds of work presented at the symposium, and identify potential synergies between that EAAI and SIGCSE as a way of better linking the two communities going forward.
