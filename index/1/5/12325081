Based on the “early selection” filter model, a new selective attention algorithm is developed to improve recognition performance for noisy patterns and superimposed patterns. The selective attention algorithm incorporates the error backpropagation rule to adapt the attention filters for a testing input pattern and an attention cue for a specific class. For superimposed test patterns an attention-switching algorithm is also developed to recognize both patterns one by one. The developed algorithms demonstrated much higher recognition rates for corrupted digit recognition tasks.
