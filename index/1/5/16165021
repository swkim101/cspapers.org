We develop a new statistical model for photographic images, in which the local responses of a bank of linear filters are described as jointly Gaussian, with zero mean and a covariance that varies slowly over spatial position. We optimize sets of filters so as to minimize the nuclear norms of matrices of their local activations (i.e., the sum of the singular values), thus encouraging a flexible form of sparsity that is not tied to any particular dictionary or coordinate system. Filters optimized according to this objective are oriented and bandpass, and their responses exhibit substantial local correlation. We show that images can be reconstructed nearly perfectly from estimates of the local filter response covariances alone, and with minimal degradation (either visual or MSE) from low-rank approximations of these covariances. As such, this representation holds much promise for use in applications such as denoising, compression, and texture representation, and may form a useful substrate for hierarchical decompositions.
