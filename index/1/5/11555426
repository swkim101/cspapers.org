Computational narrative is a complex and interesting domain for exploring AI techniques that algorithmically analyze, understand, and most importantly, generate stories. This paper studies the importance of domain knowledge in story generation, and particularly in analogy-based story generation (ASG). Based on the construct of knowledge container in case-based reasoning, we present a theoretical framework for incorporating domain knowledge in ASG. We complement the framework with empirical results in our existing system Riu.
