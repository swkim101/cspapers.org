We investigated a set of query messages taken from an Usenet newsgroup, and analyzed relations between the nature of problem-solving activities and their natural language descriptions. Based on the corpus investigation, this paper proposes an efficient computational mechanism for recovering problem-solving activities from query messages written in Japanese. The main claim of the paper is that the underlying problem-solving activity described in a natural language message can be efficiently recovered if provided with general knowledge on human problem-solving and the associated linguistic patterns in the descriptions.
