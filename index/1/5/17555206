In a typical programming class, students watch and listen as instructors explain and demonstrate e key concepts through the use of blackboards, overhead projectors, and computer screen projection. Students then move to computer laboratories and solve programming assignments, more or less on their own. There is little opportunity for machine interaction in the lecture hall, and little opportunity for human interaction in the laboratory.
