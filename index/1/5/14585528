SCA (Service Component Architecture) is an OASIS standard for describing service-oriented middleware architectures. In particular, SCA promotes a disciplined way for designing distributed architectures based on a component model and an Architecture Description Language (ADL). However, SCA does not cover the deployment and the run-time management of SCA applications. In this paper, we therefore describe the FraSCAti platform, which provides run-time support, deployment capabilities, and run-time management for SCA. Compared to state-of-the-art platforms, FraSCAti brings a dynamic reflective support to SCA and enables both introspecting and reconfiguring service-oriented architectures at run-time. To achieve this capability, the components are completed by a dedicated container, which is automatically generated by the platform. Furthermore, FraSCAti is a highly configurable platform that can be easily customized by finely selecting the features and functionalities which need to be included. In this way, the platform can be adapted to different application needs and middleware environments.
