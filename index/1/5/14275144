We consider the task of predicting lexical entailment using distributional vectors. We perform a novel qualitative analysis of one existing model which was previously shown to only measure the prototypicality of word pairs. We find that the model strongly learns to identify hypernyms using Hearst patterns, which are well known to be predictive of lexical relations. We present a novel model which exploits this behavior as a method of feature extraction in an iterative procedure similar to Principal Component Analysis. Our model combines the extracted features with the strengths of other proposed models in the literature, and matches or outperforms prior work on multiple data sets.
