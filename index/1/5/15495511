In this paper we propose a methodology for conformity analysis of communication protocols. By conformity analysis it is meant to demonstrate that a protocol does indeed provide the service for which it is intended. We specify both a protocol and its service by a CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) based language. To perform the conformity analysis we develop a transformation system to extract from a CSP process the communication sequences that may arise during its execution, and to express these sequences in terms of behavior expressions in CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems). By performing algebraic manipulations and the equivalence proof on these expressions, we can show that the external behavior of a protocol conforms to its intended service. A version of the Alternating Bit Protocol is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology.
