Many testing methods require the selection of a set of paths over which testing is to be conducted. This paper presents an analysis of the effectiveness of individual paths for testing predicates in linearly domained programs. A measure is derived for the marginal advantage of testing another path after several paths have already been tested. This measure is used to show that any predicate in such programs may be sufficiently tested using at most m+n+1 paths, where m is the number of input values and n is the number of program variables.
