In this paper, we present a collective, or swarm construction algorithm to control robotic bulldozers in the creation of a work site. Predictions about robotic missions to the planet Mars have described such site preparation as essential to the success of later mission objectives, such as the construction of solar arrays, etc. This algorithm was based on a behaviour observed in a particular species of ant called "blind bulldozing". We developed a mathematical model of blind bulldozing using a unique approach based on Markov chains. Robot bulldozers were developed and used to test the algorithms in our laboratory. The team of robots was found to be successful at clearing an open area out of field of rocks. Our robots' behaviour also agreed with the predictions of our model. This work is significant because it demonstrated the viability of blind bulldozing and represents the first time, to our knowledge, that a multiple robot system has carried out a form of the general construction task outside of simulation.
