We present a distributed protocol for updating and maintaining a minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) in a network with changing topology. The protocol can respond to multiple link/node failures and recoveries that can occur at arbitrary times. Given that an arbitrary finite number of topological changes occur during a period, the protocol finds the MST corresponding to the latest network, within finite time after the last change. The message complexity of the protocol is O(m|E|+k|V|) when k link recoveries and m link failures occur, where |V| and |E| are the total number of nodes and links, respectively.
