For the task of question answering (QA) over Freebase on the WEBQUESTIONS dataset (Berant et al., 2013), we found that 85% of all questions (in the training set) can be directly answered via a single binary relation. Thus we turned this task into slot-filling for tuples: predicting relations to get answers given a questionâ€™s topic. We design efficient data structures to identify question topics organically from 46 million Freebase topic names, without employing any NLP processing tools. Then we present a lean QA system that runs in real time (in offline batch testing it answered two thousand questions in 51 seconds on a laptop). The system also achieved 7.8% better F1 score (harmonic mean of average precision and recall) than the previous state of the art.
