This work addresses the problem of controlling smart homes dedicated to people with disabilities when their disabilities evolve. These people being usually frail by nature, keeping their environment constantly safe and adapted is crucial. While it is possible to prove the security of such an environment given both its behavioral definition and a patient profile, proving that it will remain secure for all possible profile evolution is a combinatorial problem. A solution to this problem is to define secure execution points on which the control of the environment's behavior can be changed for a new one that is adapted to an evolution of the patient's profile. This paper presents the methodology to implement this solution based on the definition of the environment as a synchronous program containing controllability information. From such a program, we use a synthesis technique named Discrete Controller Synthesis to obtain — when it exists — a control function that will enforce temporal properties on the execution of the synchronous program. A use case is presented, showing a partial model of a smart home, on which security properties are defined to be enforced at runtime. During execution, the patient profile is updated, and a new controller obtained through DCS is integrated to adapt the environment's behavior appropriately.
