The workshop focuses on the three areas of interest to CIKM to discuss how to envisage and design evaluation infrastructures able to store, manage, and make accessible the scientific data and knowledge of interest for advancing the evaluation of information retrieval and access tools.
 Main goal is to understand how to make use of the expertise of the three scientific areas in a cooperative way to avoid the duplication of efforts which may occur when addressing the problem separately in each specific area and to trigger synergies and joint actions on the issue.
 Main purposes of the workshop are the identification of a roadmap and the definition of initial best practices to guide the development of the necessary evaluation infrastructures.
