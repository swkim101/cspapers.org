The subject of this paper is the analysis and control of a biped line walking robot for inspection of power transmission lines. The novel mechanism enables the center of the robot to concentrate on the hip joint to minimize the drive torque of the hip joint. The mechanical structure of the robot is discussed, as well as forward kinematics. A dynamic model is established in this paper. Locomotion of the line-walking robot is discussed in detail and the line-walking cycle of the designed mechanism is composed of a single-support phase and a double-support phase. Finally, a PD+ gravity compensation method is introduced for the controller design in the single-support phase and a complaint controller with estimated force is implemented during the double-support phase. The feasibility of this concept is then confirmed by performing experiments with a simulated line environment.
