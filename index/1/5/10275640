A new abstraction — the Parallel Supply Function (PSF) — is proposed for representing the computing capabilities offered by virtual platforms implemented atop identical multiprocessors. It is shown that this abstraction is strictly more powerful than previously-proposed ones, from the perspective of more accurately representing the inherent parallelism of the provided computing capabilities. Sufficient tests are derived for determining whether a given real-time task system, represented as a collection of sporadic tasks, is guaranteed to always meet all deadlines when scheduled upon a specified virtual platform using the global EDF scheduling algorithm.
