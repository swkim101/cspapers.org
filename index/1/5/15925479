We describe and evaluate several methods for estimating the confidence in the per-edge correctness of a predicted dependency parse. We show empirically that the confidence is associated with the probability that an edge is selected correctly and that it can be used to detect incorrect edges very efficiently. We evaluate our methods on parsing text in 14 languages.
