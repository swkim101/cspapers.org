We present a fork-type sensing device called the Sensing Fork that detects the eating behavior of children (food choice and eating actions), and a smartphone game to address children's eating problems based on their eating behavior. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Sensing Fork prototype and a play-based eating game called Hungry Panda 2, which works with the Sensing Fork. This game focuses on motivating children to eat all kinds of food on their table.
