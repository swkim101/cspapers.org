This paper presents an experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating a studio-based learning model for CS2. Adapted from architecture and art education, as well as from collaborative problem-solving pedagogies, studio-based learning has shown great promise for computing education. Key elements of studio-based learning include exploring multiple solutions to a problem, justifying the choice of one solution, and being subject to, as well as providing, peer reviews. We describe the design, implementation, and revision of a studio model for CS2, and then present the results of an evaluation of the model when compared to traditional instruction in CS2.
