The high computational cost of population based optimization methods, such as multi-objective genetic algorithms, has been preventing applications of these methods to realistic engineering design problems. The main challenge is to devise methods that can significantly reduce the number of computationally intensive simulation (objective/constraint functions) calls. We present a new multi-objective design optimization approach in that kriging-based metamodeling is embedded within a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The approach is called Kriging assisted Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm, or K-MOGA. The key difference between K-MOGA and a conventional MOGA is that in K-MOGA some of the design points or individuals are evaluated by kriging metamodels, which are computationally inexpensive, instead of the simulation. The decision as to whether the simulation or their kriging metamodels to be used for evaluating an individual is based on checking a simple condition. That is, it is determined whether by using the kriging metamodels for an individual the non-dominated set in the current generation is changed. If this set is changed, then the simulation is used for evaluating the individual; otherwise, the corresponding kriging metamodels are used. Seven numerical and engineering examples with different degrees of difficulty are used to illustrate applicability of the proposed K-MOGA. The results show that on the average, K-MOGA converges to the Pareto frontier with about 50% fewer number of simulation calls compared to a conventional MOGA.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
