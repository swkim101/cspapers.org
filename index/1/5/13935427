In this paper, we propose a method to find the safest path between two locations, based on the geographical model of crime intensities. We consider the police records and news articles for finding crime density of different areas of the city. It is essential to consider news articles as there is a significant delay in updating police crime records. We address this problem by updating the crime intensities based on current news feeds. Based on the updated crime intensities, we identify the safest path. It is this real time updation of crime intensities which makes our model way better than the models that are presently in use. Our model would also inform the user of crime sprees in a particular area thereby ensuring that user avoids these crime hot spots.
