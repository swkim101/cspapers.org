This paper discusses the basic principles of applying data mining in Electronic Design Automation. It begins by introducing several important concepts in statistical learning and summarizes different types of learning algorithms. Then, the experience of developing a practical data mining application is described, including promises that are demonstrated through positive results based on industrial settings and constraints explained in their respective application contexts.
