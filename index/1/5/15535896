Jasmine/C is a C-based database proqramninq language that allows the handling of persistent objects in Jasmine databases. The language is used to write methods for objects and application programs. Both navigational and associative access to objects are supported. Dot notation is used for Jasmine/C queries. Attributes of different (but linked) objects are concatenated in SQL-like queries free of from-clauses. This allows the joining of objects without explicit join-predicates. Several new features are introduced into the architecture of Jasmine. Memory KB is a memorybased database where each object is accessed via a pointer. Tuples in XDE (the lower layer of Jasmine), when in database buffers, can also be accessed via pointers. NF2 tables are supported for clustering values for multiple-valued attributes; these allow faster execution of Jasmine/C programs.
