In this paper we explore possible negative drawbacks in the use of wearable sensors, i.e., wearable devices used to detect different kinds of activity, e.g., from step and calories counting to heart rate and sleep monitoring. These technologies, which in the latter years witnessed a rapid development in terms of accuracy and diffusion, are now available on different platforms at reasonable prices and can lead to an healthier behavior in people using them. Nevertheless, we will try to investigate possibly harming behaviors related to these devices. We will provide different scenarios in which wearable sensors, in connection with social media, data mining, or other technologies, could prove harmful for their users.
