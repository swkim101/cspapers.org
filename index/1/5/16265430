While collision detection and contact-related injury reduction in physical human-robot interaction has been studied intensively, safety issues in physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) with continuous coupling of human and robot(s) has received little attention so far. We develop an energy monitoring control system that observes energy flows among the different subsystems involved in pHRC, shaping them to improve human safety according to selected metrics. Port-Hamiltonian formalisms are used to model each sub-system and their interconnection. An energy-based compliance controller that enhances safety by adapting the robot behavior is proposed and validated through extensive simulations.
