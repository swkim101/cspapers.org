An interaction technique for immersive virtual environments called “head-tracked orbital viewing” is described. The user’s head orientation is tracked and mapped so as to move the viewpoint of the user about the surface of a virtual sphere surrounding a center of rotation. The technique is useful for object examination tasks in a virtual world, allowing the user to quickly and easily view an object from many perspectives.
