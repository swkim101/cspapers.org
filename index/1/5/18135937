Regular expressions are the dominant technique to extract business relevant entities (e.g., invoice numbers or product names) from text data (e.g., invoices), since these entity types often follow a strict underlying syntactical pattern. However, the manual construction of regular expressions that guarantee a high recall and precision is a tedious manual task and requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically infers regular expressions from a set of (positive) sample entities, which in turn can be derived either from enterprise databases (e.g., a product catalog) or annotated documents (e.g., historical invoices). The main innovation of our approach is that it learns effective regular expressions that can be easily interpreted and modified by a user. The effectiveness is obtained by a novel method that weights dependent entity features of different granularity (i.e. on character and token level) against each other and selects the most suitable ones to form a regular expression.
