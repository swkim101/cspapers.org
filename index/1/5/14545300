Following with the advancements in digitization technology and broadband communication technology, realtime video streaming service has become an essential one for next generation Internet. When transmitting compressed video across the Internet, however, one of the main challenges is packet error/loss. High coding dependencies among video frames suffer from vulnerability to packet loss, which impacts the playback quality of video stream. Losing an important frame may cause a set of frames loss or damage as well. In this paper, we propose an effective important frame decision scheme in which the playback quality is considered. The results of this paper can be applied to the unequal frame protection scheme which targets to improve the video playback quality with minimal frame protection overhead.
