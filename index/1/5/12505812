Log management systems are common in industry and an essential part of a system administratorâ€™s toolkit. Examples include Splunk, elk, Log Insight, Sexilog, and more. Logs in these systems are characterized by a small number of predefined fields such as timestamp and host, with the bulk of an entry being unstructured text. System administrators query these logs using a combination of range constraints over predefined fields and patterns or regular expressions over the text portion of the message. These queries are both complex and diverse. We propose a method for maintaining a subset of these logs in a much smaller database known as a sublog. Because queries are issued against a much smaller data set they run to completion quickly and avoid common scaling bottlenecks. However, the improvement in performance comes at a price. Because we only consider a subset of the original data, we are only able to provide approximate responses. Nonetheless, the reduction in accuracy is minimal and we are able to produce high-quality, high-performance results.
