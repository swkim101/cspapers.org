We present a methodology to link domain 
thesauri to general-domain lexica. This is 
applied in the framework of the KYOTO 
project to link the Species2000 thesaurus 
to the synsets of the English WordNet. 
Moreover, we study the formalisation of 
this thesaurus according to the ISO LMF 
standard and its dialect WordNet-LMF. 
This conversion will allow Species2000 
to communicate with the other resources 
available in the KYOTO architecture.
