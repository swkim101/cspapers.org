The Internet is an ever-growing ecosystem with diverse software and hardware applications deployed in numerous countries around the globe. This heterogenous structure, however, is reduced to a homogenous means of addressing servers, i.e., their IP address. Due to this, analyzing different Internet services for vulnerabilities at scale is easy, leading to many researcher focusing on large-scale detection of many types of flaws. On the other hand, the persons responsible for the administration of said services are as heterogenous as the Internet architecture itself: be it in spoken languages or knowledge of technical details of the services. The notification of vulnerable services has long been treated as a side note in research. Recently, the community has focussed more not only the detection of flaws, but also on the notification of affected parties. These works, however, only analyze a small segment of the problem space. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the issues encountered by the previous works and provide a number of future directions for research, ultimately aiming to allow for an easier means of notifying affected parties about vulnerabilities at scale.
