Inventory management refers to tracing inventory levels, orders and sales of a retailing business. In the current retailing market, a tremendous amount of data regarding stocked goods (items) in an inventory will be generated everyday. Due to the increasing volume of transaction data and the correlated relations of items, it is often a non-trivial task to efficiently and effectively manage stocked goods. In this demo, we present an intelligent system, called iMiner, to ease the management of enormous inventory data. We utilize distributed computing resources to process the huge volume of inventory data, and incorporate the latest advances of data mining technologies into the system to perform the tasks of inventory management, e.g., forecasting inventory, detecting abnormal items, and analyzing inventory aging. Since 2014, iMiner has been deployed as the major inventory management platform of ChangHong Electric Co., Ltd, one of the world's largest TV selling companies in China.
