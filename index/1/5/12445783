Target tracking is one of the most important applications of wireless sensor networks. Optimized computation and energy dissipation are critical requirements to maximize the lifetime of the sensor network. There exists a demand for self-organizing and routing capabilities in the sensor network. Existing methods attempting to achieve these requirements, such as the LEACH-based algorithms, however, suffer either redundancy in data and sensor node deployment, or complex computation incurred in the sensor nodes. Those drawbacks result in energy use inefficiency and/or complex computation overhead. OCO, or Optimized Communication and Organization, is an algorithm that ensures maximum accuracy of target tracking, efficient energy dissipation, and low computation overhead on the sensor nodes. Simulation evaluations of OCO are compared with other two methods under various scenarios.
