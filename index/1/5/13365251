Building on our previous work [1], in this paper we demonstrate how it is possible to improve flight control of a MAV that experiences aerodynamic disturbances caused by objects on its path. Predictions based on low resolution depth images taken at a distance are incorporated into the flight control loop on the throttle channel as this is adjusted to target undisrupted level flight. We demonstrate that a statistically significant improvement (p â‰ª 0.001) is possible for some common obstacles such as boxes and steps, compared to using conventional feedback-only control. Our approach and results are encouraging toward more autonomous MAV exploration strategies.
