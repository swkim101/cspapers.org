Designing appropriate force control parameters is necessary in robotic assembly for successful operations. Moreover, obtaining control parameters that can shorten the cycle time to perform operations is very important in industrial applications. In this paper, we present a method to design damping control parameters that can shorten the cycle time and show the effectiveness of the parameters obtained through the method. In the method, sub-optimal parameters are obtained through repetitive simulations of assembly operations in order to estimate the cycle time because it is difficult to calculate the cycle time analytically. We apply the method to peg-in-hole operations and show experimental results using the control parameters obtained through the method.
