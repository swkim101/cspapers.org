Incentives have been introduced in participatory sensing applications to encourage the general public to engage in providing quality data that is meaningful to a data collection campaign. However, it is likely that there is no single incentive mechanism that is guaranteed to increase and sustain user engagement. We believe that to sustain user engagement in participatory sensing campaigns, incentives should be tailored to reflect the interests of individuals, as well as the nature of the application. We propose a framework that provides participatory sensing application developers with the flexibility to offer various incentives within a single participatory sensing campaign.
