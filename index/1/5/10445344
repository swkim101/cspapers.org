This paper presents a new algorithm for finding global min-cuts in weighted, undirected graphs. One of the strengths of the algorithm is its extreme simplicity. This randomized algorithm can be implemented as a strongly polynomial sequential algorithm with running time 6(mn2), even if space is restricted to O(n), or can be parallelized as an Zn/C algorithm which runs in time O(log2 n) on a CRCW PRAM with mn2 log n processors. In addition to yielding the best known processor bounds on unweighted graphs, this algorithm provides the first proof that the min-cut problem for weighted undirected graphs is in 7ZAfC. The algorithm does more than find a single mm-cut; it finds all of them. The algorithm also yields numerous results on network reliability, enumeration of cuts, multi-way cuts, and approximate mm-cuts.
