Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) based Transport Monitoring System has created some interest to many researchers. Currently, the implementation of AVL based Transport Monitoring System rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which can produce real time location of a vehicle. Implementation of a complete Transport Monitoring System requires other components such as communication module, Geographical Information System (GIS), database and monitoring application to be included into the system architecture. Once all the elements are put together, the project might become quite complex and very difficult to be deployed in a relatively short development cycle. In this paper, we propose a new approach on the design and implementation of a Transport Monitoring System that will not only make the project more manageable but will also enhance it by offering extended collaborative features. This new language-based platform will also allow modular experimentation of various optimization algorithms to be designed, tested and selected for better system performance. With the proposed framework, AVL based Transport Monitoring System can be implemented economically and efficiently. Comparison analysis among available AVL based system framework is also performed to show that this research work is feasible.
