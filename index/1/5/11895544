Recent business studies have shown that social technologies can significantly improve productivity within enterprises by improving access to information, ideas, and collaborators. A manifestation of the growing adoption of enterprise social technologies is the increasing use of enterprise virtual discussions to engage customers and employees. In this paper we present an enterprise discussion analysis system which seeks to enable rapid interactive inference of insights from virtual online enterprise discussions. Rapid understanding is facilitated by extracting a hierarchy of key concepts, which represent a multi-faceted thematic categorization of discussion content, and by identifying high-quality thematic exemplar comments. The concept hierarchy and exemplar comments are presented through an intuitive web user-interface which allows an analyst to quickly navigate through the main concepts and the most relevant comments extracted from the discussion. We present a preliminary validation of system efficacy through user surveys provided to test users.
