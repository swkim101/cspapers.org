This paper presents a 3D simulator used for studying the motion control and autonomous navigation of a robotic fish. The simplified kinematics and hydrodynamics models are created for the simulator, including many other object models such as water, obstacles, sonar sensors and a swimming pool. The experimental results show that the use of this simulator is a realistic and convenient way to develop autonomous navigation algorithms for robotic fishes.
