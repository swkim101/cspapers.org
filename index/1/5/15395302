Compliant actuation contributes enormously in legged locomotion robotics since it is able to alleviate control efforts in improving the robot's adaptability and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel design of a variable stiffness rotary actuator, called MESTRAN, which was especially targeted to address the limitations in terms of the amount of energy and time required to vary the stiffness of an actuated joint. We have constructed a mechanical model in simulation and a physical prototype. We conducted a series of experiments to validate the performance of the MESTRAN actuator prototype. The results from the simulation and experiments show that MESTRAN allows independent control of stiffness and position of an actuated rotary joint with a large operational range and high speed. The torque-displacement relationship is close to linear. Lastly, the MESTRAN actuator is energy-efficient since a certain stiffness level is maintained without energy input.
