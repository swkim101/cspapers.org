In this paper, we propose a model of versions which manages simple and composite objects. In our model, we have identified two types of versions : class versions [ 101 [24] and instance versions [6] [8]. These different versions are linked to each other by different relationships. A mechanism for the automatic propagation of versions [13] [24] for composite objects is proposed in order to propagate the creation of versions only in certain cases.
