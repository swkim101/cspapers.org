Participants of the session will discover EarSketch (https://earsketch.gatech.edu), a free, web-based learning environment that teaches introductory computer science through music. It aligns with Computer Science Principles and has been used in a variety of other educational contexts as well, ranging from late elementary through College. EarSketch provides an in-depth introduction to computer science and programming through composing, producing, and remixing music with Python and JavaScript code. No previous knowledge or experience in music, Python, or JavaScript is required to begin learning or teaching with EarSketch. Results from pilot studies show that EarSketch facilitates student learning about computation and improves student engagement in computing through parameters such as self-confidence, motivation, or intent to persist. This trend is particularly true for female and minority students, who are underrepresented today in US computer science classrooms. EarSketch comprises a curriculum, teacher materials, a coding environment, a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), a sound database, and sharing tools. Fundamental computing concepts are introduced through curricular modules that teach how to place sounds, create rhythms, and manipulate effects, with a focus on popular genres such as hip hop and dubstep. The platform has over 77,000 users in computer science classrooms across the US and internationally. EarSketch receives funding from the National Science Foundation, the Scott Hudgens Family Foundation, the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, and the Google Inc. Fund of Tides Foundation.
