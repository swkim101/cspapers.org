In the domain of interaction languages, forms have been found to be of value in allowing users, especially non-programmers, to specify objects and operations with a minimum of training, time, and errors. Most of that research, however, has been on the use of data base query languages. The present research found that in a procedural task of specifying mail filtering instructions, non-programmers using a form were as fast as programmers using a procedural language, although programmers using the form were faster still.
