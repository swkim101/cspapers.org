The WK-recursive network proposed by Vecchia and Sanges [7] is widely used in the design and implementation of local area networks and parallel processing architectures. It provides a high degree of regularity and scalability, which very well conforms to a modular design and realization of distributed systems involving large number of computing elements. In this paper, we investigate the routing of a message on the WK-recursive network, that is key to the performance of this network. We present an efficient shortest path algorithm on the WK-recursive network, which is better that Chen and Duh [2] in terms of designing complexity.
