This paper discusses the issues in amalgamating multiple programming paradigms in the logic programming language, Prolog. It is shown that multiple paradigms can be incorporated without disturbing logic programming language features and efficiency. It also introduces a new programming paradigm called the relation-oriented paradigm. The research results are reflected in the implementation of the Prolog-based knowledge programming system PEACE, which is used to realize an expert system in a diagnostic domain. PEACE provides a relation-oriented programming paradigm, as well as previously discussed paradigms, such as object-oriented, data-oriented, and rule-oriented paradigms. These paradigms are nicely amalgamated in Prolog language and can be used intermixedly.
