A circuit for fast, compact and low-power focal-plane motion centroid localization is presented. This chip, which uses mixed signal CMOS components to implement photodetection, edge detection, ON-set detection and centroid localization, models the retina and superior colliculus. The centroid localization circuit uses time-windowed asynchronously triggered row and column address events and two linear resistive grids to provide the analog coordinates of the motion centroid. This VLSI chip is used to realize fast lightweight autonavigating vehicles. The obstacle avoiding line-following algorithm is discussed.
