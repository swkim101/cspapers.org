An Enterprise Architecture (EA) provides a holistic view of an enterprise. In creating or changing an EA, multiple decisions have to be made, which are based on assumptions about the situation at hand. In this thesis, we develop a framework for reasoning about changing decisions and assumptions, based on logical theories of intentions. This framework serves as the underlying formalism for a recommender system for EA decision making.
