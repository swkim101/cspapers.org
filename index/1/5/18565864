This paper describes an analysis method and a pro- gram, DAO, for validating requirements of embedded systems. In the real-world systems that contain embedded systems, service is provided by some "server" objects to some "client" objects. The "client" objects have needs to be satisfied. Usually, these objects are unpredictable and ephemeral. Oil the other hand, the "server" objects are there to help. They are capable, predictable and stable. These observations suggest that if we categorize objects by the functions they perform, constraints will be associated with each category. We can ask the user to specify the category of an object in addition to normal requirements specification. Then the analysis method can detect errors by checking if the behaviors of the object satisfy the constraints associated with the category of the object.
