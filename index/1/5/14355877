Class assignments should have more relevance to the real world. There is not enough time to have a realistic project in a class, but a realistic project would give the students a taste of the real world.We attacked this problem by merging two classes, Introduction to Database Systems and Software Engineering I, thereby allowing enough time for a more meaningful final project. We chose to use a loosely coupled approach to merging our classes.
