We demonstrate the first, to the best of our knowledge, LBS client that safeguards user privacy against non-trustworthy LBS servers. Our collaborative approach allows the client to obtain responses from its near-by peers rather than submitting the query to the LBS. Our demo makes the user aware of her privacy level and offers tunable user parameters. The demo contributes a novel user-centric approach that enhances privacy without altering the business model of location-based services.
