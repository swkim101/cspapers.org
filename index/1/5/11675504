This paper presents a case for using Nano-Electro-Mechanical-System switches for power gating idle functional units of an embedded microprocessor. We achieve an average of 26% total energy savings, with a worst-case 5% increase in cycles. Our work includes detailed comparison with transistor switches, actuation circuitry design, identification of desired switch parameters, and device lifetime analysis
