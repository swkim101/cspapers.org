Inspection is an important stage in the manufacturing process of machined parts. Coordinate measuring machines (CMM) have become more automatic, programmable, and capable of fulfilling the growing demands of inspection. However, fixturing (datum alignment) of parts is still done manually, consuming valuable inspection time. In this paper, we describe an automated datum alignment technique which integrates a vision system with the CMM to avoid part fixturing. The rough position of the part is estimated through image analysis. This initial reference frame drives the CMM through an automatic datum alignment procedure, thereby automatically establishing the reference frame without the use of fixtures. This technique has been demonstrated for two and a half dimensional (2.5D) machined parts with well-defined features that exhibit a stable position on a flat table.Copyright Â© 2005 by ASME
