We present Monoxalyze, a keychain-sized, Bluetooth-based, carbon monoxide breathalyzer that aims to enable mobile, scalable smoking cessation intervention programs. These intervention programs have been shown to greatly increase the rate of a quit attempt, which in turn decreases the rate of smoking, a major public health problem that still affects over one billion people around the world. Currently, intervention programs verify cessation compliance by requiring program participants to periodically visit clinics and exhale through large, expensive carbon monoxide breathalyzers---a practice that cannot scale to one billion smokers. Monoxalyze enables mobile cessation verification by working with a user's smartphone to establish a ring of spatio-temporal transitive trust between the Monoxalyze device, the user, and the smartphone, a concept that can be applied to many third-party monitoring applications. In Monoxalyze, the links of this trust are represented by simultaneous exhalation verification, facial recognition, and device-to-phone visible light authentication. In our evaluation, we show that Monoxalyze lasts over 80 days between charges, and has the ability to verify a Monoxalyze user. With a small user study we show that Monoxalyze determines smoking cessation with 92% accuracy, a level comparable with commercial CO breathalyzers. Further contributions describe the design decisions behind creating a low-power BLE device.
