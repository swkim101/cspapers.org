We present results from a system which uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements to estimate the speed at which a person is walking when they cross the link line. While many RSS-based device-free localization systems can detect a line crossing, this system estimates additionally the speed of crossing, which can provide significant additional information to a tracking system. Further, unlike device-free RF sensors which occupy tens of MHz of bandwidth, this system uses a channel of about 10 kHz. Experiments with a person walking from 0.3 to 1.8 m/s show the system can measure walking speed within 0.05 m/s RMS error.
