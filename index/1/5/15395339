Manv fundamental auestions in evolution remain unresolved despite the abundance of genetic sequence data that is now available to answer these questions. This state of affairs is largely due to the lack of efl%ent and accurate computational methods for inferring evolutionary trees. Efficient methods are critical since the abundance of sequence data has resulted in the desire to analyze large datasets. Methods with guaranteed accuracy are important since biologists reauire proof that results are meauinfi. In ihis paper the first polynomi~ time approximation scheme (PTAS) for inferring evolutionary trees under the character compatibility paradigm is presented. PTASâ€™s are hiehlv desirable since thev allow the aonroximation of an opximal solution with arbi&ary precision% polynomial time. A requirement of this PTAS is that the data set, comprised of bipartitions of the species set, have size O(n). This is shown to be a natural restriction and the Ordinal Split Method is presented which can generate a set of Q(n) bipartitions from sequence data. The ability of the Ordinal Split Method to select highly accurate bipartitions is evaluated by simulation studies.
