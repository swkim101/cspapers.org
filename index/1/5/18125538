This is a discussion paper on a very important topic that is about to become mainstream. It deals with the issues of software engineering in concurrent systems. It introduces this topic and illustrates the arguments for a change of perspective. It underlines these arguments with two examples, an asynchronous stream-based programming model and an asynchronous thread-based virtual machine model. Both support concurrency on very different abstractions but both capture similar support for concurrency engineering.
