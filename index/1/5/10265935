Scientists today conduct new research via software-based experimentation and validation in a host of disciplines. Scientific software represents a significant investment due to its complexity and longevity yet there is little reuse of scientific software beyond small libraries which increases development and maintenance costs. To alleviate this disconnect, we have developed KADRE, a domain-specific architecture recovery approach and toolset to aid automatic and accurate identification of workflow components in existing scientific software. KADRE improves upon state of the art general cluster techniques, helping to promote component-based reuse within the domain.
