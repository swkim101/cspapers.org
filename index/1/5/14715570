Monolingual alignment is the task of pairing semantically similar units from two pieces of text. We report a top-performing supervised aligner that operates on short text snippets. We employ a large feature set to (1) encode similarities among semantic units (words and named entities) in context, and (2) address cooperation and competition for alignment among units in the same snippet. These features are deployed in a two-stage logistic regression framework for alignment. On two benchmark data sets, our aligner achieves F1 scores of 92.1% and 88.5%, with statistically significant error reductions of 4.8% and 7.3% over the previous best aligner. It produces top results in extrinsic evaluation as well.
