Distributed systems contain several interacting components that perform complex computational tasks. Formal specification of the interaction protocols are crucial to the understanding of these systems. Dynamic specification mining from traces containing information about actual interactions during execution of distributed systems can play a useful role in verification and comprehension when formal specification is not available. A framework for behavioral specification mining in distributed systems is proposed. Concurrency and complexity in the distributed models raise special challenges to specification mining in such systems.
