We present an autonomous quadrotor system that is able to perform high precision landing on small platform in both indoor and outdoor environment. Its taking off and landing processes are fully autonomous. We use vision sensor to detect the landing platform, and the vision measurement is enhanced by IMU with SRUKF based sensor fusion method. All computation are done real-time and on-board. We implement the system and carry a series of experiments under various environmental conditions. The experiment results confirm the robustness and precision of our system in real use cases.
