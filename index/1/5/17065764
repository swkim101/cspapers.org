The advent of packet-switched networks has led to increased use of computers for sending text messages (memos) between people. However, attachment to common carrier or equivalent packet networks is expensive and/or restricted by organizational policies. In addition, use of several networks creates the need for relaying memos between them. The work described here is designed to free users from dependence upon any particular communication environment and to provide a memo distribution facility which can employ whatever communication channels are available. It will support variable-network structures, emulation of network attachment, and inter-network memo forwarding.
