PESOS 2013 is a forum that brings together software engineering researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners working in the areas of service-oriented systems to discuss research challenges, recent developments, novel application scenarios, as well as methods, techniques, experiences, and tools to support engineering, evolution and adaptation of service-oriented systems. The special theme of the 5th edition of PESOS is “Service Engineering for the Cloud” The goal is to explore approaches to better engineer service-oriented systems, to either take advantage of the qualities offered by cloud infrastructures or to account for lack of full control over important quality attributes. PESOS 2013 also continues to be the key forum for collecting case studies and artifacts for educators and researchers in this area.
