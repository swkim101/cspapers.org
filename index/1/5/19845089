Dynamic time warping is not suitable for on-line applications because it requires complete knowledge of both series before the alignment of the first elements can be computed. We present a novel online time warping algorithm which has linear time and space costs, and performs incremental alignment of two series as one is received in real time. This algorithm is applied to the alignment of audio signals in order to track musical performances.
