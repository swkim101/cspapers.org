The Web is a valuable source of language specific resources but collecting, organizing and utilizing this information is difficult. We describe CorpusBuilder, an approach for automatically generating Web-search queries to collect documents in a minority language. It differs from pseudo-relevance feedback in that retrieved documents are labeled by an automatic language classifier as relevant or irrelevant and a subset of documents is used to generate new queries. We experiment with various query-generation methods and query-lengths to find inclusion/exclusion terms that are helpful for finding documents in the target language and find that using odds-ratio scores calculated over the documents acquired so far was one of the most consistently accurate query-generation methods. We also describe experiments using a handful of words elicited from a user instead of initial documents and show that the methods perform similarly. Applying the same approach to multiple languages show that our system generalizes to a variety of languages.
