A CCD-based processor that we call the NNC2 is presented. The NNC2 implements a fully connected 192-input, 32-output two-layer network and can be cascaded to form multilayer networks or used in parallel for additional input or output nodes. The device computes 1.92 × 109 connections/ sec when clocked at 10 MHz. Network weights can be specified to six bits of accuracy and are stored on-chip in programmable digital memories. A neural network pattern recognition system using NNC2 and CCD image feature extractor (IFE) devices is described. Additionally, we report a CCD output circuit that exploits inherent nonlinearities in the charge injection process to realize an adjustable-threshold sigmoid in a chip area of 40 × 80 µm2.
