In this paper, the concept of a new 5-axis hybrid machine tool is proposed. The machine is a tool being with both parallel and serial structures, which is based on a novel 2-DOF parallel platform and serial orientations. The machine tool has advantages in terms of high stiffness, high dexterity, high speed, and being capable of long components manufacturing. The kinematics characteristics, such as inverse and forward kinematics, conditioning indices, of the novel 2-DOF parallel platform are studied. The dimensional synthesis based on the workspace and conditioning indices is presented. The results of the paper are very useful for the design of the hybrid machine tool.
