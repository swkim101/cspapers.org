Design and analysis of high-order control systems requires a great deal of laborious calculations. Stability analyses are usually conducted with standard techniques such as root locus or frequency response. The calculations involved in these analyses are generally too complex to do by hand. Graphical techniques and approximations may be used, but often introduce unacceptably large errors.
 The advent of modern digital computers led to the development of a great many programs to perform stability analysis. Generally, these programs were designed to perform one specific analysis using a single technique such as root locus. Such programs seldom shared common input formats, making multiple analyses difficult. Program input was often in the form of polynomial coefficients of the system's transfer function. The determination of these coefficients was difficult, for all but the most simple control systems.
 The MDELTA program was designed to satisfy all of the above requirements. New features are still being included after three years of successful usage in Boeing aerospace projects. The major analytical techniques used within the program are outlined below.
