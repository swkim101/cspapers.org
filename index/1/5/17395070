Internet traffic measurements have shown that the majority of the Internet's flows are short, while a small percentage of the largest flows are responsible for most of the bytes. To exploit this property for performance improvement in routers and Web servers, several studies have proposed size-based schedulings to offer preferential treatment to the shortest flows. In this work, we present analytical and simulation results which confirm that size-based scheduling will ease the task of launching DDOS attacks on the Internet.
