The Interactive Graphics System/370 (IGS/370) is one of a series of highly interactive programs [1][2] used extensively within IBM for the design of multiplanar chips, macros, modules, cards, and boards. The programs were developed for IBM's internal use and are not marketed by IBM. This paper describes the hardware and system software environment and the design functions, capacity and performance of IGS/370. The geometric descriptions and associated attributes defining the LSI devices are entered by a beam-directed refresh cathode ray tube, a digitizer, or a graphics interface language. Many capabilities exist for the creation and modification of all phases of design. Data library items called cells, consisting of rectangles, lines, polygons, circles, alphanumerics, attributes and references to other cells, are created, edited and manipulated into a final design. These final designs, output in the graphics interface language, then become source data for the checking and post-processing programs which result in the manufactured product.
