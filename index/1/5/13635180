A selectable depth water retriever including a weighted container having a threaded neck thereon which mounts a threaded cap. The cap has an opening formed in the top thereof. A perforated disc is positioned on the top of the neck of the container, and positioned between the perforated disc and a closure disc upon the cap opening is a coil spring which normally maintains the closure disc upon the cap opening until pressure at a selected water depth forces the closure disc from the cap opening to allow water to enter the container. The threaded connection of the cap upon the container allows for adjustment of the compression of the spring which in turn determines at what depth the closure disc is removed from the opening in the cap.
