Incorporating users' personality traits has shown to be instrumental in many personalized retrieval and recommender systems. Analysis of users' digital traces has become an important resource for inferring personality traits. To date, the analysis of users' explicit and latent characteristics is typically restricted to a single social networking site (SNS). In this work, we propose a novel method that integrates text, image, and users' meta features from two different SNSs: Twitter and Instagram. Our preliminary results indicate that the joint analysis of users' simultaneous activities in two popular SNSs seems to lead to a consistent decrease of the prediction errors for each personality trait.
