In Experiment 1, we employed linguistic features at the word, syntactic, semantic, and contextual levels in aggregated computational linguistics methods to handle the clustering task. In Experiment 2, we recruited adults and children to perform the clustering task. Experimental results indicate that our computational model achieved a similar level of performance as children.
