This paper reports the development of novel micro-force sensing tools for retinal microsurgery. Retinal microsurgery requires extremely delicate manipulation of retinal tissue, and tool-to-tissue interaction forces are frequently below human perceptual thresholds. Further, the interaction between the tool shaft and sclera makes accurate sensing of forces exerted on the retina very difficult with previously developed force sensing schemes, in which the sensor is located outside the eye. In the work reported here, we incorporate 160 Âµm Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensors into the tool shaft to sense forces distal to the sclera. The sensor is applicable both with robotically manipulated and freehand tools. Preliminary results with a 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) sensor have demonstrated 0.25 mN resolution, and work is underway to develop 2 and 3 DOF tools. The design and analysis of the force sensing tool is presented with preliminary testing data and some initial experiments using the tool with both freehand and robotic manipulation.
