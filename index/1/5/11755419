We describe an experiment in applying text classification algorithms to Dutch texts. Four well-known learning algorithms, Rocchioâ€™s algorithm, the Simple Bayesian Classifier (SBC), the Sleeping Experts (SE) and Winnow were implemented. They were tested on a corpus of articles from the Dutch newspaper NRC, pre-classified into four categories. The algorithms are compared on learning speed and error rate. We also investigated the effect of discarding terms, using either a dynamic stoplist or the Winnow heuristic.
