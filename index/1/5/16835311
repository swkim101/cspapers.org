Using the recent advances in sequencing technology thousands of genomes have been sequenced. This sequence data can be fruitfully employed in diagnosis, drug design, etc. Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) focuses on this important problem of extracting useful information from genomic data. As an example, a comparison of different genomes could throw light on causes for different diseases. Human variabilities happen due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus it might suffice to focus on these SNPs while comparing different genomes. One of the important problems in GWAS is that of identifying the correlation between genotypes (SNPs for example) and phenotypes (i.e., different characteristics such as addiction, the presence of cancer, etc.) Different approaches exist for addressing this problem. One important approach is via modeling this problem as the k-locus problem (k being any integer). The case of k = 1 has been studied widely. Some algorithms also exist for solving the case of k = 2. The real cause for a disease could be more than two SNPs. The case of k > 2 has not been studied in the literature. For the first time, in this paper we present an efficient algorithm for solving the 3-locus problem that is several orders of magnitude faster than the brute force algorithm.
