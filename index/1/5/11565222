In this paper we propose a model for the lateral connectivity of orientation-selective cells in the visual cortex based on information-theoretic considerations. We study the properties of the input signal to the visual cortex and find new statistical structures which have not been processed in the retino-geniculate pathway. Applying the idea that the system optimizes the representation of incoming signals, we derive the lateral connectivity that will achieve this for a set of local orientation-selective patches, as well as the complete spatial structure of a layer of such patches. We compare the results with various physiological measurements.
