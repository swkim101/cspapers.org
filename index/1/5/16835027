To accommodate the growing demand for complexity in the automotive industry, an approach for a cross-process information model is introduced: the infrastructure presented aims at storing and relating key development data from the various software engineering phases. The model can be harmonized with proprietary development methodologies by means of metamodeling and serves as the starting point for the traceability of requirements, global plausibility checks, and (semi-)automatic transformation of model elements. Based on the <i>medini</i> tool chain, the model infrastructure is open with respect to the models and tools used thanks to the consistent deployment of OMG standards and the benefit of metamodeling.
