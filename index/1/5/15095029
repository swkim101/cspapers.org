This paper introduces the overall design of ALEX III, the third generation of Active Leg Exoskeletons developed by our group. ALEX III is the first treadmill-based rehabilitation robot featuring 12 actively controlled degrees of freedom (DOF): 4 at the pelvis and 4 at each leg. As a first application of the device, we present an adaptive controller aimed to improve gait symmetry in hemiparetic subjects. The controller continuously modulates the assistive force applied to the impaired leg, based on the outputs of kernel-based non-linear filters, which learn the movements of the healthy leg. To test the effectiveness of the controller, we induced asymmetry in the gait of three young healthy subjects adding ankle weights (2.3kg). Results on kinematic data showed that gait symmetry was recovered when the controller was active.
