Different from other previous research efforts, we adopt a random surfing model to capture graph structural information directly, instead of using the sampling-based method for generating linear sequences proposed by Perozzi et al. (2014). The advantages of our approach will be illustrated from both theorical and empirical perspectives. We also give a new perspective for the matrix factorization method proposed by Levy and Goldberg (2014), in which the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix is considered as an analytical solution to the objective function of the skip-gram model with negative sampling proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013). Unlike their approach which involves the use of the SVD for finding the low-dimensitonal projections from the PMI matrix, however, the stacked denoising autoencoder is introduced in our model to extract complex features and model non-linearities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on clustering and visualization tasks, employing the learned vertex representations as features. Empirical results on datasets of varying sizes show that our model outperforms other stat-of-the-art models in such tasks.
