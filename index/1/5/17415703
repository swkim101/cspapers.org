Human problems solvers use heuristic knowledge. Heuristics can be justified in a given problem solving context by reasoning about 'deeper' domain theories. A working computer program, an air traffic control expert system, uses a qualitative reasoning approach to justify heuristically generated plans. The justification is based on mathematical knowledge of aircraft performance which is computationally too complex for use in the normal planning process.
