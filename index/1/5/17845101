Research on cognitive science indicates that humans often use different criteria for route selection. An alternative type of spatial proximity search on road networks recently has been proposed to find the easiest-to-reach neighboring object with the smallest navigation complexity. This paper presents an evaluation to compare the effectiveness of easiest-to-reach neighbor query against a classic nearest neighbor query in a real-world setting. Our user study demonstrates usability of the new spatial query type and suggests people may not always care about travel distance most. To provide flexibility to accommodate different requirements, we also show how to achieve tradeoff between navigation complexity and travel distance for advanced navigational assistance.
