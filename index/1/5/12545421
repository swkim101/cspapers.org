To reach President Obama's vision of computer science for all, we will need to prepare many more secondary teachers to teach computer science. In 2015, less than 3,000 schools passed the College Board's audit to offer the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) A course, while close to 12,000 schools passed the audit to offer Calculus AB. The presenters have led teacher professional development workshops for many years and will share their knowledge and materials to help others offer effective teacher professional development. In particular they will cover how to plan a workshop, how to find funding, how to prepare materials for secondary teachers, what materials are available for teacher professional development, how to teach pedagogical content knowledge (how to teach computer science), and how to increase diversity in computer science classrooms. The presenters have free materials for the new Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (CSP) course as well as the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course. These materials include free interactive ebooks for both CSP teachers and students to help them learn programming and a free interactive ebook for the AP CS A course. Participants will be encouraged to share their materials and strategies as well. Laptop Required.
