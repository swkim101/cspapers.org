In spite of the importance of well-understood semantics for knowledge representation systems, proponents of default logic have tended to ignore the lack of a general model-theoretic semantics for the formalism. This shortcoming is addressed by the presentation of such a model-theory. This characterization differs in some ways from traditional semantics. These differences are explained and motivated, and some applications of the semantics are discussed.
