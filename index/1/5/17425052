The human visual system observes and understands a scene/image by making a series of fixations. Every “fixation point” lies inside a particular region of arbitrary shape and size in the scene which can either be an object or just a part of it. We define as a basic segmentation problem the task of segmenting that region containing the “fixation point”. Segmenting this region is equivalent to finding the enclosing contour - a connected set of boundary edge fragments in the edge map of the scene - around the fixation. We present here a novel algorithm that finds this bounding contour and achieves the segmentation of one object, given the fixation. The proposed segmentation framework combines monocular cues (color/intensity/texture) with stereo and/or motion, in a cue independent manner. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on challenging videos and stereo pairs. Although the proposed algorithm is more suitable for an active observer capable of fixating at different locations in the scene, it applies to a single image as well. In fact, we show that even with monocular cues alone, the introduced algorithm performs as well or better than a number of image segmentation algorithms, when applied to challenging inputs.
