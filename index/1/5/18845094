This paper introduces GNARL, an evolutionary program which induces recurrent neural networks that are structurally unconstrained. In contrast to constructive and destructive algorithms, GNARL employs a population of networks and uses a fitness function's unsupervised feedback to guide search through network space. Annealing is used in generating both gaussian weight changes and structural modifications. Applying GNARL to a complex search and collection task demonstrates that the system is capable of inducing networks with complex internal dynamics.
