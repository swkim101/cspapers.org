An early undergraduate research program for rising sophomores and juniors at risk of leaving STEM degree programs is described. Students are paid a stipend to work part-time, at a maximum of twenty hours per week, as part of a research team. Faculty researchers are not financially compensated for working with students. The program successfully brings together STEM departments to target students who are at risk of leaving their major. Initial results demonstrate a positive influence of undergraduate research in retaining STEM majors and improvements in Student Assessment of Learning Gains. Future work, including institutionalization of the project, is discussed.
