The Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem has attracted much attention from the research community, mainly due to its efficiency in encryption/decryption, as well as the provable reductions of security against adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks in the standard model. At TCC 2005, Vasco et al. proposed a method for building Cramer-Shoup like cryptosystem over non-abelian groups and raised an open problem for finding a secure instantiation. Based on this work, we present another general framework for constructing Cramer-Shoup like cryptosystems. We firstly propose the concept of index exchangeable family (IEF) and an abstract construction of Cramer-Shoup like encryption scheme over IEF. The concrete instantiations of IEF are then derived from some reasonable hardness assumptions over abelian groups as well as non-abelian groups, respectively. These instantiations ultimately lead to simple yet efficient constructions of Cramer-Shoup like cryptosystems, including new non-abelian analogies that can be potential solutions to Vasco et al.'s open problem. Moreover, we propose a secure outsourcing method for the encryption of the non-abelian analog based on the factorization problem over non-commutative groups. The experiments clearly indicate that the computational cost of our outsourcing scheme can be significantly reduced thanks to the load sharing with cloud datacenter servers.
