The phenominal demand for computer education has placed heavy burdens on most educational institutions. University computer science departments all over the country are hard pressed to supply faculty and facilities for the “masses” of students desiring an education in computer science. Secondary schools have experienced this same demand on the part of the students. Even though the problems that these demands cause are equivalent in many respects to those in universities, solutions at the secondary level are not as easy or as speedy.
