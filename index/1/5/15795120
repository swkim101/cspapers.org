Eflcient support for retrieval and update of complex objects is a unifying requirement of many areas of computing such as business, artificial intelligence, ofice automation, and computer aided design. In this paper, we investigate and analyze a range of alternative techniques for the storage of complex objects. These alternatives vary between the direct storage representation of complex objects and the fully decomposed storage representation of complex objects. Qualitative arguments for each of the strategies are discussed. Analytical results and initial implementation results based on fully decomposed schemes are presented.
