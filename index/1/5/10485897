Targeted drug delivery by using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is an efficient technique to deliver drug molecules towards specific tissues in a human body. The MNPs' 1D guidance system is a combined electromagnetic actuation (EMA) and monitoring system, which can provide an accurate control scheme with nanoparticle's localization for more precise targeting of the drug delivery. The localization of the MNPs is done by magnetic particle imaging (MPI) with low amplitude excitation field. In this paper, we have developed a novel coil topology for 1D MNPs feedback control, by alternate supply of different currents to coils set in time sequence, the coil set alternates functions between MPI and EMA. Motion of MNPs is controlled by a gradient of the magnetic field in EMA period, the distribution of MNPs is reconstructed in MPI period and provides feedback to the EMA. The guidance system will provide navigation and tracking interleaved for targeted drug delivery of MNPs in compact and efficient ways. The 1D MNPs guidance system has 2Hz of EMA and MPI hybrid frequency, allowing a position control of MNPs with 90nm diameter.
