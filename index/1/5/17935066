It is of great interest to news providers such as Yahoo! News to attain higher visitor rates by promoting greater engagement with their content. One aspect of engagement deals with keeping users on the site longer by allowing them to navigate through content with enhanced, click-through experiences. News portals have invested in ways to provide embedded links within news stories. So far these links have been manually curated by professional editors, and due to the manual effort involved, the use of such links has been limited. In this paper we propose an automated approach to detecting and linking newsworthy events to associated articles. Our analysis, conducted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, reveals that our system's performance is comparable to that of professional editors, and that users find the automatically generated highlights interesting and the associated articles worthy of reading.
