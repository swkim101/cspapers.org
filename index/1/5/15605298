This paper studies the problems of dedicating routes and scheduling transmissions in optical networks. In optical networks, the vast bandwidth available in an optical fiber is utilized by partitioning it into several channels, each at a different optical wavelength. A connection between two nodes is assigned a specific wavelength, with the constraint that no two connections sharing a link in the network can be assigned the same wavelength. This paper classifies several models related to optical networks and presents optimal or near-optimal algorithms for permutation routing and/or scheduling problems in many of these models. tally important because the entire network can be constructed out of passive (unpowered) optical components and hence made reliable as well as easy to operate, with all the control being done outside the network.
