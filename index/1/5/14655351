A constructive induction model using ge-netic programming is presented. The model evolves new attributes starting from a random population of possible attributes constructed as functions of the original attributes. The model is tested on hard supervised learning problems and its performance is compared with backpropagation and C4.5. The performance of the system on learning incomplete 4-bit parity is reported to be better.
