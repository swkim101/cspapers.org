As news stories continue to demonstrate, ensuring adequate security and privacy in a networked "always on" world is a challenge; and while open source software can mitigate problems, it is not a panacea. This panel will bring together experts from industry and academia to debate, discuss, and offer opinions -- questions might include: 
 What are the "costs" of "good enough" security and privacy on developers and customers? 
 What is the appropriate trade-off between the price provide security and cost of poor security?
 How can the consequences of poor design and implementation be managed?
 Can systems be enabled to fail "security-safe"? 
 What are the trade-offs for increased adoption of privacy and security best practices?
 How can the "costs" of privacy and security -- both tangible and intangible -- be reduced?
