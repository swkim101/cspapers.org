In this paper, a novel four-step acceleration profile is proposed for the inner mass (moving part) of a capsubot (capsule robot) system that works on the principle of the internal force-static friction. By using the acceleration profile of the inner mass the capsubot system can move in a given desired direction. Optimum selection of the different parameters of the acceleration profile is investigated considering the design constraints. Comparison of the simulation results with previous proposed profiles demonstrates its superiority. A novel encapsulated capsubot has been developed utilizing the acceleration profile in a self-contained format.
