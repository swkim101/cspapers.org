As the complexities of automotive systems increase, designing a system is a difficult task that cannot be done manually. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for weight minimization of wires used for connecting electronic devices in a system. The wire routing problem is formulated as a Steiner tree problem with capacity constraints, and the location of a Steiner vertex is selected for adding a splice connecting more than two wires. Besides wire routing, wire sizing is also done to satisfy resistance constraints and minimize the total wiring weight. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
