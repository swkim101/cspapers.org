The human mind is capable of absorbing and processing large volumes of information. Most of this processing, however, occurs at a precognitive level, the results of which serve to alert the cognitive mind to areas of potential interest. The Multidimensional User-oriented Synthetic Environment, fluSE is an open-ended software shell that provides a new approach to interacting with computer-based information. By using a real-time, device-independent software design and incorporating both cognitive and experiential models of human perception, fluSE greatly enhances a person's ability to examine, interact with, and understand relationships in complex information space. A jluSE shell may be wrapped around data, models, simulations or even complete programs. Using a design, based on human functionality, it provides tools for the presentation, exploration, navigation, manipulation, and examination of information. Users experience a highly interactive environment, capable of dynamically mapping information into visual, auditory or kinesthetic representations.
