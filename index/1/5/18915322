This paper presents an innovative computer literacy course that focuses solely on developing skills needed for life in a networked world in which one must protect oneself from identity theft, be careful posting on social networks, and use credit and debit cards wisely. The course emphasizes ethical responsibility and information literacy. Its target audience, first-year, non-computer science majors, learn what they need to know to use technology safely, effectively, efficiently, and ethically. The course is grounded in active learning, such as posting in a class wiki, and critical thinking. It is a radical alternative to a traditional software packages approach.
