In this paper we review the design of a sequential object oriented linear algebra library, O<sc>O</sc>L<sc>A</sc>L<sc>A</sc>. Several designs are proposed and used to classify existing sequential object oriented libraries. The classification is based on the way that matrices and matrix operations are represented. O<sc>O</sc>L<sc>A</sc>L<sc>A</sc>'s representation of matrices is capable of dealing with certain matrix operations that, although mathematically valid, are not handled correctly by existing libraries. O<sc>O</sc>L<sc>A</sc>L<sc>A</sc> also enables implementations of matrix calculations at various abstraction levels ranging from the relatively low-level abstraction of a Fortran BLAS-like implementation to higher-level abstractions that hide many implementation details. O<sc>O</sc>L<sc>A</sc>L<sc>A</sc> addresses a wide range of numerical linear algebra functionality while the reviewed object oriented libraries concen trate on parts of such functionality. We include some preliminary performance results for a Java implementation of O<sc>O</sc>L<sc>A</sc>L<sc>A</sc>.
