Localization information is important in underwater wireless sensor network applications. This paper improves the DV-Hop and presents a Distributed Active Multihop Localization Algorithm. It extends fake anchors to help localization and collects the average multihop distance in the whole network, which is used as the estimated distance between unknown nodes and anchor nodes to improve localization accuracy. Finally, the algorithm calculates unknown node's location coordinates with maximum likelihood estimation. In the improved algorithm, it develops flooding and presents a distributed pruning broadcast algorithm. It prunes the previous node's neighbors recursively in the next hop set to decrease the meaningless message forwarding counts. Simulation confirms its average localization error reduces from 80 to 20 meters approximately. The influence of anchor proportion on improved algorithm's localization accuracy is less than the original one's. The algorithm's convergence time drops from exponential to linear.
