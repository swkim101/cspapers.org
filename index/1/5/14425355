The middleware for a cyber-physical system is crucial as it tightly integrates computation with physical processes to achieve better reliability, distributed coordination, higher precision and efficiency, and better autonomous control. In this work, we design and develop the cyber-physical middleware framework for a large-scale water distribution system monitoring effort.
