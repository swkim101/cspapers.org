This paper describes the Process Design Methodology, a disciplined engineering approach to development of a Real-Time Software Process. The approach described is part of an overall software research thrust, sponsored by the BMD Advanced Technology Center, which is directed at resolving fundamental problems of excessive cost, failure to meet schedules, and inadequate performance associated with the specification, design, implementation, and testing of BMD software processes.
