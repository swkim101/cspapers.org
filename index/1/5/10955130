We show that a DNF formula that has a CNF representationthat contains at least one “1/poly-heavy” clause with respect to a distribution D is weakly learnable under this distribution. So DNF that are not weakly learnable under the distribution D do not have any “1/poly-heavy” clauses in any of their CNF representations. We then show that ~-CDNF, a DNF j that has aCNF representation that contains poly(n) clauses that -r-approximates ~ according to a distribution D, is weakly ~+c-PAC-learnable with membership queries under the distribution D. Wealso show how tochange ouralgorithm to a parallel algorithm that runs in polylogarithmic time with a polynomial number of processors, In particular, decision trees are (strongly) PAC-learnable with membership queries under any distribution in parallel in polylogarithmic time with a polynomial number of processors. Finally we show that no efficient parallel exact learning algorithm exists for decision trees. We then present a 26f@ time exact learning algorithm for polynomial size DNF using equivalence queries only. In particular, DNF is PAC-learnable in subexponential time under any distribution.
