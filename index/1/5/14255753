This paper proposes a framework in which end-users can instantaneously modify existing Web applications by introducing multimodal user-interface. The authors use the IntelligentPad architecture and MPML as the basis of the framework. Example applications include character agents that read the latest news on a news Web site. The framework does not require users to write any program codes or scripts to introduce multimodal user-interface to existing Web applications.
