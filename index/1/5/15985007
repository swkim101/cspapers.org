This article is concerned with the design and implementation of Information Retrieval Systems (IRS). We show how theories and models from the domain of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) can be applied to the design of IRS. We first study the userâ€™s tasks by modelling the mental activities of the user while accomplishing a task. Adopting a system perspective, we consider the processing tasks of an IRS and organize them in a design space. We then build upon the design space to consider the implications of such data processing and levels of abstraction on software design. Finally we present PAC-Amodeus, a software architecture model and illustrate the applicability of the approach with the implementation of an IRS: the TIAPRI system.
