Optical Disk Systems have significant advantages over conventional magnetic mass storage media for very large database applications. Among other features, optical disk systems offer large capacity and high transfer rate. A critical problem is how to integrate the optical disk system into a total application system environment while maintaining the high performance capabilities of the optical disk. In this paper the performance of optical disk system configurations under realistic application environments is analyzed via queueing models. The results provide several important guidelines for the use of optical disk systems on large applications.
