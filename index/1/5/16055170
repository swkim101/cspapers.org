This paper describes BRUIN, a unified A system that can perform both problem-solving and language comprehension tasks. Included in the system is a frame-based knowledge-representation language called FRAIL, a problem solving component called NASL (which is based on McDermott's problem-solving language of the same name), and a context-recognition component currently known as PRAGMATICS. 
 
The intent of this paper is to give a flavor of how the context recognizer PRAGMATICS works and what it can do. Examples are drawn from the inventory-control, restaurant and blocks-world domains.
