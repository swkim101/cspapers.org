Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of detecting human respiration rate non-intrusively leveraging commodity WiFi devices. However, is it always possible to sense human respiration no matter where the subject stays and faces? What affects human respiration sensing and what's the theory behind? In this paper, we first introduce the Fresnel model in free space, then verify the Fresnel model for WiFi radio propagation in indoor environment. Leveraging the Fresnel model and WiFi radio propagation properties derived, we investigate the impact of human respiration on the receiving RF signals and develop the theory to relate one's breathing depth, location and orientation to the detectability of respiration. With the developed theory, not only when and why human respiration is detectable using WiFi devices become clear, it also sheds lights on understanding the physical limit and foundation of WiFi-based sensing systems. Intensive evaluations validate the developed theory and case studies demonstrate how to apply the theory to the respiration monitoring system design.
