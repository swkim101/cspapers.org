Providing authentication mechanisms for IP-Multicast streams is paramount for the development of large scale commercial multicast content delivery applications. This need is particularly strong for the delivery of real time content, such as live video/audio news events or financial stock quote distribution. However, this turns out to be a quite challenging problem for many reasons. First, the authentication of the multicast data must be verifiable by a potentially very large number of untrusted recipients. Second, since multicast communication protocols are almost always best effort, the authentication mechanisms needs to authenticate received content despite the potential loss of some packets. Finally, the authentication mechanism needs to be efficient enough to cope with real time data and should have a small communication overhead. We propose a new multicast authentication scheme designed to authenticate real time multicast packet streams with a potentially unlimited number of recipients. This scheme provides both integrity and nonrepudiation of origin, and in a majority of situations, it performs with less overhead in bytes per packet than previously proposed practical real time stream authentication schemes.
