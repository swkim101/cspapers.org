Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) becomes a mainstream storage device in embedded systems due to its favorable features, such as small size, low power consumption, and short read/write latency. On NVRAM, a write operation consumes more energy and time than a read operation. However, current mobile/embedded file systems (e.g., EXT2/3 and EXT4) are very unfriendly for NVRAM devices. The reason is that a journaling mechanism writes the same data twice during data commitment and checkpoint. Such observations motivate this paper to design a two-phase write reduction journaling file system called wrJFS. In the first phase, wrJFS classified data into two categories: Metadata and user data. Metadata will be handled by partial byte-enabled journaling strategy, and user data will be processed in the second phase. In the second phase, user data will be compressed by hardware encoder so as to reduce the write size, and managed compressed-enabled journaling strategy to avoid the write amplification. The experimental results show that the proposed wrJFS can reduce the size of the write request by 89.7% on average, compared with the original EXT3.
