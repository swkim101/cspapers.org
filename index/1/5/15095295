This paper investigates application of machine learning to the problem of contact perception between a robot's gripper and an object. The input data comprises a multidimensional time-series produced by a force/torque sensor at the robot's wrist, the robot's proprioceptive information, namely, the position of the end-effector, as well as the robot's control command. These data are used to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) classifier. The output of the classifier is a prediction of the contact state, which includes no contact, a contact aligned with the central axis of the valve, and an edge contact. To distinguish between contact states, the robot performs exploratory behaviors that produce distinct patterns in the time-series data. The patterns are discovered by first analyzing the data using a probabilistic clustering algorithm that transforms the multidimensional data into a one-dimensional sequence of symbols. The symbols produced by the clustering algorithm are used to train the HMM classifier. We examined two exploratory behaviors: a rotation around the x-axis, and a rotation around the y-axis of the gripper. We show that using these two exploratory behaviors we can successfully predict a contact state with an accuracy of 88 ± 5 % and 81 ± 10 %, respectively.
