This paper presents a fault tolerant control strategy based on an offline control mixing for an octorotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) regarding several rotor failures. This strategy consists of a set of explicit laws, computed offline, each one dedicated to a fault situation. The corresponding law is selected according to the output of a fault detection and isolation (FDI) module. This module is designed with a non-linear sliding mode observer. The main advantage of this architecture is the deterministic character of the solution, its fast operation and the low computational load. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through real experimental application to a coaxial octorotor, where up to four motor failures are considered.
