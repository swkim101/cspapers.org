In order to facilitate problem-based learning in our Programming Languages course, we developed a tutor on static and dynamic scope. Static scope includes the scope of variables, the referencing environment of procedures and the scope of procedure names in a language that permits nesting of procedure definitions (e.g., Pascal, Ada). Dynamic scope includes the scope of variables, and the referencing environment of procedures. In this paper, we will describe the design of our tutor, and present the results of evaluating it for two semesters in our Programming Languages course.
