This paper presents a discussion of means of describing the discourse and its components which makes speech act interpretation and anaphora disambiguation possible with minimal search of the knowledge in the database. A portion of this paper will consider how a frames representation of sentences and common sense knowledge provides a mechanism for representing the postulated discourse components. Finally some discussion of the use of the discourse model and of frames in a discourse understanding program for a personal assistant will be presented.
