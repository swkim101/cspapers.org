Experienced analysts are remarkable at visually recognizing unusual patterns, however, current tools have not efficiently catered to these abilities. Progress in information visualization algorithms, display techniques, and user controls has made a new generation of software tools possible. This paper will present a new hybrid data mining tool, Origamim, designed and developed by Mr. Thomas Kraay. OrigamiTM can be used to identify complex, latent relationships present in large quantities of data. These relationships can be used to interactively explore useful and strategic information that would otherwise be intractable.
