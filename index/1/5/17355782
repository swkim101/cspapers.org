We define the notion of independent views to indicate whether the range values of the two views may be achieved independently The concept of complementary views indicates when the domain element can be uniquely determined by the range values of the two complementary views We consider the relationship between independent and complementary views In unrestricted domains, a view (but not the identity or empty view) can have more than one complementary, independent view Databases, however, are more restricted domains They are finite power sets A view is monotonic if it preserves inclusion However, in finite power sets when all views are monotonic, if a given view has another view which is independent and complementary, then this view is unique.
