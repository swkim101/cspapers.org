Recommender systems try to predict which items a user will prefer. Traditional models for recommendation only take into account the user-item interaction, usually expressed by explicit ratings. However, in these days, web services continuously generate auxiliary data from users and items that can be incorporated into the recommendation model to improve recommendations. In this work, we propose an incremental Matrix Co-factorization model with implicit user feedback, considering a real-world data-stream scenario. This model can be seen as an extension of the conventional Matrix Factorization that includes additional dimensions to be decomposed in the common latent factor space. We test our proposal against a baseline algorithm that relies exclusively on interaction data, using prequential evaluation. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, after incorporating an additional dimension in three music domain datasets.
