We study the complexity of model checking in proposit ional nonmonotonic logics. Specifically, we first define the problem of model checking in such formalisms, based on the fact that several nonmonotonic logics make use of interpretation structures (i.e. default extensions, stable expansions, universal Kripke models) which are more complex than standard interpretations of propositional logic. Then, we analyze the complexity of checking whether a given interpretation structure satisfies a nonmonotonic theory. In particular, we characterize the complexity of model checking for Reiter's default logie and its restrictions, Moore's autoepistemie logic, and several nonmonotonic modal logics. The results obtained show that, in all such formalisms, model checking is computationally easier than logical inference.
