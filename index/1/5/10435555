This study evaluates the performance of the multilayer-perceptron and the frequency-sensitive competitive learning network in identifying five commercial aircraft from radar backscatter measurements. The performance of the neural network classifiers is compared with that of the nearest-neighbor and maximum-likelihood classifiers. Our results indicate that for this problem, the neural network classifiers are relatively insensitive to changes in the network topology, and to the noise level in the training data. While, for this problem, the traditional algorithms outperform these simple neural classifiers, we feel that neural networks show the potential for improved performance.
