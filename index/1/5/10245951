This paper describes the design and development of a very large Fortran simulation program. This discussion includes; the data structure, drive mechanism, and event scheduling for a time-based digital simulation system that could handle functional level models of logical devices. Five different types of functional modules are likely to be specified: a) combinational, b) ripple-effect arithmetic, c) register, d) memories, and e) basic logical devices. Currently implemented modules include decoders, encoders, universal shift registers, up-down counters, random-access memories, and ripple-carry adders. Additional functional modules could be added and basic gates can be intermixed with the functions.
