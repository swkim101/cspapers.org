In this paper, we present an interactive control method for rigid robotics. The core of the method is a neural network classifier that maps position and torque readings to a force direction in 3D space. We show that running our method online allows a human to move the robot along a desired path by performing intuitive pushes and pulls on the robot's joints. The setup is sensorless: no additional sensors, other than those already integral to the rigid joint itself, are added to the manipulator or used in the process.
