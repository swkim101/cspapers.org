Children younger than 3 years old are very special humans, their psychomotor and social development is very fast and parents and relatives would like to know every new detail (when, who, where, what, how and why) in real time. These news are difficult to remember and some kind of diary is needed. Here we propose a "prosthetic memory" based on Digital Object Memories applied to Web of Things using hidden NFC tags in children's clothes, mobile applications for smartphones and a central server to store the ontologized information.
