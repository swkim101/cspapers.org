In an online banner advertising scenario, an advertiser expects that the banner advertisement should be displayed to certain percentage of web site visitors. In this context, to generate more revenue for a given web site, the publisher has to meet the demands of several advertisers by providing appropriate sets of web pages. To help the publishers and advertisers, in this paper, we propose a model of coverage patterns and a methodology to extract potential coverage patterns by analyzing click stream data. Given web pages of a site, a coverage pattern is a set of web pages visited by a certain percentage of visitors. The proposed approach has the potential to enable the publisher in meeting the demands of several advertisers. The efficiency and advantages of the proposed approach is shown by conducting experiments on real world data sets.
