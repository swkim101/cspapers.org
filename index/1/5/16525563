The paper describes the results of simulation experiments of a tree organized multicomputer now being constructed in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook.
 First the structure of the multicomputer is introduced. This is based on, (i) separate local memories, (ii) a tree organization mirrored on that of social structures, and (iii) a distributed file system.
 The simulation studies were designed to illuminate the performance of the multicomputer when cooperating on the solution of selected single computational tasks. The results showed (i) the potential for an order of magnitude increase in the number of cooperating processors before performance saturation effects make themselves felt, (ii) a high frequency of processor resets relative to the completion time of the composite job, and (iii) a lower utilization of processors near the root of the tree relative to those near the leaves.
 The implications of these results for the design of the hardware and software of this multicomputer are discussed in a conclusion.
