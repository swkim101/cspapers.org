The paper addresses the design of an inclusive haptic display based on a multilevel display concept. The end version prototype will operate with bare hand/finger interaction to serve virtual reality applications, psychological and psychophysics studies on haptic perception, and computer haptics including combined texture/kinesthetic rendering algorithms. The proposed concept is an alternative design that brings together different actuation technologies in order to replicate, with high-fidelity, haptic sensation. Other potentials, such as the possibility to blend the haptic and the visualization spaces, are also demonstrated by this concept.
