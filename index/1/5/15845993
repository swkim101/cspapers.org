While provenance has been extensively studied in the literature, the efficient evaluation of provenance queries remains an open problem. Traditional query optimization techniques, like the use of general-purpose indexes, or the materialization of provenance data, fail on different fronts to address the problem. Therefore, the need to develop provenance-aware access methods becomes apparent. This paper starts by identifying some key requirements that are to a large extent specific to provenance queries and are necessary for their efficient evaluation. The first such property, called duality, requires that a single access method is used to evaluate both backward provenance queries (which input items of some analysis generate an output item) and forward provenance queries (which outputs of some analysis does an input item generate). The second property, called locality, guarantees that provenance query evaluation times should depend mainly on the size of the provenance query results and should be largely independent of the total size of provenance data. Motivated by the above, we identify proper data structures with the aforementioned properties, we implement them, and through a detailed set of experiments, we illustrate their effectiveness on the evaluation of provenance queries.
