In this paper we describe an automated method of classifying research project descriptions: a human expert classifies a sample set of projects into a set of disjoint and pre-defined classes, and then the computer learns from this sample how to classify new projects into these classes. Both textual and non-textual information associated with the projects are used in the learning and classification phases. Textual information is processed by two methods of analysis: a natural language analysis followed by a statistical analysis. Non-textual information is processed by a symbolic learning technique. We present the results of some experiments done on real data: two different classifications of our research projects.
