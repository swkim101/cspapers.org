In this paper, we focus on how to boost the multi-view clustering by exploring the complementary information among multi-view features. A multi-view clustering framework, called Diversity-induced Multi-view Subspace Clustering (DiMSC), is proposed for this task. In our method, we extend the existing subspace clustering into the multi-view domain, and utilize the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a diversity term to explore the complementarity of multi-view representations, which could be solved efficiently by using the alternating minimizing optimization. Compared to other multi-view clustering methods, the enhanced complementarity reduces the redundancy between the multi-view representations, and improves the accuracy of the clustering results. Experiments on both image and video face clustering well demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
