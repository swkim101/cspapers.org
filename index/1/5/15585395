In previous work, we have shown that using terms from around citations in citing papers to index the cited paper, in addition to the cited paper's own terms, can improve retrieval effectiveness. Now, we investigate how to select text from around the citations in order to extract good index terms. We compare the retrieval effectiveness that results from a range of contexts around the citations, including no context, the entire citing paper, some fixed windows and several variations with linguistic motivations. We conclude with an analysis of the benefits of more complex, linguistically motivated methods for extracting citation index terms, over using a fixed window of terms. We speculate that there might be some advantage to using computational linguistic techniques for this task.
