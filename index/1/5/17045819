This paper proposes a method called Segmentation-adaptive Pseudospectral collocation to address the problem of safe trajectory generation in missions with cooperating multiple aerial vehicles. Pseudospectral collocation can generate optimized collision-free trajectories, but for multiple aerial vehicles it cannot guarantee that the safety separation distance is maintained in the whole trajectories, since the constraints are only enforced in discrete points in the trajectory (collocation points). Hp-adaptive pseudospectral collocation increases iteratively the number of collocation points and the degree of the approximating polynomial, but this may lead to an exponential increase of the computational load. The proposed method solves the problem by selectively adding new collocation points where they are needed, only in the segments with conflicts in each iteration, thus effectively reducing the number of collocation points and the computation time with respect to other pseudospectral collocation formulations. The proposed method allows both changes of speed and changes of heading for each aerial vehicle to guarantee the safety distance between them. Its computational load and scalability are studied in randomly generated scenarios. Moreover, a comparison with other method is presented. Several experiments to test the validity of the approach have been also carried out in the multivehicle aerial testbed of the Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies.
