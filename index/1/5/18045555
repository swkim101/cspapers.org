A new concept of designing multiprocessors, which share not only memory but also specially chosen peripheral processors and VLSI functional units, is introduced in this paper. Queuing analysis is performed on the potential throughput of the Purdue multiprocessor system (PUMPS). Configuration design of the shared resource pool is demonstrated with a special PUMPS design for interactive image processing. The resource optimization techniques being developed can be also applied to configuration design of PUMPS for any other scientific applications.
