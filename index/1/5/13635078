Network representation is the basis of many applications and of extensive interest in various ﬁelds, such as information retrieval, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. Most previous methods for network representation only consider the incomplete aspects of a problem, including link structure, node information, and partial integration. The present study introduces a deep network representation model that seamlessly integrates the text information and structure of a network. The model captures highly non-linear relationships be-tween nodes and complex features of a network by exploiting the variational au-toencoder (VAE), which is a deep unsupervised generation algorithm. The representation learned with a paragraph vector model is merged with that learned with the VAE to obtain the network representation, which preserves both structure and text information. Comprehensive experiments is conducted on benchmark datasets and ﬁnd that the introduced model performs better than state-of-the-art techniques.
