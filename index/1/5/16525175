Autonomous drones system has great potential in robotics research and it is used in industrial applications. One of the popular examples is Amazon Prime Air service which uses drones to delivery customers ordered products. Another example is under indoor environment such as transferring goods and products in warehouse. However, there is a research challenge when implementing - autonomous drones system in indoor environment in which wireless network interference could deteriorate-drones' control performance. The research aims to reduce the wireless network interference in the drones system for achieving a better performance in term of the controllability of drones' position. For instance, the settling time of drone to reach its set point position or speed of recovery back to set point position after a drone is disturbed in its position. The study shows that after changing the Wi-Fi channel of drones to different frequency, the network interference between drones can be reduced, thus the performance of positioning controllability can be improved.
