We present the design and development of novel suction cups inspired by the octopus suckers. Octopuses use suckers for remarkable tasks and they are capable to obtain a good reversible wet adhesion on different substrates. We investigated the suckers morphology that allow octopus to attach them to different wet surfaces to obtain the benchmarks for new suction cups showing similar performances. The investigation was performed by using non-invasive techniques (i.e. ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging). We acquired images of contiguous sections of octopus suckers, which were used to make a 3D reconstruction aimed to obtain a CAD model perfectly equivalent to the octopus sucker in terms of sizes and anatomical proportion. The 3D information was used to develop the first passive prototypes of the artificial suction cups made in silicone. Then, in accordance with Kier and Smith's octopus adhesion model, we put in tension the water volume in the interior chamber of the artificial suction cup to obtain suction. The characterization of the passive sucker was addressed by measuring both the differential pressure between external and internal water volume of suction cup (~ 105) and the pull-off force applied to detach the substrates from the suction cup (~ 8N).
