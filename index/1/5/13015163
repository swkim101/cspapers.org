This paper presents some of the ﬁrst data visualizations and analysis of distributions for a lexicalized statistical parsing model, in order to better understand their nature. In the course of this analysis, we have paid particular attention to parameters that include bilexical dependencies. The prevailing view has been that such statistics are very informative but su (cid:11) er greatly from sparse data problems. By using a parser to constrain-parse its own output, and by hy-pothesizing and testing for distributional similarity with back-o (cid:11) distributions, we have evidence that ﬁnally explains that (a) bilexical statistics are actually getting used quite often but that (b) the distributions are so similar to those that do not include head words as to be nearly indistinguishable inso-far as making parse decisions. Finally, our analysis has provided for the ﬁrst time an e (cid:11) ective way to do parameter selection for a generative lexicalized statistical parsing model.
