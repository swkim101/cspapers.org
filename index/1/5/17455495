Existing retrieval systems rely on a single active query to pull documents from the index. Relevance feedback may be used to iteratively refine the query, but only one query is active at a time. If the user's information need has multiple aspects, the query must represent the union of these aspects. We consider a new paradigm of retrieval where multiple queries are kept ``active'' simultaneously. In the presence of rate limits, the active queries take turns accessing the index to retrieve another ``page'' of results. Turns are assigned by a multi-armed bandit based on user feedback. This allows the system to explore which queries return more relevant results and to exploit the best ones. In empirical tests, query pools outperform solo, combined queries. Significant improvement is observed both when the subtopic queries are known in advance and when the queries are generated in a user-interactive process.
