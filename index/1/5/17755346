Computational Complexity is concerned with how difficult, under some measure of difficulty, it is to evaluate certain functions or classes of functions. Most of the work in this area, however, deals with models of computation quite unlike a stored program computer, and functions very different from those which are actually computed. In this paper we turn our attention to techniques of computing some useful functions on “computer-like” devices in optimal or near optimal ways.
