As the computing ability of high performance computers are improved by increasing the number of computing elements, how to utilize the available computing resources becomes an important issue. Different strategies to solve an problem based on a multi-processing system can bring about distinct performance. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the performance of parallel applications. The method describes the parallel features of the multi-processing systems in a hierarchy way, and evaluates solutions based on the description. In this way, programmers can find the better solution of an application before real programming.
