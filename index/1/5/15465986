A key prerequisite for residential energy conservation is knowing when and where energy is being spent. Unfortunately, the current generation of energy reporting devices only provide partial and coarse grained information or require expensive professional installation. This limitation stems from the presumption that calculating per-appliance consumption requires per-appliance current measurements. However, since appliances typically emit measurable signals when they are consuming energy, we can estimate their consumption using indirect sensing. This paper presents ViridiScope, a fine-grained power monitoring system that furnishes users with an economical, self-calibrating tool that provides power consumption of virtually every appliance in the home. ViridiScope uses ambient signals from inexpensive sensors placed near appliances to estimate power consumption, thus no in-line sensor is necessary. We use a model-based machine learning algorithm that automates the sensor calibration process. Through experiments in a real house, we show that ViridiScope can estimate the end-point power consumption within 10% error.
