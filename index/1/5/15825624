Integrating the practical use of a database product into the theoretical curriculum of a database management course is a challenge. The approach described minimizes the amount of class time that is allocated to teaching students the use of a database product, while providing guidance to the students in the use of the tool. Introduction of the database product is accomplished through cooperative learning, where students help each other learn the intricacies of the system. To facilitate this process, the students are provided with a complete database implementation example. Using this example, students gradually advance from a tutorial exercise, to a step-by-step extension of the example, and finally to more difficult extensions. These self-paced assignments provide a solid foundation for the students' knowledge in the implementation of their own cooperative group project.
