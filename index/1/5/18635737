The RRT* algorithm has efficiently extended Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) to endow it with asymptotic optimality. We propose Goal-Rooted Feedback Motion Trees (GR-FMTs) that honor state/input constraints and generate collision-free feedback policies. Given analytic solutions for optimal local steering, GR-FMTs obtain and realize safe, dynamically feasible, and asymptotically optimal trajectories toward goals. Second, for controllable linear systems with linear state/input constraints, we propose a fast method for local steering, based on polynomial basis functions and segmentation. GR-FMTs with the method obtain and realize trajectories that are collision-free, dynamically feasible under constraints, and asymptotically optimal within a set we define. The formulation includes linear or quadratic programming of small sizes, where constraints are identified by root-finding in low or medium order of polynomials and added progressively.
