This paper presents several modifications to the basic rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) search algorithm. The fundamental idea is to utilize a heuristic quality function to guide the search. Results from a relevant simulation experiment illustrate the benefit and drawbacks of the developed algorithms. The paper concludes with several promising directions for future research.
