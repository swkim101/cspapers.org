We present a method for determining logarithms in GF(2<supscrpt>n</supscrpt>). Its asymptotic running time is O( exp (cn<supscrpt>1/3</supscrpt>log<supscrpt>2/3</supscrpt>n)) for a small constant c, while, by comparison, Adleman's scheme runs in time O( exp (c'n<supscrpt>1/2</supscrpt>log<supscrpt>1/2</supscrpt>n)). The ideas give a dramatic improvement even for moderate-sized fields such as GF(2<supscrpt>127</supscrpt>), and make (barely) possible computations in fields of size around 2<supscrpt>400</supscrpt>. The method is not applicable to GF(q) for a large prime q.
