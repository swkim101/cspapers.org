There are many everyday situations in which users need to enter their user identification (user ID), such as logging in to computer systems and entering secure offices. In such situations, contactless passive IC cards are convenient because users can input their user ID simply by passing the card over a reader. However, these cards cannot be used for successive interactions. To address this issue, we propose AccelTag, a contactless IC card equipped with an acceleration sensor and a liquid crystal display (LCD). AccelTag utilizes high-function RFID technology so that the acceleration sensor and the LCD can also be driven by a wireless power supply. With its built-in acceleration sensor, AccelTag can acquire its direction and movement when it is waved over the reader. We demonstrate several applications using AccelTag, such as displaying several types of information in the card depending on the user's requirements.
