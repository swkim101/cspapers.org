A systematic framework for discussion of automation of the solution of architectural problems is established, based on an examination of the concepts of solution representation, generation, and testing. Some of the more important implications of various different techniques and principles of representation, generation, and testing are then illustrated by a discussion of procedures for solution of some simple spatial arrangement games and puzzles. It is shown that when we attempt to write procedures for solution of the rather larger and more complex problems encountered in practical architectural design, we discover some quite severe limitations on our current ideas about architectural design automation. The major limitations are outlined, and progress made towards overcoming them recounted.
