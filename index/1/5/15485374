ABSTRACT If judiciously applied, the techniques of cartoon anima-tion can enhance the illusion of direct manipulation thatmany human computer interfaces strive to present. Inparticular, animation can convey a feeling of substancein the objects that a user manipulates, strengtheningthe sense that real work is being done. This paper sug-gests some techniques that application programmers canuse to animate direct manipulation interfaces, and it de-scribes tools that programmers can use to easily incor-porate the effects into their code.Our approach is based on suggesting a range of ani-mation effects by distorting the view of the manipu-lated object. To explore the idea, we added a warpingtransformation capability to the Interviews user inter-face toolkit and used the new transformation to build asimple drawing editor that uses animated feedback. Theeditor demonstrates the effectiveness of the animationfor simple operations, and it shows that the techniqueis practical even on standard workstation hardware.
