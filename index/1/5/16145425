A distance preserver of $p$ node pairs in an $n$-node graph $G$ is a subgraph that agrees with $G$ on all $p$ of these distances. Trivial lower bounds show that the worst-case size of distance preservers is at least linear in $n$ and $p$; that is, $\Omega(n + p)$ edges are sometimes needed in the subgraph. In this work, we try to categorize in what situations this is tight, i.e. a distance preserver on $O(n+p)$ edges is guaranteed to exist. We give three fairly simple arguments that make new progress on this basic question: 
1. Any $p = O(n^{1/3})$ node pairs have a distance preserver on $O(n)$ edges (even if $G$ is directed and weighted). 
2. Any $p = \Omega\left(\frac{n^2}{rs(n)}\right)$ node pairs have a distance preserver on $O(p)$ edges when $G$ is undirected and unweighted. Here, $rs(n)$ is the Ruzsa-Szemeredi function from combinatorial graph theory. 
3. We sometimes need $\omega(s^2)$ edges to preserve all pairwise distances within a subset of $s = o(n^{2/3})$ nodes, even if $G$ is undirected. If we additionally require that $G$ is unweighted, then the range falls slightly to $s \le n^{2/3 - o(1)}$.
