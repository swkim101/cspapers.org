In this paper, we present a novel method to obtain a set of most appropriate queries for retrieval of relevant information about an entity from the Web. Using the body text of existing articles in a Wikipedia category, we generate a set of queries capable of fetching the most relevant content for any entity belonging to that category. We find the common topics discussed in the articles of a category using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and use them to formulate the queries. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, we reduce the number of queries by removing the less sensible ones and then select the best ones out of them. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines. Existing approaches are performing better in generation of the relevant section title queries by extraction from the headings of the Wikipedia articles as compared to the generation of queries by extraction from the body text of the articles. Whereas, the experimental results show that the proposed approach can perform equally well and even better in extraction of the relevant queries from the body text of the Wikipedia articles.
