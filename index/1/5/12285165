Pairs of subjects with either a competitive or an integrative bargaining orientation completed the Bilateral Monopoly Task in one of four communication media (text- only, text-plus-visual-access, audio-only, and audio-plus-visual-access). As hypothesized, an integrative bargaining orientation and/or an audio mode of communication led to a higher joint outcome. In addition, visual access resulted in higher joint outcomes for subjects with integrative bargaining orientations, but lower joint outcomes for those with competitive orientations. The support for negotiation offered by decision room and computer conferencing technologies is compared based on the efficiency and richness of the communication media available in each.
