The increased complexity of computing systems, combined with the economic necessity of rapid system development, has resulted in the allocation of considerable computerized aids to the development process. Such automated design aids have been used by the major computer manufacturers to facilitate design, documentation, manufacturing, and testing of computer systems. UNIVAC has used computer aided design since 1958 with many processes and aids now essential in development efforts. The evolving Automated Design System is illustrated. This system has the following functional capabilities: logic equation handling, logic simulation, automated logic diagrams, automated board layout and routing, and artwork generation. Section 2 of this paper contains a description of the Automated Board Layout and Routing Subsystem, including a description of the algorithm used for routing. The remaining subsystem is described in the following paragraphs.
