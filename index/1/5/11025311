Given the importance of design automation to the development of complex integrated circuits, university and industrial DA efforts should be complementary and not at cross purposes. Traditionally, universities have been a source of high-risk new ideas, while industry has adapted these innovations to practical applications as well as furthered the evolution of and motivation for these new directions. While universities and industry may form their own alliances directly, government assistance in the form of funding that draws together these two kinds of organizations can be (and is already) a useful means to speed up DA development.
 The government, through its sponsorship role, should certainly develop DA tools and systems. In this way, new developments become public and available to a wide class of users. Many useful programs developed at universities and government-sponsored laboratories have advanced the DA field considerably and have been readily adopted by industry.
