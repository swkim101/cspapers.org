Recent studies on extractive text summarization formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem such as a Knapsack Problem, a Maximum Coverage Problem or a Budgeted Median Problem. These methods successfully improved summarization quality, but they did not consider the rhetorical relations between the textual units of a source document. Thus, summaries generated by these methods may lack logical coherence. This paper proposes a single document summarization method based on the trimming of a discourse tree. This is a two-fold process. First, we propose rules for transforming a rhetorical structure theorybased discourse tree into a dependency-based discourse tree, which allows us to take a treetrimming approach to summarization. Second, we formulate the problem of trimming a dependency-based discourse tree as a Tree Knapsack Problem, then solve it with integer linear programming (ILP). Evaluation results showed that our method improved ROUGE scores.
