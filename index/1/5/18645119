This paper describes a new method for incorporating a hierarchical category dimension into an Information Retrieval framework. The approach is to use the synonym sets and the hyponym ("is-a") relations defined within Wordnet in order to derive a conceptual hierarchical category dimension. The hierarchical nature of a category dimension not only provides an overview of a set of documents but also facilitates the effectiveness and the efficiency of searching documents. An evaluation is performed on two different types of models and the multidimensional approach shows a significant reduction in the number of page accesses over a large document collection.
