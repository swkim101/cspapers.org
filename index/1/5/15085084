This paper introduces the planning and control software of a teleoperation system for research in minimally invasive robotic surgery. It addresses the problem of how to organize a complex system with 41 degrees of freedom as a flexible configurable platform. Robot setup planning, force feedback control and nullspace handling with three robotic arms are considered. The planning software is separated into sequentially executed planning and registration procedures. An optimal setup is first planned in virtual reality and then adapted to variations in the operating room. The real time control system is structured in hierarchical layers. Functions are arranged in the layers with respect to their domain and maximum response time. The design is flexible and expandable while performance is maintained. Structure, functionality and implementation of planning and control are described. The prototypic robotic system provides intuitive bimanual bilateral teleoperation within the planned working space.
