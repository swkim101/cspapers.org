Anthropology is the study of civilization, particularly its societies, customs, structure, and evolution. Our premise is that there are cultureal "chasms" to be crossed to ensure the success of the technological beachhead established by innovators and early adopters of the OO paradigm. Our panelists will address the following questions:&bull;What anthropological cultural factors have to be "matured" (and how?) to foster the success of the OO paradigm?&bull;What mechanisms are required to facilitate communications between cultures of differing maturity?&bull;What cultural chasms must be crossed to develop a successful organization/culture within the framework supported by the object-oriented paradigm (or more perrversely, is there anything "special" about the OO paradigm)?This panel will interest pracitioners as a forum to share and debate experiences related to our current-day software culture metamorphosis.
