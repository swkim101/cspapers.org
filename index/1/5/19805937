Concepts of parallel algorithms of sorting and projection are presented in this paper. Implementation of the algorithms in a rectangular cellular array is suggested. The array is a two-dimensional iterative pattern of identical primitive one-character processors (cells). Sorting is basedupon the parallel exchangings of words which arestored along the array rows. Sorting runs in O(n)time. The data arranged according to the Codd'srelational model can be memorized in the array. The projection operator implementation employingsorting and matching is presented.
