The success in real applications of PID regulator has thought us that it is desirable a simple controller with clear and intuitive policy for tuning of feedback gains, as well as minimum or null dependency on the dynamics of the system. In this paper, theoretical and experimental results of PD-like structures for tracking of robots subject to friction and disturbances is presented. The salient feature of our proposal is a neuro-fuzzy schemes used to a single gain that multiplies the regressor-free PID structure. This bounded time-varying gain plays the role of enforcing a dissipative mapping to obtain exponential stability. Stability is obtained in the sense of Lyapunov and experimental study is presented and discussed, which highlights the viability and feasibility for real applications.
