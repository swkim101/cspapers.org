Dynamic Cell Structures (DCS) represent a family of artificial neural architectures suited both for unsupervised and supervised learning. They belong to the recently [Martinetz94] introduced class of Topology Representing Networks (TRN) which build perfectly topology preserving feature maps. DCS employ a modified Kohonen learning rule in conjunction with competitive Hebbian learning. The Kohonen type learning rule serves to adjust the synaptic weight vectors while Hebbian learning establishes a dynamic lateral connection structure between the units reflecting the topology of the feature manifold. In case of supervised learning, i.e. function approximation, each neural unit implements a Radial Basis Function, and an additional layer of linear output units adjusts according to a delta-rule. DCS is the first RBF-based approximation scheme attempting to concurrently learn and utilize a perfectly topology preserving map for improved performance. 
 
Simulations on a selection of CMU-Benchmarks indicate that the DCS idea applied to the Growing Cell Structure algorithm [Fritzke93] leads to an efficient and elegant algorithm that can beat conventional models on similar tasks.
