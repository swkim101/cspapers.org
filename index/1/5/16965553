TS (Typed Smalltalk) is a portable optimizing compiler that produces native machine code for a typed variant of Smalltalk, making Smalltalk programs much faster. This paper describes the structure of TS, the kinds of optimizations that it performs, the constraints that it places upon Smalltalk, the constraints placed upon it by an interactive programming environment, and its performance.
