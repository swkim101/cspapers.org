Collaborative filtering is based on the premise that people looking for information should be able to make use of what others have already found and evaluated. Current collaborative filtering systems provide tools for readers to filter documents based on which ones were read and liked by previous readers. This paper describes a different type of collaborative filtering system in which people who find interesting documents actively send "pointers" to those documents to their colleagues. A "pointer" contains a hypertext link to the source document as well as contextual information intended to help the recipient determine the potential interest and relevance of the document prior to accessing it. A preliminary version of our system has already proven easy t o use, with people using it to "bookmark" documents, send pointers to their colleagues and create "digests" that combine pointers with original text. Based on our experience we discuss the benefits of this form of filtering as well as its limitations.
