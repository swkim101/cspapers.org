We put forward the hypothesis that highaccuracy sentiment analysis is only possible if word senses with different polarity are accurately recognized. We provide evidence for this hypothesis in a case study for the adjective “hard” and propose contextually enhanced sentiment lexicons that contain the information necessary for sentiment-relevant sense disambiguation. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that senses with different polarity can be distinguished well using a combination of standard and novel features.
