Scicos, which can simulate hybrid systems, has been extended to include some types of implicit models. This results in multi-mode DAEs. Switching from one model to another requires robust and efficient reinitialization. This paper discusses some of the special problems faced in the simulation of multi-model DAEs and proposes two solutions for finding consistent initial conditions. These methods are designed to take advantage of the data and algorithms available in Scicos
