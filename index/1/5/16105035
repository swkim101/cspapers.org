This paper presents a study of a distributed system consisting of a number of hosts connected by a local area network. The system model is based on the LOCUS distributed file system. The LOCUS file system allows replicated files, and the synchronization policy is enforced by the use of the Centralized Synchronization Sites (CSS). All requests to open a file for access must be sent to the file's CSS which checks for access conflicts. Our simulation model allows process migration. The focus of this study is on load balancing as applied to optimal process and read site placement. An algorithm is proposed that increases system performance through load balancing. This algorithm uses data collected by the system on which to base its decisions. The characteristics of the algorithm and their effects on system performance are analyzed and discussed.
