We introduce a sensing system which leverages footstep-induced structural vibration for occupant localization. Such localization is important for many smart building applications, such as efficient building management, senior/health care, and security. Compared to other sensing approaches, footstep-induced vibration provides a sensing system which is sparse and non-intrusive. The main challenge of achieving high accuracy using such approach is frequency-dependent wave propagation characteristics, such as dispersion, in floor structure. These characteristics result in distortions in the shape of signal. To overcome such distortions, we decompose the vibration signals into different frequency components using wavelet transform and focus on specific components in all the sensors. In a set of experiments in a real structure, our approach results in average localization errors of 0.41 meters, a 4.4X reduction compared to a baseline approach using raw data.
