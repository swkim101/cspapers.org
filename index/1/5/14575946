The study of text editing is a significant undertaking for at least two reasons.
 Our study sought to examine text editing more extensively in two regards. First, we wanted to discover how the basic task develops into a routine cognitive skill, i.e., how does the novice user differ from the expert and how is that expertise eventually acquired. Second, we wanted to determine possible ways of improving the techniques for training people in the use of text editors, based on knowledge of how text editing skills develop.
