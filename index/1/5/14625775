This paper describes a research project which commenced recently at the NIHE, L. The project investigates the use of micro-computer software to teach aspects of computer science. Spreadsheets are the subject of this report. The potential of spreadsheet systems for teaching assembler programming is considered. We outline a model for enabling students to acquire fundamental computer science concepts using a simplistic “language machine”. The language machine is embedded in a programmable spreadsheet package which acts as the host language. The aim of the project is to explore the possibility of creating interactive, robust and instructional computer models using some of the more powerful spreadsheet packages in an imaginative fashion.
