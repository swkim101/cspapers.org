Design and Access Path Data Models are presented to form an integrated framework for logical and physical database design in a heterogeneous database environment. This paper focuses on the physical design process. First, a physical design is specified in terms of general properties of access paths, independent of implementation details. Then, a design is realized by mapping the specification into the storage structures of a particular database system. Algorithms for assigning the properties to logical access paths and for realizing a CODASYL 78 DBTG schema are given.
