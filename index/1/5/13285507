We use multiple views for cross-domain document classification. The main idea is to strengthen the views' consistency for target data with source training data by identifying the correlations of domain-specific features from different domains. We present an Information-theoretic Multi-view Adaptation Model (IMAM) based on a multi-way clustering scheme, where word and link clusters can draw together seemingly unrelated domain-specific features from both sides and iteratively boost the consistency between document clusterings based on word and link views. Experiments show that IMAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
