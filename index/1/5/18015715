FPGA devices provide a range of security features which can provide powerful security capabilities. This paper describes many security features included in present-day FPGAs including bitstream authenticated encryption, configuration scrubbing, voltage and temperature sensors and JTAG-intercept. The paper explains the role of these features in providing security capabilities such as privacy, anti-tamper and protection of data handled by the FPGA. The paper concludes with an example of a single-chip cryptographic system, a trusted system built with these components.
