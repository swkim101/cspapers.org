The number of artificial space debris around the earth has been increasing, and it is necessary to remove this debris to prevent collision with satellites in operation. One of the most practical methods which remove large debris, such as non-functioning satellite, is attaching a propulsion system for reentry. However, it exists difficulty to attach the system because non-cooperative satellites are expected to have no fixture specialized for grasping purpose. Furthermore, the dynamic parameters of the target need to be determined to realize stabilization when they are unknown. Accordingly, multipoint contact is introduced for stabilization of push-only control and estimate parameters. This paper describes the estimation method of the dynamic parameters using an unscented Kalman filter based on multipoint contact information and attitude stabilization using push-only (without pull operation) control based on feedback linearization and receding horizon with input constraints.
