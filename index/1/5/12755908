Supporting fast access to large RDF stores has been one of key challenges for enabling use of the Semantic Web in real-life applications, more so in sensor-based systems where large amounts of historic data needs to be stored. We propose a semantics-based temporal view mechanism that enables faster access to time-varying data by caching into memory only the required subset of RDF triples. We describe our experience of implementing such a framework in the context of a wide area network monitoring system. Our preliminary results show that our solution significantly improves client access time and scales well for moderate data sets.
