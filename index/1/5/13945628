Several regions of the rat brain contain neurons known as head-direction cells, which encode the animal's directional heading during spatial navigation. This paper presents a biophysical model of head-direction cell activity, which suggests that a thalamocortical circuit might compute the rat's head direction by integrating the angular velocity of the head over time. The model was implemented using the neural simulator NEURON, and makes testable predictions about the structure and function of the rat head-direction circuit.
