Motions of a robot interacting with its environment can be described by a set of constraints. This paper introduces an approach, called motion template, which can quickly program and compose the constraints for the motion planner to generate the trajectory. Two types of motion templates, grasp and turn, are specifically described to explain the details of the technique. The reusability and shareability properties of the motion template are demonstrated using a variety of the motion planning applications across different robot platforms. A motion template framework is used to implement the motion template with the trajectory optimization.
