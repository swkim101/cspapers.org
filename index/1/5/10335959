This paper describes a novel controller that is capable of simultaneously controlling torque and variable stiffness in real-time, for actuators with antagonistically driven pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). To this end, two contributions are presented: i) A stable force feedback controller that can cope with inherent PAM nonlinearities is synthesized using the dissipativity theory, for each PAM unit. ii) On top of this force feedback controller, a mathematical formulation is developed to compute reference force inputs that correspond to desired joint torque and joint stiffness inputs, concerning both agonist and antagonist PAMs. This strategy enables us to introduce real-time sensory feedback; torque and stiffness control is addressed by means of PAM force feedback control with guaranteed stability. To validate the proposed control scheme, a series of experiments were conducted on an experimental setup. As the result, the controller exhibited favorable torque and stiffness tracking in real-time, demonstrating that it could meet the performance criteria to power exoskeleton systems.
