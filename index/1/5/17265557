Objektgraph is an integrated development environment (IDE) for generating applications. Unlike other Unified Modeling Language (UML) based tools, it comprehensively supports implementation. Instantiable object diagrams eliminate the need for start-up code, both for domain model structures and the user interface. Objektgraph enables a complete model-view-controller (MVC) based application with model persistence to be developed entirely with diagrams: no conventional coding is required, although it is supported. The motivation for developing Objektgraph was to support pedagogy, however it is robust and may prove useful in other contexts. Its goal is to simultaneously lower the frustration level and raise the level of abstraction to permit novices to experience what it might be like to have a career in software development.
