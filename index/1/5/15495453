The multi-layered architecture of the DArmStadt Data Base System (DASDBS) for advanced applications is introduced DASDBS is conceived as a family of application-specific database systems on top of a common database kernel system. The main design problem considered here is, What features are common enough to be integrated into the kernel and what features are rather application-specific? Kernel features must be simple enough to be efficiently implemented and to serve a broad class of clients, yet powerful enough to form a convenient basis for application-oriented layers. Our kernel provides mechanisms to efficiently store hierarchically structured complex objects, and offers operations which are set-oriented and can be processed in a single scan through the objects. To achieve high concurrency in a layered system, a multi-level transaction methodology is applied. First experiences with our current implementation and some lessons we have learned from it are reported.
