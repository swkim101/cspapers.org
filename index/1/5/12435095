A controller design to suppress vertical vibration of a position controlled biped walking robot is presented. The system model of structural vibration is estimated from a measurement of frequency response. By using the model, an optimal feedback controller with full state observer is designed. With a consideration of leg support phase, the vibration controller is combined into our walking controller. The effectiveness of our controller is experimentally demonstrated.
