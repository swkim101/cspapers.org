Regression testing is an important part of software development, but it can be very time consuming. Regression test selection (RTS) aims to speed up regression testing by running only impacted testsâ€”the subset of tests that can change behavior due to code changes. We present STARTS, a tool for STAtic Regression Test Selection. Unlike dynamic RTS, STARTS requires no code instrumentation or runtime information to find impacted tests; instead, STARTS uses only compile-time information. Specifically, STARTS builds a dependency graph of program types and finds, as impacted, tests that can reach some changed type in the transitive closure of the dependency graph. STARTS is a Maven plugin that can be easily integrated into any Maven-based Java project. We find that STARTS selects on average 35.2% of tests, leading to an end-to-end runtime that is on average 81.0% of running all the tests.
