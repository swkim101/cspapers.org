PhotoScope visualizes the spatiotemporal coverage of photos in a photo collection. It extends the standard photo browsing paradigm in two main ways: visualizing spatial coverage of photos, and indexing photos by a combination of spatial coverage, time, and content specifications. This approach enables users to browse and search space- and time-indexed photos more effectively. We designed PhotoScope specifically to address challenges in the construction management industry, where large photo collections are amassed to document project progress. These ideas may also apply to any photo collection that is spatially constrained and must be searched using spatial, temporal, and content criteria. We describe the design choices made when developing PhotoScope and the results of user evaluation.
