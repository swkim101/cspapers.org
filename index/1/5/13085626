The goal of a System for Implicit Culture Support (SICS) is to establish an implicit culture phenomenon, namely when the elements of a set behave according to the culture of a generally different group of agents. Earlier work claimed that Implicit Culture support can be seen as a generalization of Collaborative Filtering. In this paper, we recall the concept of Implicit Culture, show how it is useful for automatically exploit tacit knowledge and we present an implementation of a System for Implicit Culture Support.
