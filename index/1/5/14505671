Students performed a variety of tasks using a statistics text presented either in conventional printed form or via the text browser “SuperBook” (Remde, Gomez and Landauer [18]). Students using SuperBook answered more search questions correctly, wrote higher quality “open-book” essays, and recalled certain incidental information better than students using the conventional text. Subjective ratings overwhelmingly favored SuperBook. The advantage of SuperBook appears to be particularly strong for questions that are not anticipated by the author's organization of a text.
