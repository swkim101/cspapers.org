A new technique is introduced, linguistic profiling, in which large numbers of counts of linguistic features are used as a text profile, which can then be compared to average profiles for groups of texts. The technique proves to be quite effective for authorship verification and recognition. The best parameter settings yield a False Accept Rate of 8.1% at a False Reject Rate equal to zero for the verification task on a test corpus of student essays, and a 99.4% 2-way recognition accuracy on the same corpus.
