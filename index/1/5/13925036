In this work a modification of a Cartesian impedance controller is presented. The proposed controller guarantees compliance of the operated manipulator strictly within preselected spatial limits. Specifically, by introducing a nonlinear stiffness term into the control design, the manipulator is prevented from colliding with an explicitly defined hard boundary, like a human being or a fragile object. When operating in spatial regions sufficiently away from the boundary the manipulator behaves as if it were operated via a linear stiffness impedance controller, thus preserving in these regions its compliance and convergence characteristics. A comparative simulation with a linear stiffness impedance controller is performed to verify and clarify the proposed approach.
