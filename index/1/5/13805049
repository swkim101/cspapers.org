Although passwords are by far the most widely-used user authentication mechanism on the web, their security is threatened by password phishing and password database breaches. SafeKeeper is a system for protecting web passwords against very strong adversaries, including sophisticated phishers and compromised servers. Compared to other approaches, one of the key differentiating aspects of SafeKeeper is that it provides web users with verifiable assurance that their passwords are being protected. In this paper, we demonstrate precisely how SafeKeeper can be used to protect web passwords in real-world systems. We first explain two important deployability aspects: i) how SafeKeeper can be integrated into the popular WordPress platform, and ii) how ordinary web users can use Intel SGX remote attestation to verify that SafeKeeper is running on a particular server. We then describe three demonstrations to illustrate the use of SafeKeeper: i) showing the user experience when visiting a legitimate website; ii) showing the encryption of the password in transit via live packet-capture; and iii) showing how SafeKeeper performs in the presence of phishing.
