Incorporation of defaults in grammar formalisms is important for reasons of linguistic adequacy and grammar organization. In this paper we present an algorithm for handling default information in unification grammar. The algorithm specifies a logical operation on feature structures, merging with the non-default structure only those parts of the default feature structure which are not constrained by the non-default structure. We present various linguistic applications of default unification.
