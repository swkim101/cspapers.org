In this paper we describe the hardware design of a novel self-reconfigurable robotic system. We have classified previous studies on self-reconfigurable robotic systems into "lattice type" composed of spatially symmetric modules and "string type" like snake robots. The proposed system has both the advantages of simple operation of self-reconfiguration of the former and motion generation ability of the latter. Its simple structure and reliable operation allows us to construct large 3D self-reconfigurable structure which functions as a robotic system such as a legged walking machine. We have examined its basic mechanical functions and verified its reliable operation of self-reconfiguration.
