SRAM design has been a major challenge for nanoscale manufacturing technology. We propose a new bit cell repair scheme for designing maximum-information memory system (MIMS). Unlike the traditional memory repair that attempts to replace all failed bit cells by redundant columns and/or rows, we propose to repair the important bits (e.g., the most significant bit) only so that the information density (i.e., the number of information bits per unit area) is maximized. Towards this goal, an efficient statistical algorithm is derived to efficiently estimate the information density and then optimize the memory system for maximum-information storage. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a traditional 6-T SRAM cell designed in a commercial 45nm CMOS process, the proposed MIMS design can successfully operate at an extremely low power supply voltage (i.e., 0.6 V) and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 20 dB compared to the traditional SRAM design.
