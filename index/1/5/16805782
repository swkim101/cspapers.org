As increasingly diverse facets of human life - including socializing, exercising, and information-seeking - are mediated by ubiquitous technology, they open the doors for the study of the hitherto under-explored interconnections between them. This work motivates and grounds the use of geo-exploration data to predict the information exploration behavior of users and to support their search. Based on a two-week field study involving 35 participants, we have identified multiple geo-exploration features that have significant associations with a user's information exploration behavior. We also found that the same geo-exploration features could be combined to build predictive models for various facets of an individual's information exploration behavior, and these models performed significantly better than comparable personality-based models.
