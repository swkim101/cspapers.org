Robots need a representation of their environment to reason about and to interact with it. Different 3D perception and modeling approaches exist to create such a representation, but they are not yet easily comparable. This work tries to identify best practice algorithms in the domain of 3D perception and modeling with a focus on environment reconstruction for robotic applications. The goal is to have a collection of refactored algorithms that are easily measurable and comparable. The realization follows a methodology consisting of five steps. After a survey of relevant algorithms and libraries, common representations for the core data-types Cartesian point, Cartesian point cloud and triangle mesh are identified for use in harmonized interfaces. Atomic algorithms are encapsulated into four software components: the Octree component, the Iterative Closest Point component, the k-Nearest Neighbors search component and the Delaunay triangulation component. A sample experiment demonstrates how the component structure can be used to deduce best practice.
