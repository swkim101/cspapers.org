TRACK is a kit to interactively construct environments that trace the execution of methods and the flow of messages between SMALLTALK-80 objects. It enables the user to set up traces by means of direct manipulation. This is done by placing obstacles between icons representing specific classes and instances much in the way a jumping course is set up. TRACK may be used to generate multiple visualizations of programs which may be concurrently run. It is a browsing and debugging tool as well as an algorithm animation tool. TRACK is tightly integrated with the standard tools of the SMALL- TALK-80 programming environment.
