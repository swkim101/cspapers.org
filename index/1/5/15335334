In multi-processor database systems there are processor initialization and inter-communication overheads that diverge real systems from the ideal linear behaviour as the number of processors increases. Main-memory database systems suffer more since the database processing cost is small compared to disk-based database systems and thus comparable to the processor initialization cost. The usual uniform data fragmentation strategy divides a relation into equal data partitions, leading to idleness of single processors after local query execution termination and before global termination. In this paper, we propose a new, non-uniform data fragmentation strategy that results in concurrent termination of query processing among all the processors. The proposed fragmentation strategy is analytically modeled, simulated and compared to the uniform strategy. It is proven that the non-uniform fragmentation strategy offers inherently better performance for a parallel database system than the uniform strategy. Furthermore, the non-uniform strategy scales-up perfectly till an upper limit, after which a system re-configuration is needed.
