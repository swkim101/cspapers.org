We present a dynamic algorithm for MAP calculations. The algorithm is based upon Santos's technique (Santos 1991b) of transforming minimal-cost-proof problems into linear-programming problems. The algorithm is dynamic in the sense that it is able to use the results from an earlier, near by, problem to lessen its search time. Results are presented which clearly suggest that this is a powerful technique for dynamic abduction problems.
