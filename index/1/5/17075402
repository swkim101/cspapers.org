Network computers are becoming a reality in the seventies. While systems such as the ARPA Network, Carnegie Mellon's PLN, the Collins C-System, CDC's Cybernet, and GE's Time Share Net are coming to fruition, even more grandiose systems are being discussed. These networks all offer the designer the potential of combining the advantages of resource sharing, data base sharing, and message switching with those of design automation. In this paper we present a brief description of a network computer currently under development and then propose an interactive design automation system for this geographically distributed network.
 The control mechanism for our design automation system is provided by an operating system, resident in each computer, whose primary function is to segment, disseminate, and regulate the jobs generated by the design automation system. When a job enters the system it may be assigned to anyone of the computers in a center. The job then runs to completion under control of that computer, but the segments that make up the job may be executed in any available computer. Additionally, we may transmit jobs between centers to improve the network response time. Thus we see that by detecting when segments are ready to be executed and by queueing this available work uniformly among all computers in the network, our design automation system will give each designer access to the full parallel processing power of the network.
