Many programs for analyzing electronic circuits including nonlinear elements have been reported. It became difficult to evaluate circuits such as ICs by the breadboard method, because this method is not always suitable for simulation of high speed and high density circuits. Moreover lengthy experiments are involved. In the case of circuits composed of discrete parts, it was considered that many manual experiments could be replaced by computer aided analysis. We developed a general nonlinear network analysis program NONLISA to enable the use of medium scale computer system FACOM 270-30 for scientific and technical applications. This program is aimed mainly at the capability of circuit designers' easy treating and extending system functions without many modifications. Functions of NONLISA are DC analysis, transient analysis, sensitivity analysis, worst case analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation etc. for networks including nonlinear elements.
 This paper deals with the structure and the functions of NONLISA.
