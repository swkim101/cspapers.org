In this study, grasp positions of human hands are measured for planar objects for development of a reasonable grasp criterion for a two-soft-fingered robotic hand. We first propose a grasp criterion that yields the best grasping position for a robot hand with two soft fingers. To examine the properties of this criterion with respect to some weighting coefficients included in the criterion, a grasping experiment is performed by humans for planar objects with various sizes and shapes. Results show that many observed grasping positions used by humans correspond to a set of weighting coefficients that equally weigh all the factors in the criterion. A grasping experiment using a robot has also been conducted using a set of coefficients corresponding to the equal weight; the effectiveness of the criterion was confirmed.
