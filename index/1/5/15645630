Quad tilt rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) solves the problem of underacuated system in general quadrotor UAV. The quad tilt rotor UAV can control position and attitude independently by tilting directions of propellers. However, the flight control system in a wide range of attitudes has not been discussed yet, e.g. a UAV flying and hovering with a 90 [째] pitch angle and can flip over when the range of the tilting motor rotates wide enough. In this paper, we present the attitude transition flight control system for pitch angles ranging 0 [째] to 90 [째] since flight condition with a 90 [째] pitch angle significantly differs from that in a conventional quadrotor UAV flight, and then adequate control system and sufficient experimental validation are necessary for stable flight in a wide range of attitude conditions.
