A fully automatic LSI wire-bonding system utilizing image processing techniques is described. The position recognition system developed is composed of measuring stations, a recognition device, a minicomputer, and cassette tape-recorders. The position of the bonding pad is found, generally in real-time, by the recognition device and computer. The computer calculates positional data of all bonding pads and stores them on a cassette tape for a subsequent wire-bonding process. The position recognition methods discussed are composed of a thresholding algorithm and a position-finding algorithm. These methods are evaluated from the viewpoint of thresholding stability, recognition rate and positional accuracy.
