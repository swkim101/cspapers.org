In this paper algorithms are presented to extract lane markers and their properties from monoscopic camera images. A filter approach that takes into account the visual appearance of the markers is presented. Another contribution constitutes the measurement of physical marker width and length from perspectively distorted images using only the calibrated camera images. Also distances between markers can be estimated. All algorithms are independent from a specific lane model.
