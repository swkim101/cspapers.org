The paper describes a heur is t ic scene descr ip t ion system. This system accepts as input a scene represented as a l ine drawing. Based on a set of known object models, the program attempts to determine the ident i ty and location of each object viewed. The most s igni f icant feature of the system is i t s a b i l i t y to deal with imperfect input data. This a b i l i t y appears essential in l igh t of our current stock of preprocessing techniques and the var iat ion that is possible in real world data.
