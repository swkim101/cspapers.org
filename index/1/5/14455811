A Personal Communication Network (PCN) location tracking scheme called “local anchoring” is introduced which reduces the signaling cost as compared to the location strategy proposed in the IS-41 standard. Local anchoring minimizes the number of location registration messages between the home location register (HLR) and the visitor location registeras (VLRs) in a way that location change is reported to a nearby VLR called the local anchor (LA) instead of to the HLR. This method successfully reduces the cost for location tracking when the call arrival rate is low relative to the mobility rate and the cost for location registration is high. A dynamic local anchoring mechanism is then introduced which dynamically selects the LA such that the expected cost for location registration and call delivery is minilnized. Experimental results demonstrated that the cost of dynamic local anchoring is always lower than OF equal to that of the IS-41 scheme.
