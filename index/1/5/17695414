We report on the model-based approach to dynamic trotting and pronking gait generation for a leg-wheel transformable robot. The rolling spring-loaded inverted pendulum (R-SLIP) model served as the template for robot locomotion by programming the robot's motion according to the stable fixed-point trajectories of the model. Two strategies are developed to match the robot leg motions to the virtual model leg: First, using the two active degrees of freedom on each leg to simulate the passive spring effect of the R-SLIP model leg. Second, installing a torsion spring on the leg-wheel module to render the leg-wheel morphology identical to that of the model leg. This model-based approach to dynamic behavior generation for the robot is experimentally evaluated. The robot can successfully generate an R-SLIP-like stable pronking gait with a flight phase.
