We introduce a novel technique for performing radiometric compensation for a projector-camera system that projects images onto a textured planar surface, which is designed to minimize perceptual artifacts visible to observers according to a model of the human vision system. A projector-camera system has previously been proposed for projecting images onto an arbitrary surface using radiometric compensation, however the dynamic range of a projector is physically limited there are some textures that cannot be compensated correctly. Also, human eyes are sensitive to artifacts introduced in this way. Our technique is designed to provide compensated images with perceptually less noticeable artifacts while preserving enough brightness and contrast in the output. We develop an optimization framework based on a perceptually-based physical error metric to minimize perceptible artifacts in the final compensated images by compressing the contrast of the input images.
