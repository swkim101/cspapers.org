Mining of software repositories has become an active research area. However, most past research considered any change to software as beneficial. This thesis will show how we can benefit from a classification into good and bad changes. The knowledge of bad changes will improve defect prediction and localization. Furthermore, we will describe how to learn project-specific error patterns that will help reducing future errors.
