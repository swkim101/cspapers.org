Incrementally updating dependence information during interactive parallelization is a difficult proposition. We have developed a tool (PAT) that maintains dependence information during incremental transformations to a Fortran program, including loop parallelization, code <italic>replication, alignment</italic> and <italic>shifting</italic>, as well as <italic>insertion</italic> and <italic>deletion</italic> of code including parallel primitives. Our analysis is based on a variation on the standard approach to dependence graph generation, with program wide and local information separated in a <italic>sequential</italic> and a <italic>parallel</italic> dependence graph.
