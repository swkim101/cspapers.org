With the proliferation of social media sites, social streams have proven to contain the most up-to-date information on current events. Therefore, it is crucial to extract events from the social streams such as tweets. However, it is not straightforward to adapt the existing event extraction systems since texts in social media are fragmented and noisy. In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective Bayesian model, called Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract structured representation of events from social media. LEM is fully unsupervised and does not require annotated data for training. We evaluate LEM on a Twitter corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 83% in F-measure, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7%.
