This paper discusses a system for programmatic processing of data processing equipment orders. Major tasks performed include analysis of the marketing order for completeness, determination of the required equipment configuration, and parts selection based upon the determined configuration. The key feature is that a single program is able to handle any data processing order within the Burroughs product line. This program is driven by “rules” disk files which are maintained independently through the use of a high level language.
