This paper proposes an effective algorithm for recognizing objects and accurately estimating their 6DOF pose in scenes acquired by a RGB-D sensor. The proposed method is based on a combination of different recognition pipelines, each exploiting the data in a diverse manner and generating object hypotheses that are ultimately fused together in an Hypothesis Verification stage that globally enforces geometrical consistency between model hypotheses and the scene. Such a scheme boosts the overall recognition performance as it enhances the strength of the different recognition pipelines while diminishing the impact of their specific weaknesses. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmark datasets for object recognition comprising 35 object models and, respectively, 176 and 353 scenes.
