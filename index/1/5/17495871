In a shared server infrastructure, a scheduler controls how quantities of resources are shared over time in a fair manner across multiple, competing consumers. It should support wide (parallel) requests for variable-sized pool of resources, provide assurance of minimum resource allotment on demand, and give predictable assignments. Our approach integrates a fair queuing algorithm with a calendar scheduler. We present WINKS, a proportional share allocation policy that addresses the needs of shared server environments. It extends start-time fair queuing to support wide requests with backfill, advance reservations, dynamic cluster sizing, dynamic request sizing, and intra-flow request prioritization. It also preserves fairness properties across queue transformations and calendar operations needed to implement these extensions.
