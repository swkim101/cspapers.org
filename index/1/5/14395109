A novel method for controlling a robotic mobility platform, the WeeBot, is presented. The WeeBot permits an infant seated on the robot to control its motion by leaning in the direction of desired movement. The WeeBot hardware and software are discussed and the results of a pilot feasibility study are presented. This study shows that after five training sessions typically developing infants ages six to nine months were able to demonstrate directed movement of the WeeBot.
