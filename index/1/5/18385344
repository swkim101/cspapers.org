Code clone detection is an enabling technology for plenty of applications, each having different requirements for a code clone detector. In the tool demonstration we present JCCD, a code clone detection API, which is based on a pipeline model. By combining and parameterizing predefined API components as well as by adding new components, the pipeline model does not only facilitate to build new custom code clone detectors, but also to parallelize the detection process.
