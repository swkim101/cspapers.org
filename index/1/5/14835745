For distributed memory parallel computers, broadcast operations arc widely used in a variety of applications. In this paper, we propose an eflicicnt algorithm for broadcasting on an all-port wormhole-routed 2D torus. The underlying network is assumed to support only the dimensionordered unicast routing. By taking the advantage of the all-port model and the distance insensitivity of the wormhole routing, the proposed algorithm can be proved to be depth contention-free, and needs only n steps for broadcasting on a 2d~2‚Äù torus. Furthermore, the software latency is also reduced by appropriately overlaying the messages sent out by the same node in each step. The timing analysis and the computer simulation conducted in this paper clearly show the performance im provement of the proposed algorithm.
