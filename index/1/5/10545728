We exhibit a novel way of simulating sigmoidal neural nets by networks of noisy spiking neurons in temporal coding. Furthermore it is shown that networks of noisy spiking neurons with temporal coding have a strictly larger computational power than sigmoidal neural nets with the same number of units.
