We introduce an emergent, collaborative filing system. In such a system, an individual is allowed to organize a subset of documents in a repository into a personal hierarchy and share the hierarchy with others. The system generates a "consensus" hierarchy from all users' personal hierarchies, which provides a full, common, and emergent view of all documents. We believe that collaborative filing helps translate personal, tacit knowledge into sharable structures, which help the user as well a community of which he or she is a part. Our filing system is suitable for any documents from text to multimedia files. Initial results on an experimental website show promise. For a knowledge task involving extensive document retrieval, hierarchies are not only used frequently but are also effective in identifying high quality documents. One surprising finding is how often subjects use others' personal hierarchies, and upon close examination, social networks play a key role as well.
