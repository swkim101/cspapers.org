Most of existing MML methods aim to learn a powerful Mahalanobis distance for computing similarity of two objects. More recently, multiple methods use matrix norm regularizers to constrain the learned distance matrixMto improve the performance. However, in real applications, the structure of the distance matrix M is complicated and cannot be characterized well by the simple matrix norm. In this paper, we propose a novel robust metric learning method with learning the structure of the distance matrix in a new and natural way. We partition M into blocks and consider each block as a random matrix variate, which is fitted by matrix variate Gaussian mixture distribution. Different from existing methods, our model has no any assumption on M and automatically learns the structure of M from the real data, where the distance matrix M often is neither sparse nor low-rank. We design an effective algorithm to optimize the proposed model and establish the corresponding theoretical guarantee. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world data. Experimental results show our method consistently outperforms the related state-of-the-art methods.
