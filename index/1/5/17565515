Teamwork is the most important key to success in almost all software projects. What makes a good team (roles, organization, education, communi cation bandwidth, management, process, etc.) remains an open question in many situations. To quote Gerald Weinberg from Understanding the Professional Programmer (Dorset House, 1988): The simple fact is, that we don’t know how to assess the “d@culty” inherent in any meaningful problem. In every useful experiment on programming so far performed, where several program mers or teams worked on the “Same “problem, there have been variations of 10 to I or more in performance. Usually 30 to I or 50 to I is a more typicalfigure. My own conclusion [Weinberg’s] from this is that in many cases the concept of ‘problem difjculty ” makes no sense as a measurement. The dtfftculty seems to be a relationship between the problem and the approach to solving it.
