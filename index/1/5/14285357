The study examined analytic and holistic methods of scoring students's programs. The sample included 30 students in an introductory computer science class. The inter-rater reliabilities for both scoring methods was significant (analytic, r = .66; holistic, r = .73). The correlation between students' holistic and analytic scores on the programs was moderate (r = .66), indicating that the two scoring methods measure different attributes of a student's program.
