This paper presents ReMAP, a reconfigurable architecture geared towards accelerating and parallelizing applications within a heterogeneous CMP. In ReMAP, threads share a common reconfigurable fabric that can be configured for individual thread computation or fine-grained communication with integrated computation. The architecture supports both fine-grained point-to-point communication for pipeline parallelization and fine-grained barrier synchronization. The combination of communication and configurable computation within ReMAP provides the unique ability to perform customized computation while data is transferred between cores, and to execute custom global functions after barrier synchronization. ReMAP demonstrates significantly higher performance and energy efficiency compared to hard-wired communication-only mechanisms, and over what can ideally be achieved by allocating the fabric area to additional or more powerful cores.
