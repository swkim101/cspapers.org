The goal of this research is to develop the human robot interface for a multi-task outdoor robot called WorkPartner (Wopa). Due to the nature of the robot, the interface is designed to support learning and continuous cooperation with the human operator in various outdoors work tasks. The natural human communication methods like speech and gestures are promoted in order to ease the operator's load. The additional interface hardware is also designed to be as natural to the human cognition as possible. All methods and hardware presented have been tested with Wopa.
