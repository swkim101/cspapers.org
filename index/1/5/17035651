In this paper, a framework of end to end (E2E) trusted cloud infrastructure is proposed. On one end of the cloud provider, the trusted chain is extended to VMM and VM by trusted measurement and remote attestation, which can assure the trust of VMM and VM. On another end of the cloud terminal, the trusted mechanism is used to protect the terminal security. For the trust of cloud network, trusted network connect (TNC) is leveraged to protect the security of communication between the loud provider and the cloud terminal. The E2E trusted cloud infrastructure provides an E2E trusted protection for cloud computing. In addition, it can support the Chinese cryptographic algorithm (SMx) based on TPM 2.0.
