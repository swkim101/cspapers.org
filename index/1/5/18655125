Group projects are a valuable part of the computer science curriculum. Group work can be enhanced if formation of groups is not via self-selection by the students themselves. Students who are assigned to groups are more likely to be exposed to other students with different backgrounds and abilities from which they can learn new things. However in a university with students having a wide mix of schedules, a crucial aspect of successful group formation is compatible time-schedules within a group. This paper describes a computer program designed to aid assignment to groups while helping to ensure that groups have suitable outside-of-class meeting times.
