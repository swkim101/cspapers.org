This paper employs Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS), a volunteers-contributed CSK database, to study the first and the third issues. For those stylized CSK, our result shows that over 40% of CSK for four predicate types in OMCS can be found in the web, which contradicts to the assumption that CSK is not communicated in texts. Moreover, we propose a commonsense knowledge classifier trained from OMCS, and achieve high precision in some predicate types, e.g., 82.6% in HasProperty. The promising results suggest new ways of analyzing and utilizing volunteer-contributed knowledge to design systems automatically mining commonsense knowledge from the web.
