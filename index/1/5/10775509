The task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) requires automated systems to identify when two spans of text share a common meaning -for example, that ``Alphaville Inc.'s attempted acquisition of Bauhaus led to a jump in both companies' stock prices'' entails ``Bauahaus' stock rose'', but not ``Alphaville acquired Bauhaus''. This general capability would be a solid proxy for Natural Language Understanding, and has direct relevance to the grand challenges named above. Moreover, it could be used to improve performance in a large range of Natural Language Processing tasks such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Exhaustive Search, Machine Translation and many others. The operational definition of Textual Entailment used by researchers in the field avoids commitment to any specific knowledge representation, inference method, or learning approach, thus encouraging application of a wide range of techniques to the problem.
