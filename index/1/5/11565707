The Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar project (HPSG) is an English language database query system under development at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. Unlike other product-oriented efforts in the natural language understanding field, the HPSG system was designed and implemented by linguists on the basis of recent theoretical developments. But, unlike other implementations of linguistic theories, this system is not a toy, as it deals with a variety of practical problems not covered in the theoretical literature. We believe that this makes the HPSG system unique in its combination of linguistic theory and practical application.The HPSG system differs from its predecessor GPSG, reported on at the 1982 ACL meeting (Gawron et al. ([1982]), in four significant respects: syntax, lexical representation, parsing, and semantics. The paper focuses on parsing issues, but also gives a synopsis of the underlying syntactic formalism.
