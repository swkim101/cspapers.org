The growing dominance of wire delays at future technology points renders a microprocessor communication-bound. Clustered microarchitectures allow most dependence chains to execute without being affected by long on-chip wire latencies. They also allow faster clock speeds and reduce design complexity, thereby emerging as a popular design choice for future microprocessors. However, a centralized data cache threatens to be the primary bottle-neck in highly clustered systems. The paper attempts to identify the most complexity-effective approach to alleviate this bottleneck. While decentralized cache organizations have been proposed, they introduce excessive logic and wiring complexity. The paper evaluates if the performance gains of a decentralized cache are worth the increase in complexity. We also introduce and evaluate the behavior of Cluster Prefetch - the forwarding of data values to a cluster through accurate address prediction. Our results show that the success of this technique depends on accurate speculation across unresolved stores. The technique applies for a wide class of processor models and most importantly, it allows high performance even while employing a simple centralized data cache. We conclude that address prediction holds more promise for future wire-delay-limited processors than decentralized cache organizations.
