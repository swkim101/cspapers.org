Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a serious threat for the Internet. DoS attack can consume memory, CPU, and network resources and damage or shutdown the operation of the resource under attack (victim). A common DoS attack floods a network with bogus traffic so that legitimate users may not be able to communicate. There are several proposals to traceback the network attack path to identify the source that causes the DoS attack. This is an effective solution to trace the attacker but it is not preventive in nature. Ingress filtering and Route-based filtering are two proactive approaches to stop DoS attacks. These solutions check source addresses of incoming packets to ensure they are coming from legitimate sources or traversing through proper routes. We study several existing schemes that deal with DoS attacks. We describe several network monitoring approaches to detect service violations and DoS attacks. In addition, we propose a new distributed scheme to reduce monitoring overhead. Finally, a quantitative comparison among all schemes is conducted, in which, we highlight the merits of each scheme and estimate the overhead (both computation and communication) introduced by it. The comparison provides guidelines for selecting the appropriate scheme, or a combination of schemes, based on the requirements and how much overhead can be tolerated.
