In this paper we characterize all the covers of x in terms of an easily computed normal form for x. The characterization theorem then gives rise to a simple recursive algorithm which computes all the covers of x in time \Theta(n). By avoiding unnecessary checks, this algorithm appears to execute more quickly than that given in [2]. Let x denote a string of length n = jxj 0; in particular, let ffl denote the empty string of zero length. For any nonempty string x, let k 1 be the greatest integer such that (1:1) x = (v...
