The use of parallel robots has been demonstrated to be an interesting alternative when high accuracy and/or high speed is required. However, in order to achieve these goals, model based controllers are required. This work presents a new model based control approach, the stable Extended CTC, that uses extra data from additional sensors introduced in the passive joints of parallel robot in the controller. The proposed controller guarantees asymptotic stability, which is an important contribution over the previously presented approaches. The use of redundant information increases controller robustness and performance, allowing to reduce tracking error with respect to traditional CTC approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is demonstrated by implementing it in a Delta robot which has been modeled in ADAMS multibody software.
