This paper illustrates a method for finding useful visual landmarks for performing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The method is based loosely on biological principles, using layers of filtering and pooling to create learned templates that correspond to different views of the environment. Rather than using a set of landmarks and reporting range and bearing to the landmark, this system maps views to poses. The challenge is to produce a system that produces the same view for small changes in robot pose, but provides different views for larger changes in pose. The method has been developed to interface with the RatSLAM system, a biologically inspired method of SLAM. The paper describes the method of learning and recalling visual landmarks in detail, and shows the performance of the visual system in real robot tests.
