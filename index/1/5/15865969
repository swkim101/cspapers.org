Directed st-connectivity is the problem of detecting whether or not there is a path from a distinguished node s to a distinguished node t in a directed graph. We prove a time-log2(*) space lower bound of T = 2Q( IOSIOSn ‘x&for the JAG model of Cook and Rackoff [CR80] where n is the number of nodes in the input graph and S and T are the space and time used. The same bound holds for the stronger (node-named) NNJAG model of Peon Poo93a] and improves the previ-J ous bound of ST = Q(n / log n) by Barnes and Edmonds [Edm93a, BE93]. It also almost matches the known upper bound of T = 2°t’0g2(”/sJ)x7nn (WZ being the number of edges in the graph) which is implicitly stated in Barnes et al. [BBRS92] and is implementable on the JAG model.
