some kinds of QoS guarantees, regardless of technical difficulties. This paper presents a novel method to manage the operational risk of noncompliance with respect to network service(3) From the provider’s perspective, the question is how level agreements. This method answers the question of how QoS classes affect profit. We assume that the one-time many quality-of-service (QoS) classes a provider shall offer investment to enable several QoS classes has already to maximize his return for a given risk and vice versa. We been made. Then the provider’s economics of network prove that two QoS classes are often optimal for a single operutions are concerned with the following trade-OK QoS parameter and specific networks, namely, single links On the one hand, better QoS corresponds to a higher and some broadcast networks. It is interesting that the nonprice, thereby increasing revenue. On the other hand, compliance risk can be managed by turning it into a service if the provider guarantees higher QoS and is not willing feature. to run a higher risk, he must accept less traffic, thereby decreasing revenue.
