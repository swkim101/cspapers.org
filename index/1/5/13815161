This paper reports our progress in integrating the Narrative Knowledge Representation Language (NKRL) components according to the HARMS model to build intelligent assistive services in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications. NKRL is used to define reasoning and interaction rules that allow the HARMS actors to proactively decide to communicate, interact, execute an action in the organization or take part to a collective intelligence in order to solve a common problem. NKRL rules are used specifically for: (i) driving the dialogues between robots, humans and smart devices, (ii) better handling of events and infering their contexts and (iii) triggering reactive actions according to given contexts. A scenario of handling daily living issues is presented to show the benefits of the proposed approach.
