The use of the hands-on approach for teaching systems programming presented at the 1974 SIGCSE Conference has proved to be even more successful in the past two years. The reasons for the increased success are given. An approach of using structured assembler language concepts as an integral part of the systems programming course is introduced and discussed. Specific examples of the use of several structured programming macros are presented.
