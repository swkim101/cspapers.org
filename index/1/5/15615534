Several results concern ing para l le l a lgor i thms are improved. A part ial list of the new results includes: For r ank ing a l inked list of length n, O(lognlog~n) t ime using an op t ima l number of processors . For se lect ing the m-th smal les t out of n e lements O(lognlog'n) t ime using an op t imal number of processors. For g raph connect ivi ty O(lognlogt-~nlogt3~n) t ime using (m + n ) a (m ,n ) / ( l ogn logf2~n logt3~n) processors , and for f inding m in imum spanning forest in a g raph O(lognlogt-~nlogtS~n) t ime using (m+n)/(lognlog~2~n) processors , where n is the number of ver t ices and m is the number of edges. All the new algor i thms are de terminis t ic . These results provide an op t imal de terminis t ic paral le l a lgor i thm for list ranking that achieves poly-log t ime. Also , they prov ide an op t imal a lgor i thm for connect ivi ty which runs in a lmos t logar i thmic t ime when m>-nlog*n. This op t ima l a lgor i thm achieves logar i thmic t ime w h e n m = n t-~, where 0 < e _ < l . Our results are also s t rong enough to refute a known conjecture regard ing a l imit on the poss ible per formance of any paral le l a lgor i thm for the list rank ing p rob lem. This paper introduces a new deterministic coin tossing technique that provides for a fast and eff ic ient b reak ing of a symmetr ic s i tuat ion in paral le l . Prev ious ly , it was known how to break such symmet r i e s only by means of r andomiza t ion . Interestingly, the s t ructure of all the a lgor i thms in this paper fol low a pa rad igm which we call accelerating cascades. Given severa l a l te rna t ive para l le l a lgor i thms for the same prob lem, this paradigm constructs a new algor i thm for the same problem ou t of these a lgor i thms; the per formance of the new a lgor i thm compares favourab ly wi th that of any of its bui ld ing blocks.
