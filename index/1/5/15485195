In this position paper, the two terms design-oriented research and research-oriented design are studied and discussed in some detail in relation to HCI. In designoriented research—where research is the area and design the means—the production of new knowledge and the questioning of problem descriptions and other kinds of limitations to the freedom of design are seen as characterizing elements. In research-oriented design—where on the contrary design is the area and research the means—the production of artifacts, and in that process answering to the problems and real-world obstacles that one faces, is the primary objective.
