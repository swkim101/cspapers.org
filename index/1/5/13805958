Extreme Multilabel Classification (XMLC) is a very active and rapidly growing research area that deals with the problem of labeling an item with a small set of tags out of an extremely large number of potential tags. Applications include content understanding, document tagging, image tagging, biological sequence tagging, recommendation, etc. While the difficulty and the potential applications of XMLC are well understood in the core machine learning community, to the best of our knowledge, XMLC has not made inroads in the field of Information Retrieval (IR) and related areas. The aim of this workshop is to bring researchers from academia and industry in order to further advance this very exciting field and come up with potential applications of XMLC in new areas.
