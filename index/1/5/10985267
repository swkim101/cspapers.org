n-Vision is a testbed for exploring n-dimensional worlds containing functions of an arbitrary number of variables. Although our interaction devices and display hardware are inherently 3D, we demonstrate how they can be used to support interaction with these higher-dimensional objects. We introduce a new interaction metaphor developed for the system, which we call “worlds within worlds”: nested heterogeneous coordinate systems that allow the user to view and manipulate functions. Objects in our world may be explored with a set of tools. We describe an example n-Vision application in “financial visualization,” where the functions are models of financial instruments. n-Vision’s software architecture supports a hierarchy of arbitrarily transformed, nested boxes that defines an interactive space within which information is displayed and input obtained. Our design, modeled in part after the hierarchical 2D windows of the X Window System, is intended to provide an environment that is well suited to the use of true 3D input and stereo display devices. Boxes are associated with event handlers that support 3D motion, enter, and leave events, and provide recognition of finger gestures. CR
