A relatively recent development in online marketing is use of online auctions for marketing purposes. For example, BMW launched its X5 SUV with great fanfare by making the first one available on eBay in October, 1999. More recently, brands have created whole loyalty programs in partnership with eBay. For example, Burger King has recently launched a joint program with eBay whereby customers receive codes in the BK outlets, and then redeem them online on a site co-branded by the two companies, where they can participate in auctions to win certain prizes. A similar, earlier arrangement has existed between Pepsi and Yahoo!. Such uses of market mechanisms are not yet supported by theory. Mechanism design, and in particular auction theory, have traditionally been geared towards the optimization of very specific quantities â€“ social surplus, and revenue maximization. These have little to do with the objectives of the (primarily, online) marketeer. We suggest a new twist on mechanism design, geared towards such marketing applications, which we call behavioral mechanism design, or BMD. A key feature of BMD is that the design criteria do not concentrate on the economic end results (in particular, on the revenue generated or the social surplus obtained), but rather on the behaviors engendered during the operation of the mechanism, such as the # of messages seen by an average customer; total # of registered users; % of registered users
