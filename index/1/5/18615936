The course, Natural Language Processing, is an upper-level course for computer science majors. The pre-requisites include Survey of Programming Languages and Data Structures, so most students have at least 21 hours of Computer Science. Because the course is only offered every two years, many students will have taken more than 21 hours. The course is organized into four primary sections: text processing, sentence generation, sentence analysis, and case studies.
