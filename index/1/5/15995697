Prior research on viral marketing mostly focuses on promoting one single product item. In this work, we explore the idea of bundling multiple items for viral marketing and formulate a new research problem, called Bundle Configuration for SpreAd Maximization (BCSAM). Efficiently obtaining an optimal product bundle under the setting of BCSAM is very challenging. Aiming to strike a balance between the quality of solution and the computational overhead, we systematically explore various heuristics to develop a suite of algorithms, including Îº-Bundle Configuration and Aggregated Bundle Configuration. Moreover, we integrate all the proposed ideas into one efficient algorithm, called Aggregated Bundle Configuration (ABC). Finally, we conduct an extensive performance evaluation on our proposals. Experimental results show that ABC significantly outperforms its counterpart and two baseline approaches in terms of both computational overhead and bundle quality.
