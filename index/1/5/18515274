Much research focuses on predicting a person's geo-spatial traversal patterns using a history of recorded geo-coordinates. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting location-state transitions. Location-states for a user refer to a set of anchoring points/regions in space, and the prediction task produces a sequence of predicted location states for a given query time window. If this problem can be solved accurately and efficiently, it may lead to new location based services (LBS) that can smartly recommend information to a user based on his current and future location states. The proposed iLoc (Incremental (Location-State Acquisition and Prediction) framework solves the prediction problem by utilizing the sensor information provided by a user's mobile device. It incrementally learns the location states by constantly monitoring the signal environment of the mobile device. Further, the framework tightly integrates the learning and prediction modules, allowing iLoc to update location-states continuously and predict future location-states at the same time. Our extensive experiments show that the quality of the location-states learned by iLoc are better than the state-of-the-art. We also show that when other learners failed to produce reasonable predictions, iLoc provides good forecasts. As for the efficiency, iLoc processes the data in a single pass, which fits well to many data stream processing models.
