For many purposes, the Web page is too small a unit of interaction. Users often want to interact with larger-scale entities, particularly collections of topically related items. We report three innovations that address this user need. l We replaced the web page with the web sire as the basic unit of interaction and analysis* We defined a new information structure, the clan graph, that groups together sets of related sites. l We invented a new graph visualization, the auditorium visualization, that reveals important structural and content properties of sites within a clan graph. We have discovered interesting information that can be extracted from the structure of a clan graph. We can identify structurally important sites with many incoming or outgoing links. Lii between sites serve important functions: they often identify “f?ont door” pages of sites, sometimes identify especially significant pages within a site, and occasionally contain informative anchor text.
