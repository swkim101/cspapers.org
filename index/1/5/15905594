A conjecture by Thorup is that the diameter of a directed graph with <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges can be reduced to (log <i>n</i>)<sup><i>O</i>(1)</sup> by adding <i>O</i>(<i>m</i>) edges [3]. We give a counterexample to this conjecture. We construct a graph <i>G</i> requiring the addition of Ω(<i>mn</i> <sup>1/17</sup>) edges to reduce its diameter below Θ(<i>n</i><sup>1/17</sup>). By extending the construction to higher dimensions, we construct graphs with <i>n</i><sup>1+ε</sup> edges that require the addition of Ω(<i>n</i><sup>2--ε</sup>) edges to reduce their diameter. These constructions yield time-space tradeoffs in lower bounds for transitive closure queries in a certain computational model.
