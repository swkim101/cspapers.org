We give an optimal bound on the number of transitions of the minimum weight base of an integer valued parametric polymatroid. This generalizes and unifies Tamal Dey's O(k1/3 n) upper bound on the number of k-sets (and the complexity of the k-level of a straight-line arrangement), David Eppstein's lower bound on the number of transitions of the minimum weight base of a parametric matroid, and also the Θ(kn) bound on the complexity of the at-most-k level (the union of i-levels for i = 1,2,…,k) of a straight-line arrangement. As applications, we improve Welzl's upper bound on the sum of the complexities of multiple levels, and apply this bound to the number of different equal-sized-bucketings of a planar point set with parallel partition lines. We also consider an application to a special parametric transportation problem.
