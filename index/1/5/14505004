Flexible endoscope has been used for the diagnosis of the large intestine. This paper aims at the development of navigation software that provides the surgeon with the 2D/3D shape of flexible endoscope inside the colon real time. It helps surgeon insert the endoscope in a safe manner and locate the position of the lesion. With the information of the insertion length and the position/orientation information of the distal end, we propose a shape prediction algorithm with consideration of constrained geometry and gravity load of the flexible endoscope. To corroborate the effectiveness of the shape prediction algorithm, we perform simulation using 2D/3D flexible endoscope models and verify the result through experiments.
