Two techniques are discussed for partitioning logic circuits to maximize the resolution of stuck-line faults. One technique exploits the inherent fault resolution of the circuit by attempting to force equivalent faults into the same module. The other involves inserting control points to separate members of equivalent fault classes, a technique called fault class splitting. Some new methods for identifying equivalent faults are also presented.
