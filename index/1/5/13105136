An airborne wireless sensor network (WSN) composed of bird-sized micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) enables low cost high granularity atmospheric sensing of toxic plume behavior and storm dynamics, and provides a unique three-dimensional vantage for monitoring wildlife and ecological systems. This paper describes a complete implementation of our SensorFlock airborne WSN, spanning the development of our MAV airplane, its avionics, semi-autonomous flight control software, launch system, flock control algorithm, and wireless communication networking between MAVs. We present experimental results from flight tests of flocks of MAVs, and a characterization of wireless RF behavior in air-to-air communication as well as air-to-ground communication.
