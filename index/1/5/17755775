We present a spatial multiplex optical transmission system named the “Smart Light” (See Figure 1), which provides multiple data streams to multiple points simultaneously. This system consists of a projector and some devices along with a photo-detector. The projector projects images with invisible information to the devices, and devices receive some data. In this system, the data stream is expandable to a positionbased audio or video stream by using DMDs (Digital Micro-mirror Device) or LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) with unperceivable space-time modulation. First, in a preliminary experiment, we confirmed with a commercially produced XGA grade projector transmitting a million points that the data rate of its path is a few bits per second. Detached devices can receive relative position data and other properties from the projector. Second, we made an LED type high-speed projector to transmit audio streams using modulated light on an object and confirmed the transmission of positionbased audio stream data.
