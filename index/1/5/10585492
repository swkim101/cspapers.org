A decentralized state visual feedback control scheme is presented using an uncalibrated camera. Full nonlinear robot dynamics is considered only in the stability analysis. The closed loop equation renders local exponential tracking by means of the existence of a chattering-free second order sliding mode regime for all time. Additionally, a time-varying feedback gain induces a well-posed terminal attractor of visual tracking errors to prove finite-time tracking of image-based desired trajectories. The system is computationally very inexpensive in comparison to the few dynamic visual servoing controllers available in the literature since the regressor is not computed. Simulations results presented, which confirms the expected dynamic closed-loop performance.
