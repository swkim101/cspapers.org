This paper proposes a concept of robots called ubiquitous intelligent robot and introduces our research efforts toward establishing its fundamental technology. A ubiquitous intelligent robot is a kind of embodied intelligence that encompasses the sphere of people's activities, records these activities, and supports people. Under this concept, we have developed an intelligent environment for capturing our experiences and a wearable event recording system for medical care. These developments mainly focus on recording people's activities along with their environments.
