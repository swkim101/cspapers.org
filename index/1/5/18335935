This paper proposes a set of assumptions about learning in general, followed by a set of assumptions concerning ICS courses in particular. Using these as a foundation, an ICS course content and structure is developed which clearly shows the relationships between the various branches of computer science, encourages a logical presentation, and is modular and hierarchical, permitting use for a wide variety of audiences and course objectives. Since content organization is only one aspect of a course, the method of presentation is also discussed, with emphasis on methodologies other than lecture.
