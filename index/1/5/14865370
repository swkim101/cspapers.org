Air vehicles or balloons may take the responsibility for deploying sensor nodes hence leading a nomal distibuted topology. In order to improve energy-efficiency in such sensor networks, in this paper, we propose a new cluster formation algorithm named DAEEC (Density-Aware Energy-Efficient Clustering). According to the performance analysis result, the proposed DAEEC outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime.
