A parallel inference machine based on the dataflow model and the mechanisms to support two types of logic programming languages are presented. The machine is constructed from multiple processing elements and structure memories interconnected through a low-latency hierarchical network. The preliminary evaluation results of the experimental machine are also presented. The evaluation results show that the machine can exploit parallelism in programs.
