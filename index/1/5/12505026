Owens: The first course in Computer Science has been beset by several diverse approaches in the past few years. This panel proposal suggests that a reasonable way to discuss these different models is to have a representative from each of several positions describe the first course at his/her school and then speculate on where the students will be at the end of the third year in the program. Each panelist will discuss core topics covered. This panel is not intended to be a debate as to the one best way to do things, but is intended to reassure the Computer Science community that there are many paths to a solid CS foundation.
