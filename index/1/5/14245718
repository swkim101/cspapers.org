A fundamental algorithmic problem in computer graphics is t hat of computing a succinct encoding of a triangulation of a polygo nal surface model in order to be able to transmit and render it efficie ntly. The goal is to take a given polygonal surface model, whose fac ts are given by (possibly multiply-connected) polygons, tria ngulate its facets, and then decompose the triangulation into a small nu mber of “tristrips,” each of which has its connectivity stored im plicitly in the ordering of the data points. We develop methods that ar e effective in solving the stripification problem, both in the ory (provably good encodings) and in practice. Our methods are based o n carefully constructed search trees in the dual graph, follo wed by algorithms to decompose dual trees into tristrips. One decomp osition algorithm is provably optimal (based on dynamic programmin g), allowing us a sound basis of comparison among our other (heur istic) algorithms. We demonstrate the speed and effectivenes s of our algorithms through a battery of experiments. In comparison with the recently released STRIPE system for stripification, we find that our stripifier,FTSG, produces comparable or better quality encodings, while requiring significantly less computing time on a large variety of datasets. Further, FTSG is carefully engineered and implemented to be robust, even in the face of highly degenerate and corrupted real-world data.
