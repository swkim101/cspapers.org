In a musculoskeletal structure, the internal force among muscles plays an important role. Changing the internal force enables to control not only joint angles but also impedance, so that vertebrate animals can produce a motion according to a situation. Focusing on a musculoskeletal system with two links and six muscles, this paper investigate the effect of biarticular muscles when feedforward position control is inputted. This control gives the constant internal force balancing at desired posture as feedforward input, based on the EP hypothesis in physiology. From the result, we point out that the biarticular muscles can reduce the convergent time of the motion, and they also can stabilize the system.
