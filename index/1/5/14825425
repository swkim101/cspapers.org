However, it has been often noted, that although DLs are well-suited for representing a single, global viewpoint on an application domain, they offer no formal grounding for dealing with knowledge pertaining to multiple heterogeneous viewpoints â€” a scenario ever more often approached in practical applications, e.g. concerned with reasoning over distributed knowledge sources on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we study a natural extension of DLs, in the style of two-dimensional modal logics, which supports declarative modeling of viewpoints as contexts, in the sense of McCarthy, and their semantic interoperability. The formalism is based on two-dimensional semantics, where one dimension represents a usual object domain and the other a (possibly infinite) domain of viewpoints, addressed by additional modal operators and a metalanguage, on the syntactic level. We systematically introduce a number of expressive fragments of the proposed logic, study their computational complexity and connections to related formalisms.
