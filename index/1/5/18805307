We propose a new approach that exploits the good properties of core-guided and model-guided MaxSAT solvers. In particular, we show how to effectively exploit the structure of unsatisfiable cores in MaxSAT instances. Experimental results on industrial instances show that the proposed approach outperforms both complete and incomplete state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers at the last international MaxSAT Evaluation in terms of robustness and total number of solved instances.
