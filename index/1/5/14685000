This paper describes afour-year experimental software reuse project conducted at Software Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. The targets of reuse are program code modules stored in a common library. The project is first described in derail; its framework, organizational structure, and activities are presented. The statistical result s of the project are then shown. Some important aspects of software reuse are discussed, including impediments to software reuse, incentives and domain selection. Finally, it concludes that software reuse is inherently a managerial issue and that key factors for successful software reuse are senior management commitment and good domain selection.
