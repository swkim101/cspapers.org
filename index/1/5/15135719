We explore in this paper the problem of generating hierarchical broadcast programs with the data access frequencies and the number of broadcast disks in a broadcast disk array given. Specifically, we first transform the problem of generating hierarchical broadcast programs into the one of constructing a channel allocation tree with variant-fanout. By exploiting the feature of tree generation with variantfanout, we develop a heuristic algorithm VF to minimize the expected delay of data items in the broadcast program. Performance of these algorithms is analyzed. It is shown by our simulation results that by exploiting the feature of variant-fanout in constructing the channel allocation tree, the solution obtained by algorithm VF is of very high quality and is in fact very close to the optimal one.
