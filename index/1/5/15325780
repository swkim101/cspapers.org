The Internet White Pages Service (IWPS) has been slow 
to materialise for many reasons. One of them is the 
security concerns that organisations have, over allowing 
the public to gain access to either their Intranet or their 
directory database. The Directory Guardian is a firewall 
application proxy for X.500 and LDAP protocols that is 
designed to alleviate these fears. Sitting in the firewall 
system, it filters directory protocol messages passing into 
and out of the Intranet, allowing security administrators 
to carefully control the amount of directory information 
that is released to the outside world. This paper describes 
the design of our Guardian system, and shows how 
relatively easy it is to configure its filtering capabilities. 
Finally the paper describes the working demonstration of 
the Guardian that was built for the 1997 World 
Electronic Messaging Association directory challenge. 
This linked the WEMA directory to the NameFLOWParadise 
Internet directory, and demonstrated some of 
the powerful filtering capabilities of the Guardian.
