This paper proposes a piercing based grasping by using the self-tightening effect of objects with elasticity. We suppose a piercing hand with palm where the piercing motion by needles can be independently achieved irrespective of the palm motion. The palm first approaches and touches with the object, with a slight pushing motion. This motion produces an increase of potential energy of object. After the motion, the needles pierce the object. When the object is lifted up, the accumulated potential energy is released and the object tries to recover the original shape under the piercing condition. We found a particular mechanical configuration between the object and the needle, under which the constraint of object is tightened due to the object deformation during the release of the potential energy. In order to confirm the robustness of the proposed method, we have done a couple of experiments. The results show that the proposed method keeps an extremely high robustness compared with the other piercing methods.
