The CMAX translator converts applications written in scalable Fortran 77 to parallel Connection Machine Fortran. The most obvious part of the translation problem, and one addressed by a number of previous translators as well as CMAX, is loop vectorization: the substitution of array syntax and intrinsics for Fortran 77 DO loops. A less obvious (but equally important) part of the translation problem is the conversion of constructs arising from Fortran 77's linear memory model into code which does not rely on storage or sequence association. Most such constructs can only be detected and repaired through interprocedural analysis and transformation; CMAX is the first translator to perform such repairs. This paper describes the CMAX translator and some of the more important transforms that we have distilled from our users' porting experiences.
