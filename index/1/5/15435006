Performance analysis has always been considered important in computer design work. The area of central processing unit (CPU) design is no exception, where the successful development of performance evaluation tools provides valuable information in the analysis of design tradeoffs. Increasing integration of hardware is producing more complicated processor modules which add to the number of alternatives and decisions to be made in the design process. It is important that these modules work together as a balanced unit with no hidden bottlenecks. This paper describes a project to develop performance simulation as an analysis tool in CPU design. The methodology is first detailed as a three part process in which a performance simulation program is realized that executes an instruction trace using command file directions. Discussion follows on the software implemented, applications of this tool in CPU design, and future goals.
