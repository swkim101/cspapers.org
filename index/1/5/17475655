We consider the problem of decomposing an arbitrary complex 3D solid into hexahedra, i. e., regions combinatorially equivalent to cubes, yielding a geometric mesh. In this abstract, we propose a new method for all-hexahedral mesh generation. The key idea is to separate the mesh generation process into a combinatorial part, where an abstract cell complex of hexahedra is constructed from a surface mesh, and a geometric embedding part, where the exact positions of the mesh nodes are determined. Our approach combines techniques from several fields, namely decompositions of non-convex regions into convex pieces from computational geometry, shellings of cell complexes from topology, graph algorithms on planar graphs, minimum cost bidirected flows for surface meshing [6], and force-directed methods for the embedding from graph drawing. Computational experiences with a first implementation of this approach are encouraging, see Fig. 1, more details are presented in [S].
