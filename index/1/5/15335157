As data mining techniques are applied to ever larger data sets, it is becoming clear that parallel processors will play an important role in reducing the turn around time for data analysis. In this paper, we describe the design of a parallel object-oriented toolkit for mining scientific data sets. After a brief discussion of our design goals, we describe our overall system design that uses data mining to find useful information in raw data in an iterative and interactive manner. Using decision trees as an example, we illustrate how the need to support flexibility and extensibility can make the parallel implementation of our algorithms very challenging. As this is work in progress, we also describe the solution approaches we are considering to address these challenges.
