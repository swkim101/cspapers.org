The IS0 9241, Part 9 Draft International Standard for testingcomputer pointing devices proposes an evaluation of performance andcomfort. In this paper we evaluate the scientific validity andpracticality of these dimensions for two pointing devices forlaptop computers, a finger-controlled isometric joystick and atouchpad. Using a between-subjects design, evaluation ofperformance using the measure of throughput was done forone-direction and multi-directional pointing and selecting. Resultsshow a significant difference in throughput for themulti-directional task, with the joystick 27% higher; results forthe one-direction task were non-significant. After the experiment,participants rated the device for comfort, including operation,fatigue, and usability. The questionnaire showed no overalldifference in the responses, and a significant statisticaldifference in only the question concerning force required tooperate the device - the joystick requiring slightly more force.The paper concludes with a discussion of problems in implementingthe IS0 standard and recommendations for improvement.
