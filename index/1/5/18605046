As fundamental problems of signed network analysis, community detection and sign (or attitude) prediction are still primary challenges. To address them, we propose a generative Bayesian approach, in which 1) a signed stochastic blockmodel is proposed to characterize the community structure in context of signed networks, by means of explicitly formulating the distributions of both density and frustration of signed links from a stochastic perspective, and 2) a model learning algorithm is proposed by theoretically deriving a variational Bayes EM for parameter estimation and a variation based approximate evidence for model selection. Through the comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world networks, the proposed approach shows its superiority in both community detection and sign prediction for exploratory networks.
