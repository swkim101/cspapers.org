This paper reports a new design topology of 4 pole hybrid electromagnetic levitation system in conjunction with linear synchronous motor. The mover, 4 pole hybrid electromagnet, is levitated underneath of the linear motor with zero power control algorithm. Propulsion and one-dimensional planar motion of the hybrid electromagnet is provided by the vector controlled linear motor. The new design of 4 pole hybrid electromagnet has several improvements over older systems, such as weight reduction and less material usage. Diagonal drive integration of mover and linear motor is proposed and experimental results are presented.
