User interface design and end-user adaptation during the use of the system should be viewed as an ongoing collaborative design process . among interface designers and end-users. Existing approaches have focused on the two activities separately and paid little attention to integration of the two by supporting their asynchronous collaboration over a long period of time throughout the evolution of the interface design. Our knowledge-based domain-oriented user interface design environments serve both as design media and as communication media among interface designers and endusers. An embedded computational critiquing mechanism not only identifies possible problematic situations in a design for user interface designers and end-users but also facilitates asynchronous communication among stakeholders. The presentation of critiquing messages often triggers designers and end-users to articulate design rationale by describing how they responded to the critiques. The recorded design rationale mediates collaboration among end-users and user interface designers during the end-user adaptation and redesign of the interface by providing background context for a design decision.
