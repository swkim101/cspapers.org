This paper describes the results obtained in a research program ultimately concerned with deriving a physical sketch of a scene from one or more images. Our approach involves modeling physically meaningful information that can be used to constrain the interpretation process, as well as modeling the actual scene content. In particular, we address the problems of modeling the imaging process (camera and illumination), the scene geometry (edge classification and surface reconstruction), and elements of scene content (material composition and skyline delineation).
