Comparison is one of the most important phenomena in language for expressing objective and subjective facts about various entities. Systems that can understand and reason over comparative structure can play a major role in the applications which require deeper understanding of language. In this paper we present a novel semantic framework for representing the meaning of comparative structures in natural language, which models comparisons as predicate-argument pairs interconnected with semantic roles. Our framework supports not only adjectival, but also adverbial, nominal, and verbal comparatives. With this paper, we provide a novel dataset of gold-standard comparison structures annotated according to our semantic framework.
