Emerging technologies on the World Wide Web promise to make program, algorithm and concept simulations universally accessible. Simulations involving animation and visualization have a tremendous benefit when applied to various algorithms. We present a simulation tool for experimenting with concepts in fuzzy clustering that has proved useful in visualizing the results and demonstrating the computation method of the algorithms. This is especially advantageous in a classroom or laboratory setting where students may become more comfortable with the mechanics of fuzzy clustering through personal discovery and online experimentation.
