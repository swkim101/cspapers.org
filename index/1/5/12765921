Have you used the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in your teaching? Would you like to? Recent events are leading to increased interest in the Code: 1) The AP CS curriculum now includes "computing in context" as one of the six course topics. 2) The ACM has initiated an update of the Code, to be completed in early 2018. 3) There have been several court cases (Oracle v. Google is a recent example) and stories in the popular press (including in the New York Times) that have cited the Code. It is therefore increasingly important that students and teachers become aware of and comfortable with the Code. This BoF invites college and high school teachers to share assignments (or assignment ideas) that incorporate the Code, particularly outside of "the ethics class." We will also discuss proposed updates to the Code, and any items that are missing or anachronistic in the current Code. Representatives of the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics will collect this feedback and provide it to the Code 2018 Task Force.
