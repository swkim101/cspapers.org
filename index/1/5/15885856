With the development of ever more sophisticated data flow analysis algorithms, traditional data dependence tests based on elementary loop information will not be sufficient in the future. In this paper, quite general algorithms are presented for solving integer linear programming problems. While the properly so called problem solution is performed by a standard algorithm (the dual all integer algorithm), preliminary problem reduction techniques not only serve as a powerful tool for preparing this latter step, but also are often sufficient for solving exactly the data dependence problem.
