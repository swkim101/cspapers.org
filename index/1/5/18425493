In this paper, we propose a method for keyword extraction of radio news. Using our method, data sparseness problem and false alarm problem was Iightened even for short discourse or document. Also, our method is robust for partial errors of phoneme recognition. In our method, there are two procedures: i.e. term weighting and keyword extraction. In procedure of term weighting, a feature vector of each domain is calculated using an encyclopedia and newspaper articles. In procedure of keyword extraction, keywords are extracted using feature vectors and result of domain identification. The results of experiments demonstrate the appbcability of the method.
