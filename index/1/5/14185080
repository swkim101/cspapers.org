Despite numerous outstanding results, highly complex and specialized multimedia algorithms have not been able to fulfill the promise of fully automated multimedia interpretation. An essential problem is that they are insufficiently aware of the context they operate in. Algorithms that do take a form of context in consideration, often function in a domain-specific environment. The generic framework proposed in this paper stimulates algorithm collaboration on an interpretation task by continuously actualizing the context of the multimedia item under interpretation. Semantic Web knowledge, combined with reasoning methods, forms the corner stone of the integration of these various interacting agents. We believe that this framework will enable an advanced interpretation of multimedia data that goes beyond the capabilities of individual algorithms. A basic platform implementation already indicates the potential of the concept, clearing the path for even more complex interpretation scenarios.
