We describe a new user-interface metaphor for immersive virtual reality â€” the virtual tricorder. The virtual tricorder visually duplicates a six-degrees-of-freedom input device in the virtual environment. Since we map the input device to the tricorder one-to-one at all times, the user identifies the two. Thus, the resulting interface is visual as well as tactile, multipurpose, and based on a tool metaphor. It unifies many existing interaction techniques for immersive virtual reality.
