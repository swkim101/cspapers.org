Designing and constructing affective robots on schedule and within costs is especially challenging because of the qualitative, artistic nature of affective expressions. Detailed affective design principles do not exist, forcing an iterative design process. This paper describes a three step design process created for the Survivor Buddy project that engages artists in the design process and allows animation to guide physical implementation. The process combines creative design of believable agents unconstrained by costs with traditional design decision matrices. The paper provides a case study comparing the resulting design of the Survivor Buddy 2.0 robot with the original (Survivor Buddy 1.0). The multi-disciplinary methodology produced a more pleasing and expressive robot that was 50% less expensive, 78% lighter, and up to 700% faster within the same amount of design time. This methodology is expected to contribute to reducing risk in designing cost-effective affective robots and robots in general.
