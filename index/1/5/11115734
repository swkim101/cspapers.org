The cloud storage-based zero client technology gains companies’ interest because of its capabilities in secured and economic management of information resources. As the use of personal smart devices such as smart phones and pads in business increases, to cope with insufficient workability caused by limited size and computing capacity most of smart devices have, the necessity to apply the zero-client technology is being highlighted. However, from the viewpoint of usability, users point out a very serious problem in using cloud storage-based zero client system: difficulty in deciding and locating a proper directory to store documents. This paper proposes a method to enhance the usability of a zero-client-based cloud storage system by intelligently and pervasively archiving working documents according to automatically identified topic. Without user’s direct definition of directory to store the document, the proposed ideas enable the documents to be automatically archived into the predefined directories. Based on the proposed ideas, more effective and efficient management of electronic documents can be achieved.
