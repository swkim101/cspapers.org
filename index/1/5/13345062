Recently Lexicographic Breadth First Search (LBFS) has received considerable attention and has been shown to be very useful in the design of simple linear time algorithms for a number of diverse applications. In light of the popularity of LBFS. it is somewhat surprising that little work has been done on the study of LBFS orderings themselves. In this paper, we provide characterizations of LBFS orderings and show the impact of these results.
