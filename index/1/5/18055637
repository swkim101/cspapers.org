This paper explores similarity criteria between non-rigid shapes. Broadly speaking, such criteria are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic, the first referring to the metric structure of the objects and the latter to the geometry of the shapes in the Euclidean space. Both criteria have their advantages and disadvantages; extrinsic similarity is sensitive to non-rigid deformations of the shapes, while intrinsic similarity is sensitive to topological noise. Here, we present an approach unifying both criteria in a single distance. Numerical results demonstrate the robustness of our approach in cases where using only extrinsic or intrinsic criteria fail.
