The performance of monocular vision based target tracking is a strong function of camera motion. Without motion, the target estimation problem is unsolvable. By designing the camera path, the best possible estimator performance can be achieved. This paper describes a trajectory design method based on the predicted target state error covariance. This method uses a pyramid, breadth-first search algorithm to generate real-time paths that achieve a minimum uncertainty bound in fixed time or a desired uncertainty bound in minimum time.
