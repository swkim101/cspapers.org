Parallelizing compilers are essential tools for parallelizing old but sophisticated sequential programs. Program restructuring techniques, like loop transformations together with dependence analysis are applied to transform automatically sequential programs into parallel code. User interaction with the parallelizing process is very useful because, on massive parallel systems, small mistakes may cause large degradation on performance. In this paper we propose an interactive compiling environment, named Graphic Parallelizing Environment (GPE) â€˜, equipped with visualization tools to join user knowledge and compiler techniques to efficiently tune the program parallelization process. GPE is oriented to the advanced users of parallel computers. The Parafrase-2 parallelizing compiler represents the core of the environment. TCL/TK is used as middleware integration language, mainly used to implement the environment components dispatcher, and the graphical components.
