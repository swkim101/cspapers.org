We present a novel model based stereo system, which accurately extracts the 3D shape and pose of faces from multiple images taken simultaneously. Extracting the 3D shape from images is important in areas such as pose-invariant face recognition and image manipulation. The method is based on a 3D morphable face model learned from a database of facial scans. The use of a strong face prior allows us to extract high precision surfaces from stereo data of faces, where traditional correlation based stereo methods fail because of the mostly textureless input images. The method uses two or more uncalibrated images of arbitrary baseline, estimating calibration and shape simultaneously. Results using two and three input images are presented. We replace the lighting and albedo estimation of a monocular method with the use of stereo information, making the system more accurate and robust. We evaluate the method using ground truth data and the standard PIE image dataset. A comparison with the state of the art monocular system shows that the new method has a significantly higher accuracy.
