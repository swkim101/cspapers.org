However, they are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial example attack, which generates malicious output by adding slight perturbations to the input. Previous adversarial example crafting methods, however, use simple metrics to evaluate the distances between the original examples and the adversarial ones, which could be easily detected by human eyes. In addition, these attacks are often not robust due to the inevitable noises and deviation in the physical world. In this work, we present a new adversarial example attack crafting method, which takes the human perceptual system into consideration and maximizes the noise tolerance of the crafted adversarial example. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.
