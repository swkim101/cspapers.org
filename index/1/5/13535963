We examine online learning in the context of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), a task for which the concept acquisition strategies for human and other primates are well documented. We describe a new WCST experiment in rhesus monkeys, comparing the monkeys' behaviors to that of online learning algorithms. Our expectation is that insights gained from this work and future research can lead to improved artificial learning systems.
