Many CS1 and CS2 instructors have been using game-like assignments and manipulatives to increase student understanding of abstract concepts. A related approach described in this paper requires students to play a game-like version of each assignment (referred to as the "pre-game") before designing and coding their own programs. Students complete a prototype of the pre-game that uses simpler I/O but otherwise follows the same specification. By playing the pre-game, students become familiar with lesson principles using a concrete example that combines the advantages of both game-play and manipulatives. Ideally, the pre-game creates an environment that both encourages experimentation, and allows students to use their intuition when designing algorithms and data structures.
