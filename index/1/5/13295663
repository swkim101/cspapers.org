Vitreoretinal microsurgery requires precise hand-eye coordination to manipulate delicate structures within the eye on the order of tens of microns. To achieve these tasks, surgeons use tools of diameter 0.9 mm or less to access the eye's interior structures. The level of force required during these manipulations is often below the human tactile threshold, requiring the surgeon to rely on subtle visual cues or to apply larger forces above the tactile threshold for feedback. However, both of these methods can lead to tissue damage. Excursions can be made into tissues which are not felt by the surgeon, while larger forces have a higher chance of damaging tissue within the eye. To prevent damage to the retina and other anatomy, we present the implementation of hybrid position/force control operating in the sub-tactile force range for a handheld robotic system. This approach resulted in a 42% reduction in the mean force and 52% reduction in maximum force during peeling tasks.
