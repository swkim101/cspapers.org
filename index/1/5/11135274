A comparison method for diagnosis of multiprocessor systems is introduced. Given a system of n units modeled by a linear graph, problems of finding the minimum number of comparison edges required for fault detection and fault location are solved by the use of a covering algorithm. The bounds for the number of comparison edges, the number of necessary comparisons and test cycles in fault detection and fault location in systems with n units are determined and an algorithm for an optimal comparison connection assignment is given. Simplicity and ease of implementation make the described method applicable for fault detection and location in multiprocessor systems.
