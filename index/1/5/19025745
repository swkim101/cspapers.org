In a previous paper [1], we described a methodology for data base conversion that operates on the logical structure of data bases, using the existing query and generate capabilities of systems (typically data management systems). In this paper, we describe the implementation of such a converter in terms of its components and the internal data structures used. In [1] we discussed other approaches which were suggested in the literature and pointed out the advantages we see in our approach. The major advantage is complete independence from the internal organizational features of data bases, such as access paths and inversion and indexing mechanisms. As a result, we can provide a simple, intuitive language for a user who wishes to convert an existing data base.
