Numerous books and papers discuss approaches for solving problems that arise when software systems are built. Many of these, however, describe methods that seem reasonable only to experienced designers and programmers. To many, these problems often seem unmotivated, especially among students who have only written small programs. This paper describes a programming course intended to teach such students some of the more popular software engineering guidelines and approaches.
