Buoyancy-driven underwater gliders (UGs) have proven to be quite effective for long-range, long-term oceanographic sampling. However, current off-the-shelf UGs are large, heavy, expensive, and difficult to modify, both in hardware and software, which prevents their frequent use for lake observations and limits researchers' ability to perform multi-vehicle coordination experiments. Our current research goal is to develop UGs that would share the buoyancy-driven concept with the first generation of gliders, but are smaller in size, lighter in weight, and lower in price. Our future research goal is to design and develop an underwater glider fleet that will result in novel and transformative research capabilities in coordinated control. Along with advancing research and broadening data collection ability, UGs provide a hands-on tool for engaging students in sophisticated STEM learning. This paper describes in detail the design, manufacturing, and modeling of our inexpensive Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Presentation in Education (GUPPIE). GUPPIE was developed using practical components such as syringes for buoyancy control and a hull made of acrylic for easy analysis. The design is both affordable and easy-to-duplicate. GUPPIE's pedagogical platform provides hands-on learning applications that demonstrate glider mechanics, mechatronics, hydrodynamics, trimming, diving and surfacing performance, and mobility in water.
