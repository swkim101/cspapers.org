This paper describes the design and implementation of a tool for creating language processors, in particular, translator generators. The purpose of this tool is to allow the fast implementation of (non-production quality) translators for any language, however exotic, for which a grammar can be written, and to generate compiler phases with “hooks” which show the compiling process in action for use in compiler construction courses. The emphasis is on a user-friendly metalanguage which is consistent for the various phases of the parameterized tool. Use of the tool in a graduate compiler construction course revealed the strengths of this metalanguage as well as providing a test site for other improvements and further development of the tool.
