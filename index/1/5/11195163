This paper focus on the integration of wireless technology and CAD/CAM system for CNC workshop development. A specific case study is described a system based on embedded wireless device and Internet of Things (IoT) concept with Bezier techniques for the proposed model. The focus of the case study is to show a complete stage of manufacturing process starting from modeling in CAD system passing through CAM system, transferring NC code, gathering machine data, monitoring whole process and finally manufacturing product. Using MATLAB and UG-NX software for modeling, Monitoring machining process using temperature, accelerometers and gyroscope sensors based on IoT concept. Transferring NC codes to CNC machines using FTP protocol and DNC software, real-time report demonstrate information about machine name, parts progress, time, operation condition and Machine Cycle Time depending on DNC network.
