Analysis of failed problem solving efforts enables people to guide subsequent problem solving to avoid similar failures. This kind of learning while doing is essential in complex domains. We define Explanation-based Learning from Failure (ELF), a technique for achieving such a capability, and describe its prototype implementation in Failsafe, a Prolog program that learns from failure while solving floor planning problems.
