Recent work has classified sorting architectures as: (A) Sequential input/Sequential output, (B) Parallel input/Sequential output, (D) Sequential input/Parallel output, (E) Hybrid input/Hybrid output. The classification is based, not only on the I/O method, but also on the interconnection network, the sorting algorithm, and the type of keys used. This reprint demonstrates that the architectures based on the undirected de Bruijn graphs can sort data items in all of the above-mentioned categories. Apparently, no other single network that can sort data items in all the categories is known. Sorting algorithms and time complexities that correspond to each of these categories are given here. It is shown that these architectures can achieve the previously known best upper-bound times, in all of the categories. Also, it is proven that they work as sorting networks, even in the presence of some faults.
