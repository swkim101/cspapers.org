A Markov chain is a popular data modeling tool. This paper presents a variation of Markov chain, namely extensible Markov model (EMM). By providing a dynamically adjustable structure, EMM overcomes the problems caused by the static nature of the traditional Markov chain. Therefore, EMMs are particularly well suited to model spatiotemporal data such as network traffic, environmental data, weather data, and automobile traffic. Performance studies using EMMs for spatiotemporal prediction problems show the advantages of this approach.
