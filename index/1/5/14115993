PriCal is an ambient calendar display that shows a user's schedule similar to a paper wall calendar. PriCal provides context-adaptive privacy to users by detecting present persons and adapting event visibility according to the user's privacy preferences. We present a detailed privacy impact assessment of our system, which provides insights on how to leverage context to enhance privacy without being intrusive. PriCal is based on a decentralized architecture and supports the detection of registered users as well as unknown persons. In a three-week deployment study with seven displays, ten participants used PriCal in their real work environment with their own digital calendars. Our results provide qualitative insights on the implications, acceptance, and utility of context-adaptive privacy in the context of a calendar display system, indicating that it is a viable approach to mitigate privacy implications in ubicomp applications.
