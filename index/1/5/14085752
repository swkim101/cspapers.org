The software design process is discussed from an engineering point of view. Initially, a distinction is made between software design and program design. Software design is then described in terms of evolving a system architecture independently of implementation considerations. Computation structures are introduced as a means of modeling the dynamic behavior of a software architecture. Functional completeness, quality, machine independence, and performance completeness of a design are then used as criteria for engineering design decisions. Finally, the basic elements of a system to support the software design process are described.
