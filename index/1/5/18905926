Whole-Body Control methods offer the potential to execute several tasks on highly redundant robots, such as humanoids. Unfortunately, task combinations often result in incompatibilities which generate undesirable behaviors. Prioritization techniques can prevent tasks from perturbing one another but often to the detriment of the lower precedence tasks. For many tasks, static prioritization is not necessary or even appropriate because tasks can often be achieved in variable ways, as in reaching. In this paper, we show that such task variability can be used to modulate task priorities during execution, to temporarily deviate certain tasks as needed, in the presence of incompatibilities. We first present a method for mapping from task variance to task priority and then provide an approach for computing task variance. Through three common conflict scenarios, we demonstrate that mapping from task variance to priorities reactively solves a number of task incompatibilities.
