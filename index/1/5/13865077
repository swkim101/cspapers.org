We present an analysis framework for comparing the maximum achievable data rates that can bc expected when ATM cells or variable length packets are used for L.AN interconnection. A common quality of service parameter is used in the comparison (the frame corruption rate). The results of the analysis show that in several cases the ATM can achieve a higher useful rate in spite of the overhead handicap. This is due to pipelining which allows a better buffer utilization. Such cases occur when low-speed connections are multiplexed on the ATM link and when the link multiplexing buffer size is not very large (up to 13500 bytes in our examples).
