Hyperspectral imaging is beneficial in a diverse range of applications from diagnostic medicine, to agriculture, to surveillance to name a few. However, hyperspectral images often times suffer from degradation due to the limited light, which introduces noise into the imaging process. In this paper, we propose an effective model for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising that considers underlying characteristics of HSIs: sparsity across the spatial-spectral domain, high correlation across spectra, and non-local self-similarity over space. We first exploit high correlation across spectra and non-local self-similarity over space in the noisy HSI to learn an adaptive spatial-spectral dictionary. Then, we employ the local and non-local sparsity of the HSI under the learned spatial-spectral dictionary to design an HSI denoising model, which can be effectively solved by an iterative numerical algorithm with parameters that are adaptively adjusted for different clusters and different noise levels. Experimental results on HSI denoising show that the proposed method can provide substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods in terms of both objective metric and subjective visual quality.
