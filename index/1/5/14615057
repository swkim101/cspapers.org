A collision of robots in a narrow corridor, defender teams coordinating patrol activities to secure a target, etc. are examples of such anonymous interactions. Formally, we consider problems that are a subset of the well known Decentralized MDP (DEC-MDP) model, where the anonymity in interactions is specified within the joint reward and transition functions. In this paper, not only do we introduce a general model model called D-SPAIT to capture anonymity in interactions, but also provide optimization based optimal and local-optimal solutions for generalizable sub-categories of D-SPAIT.
