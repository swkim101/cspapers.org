As an increasing number of human activities are moving to the Web, more and more teams are predominantly virtual. Therefore, formation and success of virtual teams is an important issue in a wide range of fields. In this paper we model social behavior patterns of team work using data from virtual communities. In particular, we use data about the Web community of the multiplayer online game Dota 2 to study cooperation within teams. By applying statistical analysis we investigate how and to which extent different factors of the team in the game, such as role distribution, experience, number of friends and national diversity, have an influence on the team's success. In order to complete the picture we also rank the factors according to their influence. The results of our study imply that cooperation within the team is better than competition.
