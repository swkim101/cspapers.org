In this paper, a novel approach of SEM calibration based on non-linear minimization process is presented. The SEM calibration for the intrinsic parameters are achieved by an iterative non-linear optimization algorithm which minimize the registration error between the current estimated position of the pattern and its observed position. The calibration can be achieved by one image and multiple images of calibration pattern. Perspective and parallel projection models are addressed in this approach. The experimental results show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.
