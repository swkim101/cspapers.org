This paper proposes a collective construction method through interaction between simple robots and intelligent blocks that have a rule set and a communication function with neighboring blocks. In our method, the structure is formed by growing chain of blocks. The growth direction is determined by the rule set and a counter value passed between the blocks. The robots load or unload the block based on a simple algorithm and a local signal from the blocks. Because of the simplicity of each robot's behavior, the structure is locally unstable: the blocks can be attached or detached randomly from the structure even if they have already formed a part of the structure. In this paper, we first explain the mechanism of our proposal. Next we show some fundamental characteristics obtained by computer simulation and small scale experiment by real robot and blocks. We introduce small modification to enhance the adaptability of the system mainly focusing on a reinforcement function of the wall against the external stress.
