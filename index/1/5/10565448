This paper concerns the singularity of the half parallel manipulator, a novel three degrees of freedom (DOFs) mechanism, with revolute actuators. The parallel manipulator, proposed previously, consists of a base plate, a movable platform, and three connecting legs. It has the advantages in terms of only single-DOF joints and high rotational capability. The parallel manipulator has wide application in the fields of industrial robots, simulators, parallel machine tools and any other manipulating devices that high rotational capability is required. The inverse kinematics problem and Jacobian matrices are recalled firstly. And then all possible singularities of the manipulator are analyzed in detail. The results of the paper are very useful for the apprehension and the application of the manipulator.
