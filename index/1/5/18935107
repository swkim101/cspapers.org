This paper proposes a measure of relevance likelihood derived specifically for language models. Such a measure may be used to guide a user on how far to browse through the list of retrieved items or for pseudo-relevance feedback. To derive this measure, it is necessary to make the assumption that a user is seeking an ideal (usually non-existent) document and the actual relevant documents in the collection will contain fragments of this ideal document. Thus, in deriving this measure we propose a novel way of capturing relevance in Language Modelling.
