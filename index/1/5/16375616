Bilingual sentiment lexicon is fundamental resource for cross-language sentiment analysis but its compilation remains a major bottleneck in computational linguistics. Traditional word alignment algorithm faces with the status of large alignment space, which may introduce redundant computations as well as alignment errors. In this paper, we use collocation alignment to extract bilingual sentiment lexicon overcoming the drawbacks of word alignment. The idea of collocation alignment is inspired by the strong cohesion between feature words and opinion words in sentiment corpus. Experimental results show that our approach not only decreases the computing time dramatically but also improves the precision of extracted bilingual word pairs due to the smaller alignment space.
