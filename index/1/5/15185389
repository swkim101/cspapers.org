This paper addresses the task of providing extended responses to questions regarding specialized topics. This task is an amalgam of information retrieval, topical summarization, and Information Extraction (IE). We present an approach which draws on methods from each of these areas, and compare the effectiveness of this approach with a query-focused summarization approach. The two systems are evaluated in the context of the prosecution queries like those in the DARPA GALE distillation evaluation.
