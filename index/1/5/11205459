We propose a method to detect hidden data in English text. We target a system previously thought secure, which hides messages in tweets. The method brings ideas from image steganalysis into the linguistic domain, including the training of a feature-rich model for detection. To identify Twitter users guilty of steganography, we aggregate evidence; a first, in any do- main. We test our system on a set of 1M steganographic tweets, and show it to be effective.
