Possibilistic logic is a well-known framework for dealing with uncertainty and reasoning under inconsistent knowledge bases. Standard possibilistic logic expressions are propositional logic formulas associated with positive real degrees belonging to [0,1]. However, in practice it may be difficult for an expert to provide exact degrees associated with formulas of a knowledge base. 
 
This paper proposes a flexible representation of uncertain information where the weights associated with formulas are in the form of intervals. We first study a framework for reasoning with interval-based possibilistic knowledge bases by extending main concepts of possibilistic logic such as the ones of necessity and possibility measures. We then provide a characterization of an interval-based possibilistic logic base by means of a concept of compatible standard possibilistic logic bases. We show that interval-based possibilistic logic extends possibilistic logic in the case where all intervals are singletons. Lastly, we provide computational complexity results of deriving plausible conclusions from interval-based possibilistic bases and we show that the flexibility in representing uncertain information is handled without extra computational costs.
