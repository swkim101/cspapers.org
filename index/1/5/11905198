The paper presents a novel approach for event detection in sports videos by topic based graphical model learning. The characteristics features defining various sport events are extracted by contextual grouping of low-level video and audio features using topic modeling. Event detection is performed by learning the structure of context based distribution of characteristic features by CRF based graphical model. Experimental evaluation of the proposed concept is presented on recorded video of Handball and Soccer game.
