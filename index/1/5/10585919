A locally decodable code encodes <i>n</i>-bit strings <i>x</i> in <i>m</i>-bit codewords <i>C(x)</i>, in such a way that one can recover any bit <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> from a corrupted codeword by querying only a few bits of that word. We use a <i>quantum</i> argument to prove that LDCs with 2 classical queries need exponential length: <i>m=2<sup>Î©(n)</sup></i>. Previously this was known only for linear codes (Goldreich et al. 02). Our proof shows that a 2-query LDC can be decoded with only 1 quantum query, and then proves an exponential lower bound for such 1-query locally quantum-decodable codes. We also show that <i>q</i> quantum queries allow more succinct LDCs than the best known LDCs with <i>q</i> classical queries. Finally, we give new classical lower bounds and quantum upper bounds for the setting of private information retrieval. In particular, we exhibit a quantum 2 server PIR scheme with <i>O(n<sup>3/10</sup>)</i> qubits of communication, improving upon the <i>O(n<sup>1/3</sup>)</i> bits of communication of the best known classical 2-server PIR.
