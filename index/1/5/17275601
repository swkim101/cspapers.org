It is recognized within data fusion domain that the main challenge in devising gradient order fusion algorithm is to provide a feasible architecture in fusion system, which will comprise concerned entities in diverse subject-specific fusion model, besides, the characteristics, fusion situations and interrelations among system components have been demonstrated the key factors in the decomposition in contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose of this paper is therefore focused on the construction of optimal methodology strategy in data fusion when confronting above problems in the interpretation of stepwise integration process. Moreover in the circulation process of data fusion a bottom-up and target-based approach will be adopted considering the data matching effects, which is from target-specific levels to the uppermost abstract levels. This paper also expects to provide a notional methodology for the capturing of various sorts of complex contextual information, it can serve as facilitating instruments needed for a thoroughly disintegration of concerned objects entity, therefore whose attributes or properties, and the interrelations among them are separated from it for gradient levels fusion operation.
