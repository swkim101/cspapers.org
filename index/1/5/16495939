IRIS@ InventorTM is an object-oriented toolkit for developers of applications that incorporate interactive, threedimensional graphics. Encapsulation of data and methods in high-level graphical objects allows Inventor to provide a significant improvement in usability to developers, as compared to the standard, low-level set of graphics primitives provided in most other graphics libraries. Inventorâ€™s object-oriented framework also facilitates extensions, which are necessary in the diverse and rapidly changing field of 3D graphics.
