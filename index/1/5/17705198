Type-ahead search is a new information-access paradigm, in which systems can find answers to keyword queries "on-the-fly" as a user types in a query. It improves traditional autocomplete search by allowing query keywords to appear at different places in an answer. In this paper we study the problem of automatic URL completion and prediction using fuzzy type-ahead search. That is, we interactively find relevant URLs that contain words matching query keywords, even approximately, as the user types in a query. Supporting fuzzy search is very important when the user has limited knowledge about URLs. We describe the design and implementation of our method, and report the experimental results on Firefox.
