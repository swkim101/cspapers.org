This paper presents a system of visual metaphors used in a introductory programming course using Pascal. The visual metaphors represent programming concepts (data types, variables, arrays, records, files, modules, module interfaces and parameter passing, and dynamic storage) that are often difficult for beginning students to learn. The metaphors are used to accelerate the students' learning process and improve the overall comprehension of programs as structured objects. The system of metaphors is used in the first course for majors, Foundations of Programming, in the Computer Information Systems curriculum at Bentley College.
