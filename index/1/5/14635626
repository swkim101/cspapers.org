This short-paper presents the design and experimental validation of model-based, mobile routing protocol for a delay tolerant network (DTN), where herds of animals are utilised as message ferries. We develop a novel routing protocol that utilises knowledge of the predicted behaviour of each ferry in order to choose optimal ferries for carrying messages from source to sink nodes, as well as minimise routing overhead of the network via adaptive beaconing based on current behaviour.
