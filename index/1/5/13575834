With smart phones being indispensable in people's everyday life, Android malware has posed serious threats to their security, making its detection of utmost concern. To protect legitimate users from the evolving Android malware attacks, machine learning-based systems have been successfully deployed and offer unparalleled flexibility in automatic Android malware detection. In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in Android malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of a set of features extracted from the Android applications (apps). We consider different importances of the features associated with their contributions to the classification problem as well as their manipulation costs, and present a novel feature selection method (named SecCLS) to make the classifier harder to be evaded. To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further propose an ensemble learning approach (named SecENS) by aggregating the individual classifiers that are constructed using our proposed feature selection method SecCLS. Accordingly, we develop a system called SecureDroid which integrates our proposed methods (i.e., SecCLS and SecENS) to enhance security of machine learning-based Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on the real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SecureDroid against adversarial Android malware attacks by comparisons with other alternative defense methods. Our proposed secure-learning paradigm can also be readily applied to other malware detection tasks.
