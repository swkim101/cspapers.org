This paper establishes common ground for researchers addressing the challenge of scaling up inductive data mining algorithms to very large databases, and for practitioners who want to understand the state of the art. We begin with a discussion of important, but often tacit, issues related to scaling up. We then overview existing methods, categorizing them into three main approaches. Finally, we use the overview to recommend how to proceed when dealing with a large problem and where future research efforts should be focused.
