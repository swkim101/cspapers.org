INTRODUCTION Power and thermal constraints now limit performance, and thus have become first-order design criteria. As a result, focus has shifted to chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to improve performance without pushing the power envelope. CMPs trade higher frequencies for more cores. When developing new software or optimizing current software for such platforms, energy efficiency is now a critical part of performance analysis. If aware of power consumption per process in a system, the OS can prioritize processes based on power and thermal constraints. Current infrastructure does not support run-time power measurement of a given core. Power meters only track total system power consumption. System simulators provide in-depth information, but are extremely time consuming and prone to error. Hardware can be enhanced to measure the current and power draw of a CPU socket, but per-core measurement is difficult because in present CMPs all cores share the same power plane. Embedding measurement devices on-chip is not a feasible option, either. We estimate power consumed by each core in extant platforms by leveraging Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs). We create analytic models using PMC data from application-independent microbenchmarks. The PMC data and temperature form the variables in the power equations. We make four contributions:
