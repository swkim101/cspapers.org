The UofA* User Interface Management System (UIMS) generates graphical user interfaces based on a high-level description of semantic commands supported by the application. A main part of the UIMS, called Chisel, generates the presentation component of interfaces. Chisel selects interaction techniques, determines their attributes, and places them on the screen of the display device. While doing so it is capable of considering device properties, end user's preferences, and interface designer's guidelines. The aim of this paper is to discuss in detail the design and implementation of Chisel.
