A significant percentage of mobile interaction involves short-period usages that originate from the standby mode-users wake up a device by pressing the power button, unlock the device by authenticating themselves, and then search for a target app or functionality on the device. These additional steps preceding a target task imposes significant overhead on users for each mobile device access. To address the issue, we developed Gesture On, a system that enables gesture shortcuts in the standby mode by which a user can draw a gesture on the touchscreen before the screen is turned on. Based on the gesture, our system directly brings up a target item onto the screen that bypasses all these additional steps in a mobile access. This paper examines several challenges in realizing Gesture On, including robustly rejecting accidental touches when the device is in standby, battery consumption incurred for continuous sensing and gesture-based user authentication methods for automatically device unlocking. Our analyses based on a set of user data indicated that Gesture On demonstrates a feasible approach for leveraging the standby mode for fast access to mobile content.
