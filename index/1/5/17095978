The opportunities of the Internet combined with new devices and technologies change the end users' habits in media consumption. While end users often search for related information to the currently watched TV show by themselves, we propose to improve this user experience by automatically enriching media using semantic extraction. In our recent work we focused on how to apply media enrichment to distributed screens. Based on the findings we made from our recent prototype we identify several problems and describe how we deal with them. We illustrate a way to achieve cross-platform real-time synchronization using several transport protocols. We propose the usage of sessions to handle multi-user, multi-screen scenarios and introduce techniques for new interaction and customization patterns. We extend our recent approach with the extraction of keywords from given subtitles by utilizing statistical algorithms and natural language processing technologies, which are then used to discover and display related content from the Web. The prototype presented in this paper reflects the improvements of our work. We discuss next research steps and define challenges for further research.
