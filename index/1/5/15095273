The work presented here is part of a more general research project for <underline>C</underline>omputer <underline>I</underline>mplemented <underline>S</underline>ite <underline>P</underline>lanning (CISP), currently under development at the Institute of Physical Planning, C-MU. CISP is designed to respond to the typical site planning problem where the description of a site and the definitions of a set of uses (including relations and/or constraints to be satisfied) are given and we want to derive a plan of the uses for the site.
