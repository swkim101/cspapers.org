We describe a method for evaluating a grammar checking application with hand-bracketed parses. A randomly-selected set of sentences was submitted to a grammar checker in both bracketed and unbracketed formats. A comparison of the resulting error reports illuminates the relationship between the underlying performance of the parser-grammar system and the error critiques presented to the user.
