Shape shifting soft microrobots are generated from self-folding hydrogel bilayer structures. The folding conditions are analyzed to develop an optimal strategy for producing desired three-dimensional shapes. We present two different methods for programming magnetization in these microrobots that are variant and invariant to folding. The microrobots can be navigated through user-defined trajectories using rotating magnetic fields, and the morphing in response to temperature changes can be tuned for adaptive behavior. On-demand modulation of the mobility of individual microrobots is demonstrated by morphing their shape using selective near infrared light (NIR) exposure.
