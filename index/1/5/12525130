A dynamic data structure is suggested for representing the accumulator array used with a Hough Transform. The structure, called a Dynamically Quantlsd Space, allocates resources where they are most needed to best discriminate the peak in the parameter space. The effect is to focus the Hough Transform. Such attention control is especially needed when the parameter space has a large number of dimensions.
