This is a considerable improvementover theO(n6) b ound known for this case [3]. It is shown in[3] that minimumweighttriangulationisgo o dfor averagecase ray sho oting in three dimensions.This further substan-tiates the signi cance of our result.1Intro ductionThe minimum weight triangulation (MWT) problem ismostwell-knownintheplane,whereatriangulationwiththeminimumtotaledgelengthissoughtfora2Dp ointset.Theproblemisnotknowntob eNP-hard but no p olynomial-time algorithm is known.Re-centlyanapproximation algorithm withconstantfac-tor p erformance guarantee has b een designed for MWTby Levcop oulos and Krznaric[10].In another versionof theproblem Steinerp ointsareallowed andamini-mum weight Steinertriangulation (MWST)among allp ossibleSteinertriangulationsisdesired.Inparticu-lar, MWT is also a Steiner triangulation but with zeroSteiner p oints.Eppstein [8] showed how to approximatethe MWST of a 2Dp oint set within a constant factor.Instead of a 2Dp oint set, general inputs such as planarstraight line graphs (PSLG) have also b eenconsideredDepartment of Computer Science, HKUST, Hong Kong.e-mail: scheng@cs.ust.hkyDepartmentofCSE,I ITKharagpur,Kharagpur721302,India. e-mail: dey@cse.iitkgp.ernet.infor their applications in ray sho oting [3, 7]. A triangula-tion of a PSLG is the decomp osition of the convex hullof its verticeswhere the input line segments app ear asedges.When Steiner p oints are allowed these segmentsmay app ear as union of edges.Aronov and Fortune [3]observe that the technique of [8] applies to this case topro duce a p olynomial size triangulation approximatingMWSTwithinaconstantfactor.Inthesp ecialcasewhen the input PSLG is a p olygon p ossibly with holes,Cheng and Lee [7] presented an algorithm with b oth sizeand running timeO(nlog), whereis the numb er ofedges.Thetriangulationofap ointsetin3Disthedecomp osition of its convex hull into disjoint tetrahedra.The weight of the triangulation is the sum of the area ofthe triangles in it.Instead of p oint sets, the input mayconsist of a set of triangles with disjoint relative interior,acounterpartofPSLGin3D.Inthissettingcalledgeneral obstacle set, a minimum weight triangulation ofthe convex hull is sought where the input triangles haeto b e conformed.A sp ecial case arises when the inputtrianglesformtheb oundaryofap olyhedronwhoseinterioristob etriangulatedwithminimumweight.Noticethattheformulationofminimumweighttriangulation problem in these cases must allow Steinerp oints since there are arrangements of triangles in threespace such as the b oundary of Schonardt p olyhedron forwhich no triangulation is p ossible without Steiner p oints[12].WeconsiderMWSTproblemforthreedi erentcategories of inputs:p olyhedra, p oint sets, and generalobstaclesets.Of course,thisleaves op entheproblemof MWT of a 3Dp oint set since a p oint set can alwaysb e triangulated without Steiner p oints.ResultonMWSTprobleminthreedimensionsisscarce.Eppstein, in his pap er [8], acknowledges the dif- culty of the problem and observes the obstacles in gen-eralizing a metho d working in two dimension.
