Design schemas provide a means for abstracting software designs into broadly reusable components that can be assembled and refined into new software designs. This paper describes a knowledge-based software development paradigm that is based on the design schema representation. It combines design schemas, domain knowledge, and various types of rules to assist in the quick generation of software designs from user specifications. A prototypical environment, IDeA (Intelligent Design Aid), is described that supports the knowledge-based paradigm. The schema-based techniques used in IDeA are presented along with some examples of their use.
