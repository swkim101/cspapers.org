Search engines are increasingly relying on large knowledge bases of facts to provide direct answers to users’ queries. However, the construction of these knowledge bases is largely manual and does not scale to the long and heavy tail of facts. Open information extraction tries to address this challenge, but typically assumes that facts are expressed with verb phrases, and therefore has had difficulty extracting facts for noun-based relations. We describe ReNoun, an open information extraction system that complements previous efforts by focusing on nominal attributes and on the long tail. ReNoun’s approach is based on leveraging a large ontology of noun attributes mined from a text corpus and from user queries. ReNoun creates a seed set of training data by using specialized patterns and requiring that the facts mention an attribute in the ontology. ReNoun then generalizes from this seed set to produce a much larger set of extractions that are then scored. We describe experiments that show that we extract facts with high precision and for attributes that cannot be extracted with verb-based techniques.
