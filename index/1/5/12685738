This five and a half day workshop will provide those new to or planning instruction in the areas of computer and network security and information assurance with an opportunity to participate in two important events: tutorials to prepare participants in information assurance (IA) education and a major information security education conference. The purpose of the WECS tutorial sessions is to assist participants in learning about fundamentals and recent advances in information assurance and computer security, and to improve their instructional capability in these areas. The core classes of the tutorial session will provide an overview of how to present the canonical IA curriculum, including required topics, example materials and suggested laboratory exercises. The range of IA topics will be presented in terms of course content from beginning to advanced classes. Key concepts from each topic will be explained. The World Conference on Information Security Education (WISE 3) will take place over two and a half days. WISE 3 is sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing and will include presentations by educators from three continents. The workshops include keynote talks by both Dorothy Denning and Peter Denning, as well as a panel on teaching information assurance to undergraduates. Attendance at WECS will be limited to 20 participants. Members or teachers of demographic groups currently underrepresented in Information Assurance education are strongly encouraged to apply. Each workshop attendee will be awarded a workshop scholarship. Scholarships will include: Travel to and from Monterey Tutorial and WISE 3 conference fees Subsistence of $125 per full day and $75 per half
