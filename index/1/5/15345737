This paper introduces a new and low-cost tissue stiffness simulation technique for surgical training and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) with pseudo-haptic feedback based on tissue stiffness maps provided by rolling mechanical imaging. Superficial palpation and deep palpation pseudo-haptic simulation methods are presented. Although without expensive haptic interfaces users receive only visual feedback (pseudo-haptics) when maneuvering a cursor over the surface of a virtual soft-tissue organ by means of an input device such as a mouse, a joystick, or a touch-sensitive tablet, the alterations to the cursor behavior induced by the method creates the experience of actual interaction with a tumor in the users' minds. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated for tissue abnormality identification. It is shown that users can recognize tumors with these two methods and the rate of correctly recognized tumors in deep palpation pseudo-haptic simulation is higher than superficial palpation simulation.
