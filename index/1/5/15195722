High findability of documents within a certain cut-off rank is considered an important factor in recall-oriented application domains such as patent or legal document retrieval. Findability is hindered by two aspects, namely the inherent bias favoring some types of documents over others introduced by the retrieval model, and the failure to correctly capture and interpret the context of conventionally rather short queries. In this paper, we analyze the bias impact of different retrieval models and query expansion strategies. We furthermore propose a novel query expansion strategy based on document clustering to identify dominant relevant documents. This helps to overcome limitations of conventional query expansion strategies that suffer strongly from the noise introduced by imperfect initial query results for pseudo-relevance feedback documents selection. Experiments with different collections of patent documents suggest that clustering based document selection for pseudo-relevance feedback is an effective approach for increasing the findability of individual documents and decreasing the bias of a retrieval system.
