Today, social media are one of the fastest ways to have access to information related to several topics. Indeed, a diffused information on these supports can travel thousands of kilometres in only few seconds contrary to an article posted on a news site. Despite the fact that a large variety of studies have been conducted to understand how fast and how scale information spreads in social media, we observe that they have not yet been interested in the geographical aspect. In this paper, we perform a geographical and temporal analysis of Twitter trends spread between May and June 2017. We introduce interesting patterns which deal with the paths taken by information between countries. In addition, we observe relevant results by taking into account the topic. Finally, we conclude and give perspectives of research of this work.
