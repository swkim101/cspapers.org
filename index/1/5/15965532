Advances in finite model theory have appeared in LICS proceedings since the very beginning of the LICS Symposium. The goal of this paper is to reflect on finite model theory by highlighting some of its successes, examining obstacles that were encountered, and discussing some open problems that have stubbornly resisted solution.
