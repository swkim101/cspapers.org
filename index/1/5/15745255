We have previously developed a simple mathematical model for formation of ocular dominance columns in mammalian visual cortex. The model provides a common framework in which a variety of activity-dependent biological machanisms can be studied. Analytic and computational results together now reveal the following: if inputs specific to each eye are locally correlated in their firing, and are not anticorrelated within an arbor radius, monocular cells will robustly form and be organized by intra-cortical interactions into columns. Broader correlations within each eye, or anti-correlations between the eyes, create a more purely monocular cortex; positive correlation over an arbor radius yields an almost perfectly monocular cortex. Most features of the model can be understood analytically through decomposition into eigenfunctions and linear stability analysis. This allows prediction of the widths of the columns and other features from measurable biological parameters.
