The problem of organizing multiple, monolithic microprocessors into an effective general purpose computer structure is examined. A tree structure with extra interconnections was found to be especially attractive. It provides a structured hierarchy for control, addressing and message routing. More important, it appears to provide a mechanism to automatically migrate data abstractions and processes over the network of processors. The network can be expanded to any desired size and no global control or routine mechanisms are needed.
 The potential advantages and disadvantages of the X-Tree structure are discussed and the results of some static simulations are presented.
