Eliot Moss asked the panelists to discuss their views on the relationship between object-oriented techniques and concurrency. In particular, he asked how object-oriented techniques facilitate or hinder, if either, the design and implementation of concurrent systems. As a starting point, he presented two lists of potential issues, one outlining general properties of concurrent systems, and the other identifying software mechanisms for controlling and exploiting concurrency. His properties list included hardware architecture (e.g., SIMD vs. MIMD) , process granularity, degree of concurrency, and process termination problems, among others. His software list included the traditional mechanisms of locking, synchronization, scheduling, and transactions (going beyond their standard database use). In addition, he asked for comments on the relationships between concurrency and the distinctly object-oriented mechanisms of inheritance and interactive (e.g., visual) interfaces.
