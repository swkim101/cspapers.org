As the cycle time of CPUS or pipeline operators decreases faster than that of memories, a large number of memory banks must be used to increase the memory bandwidth. Thus, special data mappings must be used to reduce bank conflicts. Such storage schemes allow conflict-free access to commonly used matrix vectors (which are accessed, in a SIMD computer, within an interconnection network). In this paper, we present two new classes of storage schemes: semi-linear and hi-base mappings. After discussing properties of these general classes, we introduce a specific scheme, called DOUZEl, and the interconnection network to be used with it. It allows conflict-free access to usual vectors of a matrix, and is characterized both by an efficient use of the number of memory banks, and simplicity of implementation.
