This paper illustrates an approach to designing software information systems. We have found this strategy to be sufficiently systematic and practically useful enough to merit exposition for a wider audience. The most novel aspect of our approach is how we analyze the problem in successive steps to produce a logical design. Briefly, the steps are:
 (1) identify the (classes of) things in the problem's context and the invariant relationships between them.
 (2) for each (class of) thing that is of central importance to the problem describe the main stages and transitions in the thing's “life” with respect to the problem,
 (3) synthesize the logical data base structure with attributes determined for all record types using results from the previous two steps.
 These three steps are the way we model static and dynamic aspects of data as a prerequisite to designing information systems.
