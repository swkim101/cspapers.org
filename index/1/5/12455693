Core vector machine(CVM) is suitable for efficient large-scale pattern classification. In this paper, a method for improving the performance of CVM with Gaussian kernel function irrespective of the orderings of patterns belonging to different classes within the data set is proposed. This method employs a selective sampling based training of CVM using a novel kernel based scalable hierarchical clustering algorithm. Empirical studies made on synthetic and real world data sets show that the proposed strategy performs well on large data sets.
