In this paper we describe a small content-based visual recommendation project built as part of the Allegro online marketplace platform. We extracted relevant data only from images, as they are inherently better at capturing visual attributes than textual offer descriptions. We used several image descriptors to extract color and texture information in order to find visually similar items. We tested our results against available textual offer tags and also asked human users to subjectively assess the precision. Finally, we deployed the solution to our platform.
