We present an outdoor photometric stereo method using images captured in a single day. We simulate a sky hemisphere for each image according to its GPS and timestamp, and parameterize the obtained sky hemisphere into a quadratic skylight and a Gaussian sunlight distribution. Unlike previous works which usually model outdoor illumination as a sum of constant ambient light and a distant point light, our method models natural illumination according to a popular sky model and thus provides sufficient constraints for shape reconstruction from one day images. We generate pixel profiles of uniformly sampled unit vectors for the corresponding time of captures and evaluate them using correlation with the actual pixel profiles. The estimated surface normal is refined by MRF optimization. We have tested our method to recover objects and scenes of various sizes in real-world outdoor daylight.
