This paper explores the cognitive presence of the learners in MOOCs through using a (computational) linguistic analysis of the learnersâ€™ Point-of-View as an indicator for cognitive presence. The linguistic analysis of the written language as a medium of interaction by the students in the context of MOOCs shows hallmarks of cognitive disengagement and low cognitive presence by the learners.
