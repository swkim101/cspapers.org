We present a generalization of the k server problem called dynamic servers where the number of servers is not xed a priori rather the algorithm is free to increase and decrease the number of servers at will but it is required to pay a rental cost for each active server at designated times This new problem is a simultaneous abstraction for problems aris ing in a variety of applications particularly the information delivery problem for video on demand web server manage ment and the problem of dynamic maintenance of kinematic structures for applications in molecular biology simulation of hyperredundant robots collision detection and computer animation The problem also appears to be of theoretical signi cance as a natural new paradigm in the realm of on line algorithms We give approximation algorithms for the o ine problem and initiate the study of the online ver sion of this problem We present an O minflog n log g competitive algorithm where n is the number of requests and the normalized diameter of the metric space de notes the ratio of the maximum to the minimum distance amongst the requested points We also prove a lower bound
