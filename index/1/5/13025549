In this paper, I propose a research agenda surrounding the notion of slow search, where retrieval speed may be traded for improvements in result quality. This time-quality trade- off leads to a number of implications in the areas of human- computer interaction and information retrieval algorithms, and I plan to explore this space along various dimensions, including adjustments in user behavior when exposed to new search paradigms, investigating the utility a user perceives when given the option to use slow search in addition to traditional search, and examining different notions of 'quality'. I have conducted preliminary studies to probe user behavior and attitudes towards a particular implementation of slow search, and how users? expected behaviors compare to their actual behaviors. I will provide an outline of these studies, and propose future work in this as well as related areas.
