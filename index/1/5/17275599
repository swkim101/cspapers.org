The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is an emerging standard conceptual modeling language in Software Engineering processes. UML provides extension mechanisms (stereotypes) to adapt the general modeling language to specific application domains. In addition, UML comprises the standardized expression language Object Constraint Language (OCL) to model additional invariants. In this paper we show how UML can be extended using the standardized extension mechanisms to fit the needs of the domain of knowledge-based product configuration. Starting from a conceptual product model, we define the semantics of the employed extensions based upon a logic theory of configuration in a way that the resulting knowledge bases can be processed by a specialized inference engine. We show especially how the built-in expression language OCL can be employed to enhance the expressiveness of the conceptual models and how such expressions can be translated to the logical model. Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of the presented ideas based on commercial tools.
