Computing students often have difficulty understanding the relevance of the math we teach, though educators appreciate the significance. This BoF will discuss ways to connect this math with what computing students think they should be doing: programming. This BoF will focus on the benefits (and perils) of connecting math to the development of correct programs with the goal of motivating the relevance of the math-related portion of the ACM/IEEE Computer Society CS2013 curriculum. The discussion will continue the spirit and essence held by the math-thinking working group, a distributed working group of approximately 170 people who have been promoting and clarifying the importance of mathematics in computer science education.
