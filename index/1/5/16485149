In this paper, we first present the notion of stateful identity-based encryption (IBE) and then extend standard security definitions for IBE to the stateful setting. After that, we demonstrate a concrete stateful IBE scheme, whose security meets the strongest definition in the setting in random oracle model, and whose encryption and decryption are very efficient, compared to existing IBEs: one pairing each for encryption and decryption.
