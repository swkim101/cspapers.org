This paper considers the specifications and design of a trigger subsystem in a database management system. The use of triggers as extended assertions and as a means to materialize virtual data objects are discussed. The functional requirements of a trigger subsystem and different implementation issues are studied. We also examine the relationships between a trigger subsystem and the rest of the database system, in particular the authorization and locking subsystems.
