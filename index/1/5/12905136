We present a method for real-time bare hand tracking that utilizes natural hand synergies to reduce the complexity and improve the plausibility of the hand posture estimation. The hand pose and posture are estimated by fitting a virtual hand model to the 3D point cloud obtained from a Kinect camera using an inverse kinematics approach. We use real human hand movements captured with a Vicon motion tracking system as the ground truth for deriving natural hand synergies based on principal component analysis. These synergies are integrated in the tracking scheme by optimizing the posture in a reduced parameter space. Tracking in this reduced space combined with joint limit avoidance constrains the posture estimation to natural hand articulations. The information loss associated with dimension reduction can be dealt with by employing a hierarchical optimization scheme. We show that our synergistic hand tracking approach improves runtime performance and increases the quality of the posture estimation.
