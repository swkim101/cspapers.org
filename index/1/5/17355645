Recommendation, retrieval and browsing techniques are used to address the information overload problem. Current state-of-the-art approaches in these domains deﬁne the relevance of documents based on their content and in some cases the social dynamics of the collaborating groups. Relevance, often implemented as the topical relevance, is the fundamental principle of selecting an item for access. From a user’s perspective, ‘Interest’ in an item is the basis of access. ‘Interest’ is regarded by Izard as one of the eight fundamental human emotions [2]. According to the aﬀective-cognitive and emotion-pattern theories, interests can trigger and be triggered by cognition as well as emotions. In other words, emotion plays an important role in the development of interest in humans. From this perspective, the role of emotion in inﬂuencing users’ interests seems to be neglected in the current information systems. It is our objective to investigate the role of (both reader’s and writer’s) emotion to characterise user interest. A system that provides quantitative and qualitative information about the emotional value and feelings represented in documents would be useful for a broad range of users, such as those looking for information about movies, trying to plan their vacations, searching for speciﬁc articles for or against speciﬁc subjects, or even marketing managers looking for consumers’ feelings on new products. A system that goes one step further and provides quantitative and qualitative information about the emotional value and feelings based on personalised user proﬁle –consisting of concepts and emotions– will be even more useful [1].
