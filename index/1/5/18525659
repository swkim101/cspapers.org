We have developed a system that offers comprehensive analysis functionality for information retrieval experiments combined with a storage facility for persisting experiment data in a uniform fashion to facilitate repeatability and comparability of experiments. Our Service-Oriented IR Evaluation Framework - SOIRE offers a number of technological interfaces based on open networking standards and modeling languages to connect to other systems while regarding ease-of-use for researchers as the feature of utmost importance.
