In this paper, we analyzed the operational skill for the search activity via a remote mobile robot to find out some hidden objects under debris. The experiments of the human-solo (i.e., master-slave) control revealed that the accurate and effective operations require the adequate view control of the camera, which enables the parallel execution of the robotic ambulatory movement and the accurate environment recognition. Based upon this analysis, an automated view control system coordinated with the human driving control was developed and evaluated in terms of the complementary control sharing between a human operator and a machine autonomy that embodies their naturalistic collaboration.
