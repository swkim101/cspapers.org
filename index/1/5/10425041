This paper describes work on a high-level language processor, the Array Machine System. The work described includes a description of the high-level language, a discussion of the two components of the system, the Net Compiler and the Array Machine, and recent measurements made on that system. The language described is based on postfix notation. The Net Compiler, which exists as a PL/l program, prepares the control code for the Array Machine. The Array Machine, which exists as a PL/l simulation program, executes the control code, using its primary processing element, an array of homogeneous building blocks. The measurements on the system feature a comparison to a third generation computer.
