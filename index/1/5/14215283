The use of computers in schools to promote active learning by students is not common. This research studies educational software simulations and utilizes the results to create a visual programming environment that will support the creation of simulations by teachers who are novice programmers. The expectation is that this will increase the accessibility of programming systems and give teachers a tool that will empower them to create and modify their own software.
