When students are learning to develop algorithms, they very often spend more time dealing with issues of syntax rather than solving the problem. Additionally, the textual nature of most programming environments works against the learning style of the majority of students. RAPTOR is a visual programming environment, designed specifically to help students envision their algorithms and avoid syntactic baggage. RAPTOR programs are created visually and can be executed visually by tracing the execution through the program. Required syntax is kept to a minimum. Students preferred expressing their algorithms visually, and were more successful creating algorithms using RAPTOR than using a traditional language or writing flowcharts.
