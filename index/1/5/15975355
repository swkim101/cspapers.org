A qualitative representation of space and/or time provides mechanisms that characterize the essential properties of objects or configurations. The advantages over quantitative representations can be: (1) a better match with human concepts related to natural language, and (2) better efficiency for reasoning. The two main trends in qualitative spatial constraint reasoning are topological reasoning about regions and reasoning about directions between points and straight lines and orientations of straight lines or configurations derived from points. In this work, we apply universal algebraic tools to binary qualitative calculi and their relations.
