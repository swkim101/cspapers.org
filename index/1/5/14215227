We discuss the simulation of granular materials and the problems encountered when parallelizing these simulations. The main problem of inadequately balanced loads can be mitigated via the use of a dynamic load balancing procedure. We discuss a mapping of this procedure onto a deterministic cellular automaton and show that the time needed for convergence from an initially unbalanced state grows like T cc P“, with P being the number of processors and ~ = (),0t3$J+ 0.009. THs convergence time can be considered “fast”, enabling t hk algorithm to track fluctuations in the particle density as the simulation progresses. We then discuss the implementation of this algorithm on a Paragon XP/S 10 and a CRAY T3D.
