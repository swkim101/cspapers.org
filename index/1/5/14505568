This paper introduces about an open-source project, Triangulation Toolbox, for landmark-based localization. This project aims to share various algorithms and evaluate their performance in public. At first, landmark-based localization is briefly reviewed with respect to its types of input measurements. From its generalized problem formulation, we adopt a common interface for algorithms in the toolbox. Each algorithm is based on diverse types of input measurements (e.g. distance or bearing angle) in different dimension of space (e.g. 2D or 3D). To support capricious requirements, the toolbox follows the most general convention on measurements and space. In our performance evaluation, nine algorithms were experimentally compared in the view of position and orientation accuracy. The evaluation also leads helpful comments on landmark-based localization and its applications. Since Triangulation Toolbox is designed to be simple and flexible, many developers and researchers can refer implemented algorithms for their applications and also evaluate their own algorithm through the benchmark.
