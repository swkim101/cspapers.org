This paper studies the problem of estimating worst case power dissipation in a sequential circuit. We approach this problem by finding the maximum average weight cycles in a weighted directed graph. In order to handle practical sized examples, we use symbolic methods, based on Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs), for computing the maximum average length cycles as well as the number of gate transitions in the circuit, which is necessary to construct the weighted directed graph.
