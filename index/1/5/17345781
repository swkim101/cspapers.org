Owing to the portable and excellent phone camera, people now prefer to take photos and upload them by mobile phone. Content based image retrieval is effective for users to obtain relevant information about a photo. Taking the limited bandwidth and instability into account, we propose an effective scalable mobile image retrieval approach in this paper. The proposed mobile image retrieval algorithm first determines the relevant photos according to visual similarity in mobile end, then mines salient visual words by exploring saliency from multiple relevant images, and finally we determine the contribution order of salient visual words for scalable retrieval. In server terminal, spatial verification is performed to re-rank the results. Compared to the existing approaches of mobile image retrieval, our approach transmits less data and reduces the computational cost of spatial verification. Most importantly, when the bandwidth is limited, we can transmit a part of features according their contributions to retrieval. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
