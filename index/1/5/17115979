One of the most crucial parameters of any document retrieval system is its efficiency measured in terms of the computer resources used, particularly the time taken to retrieve output to submitted queries. This quantity is especially significant for retrieval systems with large-slzed document files and/or in the case when immediate response to a user's query is required (on-llne systems, for instance). In these circumstances it is usually necessary to organize the document file so that, in order to retrieve the output to a user's query, the search is limlted to a small part of the file only.
