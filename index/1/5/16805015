Design complexity is rapidly becoming a limiting factor in the design of modern, high-performance microprocessors. This paper introduces an optimization technique to improve the efficiency of complex processors. Using a new metric (^Utilization), the designer can identify infrequently-used functionality which contributes little to performance and then systematically "prune" it from the design. For cases in which architectural pruning may affect design correctness, previously proposed techniques can be applied to guarantee forward progress. To explore the benefits of architectural pruning, we study a candidate Optimistic-Checker Tandem architecture, which combines a complex Alpha EV6-like out-of-order Optimistic core, with some of the underutilized functionality pruned from its design, with a non-pruned EV5-like in-order Checker core. Our results show that by removing 3% of infrequently used functionality from the optimistic core an increase in frequency of 25% can be realized. Taking into account the replay overhead triggered by the removed functionality, the Tandem system is still able to achieve a 12% overall speedup.
