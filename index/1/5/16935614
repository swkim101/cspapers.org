FRGC aims to develop algorithms that make use of the high quality images in the face database. The algorithms in this paper have been developed with this in view. We present methods to estimate pose using multi-view classifiers. Based on the knowledge of pose and face geometry a region of interest of possible eye locations is found. An adaptive thresholding is used to pick out the darkest pixels in this region, which forms the eye region. Using this information region of interest of nose location is formed. A gradient operator is used to obtain the edges in this region. Histogram thresholding is used to find the nose in this region. Lines are drawn joining the center points of each of the regions. Perpendicular is drawn to the line joining the eye centers. Based on the slopes of these lines the pose angle is determined. The FRGC version 2 experiment number 4 image set is used to test the eye location algorithm while the nose location and pose angle methods are tested on version 1 image set.
