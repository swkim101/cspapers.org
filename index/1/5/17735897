In this paper, we propose a new ensemble document clustering method. The novelty of our method is the use of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) in the generation phase and a weighted hypergraph in the integration phase. In our experiment, we compared our method with some clustering methods. Our method achieved the best results.
