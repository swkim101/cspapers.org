The Dual-SLIP model has been proposed as a walking template that inherently encodes a rich set of human-like features. Previous work has used the 3D Dual-SLIP with bio-inspired leg actuation to generate a human-like dynamic walking gait over a wide range of speeds. The work presented in this paper extends the 3D Dual-SLIP walking strategy to uneven terrain. With nonlinear optimization based on a multiple-shooting formulation, actuated Dual-SLIP walking gaits over uneven terrain are identified that handle 1-step elevation changes up to Â±10 cm. Moreover, this Dual-SLIP actuation strategy enables a constant center of mass (CoM) forward speed at leg midstance to be maintained. The resultant gaits have revealed a leg lengthening/shortening strategy that is similar to that adopted by a human when walking over prepared, uneven terrain. Results demonstrate that the CoM trajectories and ground reaction force patterns found with the approach are comparable to the human data found in the biomechanics literature. The trajectories generated by the Dual-SLIP model are also demonstrated to orchestrate a dynamic walking motion with an anthropomorphic humanoid model in simulation over uneven terrain.
