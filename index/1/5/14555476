In this paper, we experiment with a resource consisting of metaphorically annotated proverbs on the task of word-level metaphor recognition. We observe that existing feature sets do not perform well on this data. We design a novel set of features to better capture the peculiar nature of proverbs and we demonstrate that these new features are significantly more effective on the metaphorically dense proverb data.
