This work extends computational learning theory to situations in which concepts vary over time, e.g., system identification of a time-varying plant. We have extended formal definitions of concepts and learning to provide a framework in which an algorithm can track a concept as it evolves over time. Given this framework and focusing on memory-based algorithms, we have derived some PAC-style sample complexity results that determine, for example, when tracking is feasible. We have also used a similar framework and focused on incremental tracking algorithms for which we have derived some bounds on the mistake or error rates for some specific concept classes.
