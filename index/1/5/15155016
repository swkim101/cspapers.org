Line-edge roughness (LER) highly affects the device saturation current and leakage current, which leads to serious device performance degradation. In this paper, we propose the first layout-aware LER model where LER is highly related to the lithographic aerial image fidelity and neighboring geometric proximity. With our new LER model, we perform robust LER aware poly layout optimization to minimize the degradation of device performance, in particular leakage current. The results on 32nm node standard cells show average 91.26% reduction of leakage current and 4.46% improvement of saturation current at the worst case despite 8.86% area penalty.
