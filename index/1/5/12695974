Discussions on what makes user interfaces "natural" or "intuitive" have led researchers to apply Fauconnier and Turner's theory of Conceptual Blends to explain how users rely on familiar and real-world concepts when they learn to use new digital technologies -- as a blend of experiences from the --physical and the "digital" world. This pursuit has multiple challenges of which we address four: The continuous dynamic development of experiences; the multiplicity and complexity involved; the distinction between "real" and "virtual" experiences, and finally applying descriptive concepts predictively. Based on our background in activity theoretical HCI we discuss two cases to nuance the discussion of conceptual blends and HCI. We provide an understanding of conceptual blends beyond one-to-one static blends, and immediately recognizable concepts. We focus on multiplicity, dynamics and learning, and in that we provide a more advanced methodological scaffolding of analyses of conceptual blends, hence we propose that designers need to seed blends in design.
