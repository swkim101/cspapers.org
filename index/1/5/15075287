An approach for fast tracking of arbitrary image features with no prior model and no offline learning stage is presented. Fast tracking is achieved using banks of linear displacement predictors learnt online. A multi-modal appearance model is also learnt on-the-fly that facilitates the selection of subsets of predictors suitable for prediction in the next frame. The approach is demonstrated in real-time on a number of challenging video sequences and experimentally compared to other simultaneous modeling and tracking approaches with favourable results.
