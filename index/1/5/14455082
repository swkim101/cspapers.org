This paper introduces a probabilistic model for multirobot surveillance applications with limited range and possibly faulty sensors. Sensors are described with a footprint and a false negative probability, i.e. the probability of failing to report a target within their sensing range. The model implements a probabilistic extension to our formerly developed deterministic approach for modeling surveillance tasks in large environments with large robot teams known as Graph-Clear. This extension leads to a new algorithm that allows to answer new design and performance questions, namely 1) how many robots are needed to obtain a certain confidence that the environment is free from intruders, and 2) given a certain number of robots, how should they coordinate their actions to minimize their failure rate.
