We are beginning to make use of technology that intervenes in the contents of the communication. Language processing has indeed a large practical potential if we take into account multiple modalities of communication. Multimodality refers to the perception of different co-ordinated media used in delivering a message but also to the combination of various attitudes in relation to communication and information access (e.g. goal-oriented and exploration-oriented). In the paper reference is made to some prototypes developed at IRST, conceived for cultural tourism. In a recent one the specificity is the combination of two forms of navigation taking place at the same time - one in information space, the other in the physical space. Some challenges for the future are discussed toward the end.
