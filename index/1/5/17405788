Video kiosks increasingly contain powerful PC-like embedded processors, allowing them to display video at a high level of quality. Such video display, however, entails significant energy consumption.This paper presents an approach to reducing energy consumption by adapting the CPU clock frequency. In contrast to previous approaches, we exploit the specific behavior of a video kiosk. Because a kiosk plays the same set of movies over and over, we choose a CPU frequency for a given frame based on the computational requirements of the frame that were observed on earlier iterations. We have implemented our approach in the legacy video player MPlayer. On a PC like those that can be found in kiosks, we observe increases in battery lifetime of up to 2 times as compared to running at the maximum CPU frequency on a set of high resolution divx movies.
