Derivation of geometric structures from point clouds is an important step towards scene understanding for mobile robots. In this paper, we present a novel method for segmentation and surface classification of ordered point clouds. Data from RGB-D cameras are used as input. Normal based region growing segments the cloud and point feature descriptors classify each segment. Not only planar segments can be described but also curved surfaces. In an evaluation on indoor scenes we show the performance of our approach as well as give a comparison to state of the art methods.
