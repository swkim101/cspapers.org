On-line programming tests and examinations were administered to approximately 120 first year computer science students in order to evaluate their practical skills. We describe our motivation for on-line testing, outline the technical details of our closed testing environment, and present our observations about student performance. We also compare the effectiveness of on-line tests versus conventional tests, report the problems we encountered and our solutions, relate student opinion regarding the on-line testing experiment, and present some insights gained by this experiment.
