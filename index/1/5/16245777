The role of the computer in engineering practice is ever increasing. The computer performs such tasks as: simple calculations; on line data recording and synthesis; acting as a control unit providing feedback; statistical analysis of large data sets; information retrieval and storage; and the simulation of large complex systems.
 It is imperative that all engineering students be taught to use the computer as a tool to aid in their present and future endeavors. Their education must be such that they can build on this foundation and continue to function effectively in future environments of computer technology taking full advantage of its capabilities.
 Universities must provide guidance and a curriculum making the achievement of this goal possible for students. An up-to-date laboratory facility to support such a program is also a necessity. A continuing education program is the responsibility of institutions of higher learning.
