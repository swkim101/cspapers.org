Some preliminary observations may demonstrate some of man's motivation for using models: Generally science is concerned with causal systems, which are systems the states of which do not depend on future inputs to the system. It is this class of systems which is pretty well understood (differential equations, automata, deterministic or not). The purpose for engaging in science about causal systems is - besides pure curiosity - mainly to aid man's desire to behave in a goal-directed manner.
 Since a modern society has a need for goal-directed behavior of its members, e.g. in problem solving, there is also the need to teach people the associated structures. They need
 - to get to know existing models (knowledge),
 - to learn the way models are used (methods),
 - to get to know the tools for modelling (theories), and
 - to be able to use strategies for developing them (science).
 The introduction may give the impression that we favor a very loose use of the term “model”. This is not so, however. On the contrary since this term is so loosely used presently, it should find a refinement by explication which can be done by examining the associated structures further. That this may not be a waste of effort may have been demonstrated by the central role models play for man's goal-directed behavior.
