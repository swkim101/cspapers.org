In this paper a new decoupled imaged-based control scheme is proposed from projection onto a unit sphere. This control scheme is based on moment invariants to 3D rotational motion. This allows the control of translational motion independently of the rotational one. First, the analytical form of the interaction matrix related to the spherical moments is derived. It is based on the projection of a set of points onto a unit sphere. From the spherical moment, six features are presented to control the full 6 degrees of freedom. Finally, the results are validated through realistic simulation results.
