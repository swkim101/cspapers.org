An experimental general topology local area network based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is described. This network is intended to be used to support multiservice traffic. Thus provision of guarantees of quality of service to various traffic types is an import ant feature of the network. In order to carry on quality of service experiments, one must have both a network which is inherently manageable, and the flexibility y to provide different management strategies.
