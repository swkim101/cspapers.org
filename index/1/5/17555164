In recent years, ASP has been frequently applied for the computation of reasoning problems represented in argumentation-theoretical-terms and has been found an efficient method for determining solutions to problems in Argumentation Theory. My research is concerned with the opposite direction, i.e. with applying Argumentation Theory to ASP in order to explain the solutions to an ASP reasoning problem in a more human-understandable way.Developing such an explanation method also involves to investigate both the exact relationship between different approaches in Argumentation Theory in order to find the most suitable one for explanations and their connection with ASP, in particular with respect to their semantics.
