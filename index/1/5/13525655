This paper describes a plan-recognition program built to explore the theory of endorsements (Cohen, 1983). The program evaluates alternative interpretations of user actions and reasons about which are the most likely explanation of the user's intentions. Uncertainty about the various alternatives was encoded in data structures called endorsements. The paper describes the workings of this program and the successes and limitations of the endorsement-based approach.
