Orgmizational What is the ideal team structure for framework development? How can frameworks be protected against organizational pressures? This yearâ€™s workshop was comprised of many seasoned framework developers with expertise in domains as diverse as graphical user interfaces, telephony, real-time controls and testing. As in prior workshops, we were unable to completely agree on the definition of a framework. We did, however, add some new ideas to the definitions proposed at the OOPSLA 96 frameworks workshop.
