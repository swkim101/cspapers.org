Some phrases can be interpreted either idiomatically (figuratively) or literally in context, and the precise identification of idioms is indispensable for full-fledged natural language processing (NLP). To this end, we have constructed an idiom corpus for Japanese. This paper reports on the corpus and the results of an idiom identification experiment using the corpus. The corpus targets 146 ambiguous idioms, and consists of 102, 846 sentences, each of which is annotated with a literal/idiom label. For idiom identification, we targeted 90 out of the 146 idioms and adopted a word sense disambiguation (WSD) method using both common WSD features and idiom-specific features. The corpus and the experiment are the largest of their kind, as far as we know. As a result, we found that a standard supervised WSD method works well for the idiom identification and achieved an accuracy of 89.25% and 88.86% with/without idiom-specific features and that the most effective idiom-specific feature is the one involving the adjacency of idiom constituents.
