Most approaches to cross language information retrieval assume that resources providing a direct translation between the query and document languages exist. This paper presents research examining the situation where such an assumption is false. Here, an intermediate (or pivot) language provides a means of transitive translation of the query language to that of the document via the pivot, at the cost, however, of introducing much error. The paper reports the novel approach of translating in parallel across multiple intermediate languages and fusing the results. Such a technique removes the error, raising the effectiveness of the tested retrieval system, up to and possibly above the level expected, had a direct translation route existed. Across a number of retrieval situations and combinations of languages, the approach proves to be highly effective.
