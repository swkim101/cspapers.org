If the graph is large, this approach is infeasible due to its high computational cost. The goal of this study is to find top-k Page\-Rank score nodes efficiently for a given graph without sacrificing accuracy. Our solution, F-Rank, is based on two ideas: (1) It iteratively estimates lower/upper bounds of Page\-Rank scores, and (2) It constructs subgraphs in each iteration by pruning unnecessary nodes and edges to identify top-k nodes. Our theoretical analysis shows that F-Rank guarantees result exactness. Experiments show that F-Rank finds top-k nodes much faster than the original approach.
