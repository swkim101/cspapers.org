This paper presents an approach to exploit the richer information of sensor data provided by 3d laser rangefinders for the purpose of person tracking. Introduced is a method to adapt the observation model of a particle filter, to identify partial and full occlusions of a person, to determine the amount of occlusion behind an obstacle, and the occluding obstacle itself. This is done by tracing rays from positions near the person to the sensor and determining whether the ray hits an obstacle. The laser range data is represented using a voxel grid, which facilitates efficient retrieval and data reduction. As our experiments show, our proposed tracking approach is able to reliably keep track of a person in real-time, even when only partially visible, when moving in uneven terrain, or when the person passes closely another person of different size.
