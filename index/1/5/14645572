In this paper, we propose a new method for the restoration of deteriorated images by using multiple cameras. In outdoor environment, it is often the case that scenes taken by the cameras are hard to see because of adherent noises on the surface of the lens-protecting glass of the cameras. Our proposed method analyses multiple camera images describing the same scene, and synthesizes an image in which adherent noises are eliminated.
