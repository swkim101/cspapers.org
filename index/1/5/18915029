Affordable cloud computing technologies allow users to efficiently store, and manage their Personal Health Records (PHRs) and share with their caregivers or physicians. This in turn improves the quality of healthcare services, and lower health care cost. However, serious security and privacy concerns emerge because people upload their personal information and PHRs to the public cloud. Data encryption provides privacy protection of medical information but it is challenging to utilize encrypted data. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving disease treatment, complication prediction scheme (PDTCPS), which allows authorized users to conduct searches for disease diagnosis, personalized treatments, and prediction of potential complications. $PDTCPS$ uses a tree-based structure to boost search efficiency, a wildcard approach to support fuzzy keyword search, and a Bloom-filter to improve search accuracy and storage efficiency. In addition, our design also allows health care providers and the public cloud to collectively generate aggregated training models for disease diagnosis, personalized treatments and complications prediction. Moreover, our design provides query unlinkability and hides both search & access patterns. Finally, our evaluation results using two UCI datasets show that our scheme is more efficient and accurate than two existing schemes.
