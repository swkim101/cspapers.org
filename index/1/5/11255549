Odometry calibration is a first and essential step to do for a successful navigation because most of control algorithms are based on odomety information. Odometry error can be categorized as systematic and non-systematic error. In this paper, we suggest a novel method to calibrate systematic error using inherent home positioning capability of home cleaning robot. The method is designed for a differential drive type and take advantage of Augmented extended Kalman Fil- ter(AKF) Algorithm to estimates systematic error parameters. Our approach has both characteristics of on-line and off-line. By simulation and experiment, we evaluate the method and the result shows that the proposed method gives odometry error reduction by several times.
