With the recent explosive growth of the number of videos on the Web, it becomes more important to facilitate users' demand for locating their preferred event clips in the lengthy and voluminous programs. Although there has been a great deal of study on generic event detection in recent years, the performance of existing approaches is still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework for general event detection. The key idea is that we utilize the synchronous comments to segment the video into clips with semantic text analysis, while taking into account the relationship between the users who write the comments. By borrowing the power of "the wisdom of crowds", we experimentally demonstrate that our approach can effectively detect video events.
