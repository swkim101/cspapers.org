Abstractâ€”Intrusion Detection is one of network security area of technology main research directions. Data mining technology will be applied to Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), may automatically discover the new pattern from the massive network data, to reduce the workload of the manual compilation intrusion behavior patterns and normal behavior patterns. This article reviewed the current intrusion detection technology and the data mining technology briefly.Focus on data mining algorithm in anomaly detection and misuse detection of specific applications. For misuse detection,the main study the classification algorithm; For anomaly detection, the main study the pattern comparison and the cluster algorithm. In pattern comparison to analysis deeply the association rules and sequence rules . Finally, has analysised the difficulties which the current data mining algorithm in intrusion detection applications faced at present , and has indicated the next research direction.
