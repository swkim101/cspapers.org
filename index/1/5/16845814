This work deals with navigation of an omni-directional mobile robot with active caster wheels. Initially, the posture of the omni-directional mobile robot is calculated by using the odometry information. Next, the position accuracy of the mobile robot is measured through comparison of the odometry information and the external sensor measurement. Finally, for successful navigation of the mobile robot, a motion planning algorithm that employs kinematic redundancy resolution method is proposed. Through experiments for multiple obstacles and multiple moving obstacles, the feasibility of the proposed navigation algorithm was verified.
