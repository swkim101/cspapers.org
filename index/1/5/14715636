Jeffrey Abstract for Computing the ith Letter of v " (u) ShaJlit and David Swab x Let C be a f&e alphabet, and let cp : C' + C' be a homomorphism, i.e., a mapping satisfying cp(sy) = cp(z)cp(y) for all z,y E 2'. Let a E C, and let i 2 1, rz 2 0 be integers. We give the first efficient algorithm for computing the ith letter of q " (a). Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the input, i.e.? polynomial in logn, log i: and the description size of 'p. Our algorithm can be easily modified to give the distribution of letters in the prefix of length i of q " (o). There are applications of our algorithm to computer graphics and biological modelling. If we consider finite-state transducers instead of homomorphisms, the corresponding problem is EXPTIMEhard. 1 Introduction Let C be a finite alphabet. A homomorphism is a map p from C' to C' such that cp(zy) = cp(z)y(y) for all
