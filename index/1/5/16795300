This paper describes Felix - a File Server for an experimental distributed multicomputer system. Felix is designed to support a variety of file systems, virtual memory, and database applications with access being provided by a local area network. Its interface combines block oriented data access with a high degree of crash resistance and a comprehensive set of primitives for controlling data sharing and consistency. An extended set of access modes allows increased concurrency over conventional systems.
