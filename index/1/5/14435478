OLAP query processing is critical for enterprise grids. Capitalizing on our experience with the ParGRES database cluster, we propose a middleware solution, GParGRES, which exploits database replication and interand intra-query parallelism to efficiently support OLAP queries in a grid. GParGRES has been partially implemented as database grid services on Grid5000. We give preliminary experimental results obtained with two clusters of Grid5000 using queries of the TPC-H Benchmark. The results show linear or almost linear speedup in query execution, as more nodes are added in all tested configurations.
