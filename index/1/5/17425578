FlexRay is gaining wide acceptance as the next generation bus protocol for automotive networks. This has led to tremendous research interest in techniques for scheduling signals, which are generated by real-time applications, on the FlexRay bus. Signals are first packed together into frames at the application-level and the frames are then transmitted over the bus. To ensure reliability of frames in the presence of faults, frames must be retransmitted over the bus but this comes at the cost of higher bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel frame packing method for FlexRay bus. Our method computes the required number of retransmissions of frames that ensures the specified reliability goal. The proposed frame packing method also ensures that none of the signals violates its deadline and that the desired reliability goal for guaranteeing fault-tolerance is met at the minimum bandwidth cost. Extensive experiments on synthetic as well as a industrial case study demonstrate the benefits of our method.
