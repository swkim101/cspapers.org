This paper presents a concept of an upper-limb power assist intelligent exoskeleton with visual information as a second stage of the research on power-assist exoskeleton systems in order to help daily activities of physically weak persons. The proposed exoskeleton assists not only the motion of the user but also the perception of the user using sensors and a stereo camera. In the proposed power-assist method, the assisted user's motion can be modified based on the environmental information obtained by the sensors and the camera if problems are found in the user's motion. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent exoskeleton was evaluated by experiments.
