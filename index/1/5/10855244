Grid applications often need to distribute large amounts of data efficiently from one cluster to multiple others (multicast). Existing methods usually arrange nodes in optimized tree structures, based on external network monitoring data. This dependence on monitoring data, however, severely impacts both ease of deployment and adaptivity to dynamically changing network conditions.
 In this paper, we present Multicast Optimizing Bandwidth (MOB), a high-throughput multicast approach, inspired by the BitTorrent protocol. With MOB, data transfers are initiated by the receivers that try to steal data from peer clusters. Instead of using potentially outdated monitoring data, MOB automatically adapts to the currently achievable bandwidth ratios.
 Our experimental evaluation compares MOB to both the BitTorrent protocol and to our previous approach, Balanced Multicasting, the latter optimizing multicast trees based on external monitoring data. We show that MOB outperforms the BitTorrent protocol. MOB is competitive with Balanced Multicasting as long as the network bandwidth remains stable. With dynamically changing bandwith, MOB outperforms Balanced Multicasting by wide margins.
