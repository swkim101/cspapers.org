Online learning is one of the most common forms of neural network training. We present an analysis of online learning from finite training sets for non-linear networks (namely, soft-committee machines), advancing the theory to more realistic learning scenarios. Dynamical equations are derived for an appropriate set of order parameters; these are exact in the limiting case of either linear networks or infinite training sets. Preliminary comparisons with simulations suggest that the theory captures some effects of finite training sets, but may not yet account correctly for the presence of local minima.
