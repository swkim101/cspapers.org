Mobile video consumption establishes as a massively growing market. To guarantee an acceptable quality of experience to the end user, current studies try to improve data transmissions on air interfaces. However, the bottleneck in cellular mobile networks is the traversal of the infrastructure. A paradigm to circumvent this fact and to increase the system's capacity is given by device-to-device communication in combination with proximity detection. Those networks promise scalability and performance improvements in utilizing scarce resources. This principle is easy to integrate into an existing mobile peer-to-peer video streaming system. In this study, we present measurements on application level to determine the performance that a smart device contributes to different wireless networks. The results outline that content uploading from smart devices is negligible in cellular networks, but shows acceptable performance in WiFi networks. This evaluation is the foundation to build a proximity enhanced video streaming system for mobile devices.
