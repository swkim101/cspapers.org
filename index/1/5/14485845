The classical Clarke model of mobile radio reception assumes a constant mobile velocity. We, in this paper, relax the assumption of constant mobile velocity to allow the mobile to have constant acceleration and derive expression for the non-stationary autocorrelation function of the channel process in general 2-dimensional (2D) scattering environments. Under suitable assumptions, an expression for Wigner-Ville spectrum is obtained in isotropic scattering environment which suggests that the Wigner-Ville spectrum is a natural generalization of the Clarke's model to constant mobile acceleration scenario.
