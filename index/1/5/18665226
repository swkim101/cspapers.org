The MACCEPA (Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable Equilibrium Position Actuator) is an electric actuator of which the compliance and equilibrium position are fully independently controllable and both are set by a dedicated servomotor. In this paper an improvement of the actuator is proposed where the torque-angle curve and consequently the stiffness-angle curve can be modified by choosing an appropriate shape of a profile disk, which replaces the lever arm of the former design. The actuator has a large joint angle, torque and stiffness range and these properties can be made beneficial for safe human robot interaction and the construction of energy efficient walking, hopping and running robots. The ability to store and release energy is shown by simulations on a 1DOF hopping robot. Its hopping height is much higher compared to a configuration in which the same motor is used in a traditional stiff setup. The stiffness of the actuator has a stiffening characteristic so the leg stiffness resembles more a linear stiffness as found in humans.
