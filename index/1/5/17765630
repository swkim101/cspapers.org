Linear hashing is a hashing in which the address space may grow or shrink dynamically. A file or a table may then support any number of insertions or deletions without access or memory load performance deterioration. A record in the file is, in general, found in one access, while the load may stay practically constant up to 90 %. A record in a table is found in a mean of 1.7 accesses, while the load is constantly 80 %. No other algorithms attaining such a performance are known.
