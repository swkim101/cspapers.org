Part-based trackers are effective in exploiting local details of the target object for robust tracking. In contrast to most existing part-based methods that divide all kinds of target objects into a number of fixed rectangular patches, in this paper, we propose a novel framework in which a set of deformable patches dynamically collaborate on tracking of non-rigid objects. In particular, we proposed a shape-preserved kernelized correlation filter (SP-KCF) which can accommodate target shape information for robust tracking. The SP-KCF is introduced into the level set framework for dynamic tracking of individual patches. In this manner, our proposed deformable patches are target-dependent, have the capability to assume complex topology, and are deformable to adapt to target variations. As these deformable patches properly capture individual target subregions, we exploit their photometric discrimination and shape variation to reveal the trackability of individual target subregions, which enables the proposed tracker to dynamically take advantage of those subregions with good trackability for target likelihood estimation. Finally the shape information of these deformable patches enables accurate object contours to be computed as the tracking output. Experimental results on the latest public sets of challenging sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
