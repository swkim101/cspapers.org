This paper presents a technique for dividing a network of interconnecting components into groups of components so that the total number of interconnecting wires between groups tends to be minimized. The method of solution is noniterative, and provides good solutions using small amounts of computer time. The solution is based on the use of an electrical analogue which may be useful in aiding other design automation tasks.
