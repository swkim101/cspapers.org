Risk and benefit are two implicit key factors to determine accesses in secure information sharing. Recent researches have shown that they can be explicitly quantified and used to improve the flexibility in information systems. This paper introduces the motivation and a technical design of Quantified riSk and Benefit adaptive Access Control (QSBAC) to strengthen the security of information sharing. The paper also introduces the key issues to design policies in QSBAC.
