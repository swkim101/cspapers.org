Plans for programming a computer model of human motivation, for use in clinical applications, are described. A system based on parallel cooperating goal-processes is assumed, with the will interpreted as the resource allocator between them. Wishes and wants are distinguished on the basis of resources allocated for action. An interpretation of mental effort in terms of computational work is suggested. The generation of actions through planning, decision-making and forming intentions are discussed in relation to 'regnant' goals. The dual nature of motivation manifested in active and reactive aspects of behaviour are emphasised.
