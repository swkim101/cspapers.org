In view of the deficiency of the traditional methods, a BP neural network model is proposed to evaluate water quality. The proposed model was applied to evaluate the water quality of 20 sections in Suzhou river. The evaluation result was compared with that of the RBF neural network method and the reported results in Suzhou river. It indicated that the performance of proposed neural network model is practically feasible in tha application of water quality assessment and its operation is simple
