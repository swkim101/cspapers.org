VM/4 is a virtual machine facility designed and implemented for NEC's ACOS-4 general purpose computer series. Using this facility, multiple ACOS-t~ series computer systems can be run on a single ACOS-4 computer system. For this facility, the VM/4 architecture has been newly designed, extending the ACOS-4 architecture• Its major design emphasis is to at tain high performance• First, VM/~ has an integrated virtual machine system structure. In this system, general user's jobs can be executed directly under the native operating system, in parallel with virtual machines, without incurring virtual machine overhead. Furthermore, jobs on the virtual machine can be run with minimum overhead time. This high performance derives from highly effective and efficient hardware/firmware• Overhead amounts ranging from 3 96 to 7 96, compared to elapsed time on native machine, are thereby obtained. This paper describes the VM/t~ design policy and compares it with other virtual machine systems• An outline of the VM/4 architecture is provided, along with a summary of its implementation on ACOS System t~50. Finally, the VM/4 performance measurement results and the overhead factors are described•
