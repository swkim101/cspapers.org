The output from the massively parallel scientific simulations is so voluminous and complex that advanced visualization technologies are necessary to interpret the calculated results. Even though visualization technology has progressed significantly in recent years, we are barely capable of visualizing and analyzing terascale data to its full extent, and petascale datasets are on the horizon. This workshop aims at addressing this pressing issue by fostering communication between visualization researchers and practitioners. The workshop attendees will be introduced to the latest and greatest research innovations in large data visualization and also help direct further research direction through an open discussion session.
