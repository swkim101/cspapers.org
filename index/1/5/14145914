The need to detect faults, permanent, _ . . . transient and The method is general and application independent, i.e., it does not depend on the MCU used. The monitor circuit will differ of course since it depends on the error patterns generated by the faults considered. In this sense it differs from the design for concurrent error detection presented in [YEN 851. That paper followed the path of redesigning a specific MCU, the AMD2910, by adding redundancy in the form of coding and duplication. Error Detection Method for Microprogrammed
