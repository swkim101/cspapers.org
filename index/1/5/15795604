Subject covariate data were collected on 1, 072 pairs of FERET images for analysis in a human face verification experiment. The subject data included information about facial hair, bangs, eyes, gender, and age. The verification experiment was replicated at seven different false alarm rates ranging from 1/10, 000 to 1/100. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was fit to the binary outcomes indicating correct verification. Statistically significant main effects for bangs, eyes, gender, and age were found. The effect of the log false positive rate on verification success was found to interact significantly with bangs, gender, and age. These results have important implications for future evaluation of biometrics, and the GLMM methodology used here is shown to be effective and informative for this sort of data.
