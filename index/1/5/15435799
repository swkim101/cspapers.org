The blogosphere has unique structural and temporal properties since blogs are typically used as communication media among human individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that captures the structure and temporal dynamics of blog communities. In our framework, a community is a set of blogs that communicate with each other triggered by some events (such as a news article). The community is represented by its structure and temporal dynamics: a community graph indicates how often one blog communicates with another, and a community intensity indicates the activity level of the community that varies over time. Our method, community factorization, extracts such communities from the blogosphere, where the communication among blogs is observed as a set of subgraphs (i.e., threads of discussion). This community extraction is formulated as a factorization problem in the framework of constrained optimization, in which the objective is to best explain the observed interactions in the blogosphere over time. We further provide a scalable algorithm for computing solutions to the constrained optimization problems. Extensive experimental studies on both synthetic and real blog data demonstrate that our technique is able to discover meaningful communities that are not detectable by traditional methods.
