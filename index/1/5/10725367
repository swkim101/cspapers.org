We highlight the pessimism of independently calculating cache-related preemption delays (CRPDs) and Cache Persistence Reload Overhead (CPRO). We propose a first solution to reduce that pessimism by integrating the calculation of CRPDs and CPROs. However, the proposed result is limited to the UCB-union and CPRO-union approaches. Two methods that are known to be simple but pessimistic. As future work, we will formally prove the correctness of the proposed approach and extend it to more evolved methods for the CRPD and CPRO computation. A thorough evaluation of the proposed result will also be conducted in order to quantify the actual gain over the state-of-the-art, as it is expected that the identified problem and its impact on the response time analysis may be very context dependent.
