The CompActâ„¢ actuator features a clutch mechanism placed in parallel with its passive series elastic transmission element and can therefore benefit from the advantages of both series elastic actuators (SEA) and rigid actuators. The actuator is capable of effectively managing the storage and release of the potential energy of the compliant element by the appropriate control of the clutch subsystem. Controlling the timing of the energy storage/release in the elastic element is exploited for improving motion control in this research. This paper analyses how this class of actuation systems can be used to maximize the link velocity of the joint. The dynamic model of the joint is derived and an optimal control strategy is proposed to identify optimal input reference profiles for the actuator (motor position/velocity and clutch activation timing) which permit the link velocity maximization. The effect of compliance of the joint on the performance of the system is studied and the optimal stiffness is analyzed.
