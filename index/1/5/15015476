This paper presents an approach for labeling objects in 3D scenes. We introduce HMP3D, a hierarchical sparse coding technique for learning features from 3D point cloud data. HMP3D classifiers are trained using a synthetic dataset of virtual scenes generated using CAD models from an online database. Our scene labeling system combines features learned from raw RGB-D images and 3D point clouds directly, without any hand-designed features, to assign an object label to every 3D point in the scene. Experiments on the RGB-D Scenes Dataset v.2 demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to label indoor scenes containing both small tabletop objects and large furniture pieces.
