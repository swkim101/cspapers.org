Redundantly actuated mobile robots using conventional wheels need a precise coordination of their actuators in order to guarantee a safe and precise motion without generating high internal forces and slippage. Using the instantaneous centre of rotation (ICR) of the chassis to describe this motion is a well established method. But the ICR is a mathematical concept which is hardly achieved on a real robot. This paper addresses the problem of ICR estimation of a non-holonomic omnidirectional mobile robot using conventional wheels. Instead of estimating the ICR in the working space, our approach estimates it in the actuators' space. The algorithm is presented in its general form and then adapted for a particular robot. The use of the algorithm with other omnidirectional robots is also discussed. Results from extensive testing done in simulation as well as with a real robot are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
