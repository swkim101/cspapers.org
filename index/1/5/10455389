Adapting Seeding is a key algorithmic challenge of influence maximization in social networks. One seeks to select among certain available nodes in a network, and then, adaptively, among neighbors of those nodes as they become available, in order to maximize influence in the overall network. Despite recent strong approximation results [Seeman and Singer 2013; Badanidiyuru et al. 2015], very little is known about the problem when nodes can take on different activation costs. Surprisingly, designing adaptive seeding algorithms that can appropriately incentivize users with heterogeneous activation costs introduces fundamental challenges that do not exist in the simplified version of the problem. In this paper we study the approximability of adaptive seeding algorithms that incentivize nodes with heterogeneous activation costs. We first show a tight inapproximability result which applies even for a very restricted version of the problem. We then complement this inapproximability with a constant-factor approximation for general submodular functions, showing that the difficulties caused by the stochastic nature of the problem can be overcome. In addition, we show stronger approximation results for additive influence functions and cases where the nodes' activation costs constitute a small fraction of the budget.
