Slip-detecting tactile sensors are essential for achieving human-like gripping motion with a robot hand. In previous research, we developed a flexible, thin and lightweight slip sensor that exploits the characteristics of pressure conductive rubber. However, using this sensor, it was difficult to distinguish between object slip and a change in the normal force. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated a method for identifying object slip by analyzing the frequency components of the output signal from the sensor. As a result, we found that high-frequency components of 1 kHz or more are included in the complex voltage signal generated by object slip. Therefore, by using this high-frequency component, we developed a simple sensor that distinguished between both contact and initial slip with high sensitivity.
