Low-power networked devices, such as sensors and actuators, are becoming a vital part of our everyday infrastructure. Being networked, the continued development of these systems needs involvement from the networking community. We present a framework for simulation, experimentation, and evaluation of routing mechanisms for low-power IPv6 networking. The framework provides a detailed simulation environment for low-power routing mechanisms, and allows the system to be directly uploaded to a physical testbed for experimental measurements.
