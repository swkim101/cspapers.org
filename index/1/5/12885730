This paper proposes Listen-to-Nose, a phone-based system that detects and records when and where a person's nose-related symptoms, such as sneezing and runny nose, occur in everyday settings. It is hoped that this system can be used to collect reference data for doctors to diagnose the cause of these symptoms.
