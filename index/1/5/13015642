This paper introduces a unique hexapedal locomotion platform tagged TriBot as potential agents for swarm robotic systems. We investigate the differences in performance and kinematic characteristics of two identical prototypes of this mobile robot manufactured using different design and fabrication methods and materials. Among alternatives for mass production, we focus on cut-and-assemble (CA) acrylic bodies and cut-and-fold (CF) origami-inspired polyester structures as two promising methods for manufacturing these agents. Through a comprehensive comparison between the two prototypes, advantages and disadvantages of each robot development approach are presented. This information will enable the selection of the most appropriate robotic platform according to environmental and operational task specifications.
