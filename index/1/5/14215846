We propose SLA-NFV, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) aware framework, for building high-performance NFV, focusing on fulfilling SLAs of service subscribers (or tenants). SLA-NFV leverages a hybrid infrastructure with both software and programmable hardware to enhance NFVâ€™s capability with respect to various SLAs. Evaluations show that a hybrid service chain could reduce latency by up to 60% compared with a pure soft- ware service chain.
