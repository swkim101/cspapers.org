#Microposts2015, the 5th workshop on 'Making Sense of Microposts', is summarised by the sub-theme: 'big things come in small packages'. The workshop was borne out of research we were each carrying out as microblogging platforms became increasingly popular, and their value as a publishing platform and the data generated as a result began to be recognised. This phenomenon continues to grow, as microblogs provide a low-effort means of publishing information within private, but moreso public, fora, giving a voice to all in all arenas.
