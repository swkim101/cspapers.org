The Semantic Web (SWeb) is a vision - actually, a number of visions - which is beginning to show some signs of potential reality. The core of the vision is a synergy between machine-accessible knowledge and the global reach of the Web. The deployment of knowledge technologies on a planet-wide open network brings new challenges and opportunities, many of them not yet fully realized. This talk briefly surveys the current state of play in SWeb standards and technology, including some of the rather heated controversies, and tries to give a high-level view of some of these challenges and opportunities. Some traditional hard problems in KM may largely evaporate; but new ones will take their place.
