Minimally invasive Surgery (MIS) is one of the most challenging fields for robot designers due to the limited size of the access points, to the high miniaturization level and to the dexterity needed for performing surgical tasks. For this reason, the integration of actuators should proceed in parallel with the identification of the most effective transmission mechanisms and kinematics. Conversely, only a few microfabrication technologies are adequate for developing small size mechanisms with safe operation in the human body. In this paper a SMA actuated, miniaturized, origami-enabled, parallel structure is presented as a versatile module for novel robotic tool in MIS, the parallel structure has been combined with a twisting module and a gripper obtaining a 4-DOFs on board actuated end-effector.
