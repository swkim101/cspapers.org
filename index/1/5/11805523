Design criteria- α, β and γ parameters- for an arrayed touch-sensor are proposed. Pattern recognition schemes for static images are proposed and their performances are evaluated in terms of proposed criteria. Possible causes of deteriorating the image information are considered; their effects to the pattern recognition are also investigated.
