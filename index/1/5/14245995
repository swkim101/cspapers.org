Three dimensional (3D) integration attempts to address challenges and limitations of new technologies such as interconnect delay and power consumption. However, high power density and increased temperature in 3D architectures accelerate wearout failure mechanisms such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI). In this paper we present VAWOM (Variation Aware WearOut Management), an approach that reduces the NBTI effect by exploiting temperature and process variation in 3D architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of VAWOM on a two-layer 3D architecture with 4x4 cores on the first layer and 4x4 last level caches on the second layer, and show that VAWOM reduces NBTI induced threshold voltage degradation by 30% with only a small degradation in performance.
