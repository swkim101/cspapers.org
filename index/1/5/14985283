We investigate the applicability of IEEE 802.11ac for entertainment low-latency show control systems (to orchestrate free-riding vehicles in a theme-park environment) by experimentally characterizing the indoor throughput and jitter performance of 802.11ac using statistical analysis. 802.11ac is the successor of 802.11n that provides higher throughput by incorporating wider channels, more spatial streams and denser modulation. We show that multiple linear regression provides valuable insight in the influence of 802.11ac's independent features and their combinations on performance, for various links and interference scenarios. Finally, we show that 802.11ac could be used for not only delivering high throughput for multimedia streaming but also supports applications requiring minimal jitter variance in the setup investigated.
