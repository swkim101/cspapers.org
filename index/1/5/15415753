Most undergraduate curriculums in CS include at least a one semester study of data base management systems. In this paper, we take a closer look at a DBMS course we have offered recently and elaborate on a world wide web based database project in this course; it integrates a number of ideas not only from within DBMS but across other CS areas. We discuss the objectives underlying the design of the project and the ways in which these projects provide students with a feel for the organization and use of contemporary commercial database applications.
