With the rise of digital video consumptions, contextual video advertising demands have been increasing in recent years. This paper presents a novel video advertising system that selects relevant text ads for a given video scene by automatically identifying the situation of the scene. The situation information of video scenes is inferred from available video scripts. Experimental results show that the use of the situation information enhances the accuracy of ad retrieval for video scenes. The proposed system represents one of the pioneer video advertising systems using contextual information obtained from video scripts.
