We initiate a study of when the value of mathematical relaxations such as linear and semi-definite programs for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is approximately preserved when restricting the instance to a sub-instance induced by a small random subsample of the variables.
 Let <i>C</i> be a family of CSPs such as 3SAT, Max-Cut, etc., and let Π be a mathematical program that is a <i>relaxation</i> for <i>C</i>, in the sense that for every instance <i>P</i> ∈ <i>C</i>, Π(<i>P</i>) is a number in [0, 1] upper bounding the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints of <i>P</i>. Loosely speaking, we say that <i>subsampling holds</i> for <i>C</i> and Π if for every sufficiently dense instance <i>P</i> ∈ <i>C</i> and every ε > 0, if we let <i>P</i>' be the instance obtained by restricting <i>P</i> to a sufficiently large constant number of variables, then Π(<i>P</i>') ∈ (1 ± ε)Π(<i>P</i>). We say that <i>weak subsampling</i> holds if the above guarantee is replaced with Π(<i>P</i>') = 1 − θ(γ) whenever Π(<i>P</i>) = 1 − γ, where θ hides only absolute constants. We obtain both positive and negative results, showing that:
 1. Subsampling holds for the BasicLP and BasicSDP programs. BasicSDP is a variant of the semi-definite program considered by Raghavendra (2008), who showed it gives an optimal approximation factor for every constraint-satisfaction problem under the unique games conjecture. BasicLP is the linear programming analog of BasicSDP.
 2. For tighter versions of BasicSDP obtained by adding additional constraints from the Lasserre hierarchy, <i>weak</i> subsampling holds for CSPs of unique games type.
 3. There are non-unique CSPs for which even weak subsampling fails for the above tighter semi-definite programs. Also there are unique CSPs for which (even weak) subsampling fails for the Sherali-Adams <i>linear programming</i> hierarchy.
 As a corollary of our weak subsampling for strong semi-definite programs, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm to certify that <i>random geometric graphs</i> (of the type considered by Feige and Schechtman, 2002) of max-cut value 1 − γ have a cut value at most 1 − γ/10. More generally, our results give an approach to obtaining average-case algorithms for CSPs using semi-definite programming hierarchies.
