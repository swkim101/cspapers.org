A capability system which supports very small objects can achieve flexible and efficient protection. This paper presents a scheme for representing both large and small entitles In a computation, down to integers and character strings, as objects. This is achieved by a generalization of tagged memory to encompass extended data types; and by the use of variable-length capabilities, which can be very short if they are close to the object they reference. As developed here, the design assumes a single, systemwide virtual-address space, and a stack architecture; but it could probably be modified for use In other environments.
