Personal photo collections are large and growing rapidly. Today, it is difficult to search such a photo collection for people who occur in them since it is tedious to manually associate face tags in photos. The key idea is to learn face models for friends and family of the user using tagged photos in a social graph such as Facebook as training examples. These face models are then used to automatically tag photos in the collection, thereby making it more searchable and easier to organize. To illustrate this idea we have developed a Windows app called AutoTag 'n Search My Photos. In this demo paper we describe the architecture, user interaction and controls, and our initial learnings from deploying the app.
