The Better-Than-Worst-Case (BTW) design methodology is well-known for its potential to improve circuit energy efficiency, performance, and reliability. However, most existing methods do not provide sufficiently scalable solutions. Thus, we propose a new technique, C-Mine, which combines two scalable techniques, data mining and SAT solving, to provide scale-up solutions. Data mining can efficiently extract patterns from an enormous data set, and SAT solving is famous for its scalable verification. The experimental results show that, compared to a recent publication, C-Mine can achieve compatible performance with an additional 5% energy savings, and 50x speedup for bigger benchmarks on average.
