How effective is stemming? Text normalization? Stemming experiments test two hypotheses: one term (+stemmer) or two (–stemmer). The truth lies somewhere in between. The correlations, ρ, between a word and its variants (e.g., + s, + ly, +uppercase) tend to be small (refuting the one term hypothesis), but non-negligible (refuting the two term hypothesis). Moreover, ρ varies systematically depending on the words involved; it is relatively large for a good keyword, ρ(hostage , hostages) ∼∼0. 5, and small for pairs with little content, ρ(anytime, Anytime) ∼∼0, or conflicting content, ρ(continental , Continental) ∼∼0.
