Present times are the best of times for the computer and electronics industry. It was not always that way. In 1971 the computer and electronics industry was in one of its worst years. As a young graduate from Stanford University with a fresh M.S. in Electrical Engineering, I could not find a suitable job. So I decided to go back to Stanford to continue graduate studies beyond a Masters, still not sure if I wanted to do a Ph.D. I talked to one of the Stanford professors for doing some project for the Engineer degree which is a terminal degree for doing more than Masters but not doing thesis research. The professor I talked to was Edward S. Davidson. I told him that I am just an engineer, I don’t want to do Ph.D. research. In reality I had no idea what Ph.D. research involved since my MS. degree did not require a thesis. In that summer of 1971, Davidson gave me some papers on pipelining. In about a month or two, I wrote down some simple ideas extending the elegant reservation table and scheduling method that Davidson had devised. I handed him the hand written paper explaining how one can modify the reservation tables to get a desired schedule. This is when he asked me, “do you know what research is?” I was still not sure what it was, and I told him so. In fact, I told him this is why I was doing an Engineer degree, and not a Ph.D. degree. That is when he pointed to my papers and told that what I was doing was in fact research! He told me if I continued along the same path, I could have a Ph.D. thesis. I was finally convinced. And so I had a Ph.D. thesis topic and an advisor. Now that I am a Professor myself, I do occasionally use this method to convince a reluctant young engineer to pursue Ph.D.
