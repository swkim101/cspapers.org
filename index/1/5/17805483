The proposed solution in the form of a conversational intelligent tutoring system, called DeepTutor, has been developed as a web application that is accessible 24/7 through a browser from any device connected to the Internet. The success of several large scale experiments with high-school students using DeepTutor is a solid proof that conversational intelligent tutoring at scale over the web is possible.
