Monitoring energy consumption of applications is crucial for energy optimisation and improvements in software systems. With the recent emphasis on energy efficiency, it is vital that software engineers have an understanding of the energy consumed by the code they write. In this paper, we present Jolinar, a tool that bridges the gap between energy measurements and accessibility to software engineers and even end-users. The tool builds on top of recent energy models to provide an accurate, light and easy-to-use interface for energy measurements. The target audience of Jolinar is both software engineers and non-technical end-users who want to monitor their applications' energy footprint. We show that end-users can use Jolinar's GUI to determine the energy consumed by the software they are using, and software engineers can use the tool to analyse energy consumption of systems to make energy-conscious decisions.
