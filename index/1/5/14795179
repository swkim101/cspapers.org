The problem of visual tracking of multiple objects is considered in this paper. Special emphasis is devoted to the case when two or more objects overlap with respect to the visual system causing occlusion. The algorithm is based on the Kalman filtering and binary space partition tree representations of the objects geometry. The real-time implementation of the algorithm is experimentally tested for the case of visual tracking of two objects using two cameras.
