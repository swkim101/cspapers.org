We set forth general techniques for managing discourse in an intelligent tutor. These techniques are being implemented in a structure that dynamically reasons about the discourse, a student's response, and the tutor's move. The structure is flexible, domain-independent, and designed to be rebuilt - decision points and machine actions are modifiable through a visual editor. We discuss this formal reasoning structure and its application in an intelligent tutor.
