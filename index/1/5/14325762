We present an evaluation methodology and data for large scale video-based 3D reconstruction. We evaluate the effects of several parameters and draw conclusions that can be useful for practical systems operating in uncontrolled environments. Unlike the benchmark datasets used for the binocular stereo and multi-view reconstruction evaluations, which were collected under well-controlled conditions, our datasets are captured outdoors using video cameras mounted on a moving vehicle. As a result, the videos are much more realistic and include phenomena such as exposure changes from viewing both bright and dim surfaces, objects at varying distances from the camera, and objects of varying size and degrees of texture. The dataset includes ground truth models and precise camera pose information. We also present an evaluation methodology applicable to reconstructions of large scale environments. We evaluate the accuracy and completeness of reconstructions obtained by two fast, visibility-based depth map fusion algorithms as parameters vary.
