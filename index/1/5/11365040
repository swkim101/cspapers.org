In this paper, we relook at the problem of pronunciation of English words using native phone set. Specifically, we investigate methods of pronouncing English words using Telugu phoneset in the context of Telugu Text-to-Speech. We compare phone-phone substitution and wordphone mapping for pronunciation of English words using Telugu phones. We are not considering other than native language phoneset in all our experiments. This differentiates our approach from other works in polyglot speech synthesis.
