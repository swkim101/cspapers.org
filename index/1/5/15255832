The 370-XA channel-subsystem architecture represents an evolutionary and significant extension of the System/370 channel architecture. This paper examines the programming-machine interface of the 370-XA channel subsystem and how it was designed to meet the requirements called for by the evolution of IBM's large-scale systems. In particular, emphasis has been placed upon meeting the needs of multiprocessing, maintaining availability, and supporting large I/O configurations while at the same time preserving compatibility for running System/370 channel programs.
