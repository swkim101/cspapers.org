LIPP (Link√∂ping Image Parallell Processor) is a multiprocessor system intended mainly for image analysis and image processing but even other computing tasks where large amount of data should be manipulated in forms of matrices, such as weather forecasts or other related problems namely systems of differential equations. The processors within the processor array are of bit-serial type with the capability of directly processing data with wordlengths in the range of 1 bit to 32 bits in one bit increments without time penalty. Bit-serial operation gives the possibility of designing suprisingly fast algorithms. To each processor is a fairly large memory (64 Kbit) associated. A processor can instantly reach 8 neighboring memories through an interconnecting network. The processor array whose size is thought to be 16 by 16 it running in SIMD mode. In this way memory access collisions can be minimized. Image and matrix data are mapped in the memory space so that each memory holds a subimage. We call this mapping distributed processor topology. Because of the memory mapping and interconnection network neighborhood operations such as two dimensional convolution are easily performed.
