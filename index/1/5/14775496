This poster presents the work done to monitor the structural health of a Rome B1 underground construction site through a battery-powered Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). We illustrate the specific requirements and challenges of working with wireless sensors underground, and we describe the solutions adopted for obtaining a working WSN that provides a robust solution of on line monitoring. We conclude by presenting an assessment and testing of these solutions, along with the design insights and the lessons we learned during this on-the-field experience.
