Software engineering is extremely information-intensive. Every day developers work with source code, version repositories, issue trackers, documentation, web-based and other information resources. However, three key aspects of information work lack good support: (i) combining information from different sources; (ii) flexibly presenting collected information to enable easier comprehension; and (iii) automatically acting on collected information, for example to perform a refactoring. Poor support for these activities makes many common development tasks time-consuming and error-prone. We propose an approach that directly addresses these three issues by integrating a flexible query mechanism into the development environment. Our approach enables diverse ways to process and visualize information and can be extended via scripts. We demonstrate how an implementation of the approach can be used to rapidly write queries that meet a wide range of information needs.
