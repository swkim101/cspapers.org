Automated singer identification is important in organising, browsing and retrieving data in large music databases. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called Hybrid Singer Identifier (HSI), for automated singer recognition. HSI can effectively use multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal and non-vocal music segments to enhance the identification process with a hybrid architecture and build profiles of individual singer characteristics based on statistical mixture models. Extensive experimental results conducted on a large music database demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.
