For sentence compression, we propose new semantic constraints to directly capture the relations between a predicate and its arguments, whereas the existing approaches have focused on relatively shallow linguistic properties, such as lexical and syntactic information. These constraints are based on semantic roles and superior to the constraints of syntactic dependencies. Our empirical evaluation on the Written News Compression Corpus (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) demonstrates that our system achieves results comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques.
