Technologies keep evolving to strengthen and further people's abilities in many aspects. For instance, vehicles expand the range of human moving while mobile phones boost the range of human communication. In this video, we develop a novel mini unmanned aerial vehicle (mini-UAV) named FlyingBuddy to augment human mobility and perceptibility. This prototype is made up of off the shelf components AR. Drone and iPhones with customized software. With help of the built-in magnetometer, GPS, and cameras, as well as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity, FlyingBuddy is capable of both manual controlled and self-piloted flying. It provides four typical services: flying to buy, flying to see, flying to report accident, and flying to take pictures.
