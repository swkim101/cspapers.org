This paper investigates certain problems in the production of text from a languaqe-free representation and proposes a model of generation to treat these problems. We deal with generation of connected text. We show that the generation of a connected text cannot be reduced to a simple combination of phrases expressing sub-parts of the representation, but must be based on patterns of discourse structure reflecting the whole representation.
