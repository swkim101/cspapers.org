In this research, we design the navigation and fully autonomous control system for small electric helicopter. Small and low-accuracy sensors (GPS which cannot output vertical velocity, low-accuracy accelerometers, and barometer) are used for navigation and control. Firstly, INS/GPS/Barometer navigation system is designed to obtain high-accuracy position and velocity of the helicopter. Secondly, 3-dimensional guidance control system is designed by using optimal control theory and quaternion kinematics. Lastly, whole systems designed in this research are validated by the flight experiments.
