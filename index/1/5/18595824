CrowdGrader is a system that lets students submit and collaboratively review and grade homework. We describe the techniques and ideas used in CrowdGrader, and report on the experience of using CrowdGrader in disciplines ranging from Computer Science to Economics, Writing, and Technology. In CrowdGrader, students receive an overall crowd-grade that reflects both the quality of their homework, and the quality of their work as reviewers. This creates an incentive for students to provide accurate grades and helpful reviews of other students' work. Instructors can use the crowd-grades as final grades, or fine-tune the grades according to their wishes. Our results on seven classes show that students actively participate in the grading and write reviews that are generally helpful to the submissions' authors. The results also show that grades computed by CrowdGrader are sufficiently precise to be used as the homework component of class grades. Students report that the main benefits in using CrowdGrader are the quality of the reviews they receive, and the ability to learn from reviewing their peers' work. Instructors can leverage peer learning in their classes, and easily handle homework evaluation in large classes.
