Teaching a course that does justice to all these aspects of the field is a big challenge. However, due to the increase in computational capability with a commensurate decrease in cost, a wealth of products and materials are available that can be used to provide students with rich, meaningful, and memorable experiences within the context of a primarily technical course in AI. Toys, articles, and movies can all be used to foster student exploration of key questions in the technical, philosophical, and ethical issues of AI.
