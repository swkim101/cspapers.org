This paper presents an approach for generating parametric systems from frequency response measurements performed with respect to the frequency, and also with respect to one or more design parameters (geometry or material properties). These allow for fast construction of models for other parameter values, so it is suited for optimizing a certain performance measure over the design variables. We validate the proposed approach on an example with two parameters.
