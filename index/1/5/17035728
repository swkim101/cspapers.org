The area of software maintenance has been described by one author as an “iceberg.” (EDP Analyzer, 1972) Much goes on here that does not currently meet the eye. In part, this is the consequence of measurement difficulties. Practitioners and researchers can benefit from an understanding of the “dimensionality” of the maintenance problem. Some measures are suggested for coming to grips with this dimensionality, and problems of utilization associated with these measures are explored.
