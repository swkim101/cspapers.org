This paper is an experience report describing the interaction between parallel programmers from industry and a select group of 16 high school students and six faculty from a Technical High School during a three-day "Clubhouse Parallel Universe Boot Camp" held summer 2009. Based on observations of what worked, this whitepaper offers next steps for getting parallelism topics taught at the high school level around the country.
 The paper also explores elements in the area of experimentation and human factors and touches on algorithms taught and languages used at this camp. The paper evaluates role playing exercises and hands-on labs presented by industry parallelism experts. We also explore how this specific group of high school kids responded, and draw some conclusions about next steps based on the teaching experience of the co-authors.
