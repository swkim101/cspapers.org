In many complex tasks, a remote subject-matter expert may need to assist a local user to guide actions on objects in the local user's environment. However, effective spatial referencing and action demonstration in a remote physical environment can be challenging. We introduce two approaches that use Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) for the remote expert, and AR for the local user, each wearing a stereo head-worn display. Both approaches allow the expert to create and manipulate virtual replicas of physical objects in the local environment to refer to parts of those physical objects and to indicate actions on them. This can be especially useful for parts that are occluded or difficult to access. In one approach, the expert points in 3D to portions of virtual replicas to annotate them. In another approach, the expert demonstrates actions in 3D by manipulating virtual replicas, supported by constraints and annotations. We performed a user study of a 6DOF alignment task, a key operation in many physical task domains, comparing both approaches to an approach in which the expert uses a 2D tablet-based drawing system similar to ones developed for prior work on remote assistance. The study showed the 3D demonstration approach to be faster than the others. In addition, the 3D pointing approach was faster than the 2D tablet in the case of a highly trained expert.
