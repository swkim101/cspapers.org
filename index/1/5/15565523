We examine linear program (LP) approaches to boosting and demonstrate their efficient solution using LPBoost, a column generation simplex method. We prove that minimizing the soft margin error function (equivalent to solving an LP) directly optimizes a generalization error bound. LPBoost can be used to solve any boosting LP by iteratively optimizing the dual classification costs in a restricted LP and dynamically generating weak learners to make new LP columns. Unlike gradient boosting algorithms, LPBoost converges finitely to a global solution using well defined stopping criteria. Computationally, LPBoost finds very sparse solutions as good as or better than those found by ADABoost using comparable computation.
