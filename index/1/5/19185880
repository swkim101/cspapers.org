Why does Smith follow Johnson on Twitter? In most cases, the reason why users follow other users is unavailable. In this work, we answer this question by proposing TagF, which analyzes the who-follows-whom network (matrix) and the who-tags-whom network (tensor) simultaneously. Concretely, our method decomposes a coupled tensor constructed from these matrix and tensor. The experimental results on million-scale Twitter networks show that TagF uncovers different, but explainable reasons why users follow other users.
