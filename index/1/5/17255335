We describe a tool kit to support a knowledge-enhancement cycle on the Web. In the first step, structured data which is extracted from Wikipedia is used to construct automatic content enhancement engines. Those engines can be used to interconnect knowledge in structured and unstructured information sources on the Web, including Wikipedia itself. Sztakipedia-toolbar is a MediaWiki user script which brings DBpedia Spotlight and other kinds of machine intelligence into the Wiki editor interface to provide enhancement suggestions to the user. The suggestions offered by the tool focus on complementing knowledge and increasing the availability of structured data on Wikipedia. This will, in turn, increase the available information for the content enhancement engines themselves, completing a virtuous cycle of knowledge enhancement.
