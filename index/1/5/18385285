Originally conceived as the target platform for Java alone, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has since been targeted by other languages, one of which is Scala. This trend, however, is not yet reflected by the benchmark suites commonly used in JVM research. In this paper, we thus present the design and analysis of the first full-fledged benchmark suite for Scala. We furthermore compare the benchmarks contained therein with those from the well-known DaCapo 9.12 benchmark suite and show where the differences are between Scala and Java code---and where not.
