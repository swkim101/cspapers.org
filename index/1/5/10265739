The hierarchical structure of a knowledge base system can lead to various valuable applications; however, many knowledge base systems do not have such property. In this paper, we propose an entity-driven approach to automatically construct the hierarchical structure of entities for knowledge base systems. By deriving type dependencies from entity information, the initial graph of types will be constructed, and then modified to become a hierarchical structure by several graph algorithms. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in terms of constructing reasonable type hierarchy for knowledge base systems.
