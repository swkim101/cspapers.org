In this paper, we describe our experience running "Girls on the Go: The Mobile Computing College Experience." We decided to do a residential summer camp for HS-age girls to achieve two goals: to encourage our campers to attend college and to interest them in computer science as a possible career option. We centered the camp around the design of a zoo-themed research tool where campers designed a mobile application to be used by researchers to document and study animal behavior. Post-camp surveys gave statistically significant results indicating that the camp increased the girls' confidence in performing computer science and understanding what computer scientists did.
