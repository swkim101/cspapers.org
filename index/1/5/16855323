The next generation of ambient assisted living services will be based on eco-systems or organizations of intelligent artificial agents embodied in companion robots and smart objects. To provide, anywhere and anytime, smart assistance services to people, these agents need to be endowed with advanced knowledge representation, reasoning and communication capabilities. In this paper, we propose a distributed cognitive architecture allowing to integrate seamlessly the actors of the ambient system and an expressive model for commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning on events. This model allows a common description of the actors in an open world and a management of interactions with humans using natural language. A scenario dedicated to the cognitive assistance of frail people is implemented and analyzed for validation purposes of the proposed approach.
