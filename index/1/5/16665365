A tandem queue model is developed that models the end-to-end delay behavior in networks that employ sliding window flow control. Messages arriving to find the window filled are assumed to be queued outside the network to await their turn to enter. The model is analyzed using a hierarchical decomposition method; the key step entails incorporating the fact that the interdeparture process is not exponentially distributed. End-to-end delay in virtual circuits can then be obtained by modelling a virtual route as a tandem queue [1] using the method of “adjusted rates.”
