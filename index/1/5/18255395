We propose a human mimetic foot structure for musculoskeletal humanoids. We designed the foot structure by inspiring from human foot abilities of the multi-bone connected structure for flexibility and the distributed force sensor system. The foot has multi-DOFs structure including toe DOF that is composed of fingers. The distributed force sensing system is composed of 12 an-axis force sensors. In order to demonstrate those effectiveness, we implement the foot into musculoskeletal humanoid Kengoro and conduct several experiments. As a result, we confirmed effectiveness of the foot from tiptoe motion and balancing behavior by utilizing the foot characteristics.
