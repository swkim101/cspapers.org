The computational analysis of protein-protein interaction and biomolecular pathway data paves the way to efficient in silico drug discovery and therapeutic target identification. However, relevant data sources are currently distributed across a wide range of disparate, large-scale, publicly-available databases and repositories and are described using a wide range of taxonomies and ontologies. Sophisticated integration, manipulation, processing and analysis of these datasets are required in order to reveal previously undiscovered interactions and pathways that will lead to the discovery of new drugs. The BioMANTA project focuses on utilizing Semantic Web technologies together with a scale-out architecture to tackle the above challenges and to provide efficient analysis, querying, and reasoning about protein-protein interaction data. This paper describes the initial results of the BioMANTA project. The fully-developed system will allow knowledge representation and processing that are not currently available in typical scale-out or Semantic Web databases. We present the design of the architecture, basic ontology and some implementation details that aim to provide efficient, scalable RDF storage and inferencing. The results of initial performance evaluation are also provided.
