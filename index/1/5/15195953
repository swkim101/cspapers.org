Given an edge weighted graph <i>G</i> with <i>n</i> vertices and no <i>K</i><inf>τ</inf>-minor and a small positive constant ε, we show that a simple greedy algorithm [1] finds a spanning subgraph approximating all shortest-path distances within a factor of 1 + ε, and with total edge weight at most <i>O</i>((τ√logτ · log<i>n</i>)/ε) times the weight of a minimum spanning tree. This result implies a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in such graphs, with running time <i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>((τ<sup>4</sup>√logτ·log <i>n</i>·log log <i>n</i>)/ε<sup>2</sup>)</sup>.Our analysis shows that a graph with <i>detour gap number</i> [5] Ω(τ√logτ · log <i>n</i>) has a <i>K</i><inf>τ</inf>-minor. We also show that this dependence on <i>n</i> is nearly tight, by exhibiting graphs with no <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor (apex graphs) and detour gap number Ω((log <i>n</i>)/log log <i>n</i>).As a step towards eliminating the log <i>n</i> factors the first paragraph, we propose a generalized detour gap number, now depending on ε, and we show that it remains bounded for apex graphs and some similar graph families.
