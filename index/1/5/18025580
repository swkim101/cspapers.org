This paper addresses the problem of ice-relative navigation of underwater robotic vehicles for oceanographic missions under moving sea ice. We define the ice-relative navigation problem and report a novel underwater robot vehicle, Nereid-UI, and its navigation system designed for under-ice oceanographic operations in ice-covered seas. The goal of Nereid-UI is to enable deployments in polar ocean regions traditionally considered difficult or impossible to access such as the ice-ocean interface in marginal ice zones, the water column of ice-covered seas, and the water column underlying ice shelves. This paper also reports the navigation results of Nereid-UI's first under-ice sea trials and science operations conducted under moving multi-year sea ice off the ice breaker Polarstern in the Arctic Ocean at 83° N 6° W - about 200 km NE of Greenland.
