In this video, composites and a polymer flexure joint are used to design mechanical elements. This composite structure can be applied to endoskeleton structures of biomimetic meso-scale robot. The basic active unit of the structure is a revolute joint with an SMA spring actuator that imitates a joint and muscle formation. The conventional mechanical element is replaced by composite structures design on 2D pattern. Using these elements, prototypes of a robot are fabricated to verify feasibility of application of the robot.
