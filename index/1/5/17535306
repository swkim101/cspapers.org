We present a new sparse compression technique based on the information bottleneck (IB) principle, which takes into account side information. This is achieved by introducing a sparse variant of IB which preserves the information in only a few selected dimensions of the original data through compression. By assuming a Gaussian copula we can capture arbitrary non-Gaussian margins, continuous or discrete. We apply our model to select a sparse number of biomarkers relevant to the evolution of malignant melanoma and show that our sparse selection provides reliable predictors.
