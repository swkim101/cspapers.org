Many modern user-intensive applications, such as Web applications, must satisfy the interaction requirements of thousands if not millions of users, which can be hardly fully understood at design time. Designing applications that meet user behaviors, by efficiently supporting the prevalent navigation patterns, and evolving with them requires new approaches that go beyond classic software engineering solutions. We present a novel approach that automates the acquisition of user-interaction requirements in an incremental and reflective way. Our solution builds upon inferring a set of probabilistic Markov models of the users' navigational behaviors, dynamically extracted from the interaction history given in the form of a log file. We annotate and analyze the inferred models to verify quantitative properties by means of probabilistic model checking. The paper investigates the advantages of the approach referring to a Web application currently in use.
