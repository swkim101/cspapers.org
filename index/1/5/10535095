This tutorial focuses on the task of automated information linking in text and multimedia sources. In any task where information is fused from different sources, this linking is a necessary step. To solve the problem we borrow methods from computational linguistics, computer vision and data mining. Although the main focus is on finding equivalence relations in the sources, the tutorial opens views on the recognition of other relation types.
