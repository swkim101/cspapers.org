Information retrieval is one of the most popular information access methods for overcoming the information overload problem of the Web. However, its interaction model is still utilizing the old text-based ranked lists and static interaction algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our adaptive visualization approach for searching the Web, which we call Adaptive VIBE. It is an extended version of a reference point-based spatial visualization algorithm, and is designed to serve as a user interaction module for a personalized search system. Personalized search can incorporate dynamic user interests and different contexts, improving search results. When it is combined with adaptive visualization, it can encourage users to become involved in the search process more actively by exploring the information space and learning new facts for effective searching. In this paper, we introduce the rationale and functions of our adaptive visualization approach and discuss the approaches' potential to create a better search environment for the Web.
