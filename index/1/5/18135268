In this paper, a general framework to control in a distributed way a system composed by multiple robots is proposed. Each robot is characterized by a discrete-time linear dynamics, and the whole system is controlled via a linear static feedback law with a feed-forward term. Usually, this form of the global control input requires a central unit or an all-to-all communication for computing the local control input of each robot. To counteract the lack of a central unit, each robot estimates, via a local observer, the overall state of the team, and such an estimate is used to compute its local control input as in the case a central unit was present. Two simulations case studies are provided in the framework of multi-robot optimal control and formation control.
