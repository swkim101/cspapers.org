This paper examines procedures for estimating the probability of detecting a logical fault in a combinational network. The prediction methods are based upon the characteristics of the circuit element, the interconnections, and the faults; they do not require generation of any test patterns or simulation of the network.
 The procedures are developed through the use of existing switching algebra and fault collapse techniques, combined with elementary probability theory. While the goal was to derive a general procedure for accurately predicting fault detectability networks, subsequent analysis indicated that detection probabilities would only be estimated without resorting to simulation. The results have been verified using an existing test generation and simulation system. Extensions to sequential circuits are discussed.
 This approach may improve the cost-effectiveness of existing test generation systems, and may provide a means of estimating the difficulty of production testing of a proposed logic design.
