The Australian National Corpus (AusNC) provides a technical infrastructure for collecting and publishing language resources representing Australian language use. As part of the project we have ingested a wide range of resource types into the system, bringing together the different meta-data and annotations into a single interoperable database. This paper describes the initial collections in AusNC and the procedures used to parse a variety of data types into a single unified annotation store.
