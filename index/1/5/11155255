In a high volume materials handling system, such as required for baggage handling at airports, it is necessary to minimize transit times between points in the system, i.e. a high speed mainline. It is further necessary for baggage to be entered into and retrieved from the system with the baggage containers at a virtual standstill. Thus arises the basic problem of accelerating a baggage container from standstill to mainline velocity and merging the container into mainline traffic without collision or other interruption of mainline flow. System performance depends upon high density mainline traffic combined with rapid merging of containers from spur lines. The problem can be recognized as being similar to that of entering a freeway system with an automobile, except that freeway merge equations are determined and solved (not always successfully) by the human computer and control system.
