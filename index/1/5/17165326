KEYWORDS; Automatic programming, Program refinement, Programming knowledge, Rules about programming, Know ledge -based systems. o the r module of the synthesis phase, an Eff iciency Expert known as LIBRA, is used to select from among these a l t e rna t i ves . The deve lopment of PECOS has required research along four d i rec t i ons : (1 ) the codif icat ion of a body of knowledge about programming; (2) the development of a model of program const ruc t ion appropriate for that knowledge; (3) t h e des ign of a representat ion scheme; and (4) the design and implementat ion of a system that can apply the know ledge to produce implementations of abstract a lgor i thms. No one aspect can be total ly isolated from any of the o the rs , but this paper will focus on the last. O v e r v i e w s of the knowledge base and the model of program cons t ruc t i on will be given, fol lowed by a brief description of t he represen ta t ion scheme. Finally, PECOS's control s t r u c t u r e wil l be discussed and an example of PECOS in opera t i on wil l be given.
