In the past years, modeling and simulation of hybrid dynamic systems (HDS) have attracted much attention. However, since simultaneously dealing with the discrete and continuous variables is very difficult, most of the models result in a unified, but more complicated and unnatural format. Moreover, design engineers cannot be allowed to use their preferred domain models. Based on the multi-paradigm modeling (MPaM) concept, this paper proposed a Petri net (PN) framework with associated state equations to model the HDS. In the presented approach, modeling schemes of the hybrid systems are separated, but combined in a hierarchical way through specified interfaces. Designers can still work in their familiar domain-specific modeling paradigms and the heterogeneity is hidden when composing large systems. An application to a rapid thermal process (RTP) in semiconductor manufacturing is provided to demonstrate the practicability of the developed approach
