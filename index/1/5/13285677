This paper deals with the control of a lower limb exoskeleton acting at the knee joint level. Classical -1 adaptive control law is proposed to ensure assistance-as-needed and resistive rehabilitation following a desired trajectory that is defined by a therapeutic doctor. This control law introduces a time lag within the desired trajectory tracking due to the presence of a filter in its structure. In order to mitigate this drawback, the classical -1 adaptive control is augmented by a nonlinear proportional control. The classical and augmented -1 adaptive control laws are tested in real-time using the Exoskeleton Intelligently COmmunicating and Sensitive to Intention (EICOSI) of LISSI-lab. Real-time experimental results highlight the utility of these control laws in assistance-as-needed and resistive rehabilitation paradigms.
