Coherent oscillatory activity in large networks of biological or artificial neural units may be a useful mechanism for coding information pertaining to a single perceptual object or for detailing regularities within a data set. We consider the dynamics of a large array of simple coupled oscillators under a variety of connection schemes. Of particular interest is the rapid and robust phase-locking that results from a "sparse" scheme where each oscillator is strongly coupled to a tiny, randomly selected, subset of its neighbors.
