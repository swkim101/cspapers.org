Threats of abusing websites that webmasters have stopped updating have increased. In this poster, we propose a method of predicting potentially abusable websites by retrospectively analyzing updates of software that composes websites. The method captures webmaster behaviors from archived snapshots of a website and analyzes the changes of web servers and web applications used in the past as update histories. A classifier that predicts website abuses is finally built by using update histories from snapshots of known malicious websites before the detections. Evaluation results showed that the classifier could predict various website abuses, such as drive-by downloads, phishes, and defacements, with accuracy: a 76% true positive rate and a 26% false positive rate.
