The paper investigates techniques for extracting data from HTML sites through the use of automatically generated wrappers. To automate the wrapper generation and the data extraction process, the paper develops a novel technique to compare HTML pages and generate a wrapper based on their similarities and dierences. Experimental results on real-life data-intensive Web sites confirm the feasibility of the approach.
