In this poster we present an innovative authentic learning approach for Secure Mobile Software Development(SMSD) through real-world-scenario case studies. The primary goal of this learning approach is to create an engagement and motivating learning environment that encourages all students in learning emerging SMSD technologies and enhances their secure software development concepts. This approach provides students with hands-on laboratory practices on real-world SMSD and mobile security. The laboratory consists of multiple modules covering input validation, output encoding, secure inter-process communication, secure data protection, secure mobile database. Each topic consists of a series of progressive sub-labs: a pre-lab, lab activities, and a student add-on post-lab. The preliminary feedback from students is positive. Students have gained hands-on real world experiences on Android software security with Android mobile devices, which also greatly promoted students' self-efficacy and confidences in their mobile security learning.
