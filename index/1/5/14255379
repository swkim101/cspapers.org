We present an overview of the prototype family of Alice miniature mobile robots and the improvements achieved so far. Applications are often the final objective but also an incentive to correct and enhance the robot abilities. The research carried out with Alice and various real-world applications, which exceed the robot's use as a research prototype, is presented. They include local and global localization, map building, control strategies for semi-autonomous operation via Internet and Matlab, its use for robot soccer tournaments and as a research platform for studies of collective behaviors.
