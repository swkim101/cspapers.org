The use of cloud servers to host modern Internet-based services is becoming increasingly common. Today's cloud platforms offer a choice of server types, including non-revocable on-demand servers and cheaper but revocable spot servers. A service provider requiring servers can bid in the spot market where the price of a spot server changes dynamically according to the current supply and demand for cloud resources. Spot servers are usually cheap, but can be revoked by the cloud provider when the cloud resources are scarce. While it is well-known that spot servers can reduce the cost of performing time-flexible interruption-tolerant tasks, we explore the novel possibility of using spot servers for reducing the cost of hosting an Internet-based service such as an e-commerce site that must {\em always} be on and the penalty for service unavailability is high. By using the spot markets, we show that it is feasible to host an always-on Internet-based service at one-third to one-fifth the cost of hosting the same service in the traditional fashion using dedicated non-revocable servers. To achieve these savings, we devise a cloud scheduler that reduces the cost by intelligently bidding for spot servers. Further, the scheduler uses novel VM migration mechanisms to quickly migrate the service between spot servers and on-demand servers to avoid potential service disruptions due to spot server revocations by the cloud provider. Our work provides the first feasibility study of using cloud spot markets to significantly reduce the cost of hosting always-on Internet-based services without sacrificing service availability.
