Scan chain timing is increasingly critical to test time and product cost. However, hold buffer insertions (e.g., due to large clock skew) limit scan timing improvement. Dynamic voltage drop (DVD) during scan shift further degrades scan shift timing, inducing “false failures” in silicon. Hence, new optimizations are needed in late stages of implementation when accurate (skew, DVD) information is available. We propose skew-aware scan ordering to minimize hold buffers, and DVD-aware gating insertion to improve scan shift timing slacks. Our optimizations at the post-CTS and postrouting stages reduce hold buffers by up to 82%, and DVD-induced timing degradation by up to 58%, with negligible area and power overheads.
