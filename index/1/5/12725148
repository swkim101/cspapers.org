: Performance engineers analyze the performance of software architectures before their actual implementation to resolve performance bottlenecks in early development phases. Performance prototyping is such an approach where software architecture models are transformed to runnable performance prototypes that can provide analysis data for a speciﬁc target operation platform. This coupling to the operation platform comprises new challenges for performance prototyping in the context of cloud computing because a variety of different cloud platforms exists. Because the choice of platform impacts performance, this variety of platforms induces the need for prototype transformations that either support several platforms directly or that are easily extensible. However, current performance prototyping approaches are tied to only a small set of concrete platforms and lack an investigation of their extensibility for new platforms, thus rendering performance protoyping ineffective for cloud computing. To cope with this problem, we extended Palladio’s performance prototyping approach ProtoCom by an additional target platform, namely the SAP HANA Cloud, and analyzed its extensibility during the extension process. In this tool paper, we focus on illustrating the capabilities of our extension of ProtoCom. For this illustration, we use a simple example system for which we create a ProtoCom performance prototype. We particularly run this prototype in the SAP HANA Cloud, thereby showing that our extension can efﬁciently be applied within a practical context.
