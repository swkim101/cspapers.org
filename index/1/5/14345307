We propose that logic (enhanced to encode probability information) is a good way of characterizing semantic interpretation. In support of this we give a fragment of an axiomatization for word-sense disambiguation, nounphrase (and verb) reference, and case disambiguation. We describe an inference engine (Frail3) which actually takes this axiomatization and uses it to drive the semantic interpretation process. We claim three benefits from this scheme. First, the interface between semantic interpretation and pragmatics has always been problematic, since all of the above tasks in general require pragmatic inference. Now the interface is trival, since both semantic interpretation and pragmatics use the same vocabulary and inference engine. The second benefit, related to the first, is that semantic guidance of syntax is a side effect of the interpretation. The third benefit is the elegance of the semantic interpretation theory. A few simple rules capture a remarkable diversity of semantic phenomena.
