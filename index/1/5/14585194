Identtication schemes allow a user to identi& herseMto a verifying authority in a secure way (i.e., without revealing her secret key). Group identification schemes allow a user to identi~ herself as a member of a group of users in a se cure and anonymous way (i.e., without revealing her identity nor her secret key). Several identification schemes and group identification schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we consider the problem of constructing communication-eficient group identification schemes. Assuming factoring Blum integers is hard, we construct a secure and anonymous group identification scheme having communication complexity @ (m+n), where m is the size of the group and n is the security parameter (previous restits achieved complexity @(inn)). In fact, we show our protocol to be perfect zer~knowledge. We extend this scheme to the case of groups oft >1 users and obtain a protocol that improves on the communication complexity of previous protocoh even ● Dipartimento d] Informatica ed Appliczioni, Universit~ di Salerno, 84081 Baronissi (SA), Italy.
