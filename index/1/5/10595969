Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) courses are considered critical in any computer science curriculum. DSA courses emphasize topics related to procedural dynamics (how an algorithm works) and algorithm analysis (the algorithm's efficiency). Historically, algorithm visualizations (AVs) have dealt almost exclusively with portraying algorithm dynamics, and there are few examples of visualizations related to algorithm analysis topics. We have developed a new generation of visualizations that we term Algorithm Analysis Visualizations (AAVs) to convey algorithm analysis concepts. We present the motivation behind AAVs, and outlines a methodology for their evaluation. We present results from student surveys and the analysis of student interaction logs from the OpenDSA eTextbook used by several CS3-level classes during the period of Fall 2014 through Fall 2015. Initial results from Fall 2014 revealed that students were not spending enough time reading the algorithm analysis material presented as textual content. Our results from a preliminary deployment of AAVs in Spring 2015 showed that students interacted with AAVs for significantly longer than the control group spent reading the previous text-based algorithm analysis material. We will present additional results from our ongoing experiment in Fall2015 (control group without AAVs) and Spring2016 (test group with additional AAVs).
