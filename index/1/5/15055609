Radio interference plays a central role for the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Interference not only leads to packet loss, but it also affects the function of MAC and routing protocols. Hitherto, testing the impact of interference on WSN experimentally has been difficult because of the unavailability of low-cost tools to create reproducible and well-controlled interference patterns.
 In this demo we present a simple and inexpensive method to generate controllable and repeatable interference patterns for 802.15.4 devices. The demo is presented as a game, where a user is required to achieve a given interference level.
