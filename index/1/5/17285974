RapidRT is a tool for statistical response time analysis of Complex Industrial Real-Time Embedded Systems (CIRTES). A key feature of this tool is that it does not require worst-case execution times of tasks to be known for the computation of a probabilistic task worst-case response time estimate. The presented tool is a step towards bridging the gap between academic research and industrial practice.
