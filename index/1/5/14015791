In this paper, we study cross-domain sentiment classiﬁcation with neural network archi-tectures. We borrow the idea from Structural Correspondence Learning and use two auxiliary tasks to help induce a sentence embedding that supposedly works well across domains for sentiment classiﬁcation. We also propose to jointly learn this sentence embedding together with the sentiment classiﬁer itself. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed joint model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on ﬁve benchmark datasets.
