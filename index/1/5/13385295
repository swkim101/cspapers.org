We describe a module, or sequence of lessons, that has been successfully used to teach basic elements of computer science to fourth grade students. The module was designed to reflect a firm grounding in computer science, to be age-appropriate, to be easily installed in schools, and to support a range of teachers. Over 300 students in grades three through six have taken this module or a related module. The programming language used is a modern variant of Logo called VVLogo, which students access through a Java applet on a web page.
