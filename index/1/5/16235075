Many domain-specific search tasks are initiated by document-length queries, e.g., patent invalidity search aims to find prior art related to a new (query) patent. We call this type of search Query Document Search. In this type of search, the initial query document is typically long and contains diverse aspects (or sub-topics). Users tend to issue many queries based on the initial document to retrieve relevant documents. To help users in this situation, we propose a method to suggest diverse queries that can cover multiple aspects of the query document. We first identify multiple query aspects and then provide diverse query suggestions that are effective for retrieving relevant documents as well being related to more query aspects. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is effective in comparison to previous query suggestion methods.
