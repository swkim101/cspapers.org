Association rules, introduced by Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami, are rules of the form “for 90% of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W, then it has 1 also in column B”. Efficient methods exist for discovering association rules from large collections of data. The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization tool interfaces with rule templates.
