Synchronous languages are widely used to design safety-critical embedded systems. These languages are based on the synchrony hypothesis, asserting that all tasks must complete instantaneously at each logical time step. This assertion is, however, unsuitable for the design of mixed-criticality systems, where some tasks can tolerate missed deadlines. This paper proposes a novel extension to the synchronous approach for supporting three levels of task criticality: life, mission, and non-critical. We achieve this by relaxing the synchrony hypothesis to allow tasks that can tolerate bounded or unbounded deadline misses. We address the issue of task communication between multi-rate, mixed-criticality tasks, and propose a deterministic lossless communication model. To maximize system utilization, we present a hybrid static and dynamic scheduling approach that executes schedulable tasks during slack time. Extensive benchmarking shows that our approach can schedule up to 15% more task sets and achieve an average of 5.38% better system utilization than the Early-Release EDF (ER-EDF) approach. Tasks are scheduled fairer under our approach and achieve consistently higher execution frequencies, but require more preemptions.
