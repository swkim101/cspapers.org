We proposed a novel real time monitor system of 3D printer with dual cameras, which capture and reconstruct the printed result layer by layer. With the reconstructed image, we can apply computer vision technique to evaluate the difference with the ideal path generate by G-code. The difference gives us clues to classify which might be the possible factor of the result. Hence we can produce advice to user for better slicing parameter settings. We believe that this system can give helps to beginner or users of 3D printer that struggle in parameter settings in the future.
