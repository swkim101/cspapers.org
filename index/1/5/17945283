Techniques similar to shadow pages have been suggested for use in rollback and crash recovery for nested transactions. However, undo/redo log methods have not been presented, though undo/redo logs are widely used for transaction recovery, and perhaps preferable to shadow methods. We develop a scheme of log-based recovery for nested transactions. The resulting design is promising because it requires a relatively small number of extensions to a similar scheme of recovery for single-level transactions.
