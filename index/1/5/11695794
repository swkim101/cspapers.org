This paper presents a cluster-based resource distribution scheme for electric vehicle sharing systems, aiming at overcoming time complexity and enhancing the service ratio. A clustering plan is encoded by an integer-valued vector to apply genetic algorithms. Specific vector elements are dedicated to intermediary stations while negative numbers separate stations. The number of intermediary stations through which vehicles move across cluster domains, is given in priori and genetic operators make better the quality of the solution generation by generation. The fitness function gives precedence to a clustering plan having even load for each cluster. Next, the local relocation scheduler also runs a genetic algorithm to match overflow and underflow stations, trying to minimize the relocation distance, or the distance taken by a service vehicle.
