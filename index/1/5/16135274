In this paper, two approaches to self-consistent electromechanical analysis of three-dimensional micro-electro-mechanical structures are described. Both approaches combine finite-element mechanical analysis with multipole-accelerated electrostatic analysis, the first using a relaxation algorithm and the second using a surface/Newton generalized conjugate-residual scheme. Examples are given to demonstrate the relative merits of the two approaches.
