Current user interface techniques such as WIMP or the desk-top metaphor do not support real world tasks, because the focus of these user interfaces is only on human–computer interactions, not on human–real world interactions. In this paper, we propose a method of building computer augmented environments using a situation-aware portable device. This device, called NaviCam , has the ability to recognize the user’s situation by detecting color-code IDs in real world environments. It displays situation sensitive information by superim-posing messages on its video see-through screen. Combination of ID-awareness and portable video-see-through display solves several problems with current ubiquitous computers systems and augmented reality systems.
