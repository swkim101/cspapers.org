A structural active-object system (SAOS) is a transition-based object-oriented system suitable for rapid development of various concurrent systems. A SAOS consists of a collection of interacting structural active objects (SAOs), whose behaviors are determined by the transition statements provided in their class definitions. Furthermore, SAOs can be structurally and hierarchically composed form their component SAOs like hardware components. These features allow SAOs to model components to be simulated more naturally than passive objects used in ordinary object-oriented programming. Also, we can easily create new kinds of components by using the inheritance mechanism. Executions of transition statements may be event- and/or time-driven, and hence discrete, continuous, and mixed-mode simulation is possible. Prototype simulation programs were developed as SAOS programs for such diverse applications as queuing systems, digital/analog/mixed-mode circuit simulation, process control, manufacturing control, road network traffic simulation, computer networks, and elevator systems. Graphical user interfaces can be added to SAOS programs with minimal extra effort, or executable SAOS programs can be graphically created.
