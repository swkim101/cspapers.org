Two classic "phase transitions" in discrete mathematics are the emergence of a giant component in a random graph as the density of edges increases, and the transition of a random 2-SAT formula from satisfiable to unsatisfiable as the density of clauses increases. The random-graph result has been extended to the case of prescribed degree sequences, where the almost-sure nonexistence or existence of a giant component is related to a simple property of the degree sequence. We similarly extend the satisfiability result, by relating the almost-sure satisfiability or unsatisfiability of a random 2-SAT formula to an analogous property of a prescribed literal sequence.
