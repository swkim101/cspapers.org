Data mining is often performed on an ad-hoc basis where fairly complex business problems are analyzed. However, we believe that the greater value of data mining is not in such complex analysis by statisticians or data mining experts, but in a day to day use of data mining as part of a company’s primary processes. These so-called data mining solutions will be used by business users, such as marketeers, rather than by statisticians. Data Distilleries has gained considerable experience in implementing data mining solutions, based on the European KESO research framework. This technology is used by leading banks and insurance companies as integrated part of their marketing and sales processes. From these experiences, new research directions arise, such as “how can the quality of mining results be guaranteed when non-experts are using technology?” and “how can the results of data mining be integrated in business processes?“. In this tutorial, we will go in depth into our experiences and outline which new research directions arise from these experiences. We hope that the combination of our scientific background and our practical experiences will help the research community in exploring even more challenging areas.
