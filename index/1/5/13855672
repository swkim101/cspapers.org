This paper presents a novel Pregel-based Distributed Subgraph Matching method PDSM to answer subgraph matching queries on big RDF graphs. In our method, the query graph is transformed to a spanning tree based on the breadth-first search (BFS). Two optimization techniques are proposed to filter out part of the unpromising intermediate results and postpone the Cartesian product operations in the Pregel iterative computation. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PDSM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an order of magnitude.
