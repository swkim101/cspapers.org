In this paper, we present the dynamics, control, and preliminary experiments on a wearable upper arm exoskeleton intended for human users with four degrees-of-freedom (dof), driven by six cables. The control of this cable-driven exoskeleton is complicated because the cables can transmit forces to the arm only under tension. The standard PD controllers or Computed torque controllers perform only moderately since the cables need to be in tension. Future efforts will seek to refine these control strategies and their implementations to improve functionality of a human user.
