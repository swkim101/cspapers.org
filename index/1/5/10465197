With the introduction of cellular phones, mobile wireless communication has become an integral part of day-to-day life in this century. A testbed is crucial in continuing cuttingedge wireless technology research and development since physical and MAC layers in mobile wireless communication have many parameters pertinent to performance that are often not tractable in analysis or simulation alone. Although many wireless testbeds have been built, most are not general purpose, have a limited access policy, or focus on single technologies like WiFi. In this paper, we present the implementation and evaluation of a mobile testbed node. This node will be the founding block of a mobile wireless testbed that we envision to be as open as PlanetLab to researchers.
