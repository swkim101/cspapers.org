Flow-related structures on terrains are defined in terms of paths of steepest descent (or ascent). A steepest descent path on a polyhedral terrain <i>T</i> with <i>n</i> vertices can have θ(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) complexity. The watershed of a point <i>p</i>---the set of points on <i>T</i> whose paths of steepest descent reach <i>p</i>---can have complexity θ(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>). We present a technique for tracing a collection of <i>n</i> paths of steepest descent on <i>T</i> implicitly in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time. We then derive <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time algorithms for: (i) computing for each local minimum <i>p</i> of <i>T</i> the triangles contained in the watershed of <i>p</i> and (ii) computing the surface network graph of <i>T</i>.
 We also present an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time algorithm that computes the watershed area for each local minimum of <i>T</i>.
