Given the popularity of smartphones and mobile devices, mobile botnets are becoming an emerging threat to users and network operators. We propose a new form of cloud-based push-styled mobile botnets that exploits today's push notification services as a means of command dissemination. To motivate its practicality, we present a new command and control (C&C) channel using Google's Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM) service, and develop a C2DM botnet specifically for the Android platform. We present strategies to enhance its scalability to large botnet coverage and its resilience against service disruption. We prototype a C2DM botnet, and perform evaluation to show that the C2DM botnet is stealthy in generating heartbeat and command traffic, resource-efficient in bandwidth and power consumptions, and controllable in quickly delivering a command to all bots. We also discuss how one may deploy a C2DM botnet, and demonstrate its feasibility in launching an SMS-Spam-and-Click attack. Lastly, we discuss how to generalize the design to other platforms, such as iOS or Window-based systems, and recommend possible defense methods. Given the wide adoption of push notification services, we believe that this type of mobile botnets requires special attention from our community.
