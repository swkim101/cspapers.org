The fundamental problem in Information Retrieval (IR) is to identify lhe relevant documents from lhe nonrelevant ones in a collection of documents according to. a particular user's information. needs. One of the majar difficulties in modeUing information retrieval is to choose an appropriate (knowledge) representation of the content of an individual document For example. it is common to describe each document by a set of (weighted) indu. terms ar keywords obtained from an automatic indexing scheme (1, 2, 3]. Since these index tenns (or some other similar "constructs") provide us only with partial knowledge about the contents of the documents, it is unrealistic to expect that lhe system would identify without uncertainty only those docume.nts the user needs. Thus, any relevance judgment based on the surrogate documents and some highly model dependent retrieval strategy is bound to be uncertain. In this regard, the search strategy acq,ted in !he standard Boolean model, for example, used in most commercial systems is generally considered ·to be too restrictive. On the other hand, a soft matching function is provided by the vectarbased [2, 3, 4) and the fuzzy set [S, 6] models to rank documents with respect to the degree of similarity between a sunogate document and the query. In these approaches, it is believed that the query formulated by the user (using whatever query language provided by a particular IR model) can in fact accurately reftect a user's information requirements. However, in practice, more often than not a user may not be able to describe· in a precise way the characteristics of the relevant information items even with a query language of sufficient expressive power [7). This drawbaclt, to some extent, can be remedied by incorporating some intuitive relevance feedback procedure [8) to im~ve the query formulation.
