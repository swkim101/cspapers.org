Kerberos, a widely used network authentication mechanism, is integrated into numerous applications: UNIX and Windows 2000 login, AFS, Telnet, and SSH to name a few. Yet, Web applications rely on SSL to estabilish authenticated and secure connections. SSL Provides strong authentication by using certificates and public key challenge response authentication. The expansion of the Internet requires each system to leverage the strength of the other, which suggets the importance of interoperability between them. 
 
This paper descirbes the design, implentation, and performance of a system that provides controlled access to Kerberized services through a browser. This system provides a singole sign-on that produces both Kerberos and public key credentials. The Web server uses a plugin that translates public key credentials to Kerberos credentials. The Web server's subsequent authenticated actions taken on a user's behalf are limited in time and scope. Performance measurements show how the overhead introduced by credential trnslation is amortized over the login session.
