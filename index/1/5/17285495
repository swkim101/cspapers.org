This paper presents the CHIC (Constraints in Hierarchical Composite objects) model for expressing and maintaining constraints between objects in a part-whole hierarchy. This model is based essentially on the semantics of the part-whole relation both in representing and managing constraints. Its principal contribution involves integrating an explicit object-oriented constraint model in complex objects with contextual reactivity.
