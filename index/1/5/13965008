The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with time windows (RCPSP/max) is an important generalization of a number of well studied scheduling problems. In this paper, we present a new heuristic algorithm that combines the benefits of squeaky wheel optimization with an effective conflict resolution mechanism, called bulldozing, to address RCPSP/max problems. On a range of benchmark problems, the algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art systematic and non-systematic methods and scales well.
