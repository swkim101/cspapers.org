As models are elevated to first-class artifacts within the software development lifecycle, the task of construction and evolution of large-scale system models becomes a manually intensive effort that can be very time consuming and error prone. To address these problems, this dissertation abstract presents a model transformation approach. There are three main features of this research. First, tasks of model construction and evolution are specified in a model transformation language (called the Embedded Constraint Language). Second, a core transformation engine (called C-SAW) is used to perform model transformation in an automated manner by executing the ECL transformation specification. Finally, testing and debugging tools at the modeling level are provided to assist in detecting errors in the model transformation.
