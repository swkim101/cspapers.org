This work presents new directions for building a self stabilizing operating system kernel. A system is self-stabilizing [3, 4] if it can be started in any possible state and it converges to a desired behavior. A state of a system is an assignment of arbitrary values to the systems variables. The usefulness of such a system in critical and remote systems cannot be over estimated. Entire years of work maybe lost when the operating system of an expensive complicated device e.g., a spaceship, may reach an arbitrary state due to say, soft errors (e.g., [8]), and be lost forever. Last results of this research can be found in [5] and [6].
