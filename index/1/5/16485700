Capitalizing on advances in CMOS and MEMS technologies, microrobots have the potential to dramatically change many aspects of medicine by navigating bodily fluids to perform targeted diagnosis and therapy. Onboard energy storage and actuation is very difficult at the microscale, but externally applied magnetic fields provide an unparalleled means of wireless power and control. Recent results have provided a model for accurate real-time control of soft-magnetic bodies with axially symmetric geometries. In this paper, we extend the model to consider the real-time control of assembled-MEMS devices that may have significantly more complex geometries. We validate the model through FEM and experiments. The model captures the characteristics of complex 3-D structures and allows us, for the first time, to consider full 6-DOF control of untethered devices, which can act as in vivo microrobots or as end-effectors of micromanipulation systems.
