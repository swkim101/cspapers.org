Graphic symbols are being used more and more frequently in computer applications, as high resolution displays with advanced graphic capabilities become more common (for example, see [14]). The motivations for using graphic symbols—or icons, as they have been called—in command menus are similar to the reasons graphic symbols have long been popular for use on maps.
 Their commercial and technical advantages aside, to a large extent the effects of icons on users' performance with a system are unknown. The study summarized here is an initial attempt to understand how commands are represented graphically, to identify the characteristics of icons that make them easy or difficult to comprehend, and to identify the characteristics that lead to retention of the icon-command correspondences. More generally, it is an initial attempt to identify how the user's ability to learn and understand a system is affected by the way in which the commands are represented.
