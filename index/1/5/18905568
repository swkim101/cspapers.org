Robots would be able to coexist with humans and support humans effectively in near future. We proposed the intelligent space in order to achieve such human-centered system. The intelligent space is the space where many intelligent devices, such as computers and sensors, are distributed. The intelligent space achieves the human centered services by accelerating the physical and psychological interaction between humans and intelligent devices. As an intelligent device of the intelligent space, a color CCD camera module, which includes processing and networking part, has been chosen. The intelligent space requires functions of identifying and tracking the multiple objects to realize appropriate services to users under the multi-camera environments. In order to achieve seamless tracking and location estimation, many camera modules are distributed. They cause some errors about object identification among different camera modules. This paper describes appearance based object identification for the distributed vision system in intelligent space to achieve consistent labeling of unknown objects. First, we discuss how to obtain the object color information for constructing the color appearance based model. Then, we propose the global color model based on the color information for the object identification.
