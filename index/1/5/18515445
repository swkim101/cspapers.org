The ability to perform an accurate robotic fold is essential to obtain the properly folded garment. Available solutions rely on a rough folding surface or on a comprehensive simulation, both preventing the garment from slipping on the table during folding. This paper proposes a new algorithm for a folding path design respecting the garment material properties and preventing the garment slipping. The folding path is derived based on the equilibrium of forces under the simplifying assumptions of a rectangular and homogeneous garment. This approach allows folding the rectangular garment on a low friction table surface as we demonstrated in the experiments performed by a dual-arm robotic testbed.
