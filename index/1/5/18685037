We explore a class of task allocation mechanisms that are incremental and can be tuned to the computational resource limitations of agents Our focus is on dis tributed task and resource allocation problems involv ing coalitions of cooperative agents that must negotiate among themselves on the distribution of tasks Our emphasis is on the design of mechanisms with desir able real time and dynamic properties We describe preliminary work in four areas the design of what we call time bounded commitment networks that are ex tensions of task auctions and contract nets and that support a notion of reciprocal commitment anytime algorithms for combinatorial task allocation that take into account both positive and negative task interac tions organizational frameworks for e cient task allo cation in highly dynamic domains involving hundreds of agents and logical tools for analyzing dynamic emer gent properties of agent societies
