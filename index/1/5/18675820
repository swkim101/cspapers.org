This paper briefly discusses software engineering and its relationship to CAD. We look at:
 • software engineering and the software life cycle
 • the characteristics of CAD software
 • a survey of software engineering use in CAD
 • recommendations for the use of software tools in CAD
 • recommendations for the development of new software engineering techniques to aid the CAD developer.
