With data on scholarly publications becoming more abundant and accessible, there exist new opportunities for using this information to provide rich author profiles to display and explore scholarly work. We present a pair of linked visualizations connected to the Microsoft Academic Graph that can be used to explore the publications and citations of individual authors. We provide an online application with which a user can manage collections of papers and generate these visualizations.
