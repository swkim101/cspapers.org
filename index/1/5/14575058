We present in this paper the problem of discovering sets of attribute-value pairs in high dimensional data sets that are of interest not because of co-occurrence alone, but due to their value in serving as cores for potential classifiers of clusters. We present our algorithm in the context of a gene-expression dataset. Gene expression data, in most situations, is insufficient for clustering algorithms and any statistical inference because for 6000+ genes, typically only 10s and at most 100s of data points become available. It is difficult to use statistical techniques to design a classifier for such immensely under-specified data. The observed data, though statistically, insufficient contains some information about the domain. Our goal is to discover as much information about all potential classifiers as possible from the data and then summarize this knowledge. This summarization provides insights into the composition of potential classifiers. We present here algorithms and methods for mining a high dimensional data set, exemplified by a gene expression data set, for mining such information.
