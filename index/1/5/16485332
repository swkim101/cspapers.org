By the theory of measure and linear algebra, this paper shows that the following property holds for almost all 2-player finite simultaneous games: for any Nash equilibrium, the numbers of pure strategies assigned positive probability by two players are equal. Moreover, if all the equilibria of the game are quasi-strong, the number of equilibria of the game is finite and odd.
