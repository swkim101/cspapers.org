In this work we present a formal approach to the design of Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) components. We define a comprehensive language for the specification of FDI, and discuss how to check whether a given FDI component fulfills its specification. Then, we propose an automatic procedure to synthesize an FDI component that satisfies a given specification. The approach has been implemented and tested in realistic case studies from the aerospace domain.
