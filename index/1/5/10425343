Recent work [27, 15] introduced a novel peer-to-peer application that leverages content sharing and aggregation among the peers to diagnose misconfigurations on a desktop PC. This application poses interesting challenges in preserving privacy of user configuration data and in maintaining integrity of troubleshooting results. In this paper, we provide a much more rigorous cryptographic and yet practical solution for preserving privacy, and we investigate and analyze solutions for ensuring integrity.
