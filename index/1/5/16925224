We present a novel method for coreference resolution error analysis which we apply to perform a recall error analysis of four state-of-the-art English coreference resolution systems. Our analysis highlights differences between the systems and identifies that the majority of recall errors for nouns and names are shared by all systems. We characterize this set of common challenging errors in terms of a broad range of lexical and semantic properties.
