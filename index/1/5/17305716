SP3 presents the design and implementation of a service to allow clients to send themselves a limited amount of network traffic from an arbitrary source IP address. Packet Spoofing is a powerful tool, although often misused, and has the potential to establish TCP connections between clients located behind NATs, to learn about network firewall policies, and to obscure communication patterns by separating source and destination. SP^3 is the first system to offer this capability as a service, while implementing safeguards to prevent malicious users from attacking others. This poster presents the design of SP^3.
