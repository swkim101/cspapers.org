Inspired by biological systems, compliant elements are introduced in the driving train of legged robots with the purpose of recycling energy. This paper presents the design and control concept of the monopedal robot SPEAR, driven by a novel implementation of a Switchable Parallel Elastic Actuator (S-PEA). At the stance phase, the parallel spring in S-PEA works with the actuator to support body weight and recover energy. The spring is removed from the system at the flight phase to gain precise joint control. The stiffness of the whole leg is also adjustable online either by active control of the motor or by changing the knee angle at touchdown. Experimental results show that the spring recycles part of energy during hopping, reducing the peak torque and peak power of the motor.
