As Android becomes popular, Android security acquires more and more attentions. This paper proposes a new system design strategy for dissemination of high fidelity applications. We propose to use static and dynamic data flow analysis on Android applications to detect about how the apps leverage users'/enterprises' sensitive data. Also, we plan to build up a cloud-based back-end to safeguard mobile devices. The new secure system framework will not only analyze an individual app isolatedly, but also analyze the correlation between apps.
