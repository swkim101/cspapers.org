In this paper, we present a supporting structure for speeding up visibility queries needed for a 3D multi-goal path planning arising from a robotic coverage problem where goals are sensing locations from which an object of interest can be covered. Although such coverage problems can be addressed by a decomposed approach where sensing locations are determined prior finding the sequence of their visits, the proposed approach is motivated by a solution of the problem in which sensing locations are simultaneously determined together with evaluation of the path connecting them in order to provide a cost effective inspection path. The proposed structure divides the space into elements that support determination of suitable sensing locations to cover the objects during solution of the multi-goal path planning.
