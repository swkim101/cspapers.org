The novel features and locomotion of a reconfigurable modular robot called iMobot are presented in the accompanying video. iMobot is designed for search and rescue operations as well as other applications such as research and teaching. It has versatile locomotion, including a unique feature of driving as though with wheels and lifting itself into a camera platform. Future work is envisioned for using these modules in clusters to achieve advanced mobility. The accompanying video demonstrates the various locomotion of iMobot.
