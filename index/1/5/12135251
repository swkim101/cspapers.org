Requiring only category names as user input is a highly attractive, yet hardly explored, setting for text categorization. Earlier bootstrapping results relied on similarity in LSA space, which captures rather coarse contextual similarity. We suggest improving this scheme by identifying concrete references to the category name's meaning, obtaining a special variant of lexical expansion.
