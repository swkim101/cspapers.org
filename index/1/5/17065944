The operation of a design automation system for custom integrated circuits is described. The procedures are based upon standard cell libraries and a sophisticated automatic placement and routing program. The economic viability of automated layout techniques has been demonstrated by circuit layout, design verification and system integration of twenty five custom PMOS/LSI devices in 1975.
