This paper introduces analytic models for evaluating demand assignment protocols in realistic finite buffer/finite station network configurations. We present a solution for implicit and explicit token passing systems enabling us to model local area networks, such as Token Bus. We provide, for the first time, a tractable approximate solution by using an approach based on restricted occupancy urn models. The presented approximation involves the solving of linear equations whose number is linear and equal only to the number of buffers in the system. It is demonstrated that in addition to its simplicity, the presented approximation is also highly accurate.
