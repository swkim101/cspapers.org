In this paper, we propose a set of semantic cohesion metrics for ontology measurement, which can be used to assess the quality of evolving ontologies in the context of dynamic and changing Web. We argue that these metrics are stable and can be used to measure ontology semantics rather than ontology structures. Measuring ontology quality with semantic inconsistencies caused by ontology evolutions, is mainly considered in this paper. The proposed semantic cohesion metrics are theoretically and empirically validated.
