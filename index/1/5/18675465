With the in-depth study of sentiment analysis research, finer-grained opinion mining, which aims to detect opinions on different review features as opposed to the whole review level, has been receiving more and more attention in the sentiment analysis research community recently. Most of existing approaches rely mainly on the template extraction to identify the explicit relatedness between product feature and opinion terms, which is insufficient to detect the implicit review features and mine the hidden sentiment association in reviews, which satisfies (1) the review features are not appear explicit in the review sentences; (2) it can be deduced by the opinion words in its context. From an information theoretic point of view, this paper proposed an iterative reinforcement framework based on the improved information bottleneck algorithm to address such problem. More specifically, the approach clusters product features and opinion words simultaneously and iteratively by fusing both their semantic information and co-occurrence information. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the template extraction based approaches.
