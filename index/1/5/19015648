This paper is concerned with the design and performance of coloration neighborhood search (CNS) algorithms for the general graph coloring problem. A coloration neighborhood is an implicit mapping F : II --+ 25 where H is the set of all colorations of a graph, G = (V,E). We require that F(C) be easily enumerable and, ideally, we would like to be able to choose a coloration from r(C) uniformly at random. CNS algorithms traverse a neighborhood structure in search of a “good” coloration by repeatedly sampling the neighborhood of the current coloration as shown in Figure 1, They algorithms are computation intensive, but produce better colorations than those obtained by doing multiple runs, for the same length of time, using randomized versions of the known polynomial time approximation algorithms [3,8]. CNS algorithms are fully specified by giving a search framework (selection of C, acceptance of C and a termination criterion) as well as a coloration neighborhood. Well known frameworks include simulated annealing [3] and the tabu search method [23. Acceptance of a neighboring coloration is determined using an objective function that prescribes a value to each coloration. Smaller objective function values correspond to better colorations. However, using objective function improvement as the only criterion for acceptance is too strict; this approach often results in the search becoming trapped in a local optimum that is far away from a global optimum. One way to avoid this local trapping is to allow for the possibility of accepting a neighboring coloration that represents a move contrary to the direction of optimality-such a move is called a disimprovement. Search frameworks have a parametrized mechanism for accepting disimprovements that control the frequency of such moves and the magnitude of change to the objective function. A well known
