Many systems for tasks such as question answering, multi-document summarization, and information retrieval need robust numerical measures of lexical relatedness. Standard thesaurus-based measures of word pair similarity are based on only a single path between those words in the thesaurus graph. By contrast, we propose a new model of lexical semantic relatedness that incorporates information from every explicit or implicit path connecting the two words in the entire graph. Our model uses a random walk over nodes and edges derived from WordNet links and corpus statistics. We treat the graph as a Markov chain and compute a word-specific stationary distribution via a generalized PageRank algorithm. Semantic relatedness of a word pair is scored by a novel divergence measure, ZKL, that outperforms existing measures on certain classes of distributions. In our experiments, the resulting relatedness measure is the WordNet-based measure most highly correlated with human similarity judgments by rank ordering at = .90.
