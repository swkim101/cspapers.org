Early testing reduces the cost of detecting faults and improves the system reliability. In particular, testing component or service based systems during modeling frees the tests from implementation details, especially those related to the middleware. COSTOTest is a tool that helps the tester during the process of designing tests at the model level. It suggests the possibilities and the lacks when (s)he builds test cases. Building executable tests is achieved thanks to model transformations.
