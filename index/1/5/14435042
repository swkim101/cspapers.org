A novel proposal for object recognition based on relational grammars and Bayesian Networks is presented. Based on a Symbol-Relation grammar an object is represented as a hierarchy of features and spatial relations. This representation is transformed to a Bayesian network structure which parameters are learned from examples. Thus, recognition is based on probabilistic inference in the Bayesian network representation. Preliminary results in modeling natural objects are presented.
