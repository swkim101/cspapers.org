We show that if a system of polynomials f l , f 2 , . . . ,Jr in n variables with deg(fl) _< d over the rational numbers has only finitely many affine zeros, then, all the affine zeros can be determined in time polynomial in d n by a Las Vegas type randomized algorithm. We then describe single exponential time algorithms to compute reduced Gr5bner bases for the radical of the ideal generated by fi and for all the prime ideals containing the radical.
