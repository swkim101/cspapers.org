We discuss challenges a sprawling posture legged robot faces when moving in a complex environment. These kind of robots can be used for search and rescue applications when proper sensors are used and placed correctly. Finding an adequate position for placing sensors on legged robots with a segmented spine to maximize the information retrieval is not trivial. In this paper, we talk about equipping the salamanderlike robot Pleurobot with necessary sensors to understand its challenges. Our setup gathers visual and inertial information for 3D mapping and localization. To do so, we have come up with three different experimental terrains to analyze the sensing behavior. The results are examples to understanding the behavior of quadrupedal legged robots similar to Pleurobot in search and rescue scenarios.
