In this paper we focus on solving DCOPs in computationally demanding scenarios. GDL optimally solves DCOPs, but requires exponentially large cost functions, being impractical in such settings. Function filtering is a technique that reduces the size of cost functions. We improve the effectiveness of function filtering to reduce the amount of resources required to optimally solve DCOPs. As a result, we enlarge the range of problems solvable by algorithms employing function filtering.
