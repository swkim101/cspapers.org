The automatic generation of diagnostic decision trees from qualitative models is a reasonable compromise between the advantages of using a modelbased approach in technical domains and the constraints imposed by on-board applications. In this paper we extend the approach to deal with temporal information. We introduce a notion of temporal diagnostic decision tree, in which nodes have a temporal label providing temporal constraints on the observations, and we present an algorithm for compiling such trees from a model-based diagnostic system.
