The mystery of belief propagation (BP) decoder, especially of the turbo decoding, is studied from information geometrical viewpoint. The loopy belief network (BN) of turbo codes makes it difficult to obtain the true "belief" by BP, and the characteristics of the algorithm and its equilibrium are not clearly understood. Our study gives an intuitive understanding of the mechanism, and a new framework for the analysis. Based on the framework, we reveal basic properties of the turbo decoding.
