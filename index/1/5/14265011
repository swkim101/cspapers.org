CLAM (C++ Library for Audio and Music) is a framework for audio and music programming. It may be used for developing any type of audio or music application as well as for doing more complex research related with the field. In this paper we introduce the practicalities of CLAM's first release as well as some of the sample application that have been developed within the framework. See [1] for a more conceptual approach to the description of the CLAM framework.
