There are several attempts to model and provide guidelines for the development of COTS-based software systems. The literature offers a wide spread in terms of both viewpoints and focus. We present here our attempt to model the CBD process using a software process modeling language (E3). Our work proposes a unified view in the form of a software process model which provides a formal abstraction of existing COTS-based development processes. In addition, our work proposes a process model for the acquisition phase, which recognizes the importance of architecture and gives room to a learning phase.
