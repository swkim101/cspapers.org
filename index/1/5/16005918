This paper presents dynamic modeling of glass substrate transfer robot arm that use timing belts for power transmission. The methods proposed in the existing literature are limited in practical use because the dynamic models require a high computational burden or can generate a large error. We propose a simple dynamic model that considers the elasticity of the timing belt in order to estimate the path errors of the robot. The experimental results show that the proposed dynamic model can predict the path errors within maximum 8 %.
