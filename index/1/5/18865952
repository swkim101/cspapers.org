Many theoretic approaches for feedback stabilization control of nonholonomic mobile robots cannot be directly applied to practical robots since various kinematic constraints such as the velocity and acceleration limits are not considered in existing methods. To deal with this issue, we aim to propose a generic approach which first uses an (arbitrary) feedback stabilizer to generate the `path' and then rebuilt the corresponding `trajectory' along this `path' to meet various kinematic constraints, which ultimately gives a practical satisfactory solution for local trajectory planning. Specifically, a general framework is established to transform feedback stabilizers into a feasible and highly efficient trajectory planner by using path generation and optimal velocity planning techniques, considering both kinematic and differential constraints. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the proposed approach.
