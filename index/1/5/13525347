This paper presents empirical results that contradict the prevailing opinion that entity extraction is a boring solved problem. In particular, we consider data sets that resemble familiar MUC/ACE data, and report surprisingly poor performance for both commercial and research systems. We then give an error analysis that suggests research challenges for entity extraction that are neither boring nor solved.
