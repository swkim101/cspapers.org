Automatic review assignment can significantly improve the productivity of many people such as conference organizers, journal editors and grant administrators. Most previous works have set the problem up as using a paper as a query to independently "retrieve" a set of reviewers that should review the paper. A more appropriate formulation of the problem would be to simultaneously optimize the assignments of all the papers to an entire committee of reviewers under constraints such as the review quota. In this paper, we solve the problem of committee review assignment with multi-aspect expertise matching by casting it as an integer linear programming problem. The proposed algorithm can naturally accommodate any probabilistic or deterministic method for modeling multiple aspects to automate committee review assignments. Evaluation using an existing data set shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for committee review assignments based on multi-aspect expertise matching.
