This paper presents a modeling of brushless dc motor based servo actuator for manipulators, and described dynamic and fault analysis of the actuator using the model A new model of brushless dc motors, which have delta windings, is proposed. Nonlinear model of the actuator, which has ball screw and spur gears, is presented, too. Nonlinear modeling of electromechanical actuation systems makes it possible to investigate the effects of faults such as open circuit of motor winding and jamming of gear screw. The simulation using the model examines the effects of nonlinear components on the system performance such as frequency response and dynamic stiffness which is more critical issue in some applications.
