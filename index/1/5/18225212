We present a novel study of ad hoc retrieval methods utilizing document-level relevance feedback and/or focused relevance feedback; namely, passages marked as (non-)relevant. The first method uses a novel mixture model that integrates relevant and non-relevant information at the language model level. The second method fuses retrieval scores produced by using relevant and non-relevant information separately. Empirical exploration attests to the merits of our methods, and sheds light on the effectiveness of using and integrating relevance feedback for textual units of varying granularities.
