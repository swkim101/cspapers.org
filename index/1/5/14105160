On-line analysis of clinical study data has not benefited from recent advances in OLAP technologies. We examine the analysis requirements posed by the biotech domain that are not met by traditional OLAP. To accommodate these new requirements, we propose the concept of Scientific OLAP which applies more broadly to data analysis in controlled scientific experiments. We describe our experience implementing such a system for the support of biomarker discovery and we identify some key challenges that must be overcome before OLAP can be widely adopted in the biotech industry.
