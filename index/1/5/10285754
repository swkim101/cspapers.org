We present a new family of hybrid index maintenance strategies to be used in on-line index construction for monotonically growing text collections. These new strategies improve upon recent results for hybrid index maintenance in dynamic text retrieval systems. Like previous techniques, our new method distinguishes between short and long posting lists: While short lists are maintained using a merge strategy, long lists are kept separate and are updated in-place. This way, costly relocations of long posting lists are avoided.We discuss the shortcomings of previous hybrid methods and give an experimental evaluation of the new technique, showing that its index maintenance performance is superior to that of the earlier methods, especially when the amount of main memory available to the indexing system is small. We also present a complexity analysis which proves that, under a Zipfian term distribution, the asymptotical number of disk accesses performed by the best hybrid maintenance strategy is linear in the size of the text collection, implying the asymptotical optimality of the proposed strategy.
