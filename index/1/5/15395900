We developed four widely different interfaces for users ofSomewire, a prototype audio-only media space. We informally studiedusers experiences with the two screen- based interfaces. Weprototyped a non-screen-based interface as an example of a noveltangible interface for a communication system. We explored theconflict between privacy and simplicity of representation, andidentified two unresolved topics: the role of audio quality and theprospects for scsiling audio spaces beyond a single Workgroup.Finally, we formulated a set of design guidelines for control andrepresentation in audio spaces, as follows: GUIs are notwell-suited to audio spaces, users do not require control overlocalization or other audio attributes, and awareness of otherusers presence is desirable.
