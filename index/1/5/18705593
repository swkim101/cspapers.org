An expressive first-order temporal logic using the method of temporal arguments is developed and provided with a non-standard semantics that explicates its underlying temporal structure. Objections from the AI literature against the adequacy of temporal argument theories are answered in the course of discussing representational issues for the developed logic. This logic "accords a special status to time," distinguishes the temporal features of event occurrences from ordinary facts, and supports changing ontologies. We conclude that the method of temporal arguments remains a viable candidate for temporal reasoning in AI.
