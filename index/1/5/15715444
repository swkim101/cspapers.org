We have developed an application called Social Media Illustrator that allows for finding media items on multiple social networks, clustering them by visual similarity, ranking them by different criteria, and finally arranging them in media galleries that were evaluated to be perceived as aesthetically pleasing. In this paper, we focus on the ranking aspect and show how, for a given set of media items, the most adequate ranking criterion combination can be found by interactively applying different criteria and seeing their effect on-the-fly. This leads us to an empirically optimized media item ranking formula, which takes social network interactions into account. While the ranking formula is not universally applicable, it can serve as a good starting point for an individually adapted formula, all within the context of Social Media Illustrator. A demo of the application is available publicly online at the URL http://social-media-illustrator.herokuapp.com/.
