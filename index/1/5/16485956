FlexRay has been widely accepted as the next generation bus protocol for automotive networks. This has led to tremendous research interest in techniques for scheduling messages on the FlexRay bus, in order to meet the hard real-time deadlines of the automotive applications. However, these techniques do not generate reliable schedules in the sense that they do not provide any performance guarantees in the presence of faults. In this work, we will present a framework for generating fault-tolerant message schedules on the time-triggered (static) segment of the FlexRay bus. We provide formal guarantees that the generated fault-tolerant schedules achieve the reliability goal even in the presence of transient and intermittent faults. Moreover, our technique minimizes the required number of re-transmissions of the messages in order to achieve such fault tolerant schedules, thereby, optimizing the bandwidth utilization. Towards this, we formulate the optimization problem in Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), which returns optimal results. However, this procedure is computationally intensive and hence, we also propose an efficient heuristic. The heuristic guarantees the reliability of the constructed schedules but might be sub-optimal with respect to bandwidth utilization. Extensive experiments run on synthetic test cases and real-life case studies illustrate that the heuristic performs extremely well. The experiments also establish that our heuristic scales significantly better than the CLP formulation.
