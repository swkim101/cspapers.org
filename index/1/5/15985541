In large programs such as NASA Exploration, multiple systems that interact via safety-critical protocols are already designed with different Statechart variants. To verify these safety-critical systems, a unified framework is needed based on a formal semantics that captures the variants of Statecharts. We describe Polyglot, a unified framework for the analysis of models described using multiple State-chart formalisms. In this framework, Statechart models are translated into Java and analyzed using pluggable semantics for different variants operating in a polymorphic execution environment. The framework has been built on the basis of a parametric formal semantics that captures the common core of Statecharts with extensions for different variants, and addresses previous limitations. Polyglot has been integrated with the Java Pathfinder verification tool-set, providing analysis and test-case generation capabilities. We describe the application of this unified framework to the analysis of NASA/JPL's MER Arbiter whose interacting components were modeled using multiple Statechart formalisms.
