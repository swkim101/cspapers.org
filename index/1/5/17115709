Our work is devoted to Web revisitation patterns of individual users. Everybody revisits Web pages, but their reasons for doing so can differ. We analyzed Web interaction logs of millions users to characterize how people revisit Web content. We revealed that each user have its own distribution of revisitation times. This distribution follows Power Law with some exponent, which captures specific user peculiarities.
