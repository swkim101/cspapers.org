This paper presents a method of applying rewriting rules to the recognition of patterns, structure of which are sequentially connected and can be expressed as symbol strings. Rewriting rules, which play the part of a recognizer, are formulated in a hierarchical structure. Rule 1 normalizes the length of string and extracts properties, rule 2 transforms the deformed string in a context dependent way and rule 3 determines the category. A procedure for producing rules from given sample patterns based on the similarity between the symbols and a procedure for modifying the rules when input patterns are added are described. Experimental results of the recognition of Japanese spoken digits to illustrate the method are exhibited.
