Partial-order reduction is a well-known technique to cope with the state-space-explosion problem in the verification of concurrent systems. Using the hierarchical structure of concurrent systems, we present an enhancement of the partial-order-reduction scheme of G.J. Holzman and D. Peled (1995) and D. Peled (1994). A prototype of the new algorithm has been implemented on top of the verification tool SPIN. The first experimental results are encouraging.
