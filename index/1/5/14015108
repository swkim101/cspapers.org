In this paper we present a new robotic system, called STRAS, designed for endoluminal and transluminal surgery. The system is based on the AnubisÂ® platform - a manual flexible system designed by Karl Storz for transluminal operations. Our new robot is a modular robotic system, compatible with the medical environment, allowing an easy setup in the operating room. It provides up to 10 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), enabling the 3D positioning of an endoscopic camera, positioning of two instruments and offering grasper opening / closing functionalities. The paper presents for the first time the mechanical, electrical and control design of STRAS. An initial characterization of the system shows that, because of complex mechanical interactions, the kinematic modeling is not sufficient for cartesian control. However, first experiments, demonstrate that the robotic system can be telemanipulated using joint control and that the robotic system enables a single user to perform complex tasks with the underlying flexible system.
