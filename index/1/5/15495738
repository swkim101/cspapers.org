The study of the location of facilities to serve clients at minimum cost has been one of the most studied themes in the field of Operations Research (see, e.g., the textbook edited by Mirchandani & Francis [S]). We investigate algorithms for a variant of the capacitated fucility location problem, that can be described as follows. There is a set of potential facility locations J= and a set of clients V that require service. Building a facility at location i E 3 has an associated nonnegative fixed cost fi, and each facility installed at this location can service at most u clients. Client j E D must be assigned to one of the open facilities. If a facility at location i E 3 is used to satisfy the demand of client j E D, the service cost incurred is equal to the distance from i to j, cij. The goal is to determine the (integer) number of facilities to install at each potential facility location and an assignment of each client to these facilities so as to minimize the overall total cost, that is, the cost of installing the facilities plus the total service cost. We will only consider the metric variant of the problem in which the distance function c is nonnegative, symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality. The main result of this paper is a 3-approximation algorithm for the metric capacitated facility location problem, improving on the 5.69-approximation algorithm of [7]. Our work builds on recent results on approximation algorithms for facility location problems that rely on rounding the fractional solution to a linear programming relaxation. Shmoys, Tardos, & Aardal [7] gave the first approximation algorithms with constant performance guarantee for a number of NP-hard metric facility location problems. For the uncapacitated facility location problem (where u = +oo), they gave a
