A manipulator with variable stiffness allows the manipulator to adjust its stiffness to fulfill different task requirements. In this paper, a cable-driven manipulator with the ability to significantly regulate its stiffness through tension manipulation is introduced. Variable stiffness is achieved by attaching a novel variable stiffness device along each driving cable, in which the stiffness of the device is a function the cable tension. As cable-driven manipulator has actuation redundancy, the tension distribution can be manipulated even at a stationary pose. Such property allows the cable-driven manipulator to adjust the stiffness of each variable stiffness device, thereby changing the stiffness of the manipulator. The design and analysis of the variable stiffness device is presented. The variable stiffness device uses commercial torsion springs, and has a compact and light-weight design. Experimental and simulation results verified that cable-driven manipulator with such variable stiffness devices is able to achieve significant stiffness regulation.
