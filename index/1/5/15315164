With the selection of devices encompassing a wider range of computing surfaces, along with the near ubiquity of wireless networks, the nature of the workspace has become distributed over multiple locations and digital artifacts. We interviewed 22 professionals across a wide range of industries about their use of artifacts in their workflows to dis-cover new cross-device interaction paradigms and issues. We explore the impact of today's cloud services and app-based computing on how devices are used together. Gaps in data management and cross-device interactions were identified as the main obstacles and opportunities for improvement for multi-device interaction.
