A crucial issue in programming hierarchical distributed-shared memory systems is the workload decomposition. In this paper we address this issue in the framework of porting typical particle in cell (PIC) applications on hierarchical distributed-shared memory parallel systems. The workload decomposition we have devised consists in a two-stage procedure: a higher-level decomposition among the computational nodes, and a lower-level one among the processors of each computational node. We have implemented the described work decomposition without large programming effort by using and integrating the high-level languages High Performance Fortran and OpenMP.
