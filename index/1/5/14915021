We review recent results on inferencing for SROEL(Ã—), a description logic that subsumes the main features of the W3C recommendation OWL EL. Rule-based deduction systems are developed for various reasoning tasks and logical sublanguages. Certain feature combinations lead to increased space upper bounds for materialisation, suggesting that efficient implementations are easier to obtain for suitable fragments of OWL EL.
