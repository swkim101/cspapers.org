In order to address the under-representation of women in Computer Science, we have created a program for middle-school girls that specifically aims to change their attitudes about CS and encourages them to see it as a potential career. Our assessment of the program shows that it did indeed have a significant, positive impact and suggests that this was still in effect three months later. This paper describes the program and its assessment, and makes suggestions for those considering offering a similar program.
