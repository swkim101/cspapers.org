Several attempts have been lately proposed to tackle the problem of recovering the original image of an underwater scene using a sequence distorted by water waves. The main drawback of the state of the art [18] is that it heavily depends on modelling the waves, which in fact is ill-posed since the actual behavior of the waves along with the imaging process are complicated and include several noise components; therefore, their results are not satisfactory. In this paper, we revisit the problem by proposing a data-driven two-stage approach, each stage is targeted toward a certain type of noise. The first stage leverages the temporal mean of the sequence to overcome the structured turbulence of the waves through an iterative robust registration algorithm. The result of the first stage is a high quality mean and a better structured sequence; however, the sequence still contains unstructured sparse noise. Thus, we employ a second stage at which we extract the sparse errors from the sequence through rank minimization. Our method converges faster, and drastically outperforms state of the art on all testing sequences even only after the first stage.
