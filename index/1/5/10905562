This paper describes a syntactic representation for modeling speech repairs. This representation makes use of a right corner transform of syntax trees to produce a tree representation in which speech repairs require very few special syntax rules, making better use of training data. PCFGs trained on syntax trees using this model achieve high accuracy on the standard Switchboard parsing task.
