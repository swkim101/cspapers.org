We propose a nonmonotonic extension of low complexity Description Logics EL⊥ and DL-Litecore for reasoning about typicality and defeasible properties. The resulting logics are called EL⊥Tmin and DL-LitecTmin. Concerning DL-LitecTmin, we prove that entailment is in Π2p. With regard to EL⊥Tmin, we first show that entailment remains EXPTIME-hard. Next we consider the known fragment of Left Local EL⊥Tmin and we prove that the complexity of entailment drops to Π2p.
