Three-dimensional Multicore Systems present unique opportunities for proximity driven data placement in the memory banks. Coupled with distributed memory controllers, a design trend seen in recent systems, we propose a Dynamic Memory Relocator for 3D Multicores (DMR3D) to dynamically migrate physical pages among different memory controllers. Our proposed technique avoids long interconnect delays, and increases the use of vertical interconnect, thereby substantially reducing memory access latency and communication energy. Our techniques show 30% and 25% average performance and communication energy improvement on real world applications.
