Relational database theory has discovered complete axiomatizations for functional and multivalued dependencies. However, a database design system that makes use of dependencies declared by the user must deal with some more general kinds of dependencies than these— at least with embedded multivalued dependencies. Yet no axiomatization for embedded multivalued dependencies is known. In this paper, we define a more general class of dependencies, called “template dependencies” and give a complete axiomatization for these. We then discuss the interaction between functional dependencies and template dependencies.
