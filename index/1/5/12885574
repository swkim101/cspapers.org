Secure Xenix * is an experimental system designed to run on IBM PC/AT workstations. Like Xenix, it is a Unix implementation on the PC/AT workstation; unlike Xenix, it eliminates the Unix security deficiencies and it enhances security policies. In this paper, we present the design features of Secure Xenix, their integration within Xenix, and some of the lessons learned from this experiment to date. In addition, we address some of the problems specific to workstations in the security management area. The major design differences between Secure Xenix and other experiments with Unix security enhancements, such as LINUS IV, are also presented. In a companion paper, we present the important problems that arise in the testing of Secure Xenix and their solutions.
