There is a large continuing project at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory aimed towards the development of a system capable of interesting perceptual-motor behavior. This paper presents a brief outline of the currently active efforts and suggests references for more detailed information. A more thorough discussion of the effort to organize a visual perception system is presented.
