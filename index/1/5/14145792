AltiVec technology is Motorolaâ€™s high-performance vector parallel processing extension to the PowerPC RISC microprocessor. It is designed to improve the performance of algorithms and applications that can exploit data parallelism such as tho se in digital signal processing (DSP) and multimedia. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the AltiVec technology on a set of common DSP and multimedia algorithms. These algorithms include digital filters, fast Fourier transforms, inverse d iscrete cosine transforms, and vector arithmetic. Ea ch algorithm has one non-AltiVec version, and one version implemented with the AltiVec instruction se t by using the AltiVec programming model. The AltiVec version of the algorithms is evaluated usin g an AltiVec emulator. Traces for both versions are obtained by using an AltiVec-enabled trace generator, and trace-driven simulation is performed by using a cycle-accurate performance simulator. The observed speedup for the AltiVec version of DSP and multimedia algorithms ranges from a factor of 1.60 up to 11.66, and the number of dynamic instructions is reduced by a factor of 1.82 up to 10.25. In add ition to quantifying the speedup, we also perform detailed instruction level analysis, which helps to understand issues that become significant while uti lizing AltiVec to exploit SIMD parallelism. Efficie nt utilization of a vector extension such as AltiVec c urrently requires significant programming effort. * L.
