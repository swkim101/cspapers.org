Active learning and using visualization tools provide an effective approach in computer science education. Without meaningful hands-on exercises or access to training tools, it is usually difficult for students to understand or elaborate on complex algorithms, protocols, and concepts underlying different aspects of computing. This paper introduces a tool, IPsecLite, which demonstrates the inner-working of IP Security (IPsec) standard. Built on many networking technologies and cryptographic techniques, IPsec provides services to secure network communication. We introduce IPsecLite through a series of labs that can be used in several security courses. IPsecLite is fully developed and can be easily integrated into curriculum.
