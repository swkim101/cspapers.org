This paper analyzes relationships between the roles of descriptions and actions in large scale, open ended, geographically distributed, concurrent systems. Rather than attempt to deal with the complexities and ambiguities of currently implemented descriptive languages, we concentrate our analysis on what can be expressed in the underlying frameworks such as the lambda calculus and first order logic. By this means we conclude that descriptions and actions complement one another; neither being sufficient unto itself. This paper provides a basis to begin the analysis of the very subtle relationships that hold between descriptions and actions in Open Systems.
