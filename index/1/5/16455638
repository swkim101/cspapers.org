An adaptive cache coherence protocol changes its actions to address changing program behaviors. We present an adaptive protocol called Cachet for distributed sharedmemory systems. Cachet is a seamless integration of several micro-protocols, each of which has been optimized for a particular memory access pattern. Cachet embodies both intraprotocol and inter-protocol adaptivity, and exploits adaptivity to achieve high performance under changing memory access patterns. Cachet is presented in the context of a mechanism-oriented memory model, Commit-Reconcile & Fences (CRF), which is a generalization of sequential consistency and other weaker memory models in use today. A protocol to implement CRF is automatically a correct implementation of any memory model whose programs can be expressed as CRF programs.
