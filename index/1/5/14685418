People choose their favorite supermarket based on many factors including how the place is designed and organized. Customers generally perceive their shopping experience in an aggregated way, which leaves little room for supermarkets managers to understand what triggers negative feelings. Moreover, adapting the supermarket design to clients' needs is crucial to retain current customers. Accommodating facilities make shoppers feel pleased. In this paper we show the design and initial deployment of a pervasive system that registers location-stamped stress levels of supermarket customers during their shopping. The system aims to discover stress hot spots in a supermarket, which will help managers locate and solve design and store management deficiencies.
