This demo presents Spotlights, a technique to facilitate skim reading, or the activity of rapidly comprehending long documents such as webpages or PDFs. Users mainly use continuous rate-based scrolling to skim. However, visual attention fails when scrolling rapidly due to excessive number of objects and brief exposure per object. Spotlights supports continuous scrolling at high speeds. It selects a small number of objects and raises them to transparent overlays (spotlights) in the viewer. Spotlights stay static for a prolonged time and then fade away. The technical contribution is novel method for ?brokering? user?s attentional resources in a way that guarantees sufficient attentional resources for some objects, even at very high scrolling rates. It facilitates visual attention by (1) decreasing the number of objects competing for divided attention and (2) by ensuring sufficient processing time per object.
