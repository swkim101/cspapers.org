This paper outlines the experience of the author in teaching computer programming and simulation concepts to thirty high school students as part of a National Science Foundation Summer Institute in probability and computing.2 It is hoped that the experience and observations reported in this paper might help others who might become involved in a similar course. There is certainly no doubt that students at this age level are capable of doing sophisticated work in computing. This program consisted only of high ability students; however, the author's experience with this program and another high school program with students with less ability indicates that students do not have to be of high ability in order to be attracted to and do well in computing. As is true of almost any area of study, what is particularly needed for success is motivation. Students with average or above average ability can do quite well in computing if they are motivated to do so.
