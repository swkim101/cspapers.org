This paper considers the subset selection problem with a monotone objective function and a monotone cost constraint, which relaxes the submodular property of previous studies. We ﬁrst show that the approximation ratio of the generalized greedy algorithm is (cid:11) 2 (1 (cid:0) 1 e (cid:11) ) (where (cid:11) is the submodu-larity ratio); and then propose POMC, an anytime randomized iterative approach that can utilize more time to ﬁnd better solutions than the generalized greedy algorithm. We show that POMC can obtain the same general approximation guarantee as the generalized greedy algorithm, but can achieve better solutions in cases and applications.
