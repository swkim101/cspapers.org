 with many applications in the areas of bioinformatics and computational genomics. Although significant efforts
 have been made to address the problem and its special cases, the increasing complexity and size of biological
 data require more efficient methods applicable to an arbitrary number of strings. In this paper, a novel search
 algorithm, MLCS-A*, is presented for the general case of multiple LCS (or MLCS) problems. MLCS-A* is a variant
 of the A* algorithm. It maximizes a new heuristic estimate of the LCS in each search step so that the longest
 common subsequence can be found. As a natural extension of MLCS-A*, a fast algorithm, MLCS-APP, is also proposed
 to deal with large volume of biological data for which finding a LCS within reasonable time is impossible. The
 benchmark test shows that MLCS-APP is able to extract common subsequences close to the optimal ones and that
 MLCS-APP significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches. When applied to 8 protein domain families,
 MLCS-APP produced more accurate results than existing multiple sequence alignment methods.
