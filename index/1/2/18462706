Due to the wide acceptance of object-oriented database systems, some implementation issues such as query processing and indexing become a crucial factor in the success of object-oriented database systems. To tackle the issues, we propose an s-signature scheme, which is an efficient access method for query processing, especially, when the path dictionary is used. We also compare the s-signature scheme with other indexing techniques such as path index, path signature, and path dictionary. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method shows significant improvements in the retrieval operation, while at the same time producing lower storage overhead than the path index.
