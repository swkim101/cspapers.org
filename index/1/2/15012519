Resilient localization and navigation for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) still remains a challenge in certain scenarios, like GPS-deprived environments such as indoors or urban canyons. In this work, we explore a heterogeneous UAV swarm design, in which a small number of sensor and computationally powerful UAVs collaborate with the remaining resource-constrained UAVs to guarantee optimal localization accuracy.
