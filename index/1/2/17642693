With the emergence of inexpensive network components and high-speed network services, a variety of network-capable electronic devices have become available. However, as no self-defence mechanism is equipped in a usual network device, the device can be attacked by other devices or by attackers, which causes it in a vulnerable state. In this paper, we propose a system for keeping an Intra-LAN in a secure state with isolation of such a network information device. The system the communications between devices in the LAN by introducing the safety-and-performance ratio control policies. The control policies are controlled dynamically. The isolation of a devices is performed using an intrusion detection system. A secure LAN can be maintained by the dynamic controlled policies.We have confirmed that the LAN can keep secure with actual LAN environment experiments of our system.
