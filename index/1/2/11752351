We address the problem of knowledge acquisition for alarm correlation in a complex dynamic system like a telecommunications network. To reduce the amount of information coming from telecommunications equipment, one needs to preprocess the alarm stream and we propose here a way to acquire some knowledge to do that. The key idea is that only the frequent alarm sets are relevant for reducing the information stream: we aggregate frequent relevant information and suppress frequent noisy information. We propose algorithms for analysing alarm logs: first stage is to discover frequently occurring temporally-constrained alarm sets (called chronicles) and second stage is to filter them according to their interdependency level. We also show experimental results with an actual telecommunications ATM network.
