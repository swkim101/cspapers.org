This paper describes the Ready-to-Live project carried out at the ETH Zurich, Electronics Laboratory in collaboration with Swiss Textile College (STF) during the 2010 spring semester. The goal of the project was to provide an interdisciplinary collaboration for technical and fashion students, and to present the final result in a real fashion show. In this paper, we show how we integrated wearable sensors into fashionable clothes in order to express different feelings and emotions. We explain first the technical implementation and then we present the design aspects of the final outfits.
