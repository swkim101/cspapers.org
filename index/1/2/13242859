Multiprocessor computer systems have proven effective as high performance switching nodes in packet switched data communications networks. They are well suited to performing the required queuing, routing, and scheduling tasks, and can scale upward to provide higher system throughput when combined with software that exploits the parallelism provided by the hardware. This paper describes the packet switch used in the DARPA Wideband Packet Satellite Network and the Butterfly#8482; Multiprocessor on which it is based.
