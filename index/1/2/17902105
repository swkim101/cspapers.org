Models built into computer assisted instructional courses have several advantages. They make the underlying theoretical assumptions more explicit and, at the same time, give a clearer direction to the actual development of the CAI program. The purpose of this discussion is to present some of the areas in which models have had an implicit or explicit impact and to indicate how our current work is focused by these efforts.
 The main purpose of the modeling discussed here is to provide better, more effective instruction (models of the learner) with substantially generated curriculum (models of the discipline). The drill and practice context is emphasized because that is one with a history of models in both areas and one which has demonstrated potential.
