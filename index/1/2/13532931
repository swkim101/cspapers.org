Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been a powerful tool to investigate gene networks in biological sciences [1]. Visualisation of data produced by NGS is essential for the interpretation of the findings by biological scientists. Here we describe a workflow to image findings from a NGS sequencing methodology to investigate gene expression that can be visualised with Circus software [2]. Visualisation of these processes has provided biological scientists with valuable interpretation of high throughput data and identification of new transcripts.
