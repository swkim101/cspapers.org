This paper presents a new type of online password guessing attack called "WiPING" (Wi-Fi signal-based PIN Guessing attack) to guess a victim's PIN (Personal Identification Number) within a small number of unlock attempts. WiPING uses wireless signal patterns identified from observing sequential finger movements involved in typing a PIN to unlock a mobile device. A list of possible PIN candidates is generated from the wireless signal patterns, and is used to improve performance of PIN guessing attacks. We implemented a proof-of-concept attack to demonstrate the feasibility of WiPING. Our results showed that WiPING could be practically effective: while pure guessing attacks failed to guess all 20 PINs, WiPING successfully guessed two PINs.
