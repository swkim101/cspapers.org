We propose a technique for analyzing cache-related preemption delays of tasks that cause unpredictable variation in task execution time in the context of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. The proposed technique consists of two steps. The first step performs a per-task analysis to estimate cache-related preemption cost for each execution point in a given task from the number of useful cache blocks at the execution point. The second step computes the worst case response time of each task using a response time equation and a linear programming technique which takes as its input the preemption cost information of tasks obtained in the first step. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique gives a prediction of the worst case cache-related preemption delay that is up to 60% tighter than that obtained from previous approaches.
