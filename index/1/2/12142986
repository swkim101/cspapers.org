The bulk of previous work on goal and plan recognition may be crudely stereotyped in one of two ways. "Neat" theories -- rigorous, justified, but not yet practical. "Scruffy" systems -- heuristic, domain specific, but practical. In contrast, we describe a goal recognition module that is provably sound and polynomial-time and that performs well in a real domain. Our goal recognizer observes actions executed by a human, and repeatedly prunes inconsistent actions and goals from a graph representation of the domain. We report on experiments on human subjects in the Unix domain that demonstrate our algorithm to be fast in practice. The average time to process an observed action with an initial set of 249 goal schemas and 22 action schemas was 1.4 cpu seconds on a SPARC-10.
