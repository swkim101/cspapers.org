The Pledge of the Computing Professional (http://computing-professional.org), endorsed by SIGCAS and the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics, was developed to both support professional responsibility in computing and to raise awareness of one's ethical responsibilities. To date, 25 institutions across the US have conducted Pledge Ceremonies to welcome their graduates into the computing profession. In a recent Inroads article, Don Gotterbarn asserts that, if one's ethics is influenced by those around us, then "just being aware of the existence of this Pledge helps to refocus us all on our own responsibility and the profession's responsibility." So in what ways can this Pledge be used both inside and outside of the classroom to better promote such traits? This session is for those interested in computing ethics and professional responsibility to get together and collaborate on new initiatives featuring The Pledge of the Computing Professional as a means to this end.
