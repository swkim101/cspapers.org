Approximately 800,000 people in the United States survive a stroke each year, and many will need some form of motor rehabilitation [1]. The rehabilitation process often involves repetitive tasks, making it difficult to consistently perform exercises without outside support. A possible source of support and motivation, between visits to an occupational or physical therapist, is a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). However, a greater understanding of how to motivate a patient is needed in order to provide this type of support with a SAR. An important factor underlying motivation is self-efficacy, a person’s belief about their ability to perform a task. In this work, we develop an autonomous SAR capable of guiding a person through a button-reaching task and providing feedback on their performance. We then compare the effects of two types of comparative feedback that have been shown to increase performance on motor learning tasks [2] to no comparative feedback given by a robot coach on a person’s self-efficacy for a reaching task.
