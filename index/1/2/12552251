The skyline operator has recently emerged as an alternative to ranking queries. It retrieves a number of potential best options for arbitrary monotone preference functions. The success of this operator in the database community is based on the belief that users benefit from the limited effort required to specify skyline queries compared to, for instance, ranking. While application examples of the skyline operator exist, there is no principled analysis of its benefits and limitations in data retrieval tasks. Our study investigates the degree to which users understand skyline queries, how they specify query parameters and how they interact with skyline results made available in listings or map-based interfaces.
