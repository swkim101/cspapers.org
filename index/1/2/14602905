Leaf identification is a challenging research. So far, many approaches have been proposed. In this paper, an approach that combines Fourier descriptors with other shape features was investigated to identify 100 hundred kinds of leaves. The result shows that the combination of Fourier descriptors and several other shape features can be used to identify leaves with the accuracy rate of 88%. This result indicates that this approach is a promising way for identifying leaves.
