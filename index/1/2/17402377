To this end, samples are represented by sparse codes inheriting their graph structure while the labeled samples within the same class are represented with group sparsity, sharing the same atoms of the dictionary. Instead of statically combining graph and group structures, we take advantage of them in a mutually reinforcing way â€” in the dictionary learning phase, we introduce the unlabeled samples into groups by an entropy-based method and then update the corresponding local graph, resulting in a more structured and discriminative dictionary. We analyze the relationship between the two structures and prove the convergence of our proposed method. Focusing on image classification task, we evaluate our approach on several datasets and obtain superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of only a few labeled samples and limited dictionary size.
