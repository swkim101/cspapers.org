Target tracking is a typical and important application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A lot of target tracking protocols have been proposed, whereas few of them are implemented into real systems. In this paper, we develop a real target tracking system, called HieTrack, for energy efficient and real-time target tracking in WSNs. The system relies on the cluster-based network architecture and contends for network cost minimization by selectively activating appropriate senor nodes according to the prediction of target trajectory. The estimated locations of the target can be routed to the base station via the backbone composed by the cluster heads. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also designed complementarily to facilitate users while monitoring the status of the sensor network. The efficiency of our system is validated by experiments.
