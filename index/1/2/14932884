The objective of this research project is to define a solution for integrating multiple databases. These databases contain structured data, typical for business applications. Important considerations are: to provide flexibility to adjust to changing data retrieval requirements, to accommodate different data models, and to focus on the user's role in defining the solution. 
DIRECT is a query facility for heterogeneous databases. The databases and their definitions can differ in their data models, names, types and encoded values. Instead of creating a global schema, descriptions of different databases are allowed to coexist. DIRECT assists the user in specifying a multi-database query and in identifying semantically equivalent data elements interactively. A multi-database query not only retrieves data from multiple databases, but also defines alternative schema representations, specifies semantically equivalent data elements and converts data values. DIRECT has been evaluated for its usability and exercised with operational databases that are part of an automated business system.
