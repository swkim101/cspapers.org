Recent advances in sensor networks permit the use of a large number of relatively inexpensive distributed computational nodes with camera sensors linked in a network and possibly linked to one or more central servers. We argue that the full potential of such a distributed system can be realized if it is designed as a distributed search engine where images from different sensors can be captured, stored, searched and queried. However, unlike traditional image search engines that are focused on resource-rich situations, the resource limitations of camera sensor networks in terms of energy, bandwidth, computational power, and memory capacity present significant challenges. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a distributed search system over a camera sensor network where each node is a search engine that senses, stores and searches information. Our work involves innovation at many levels including local storage, local search, and distributed search, all of which are designed to be efficient under the resource constraints of sensor networks. We present an implementation of the search engine on a network of iMote2 sensor nodes equipped with low-power cameras and extended flash storage. We evaluate our system for a dataset comprising book images, and demonstrate more than two orders of magnitude reduction in the amount of data communicated and up to 5x reduction in overall energy consumption over alternate techniques.
