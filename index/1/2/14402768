Collaborative filtering is a fundamental building block in many recommender systems. While most of the existing collaborative filtering methods focus on explicit, multi-class settings (e.g., 1-5 stars in movie recommendation), many real-world applications actually belong to the one-class setting where user feedback is implicitly expressed (e.g., views in news recommendation and video recommendation). The main challenges in such one-class setting include the ambiguity of the unobserved examples and the sparseness of existing positive examples. In this paper, we propose a dual-regularized model for one-class collaborative filtering. In particular, we address the ambiguity challenge by integrating two state-of-the-art one-class collaborative filtering methods to enjoy the best of both worlds. We tackle the sparseness challenge by exploiting the side information from both users and items. Moreover, we propose efficient algorithms to solve the proposed model. Extensive experimental evaluations on two real data sets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. Overall, the proposed method leads to 7.9% - 21.1% improvement over its best known competitors in terms of prediction accuracy, while enjoying the linear scalability.
