This paper presents the design and development of a 3-axial artificial vestibular system to be integrated on robotic heads, in order to provide a sense of head position and motion. In accordance with the role of the vestibular system in humans, this artificial vestibular system is specifically devoted to regulate and stabilize gaze during head motion, by means of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) mechanism. Future applications explore the possibility of using the artificial vestibular system on human heads, as an indirect interface between humans and robots, for 'tele-control'.
