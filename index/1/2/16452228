Measuring word relatedness is an important ingredient of many NLP applications. Several datasets have been developed in order to evaluate such measures. The main drawback of existing datasets is the focus on single words, although natural language contains a large proportion of multiword terms. We propose the new TR9856 dataset which focuses on multi-word terms and is significantly larger than existing datasets. The new dataset includes many real world terms such as acronyms and named entities, and further handles term ambiguity by providing topical context for all term pairs. We report baseline results for common relatedness methods over the new data, and exploit its magnitude to demonstrate that a combination of these methods outperforms each individual method.
