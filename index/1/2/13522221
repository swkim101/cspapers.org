Occlusion is usually modelled in two images symmetrically in previous stereo algorithms which cannot work for multi-view stereo efficiently. In this paper, we present a novel formulation that handles occlusion using only one depth map in an asymmetrical way. Consequently, multi-view information is efficiently accumulated to achieve high accuracy. The resulting energy function is complex and approximate graph cut based solutions are proposed. Our approach complements the theory and extends the applicability of using graph cut in stereo. The experiments demonstrate that the approach is comparable with the state of the art and potentially more efficient for multi-view stereo.
