Policy-makers, ISPs and content providers are locked in a debate about who can control the Internet traffic that flows into our homes. In this paper we argue that the user, not the ISP or the content provider, should decide how traffic is prioritized to and from the home. Home users know most about their preferences, and if they can express them well to the ISP, then both the ISP and user are better off. To test the idea we built a prototype that lets users express highlevel preferences that are translated to low-level semantics and used to control the network.
