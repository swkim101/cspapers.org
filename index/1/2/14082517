We introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for comparing the expected values of the number of failures caused by applications of software testing techniques. Our conditions are based only on the knowledge of a total or even a hierarchical order among the failure rates of the subdomains of a program's input domain. We also prove conditions for comparing the probability of causing at least one failure in three important special cases.
