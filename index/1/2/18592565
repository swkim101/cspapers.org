As an important supporting technology of Market Intelligence (MI), Web data integration is facing new challenges, such as the integrity of data acquisition, the quality of data extraction and data consolidation. To solve such problems, we propose an MI-oriented web data integration system (MI-WDIS), which achieves excellent performances in integrating Surface Web and Deep Web data with much less manual work. Based on MI-WDIS, we have developed a platform for intelligent analysis of job data. The platform collects tens of thousands of job data daily and provides personalized services for job seekers through diversified channels. Besides, it provides other advanced services, including intelligence analysis, automatic monitoring and alerting, for various organizations, such as enterprises, training institutions and recruitment agencies.
