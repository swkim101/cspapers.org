In this paper we study performance achievable in delayed bilateral teleoperation control. Our goal is to characterize all teleoperation system behaviors that can be achieved with delayed communication but without any restrictive assumptions on the control law, such as passivity. To this end, a recent non-restrictive stabilizing control architecture for bilateral teleoperation is exploited. The main properties of this architecture are discussed and used to obtain parameterization of all the admittance matrices feasible under the nominal stability constraint. The use of this parameterization for shaping system behavior is demonstrated and the results are compared with those obtained using the classical passivity-based control schemes.
