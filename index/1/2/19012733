In recent years, Wi-Fi has seen extraordinary growth; however, due to the cost, performance and security issues, many Wi-Fi hotspot owners would like to restrict the network access only to individuals inside the physical property. Unfortunately, due to the nature of wireless, this is difficult to accomplish, especially with the off-the-shelf omni-antenna devices. In this work, we develop and implement CLaWa, a Crowdsourced Location Aware Wi-Fi Access Control scheme to address this challenge. Our system is based on observations of differing characteristics of physical layer information across physical boundaries such as walls and corners. CLaWa crowdsources both channel state information (CSI) and received signal strength (RSS) of already validated users to classify future users. We have also selected an appropriate machine learning algorithm for CLaWa. Evaluation results show that CLaWa can identify the boundary around a given area precisely, thus granting network access only to users inside the area while not validating users outside the boundary. Compared to indoor localization schemes, CLaWa is a lightweight solution which does not require expensive localization operations.
