The validity of semantic inferences depends on the contexts in which they are applied. We propose a generic framework for handling contextual considerations within applied inference, termed Contextual Preferences . This framework deÔ¨Ånes the various context-aware components needed for inference and their relationships. Contextual preferences extend and generalize previous notions, such as se-lectional preferences, while experiments show that the extended framework allows improving inference quality on real application data.
