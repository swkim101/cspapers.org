Computer Science contains a large number of new concepts well outside most students' prior experience. An important characteristic of many of these concepts is their dynamic nature: the execution of a program, assignment of a value to a variable, change of machine state following an interrupt, convergence on a root. By using the computer itself as my demonstration apparatus, I propose to give the students personal exposure to the concepts in action. With a low-cost interactive CRT terminal and video projector, I can show various aspects of a program executing, for instance, at comparatively low investment in machine and people time.
