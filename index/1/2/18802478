Direct photometric visual servoing uses only the pure image information as a visual feature, instead of using classic geometric features such as points or lines. It was demonstrated efficiently in 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) positioning. However, in micro-scale, using only image intensity as a visual feature performs unsatisfactorily in cases where the photometric variation is low, such as motions along vision sensor's focal axis under a high magnification. In order to improve the performance and accuracy in those cases, an approach using hybrid visual features is proposed in this paper. Image gradient is employed as a visual feature on z axis while image intensity is used on the other 5 DoFs to control the motion. A 6-DoF micro-positioning task is accomplished by this hybrid visual servoing scheme. The experimental results obtained on a parallel positioning micro-stage under a digital microscope show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.
