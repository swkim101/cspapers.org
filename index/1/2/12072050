Direct marketing is an increasingly popular application of data mining. In this paper we summarize some of our own experiences from various data mining application projects for direct marketing. We focus on a particular project environment and describe tools which address issues across the whole data mining process. These tools include a Quick Reference Guide for the standardization of the process and for user guidance and a library of re-usable procedures in the commercial data mining tool Clementine. We report experiences with these tools and identify open issues requiring further research. In particular, we focus on evaluation measures for predictive models.
