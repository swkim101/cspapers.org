Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been considered as a promising candidate for on-chip last-level caches, replacing SRAM for better energy efficiency, smaller die footprint, and scalability. However, it also introduces several new challenges into last-level cache design that need to be overcome for feasible deployment of STT-RAM caches. Among other things, mitigating the impact of slow and energy-hungry write operations is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to reduce write activities of STT-RAM last-level caches. The key observation is that a significant amount of data written to last-level caches is not actually re-referenced again during the lifetime of the corresponding cache blocks. Such write operations, which we call dead writes, can bypass the cache without incurring extra misses by definition. Based on this, we propose Dead Write Prediction Assisted STT-RAM Cache Architecture (DASCA), which predicts and bypasses dead writes for write energy reduction. For this purpose, we first propose a novel classification of dead writes, which is composed of dead-on-arrival fills, dead-value fills, and closing writes, as a theoretical model for redundant write elimination. On top of that, we present a dead write predictor based on a state-of-the-art dead block predictor. Evaluations show that our architecture achieves an energy reduction of 68% (62%) in last-level caches and an additional energy reduction of 10% (16%) in main memory and even improves system performance by 6% (14%) on average compared to the STT-RAM baseline in a single-core (quad-core) system.
