This paper is concerned with the design and implementation of a new concept of robot to clean the underwater sections of ship hulls without using any magnetic attachment. The use of this type of robots on a regular basis to preserve a clean hull, usually when ships are in port or anchored, will improve the efficiency of the ships and will permit a reduction in the use of chemicals that are harmful to the environment to prevent the growth of marine life on the hull. The main contribution of the robot described in this paper is that it is a completely novel design that through an appropriate morphology solves the problems that arise when moving along hulls, including changing planes, negotiating appendices, portholes, corners, and other elements. It thus provides a basis for completely autonomous operation. The design and implementation of the robot is described and some simulations and tests in real environments are presented.
