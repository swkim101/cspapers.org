Fueled by the large number of powerful tight-weight portable computers, the expanding availability of wirel= networks, and the popularity of the Internet, there is an increasing de mand to connect portable computers to the Internet at any time and in any place. However, the dynamic nature of such connectivity requires more flexible network support than has typically been atiable for stationary workstations. ThM paper introducw the following two me~anisms, in the context of Mobile 1P [24], to ensure a mobile hostâ€™s convenient and efficient communication with other hosts in a &anging environment. One me&anism supports multiple packet defivery methods (such as regular 1P or Mobile 1P) and adaptively selects the most appropriate one to use Wcordlng to the char=teristim of eti trfic flow. The other medanism enables a mobile host to make use of multiple wtive network interfww simultaneously and to control the selection of the most dwirable network interfaces for both outgoing and incoming pdets for different traffic flows. We demonstrate the usefdnm of these two network layer me&anisms and describe how they are implemented.
