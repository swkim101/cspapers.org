Instruction on web programming at an advanced level in computer science has been in high demand in recent years. The topics and technologies in this area are so vast and diverse that designing and teaching a course requires vast knowledge and the ability to select coherent topics and technologies that can be presented in a semester. The students should learn enough of the underlying fundamental concepts along with the selected technologies so that they can practise in the real world setting while being able to adapt and expand beyond what was taught in class. Very few courses of this kind if any have been taught. We describe such a course, called Web Software Architecture, that we created and have taught successfully last Spring. It is a junior/senior level computer science elective course that uses Java, Servlets, JavaServer Pages, HTML, JavaScript, JDBC, and the Apache-Tomcat web server as key technologies. Our experience supports the assertion that such a web programming course has a legitimate place in a computer science curriculum.
