We present a new strategy for semantic paramodulation for Horn sets and prove its completeness The strategy requires for each paramoduiation that either both parents be false positive units or that one parent and the paramodulant both be false relative to an interpretation We also discuss some of the issues involved in choosing an interpretation that has a chance of giving better performance that simple set-of-support paramoduiation.
