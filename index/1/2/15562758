In this paper we study diversity and its relations to search relevance in the context of an online marketplace. We conduct a large-scale log-based study using click-stream data from a leading eCommerce site. We introduce 3 main metrics -- selection (diversity), trust, and value. In our analysis we also show how these interact with relevance in different ways. We study the benefits of diversity and also show why guaranteeing diversity is important.
