Code.org first exploded on the CS education scene in Feb 2013 with its first video featuring Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates talking about computer science. 10 months later, it launched an Hour of Code campaign that has taken the world by storm. Reaching 10 million students in just 3 days, the Hour of Code became the fastest-spreading service in the history of technology OR education. Code.org founder Hadi Partovi will talk about how he came up with the concepts behind these grassroots campaigns, and how Code.org hopes to harness the reach of the broader CS community to grow computer science education in schools.
