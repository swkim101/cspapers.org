It is well known a fine tuned unpowered biped machine can passively walk down a gentle slope. The in-depth understanding of the passivity is helpful to design more efficient bipedal gaits. In this paper, we investigate the principle mechanism of passive dynamic walking and propose a unified framework for virtual passive bipedal gait generation. The framework shows the physical system's kinetic energy varies inversely proportional to the imitated virtual system's potential energy. Based on this property we propose a kinetic energy tracking control law to realize virtual passive dynamic walking on any slopes in any virtual gravity fields. Numerical simulations are given to support our proposal.
