It is very important and hard to develop motions and behaviors for robots that have complex body and numerous actuators and sensors. The more complex a humanoid's body becomes, the more important the developing environment of the motions and behaviors will be. We have built a fully muscle-driven flexible-spine humanoid named "Kenta", which has 96 actuators and more than 400 sensors including tension sensors, posture sensors, vision sensors, and so on. This paper describes the developing environment of motions and behaviors for the robots like Kenta. A visualizable geometric model, a simulation environment transparent to the real environment, sample procedures of the motion development, and, as an example, realization of swing behavior by Kenta are presented.
