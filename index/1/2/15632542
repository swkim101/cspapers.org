It has become common to connect local-area networks together to form high-bandwidth internetworks. The topology of such an internetwork — how the component networks and gateways are interconnected — is an important factor in determining the reliability of the internet. We present several techniques for analyzing an internetwork's topology. These techniques are based on a novel mapping of network components onto a bipartite graph.
We use these techniques to analyze the topology of the Stanford University Network and the impact of topological changes as it has grown to its current size of 60 networks.
