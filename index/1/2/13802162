The Demo Track is one of the most exciting parts of any Web Conference. It allows researchers and practitioners to demonstrate new systems in an engaging and hands-on manner to the community. The Web has been driven forward by building systems and technology. The demo track is a venue that encourages this sort of important type of result This year the track received 71 submissions of those 30 were accepted for a 42% accept rate. We had a comprehensive review procedure that looked at a number of dimensions including the novelty of the demo, its fit with the conference, its research content, and its potential for audience engagement. We were pleased by the number of submissions that included links to online demonstrations and/or videos. This gave reviewers additional information about how the demo would be presented. Overall, we had 232 reviews across all submissions. Many of the reviews provided not only a their expert judgement but ways in which the submissions could be improved. It is often difficult judging demonstrations as there are multiple factors to be taken into account. We want to thank the entire committee for taking the time to support the track. The resulting set of selected demos reflects the wide-variety of technology and research interests impacting the wide. Demonstrations cover topics such as using data on the web, the integration of the web and the physical world, knowledge graphs, search engines, security and privacy, and dealing with multimedia data. We believe that these demos provide an exciting taste of the future of the Web.
