This paper discusses a dynamic nonprehensile manipulation by using a vibrating plate. The manipulation method, where two DOF (degrees of freedom) motion of an object on the plate surface is controlled by a single active joint, is proposed. For the plate vibration mechanism, we newly introduce an active-passive hybrid joint whose two axes are arranged in nonparallel to each other. This mechanism features the plate vibration trajectory is variable based on the input frequency. We then analytically derive the trajectory of object on the vibrating plate. Through this analysis, we reveal that two DOF motion of the object can be controlled by utilizing the variable vibration effect. Finally, we show experimental result by using the prototype robot, for confirming the validity of the proposed method.
