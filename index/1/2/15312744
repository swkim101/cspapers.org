The development of reliable documents is an important challenge facing the software industry today. This paper presents the Programming and Design Assist System (PDAS), which supports detailed design and implementation of system programs. PDAS uses a design language as the kernel of the system. Japanese/English documents and programs are generated from specifications written in the design language. The design language is a forms-oriented language based on PDL. To standardize the level of abstraction of document description, the language introduces a data model called a “set”. The model is an abstraction of linked lists, arrays, queues, and stacks. In operating systems, there are many such data structures, and the ability to simplify their manipulation is very helpful.
