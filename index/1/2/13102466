The Inverted Classroom is an exciting pedagogical technique where more passive information assimilation activities (e.g. lectures) are assigned as homework and class time is reserved for active applied problem solving and group activities. With current technology, instructors wishing to implement inverted classroom have a variety of options to create engaging and accessible learning modules. In this workshop, we will provide an overview of inverted classroom philosophy and some initial data from successful pilots of the inverted classroom. Participants will work in small groups to develop small inverted classroom activities using software and technology provided by the presenters. We will wrap up with presentations from the groups and a discussion about assessment. Laptop Recommended.
