Demand assignment protocols have been implemented in a large number of operational LANs. However, the analytic models for protocol evaluation currently capture only a limited range of LAN operational circumstances. In this paper we present an analytic tool for evaluating fair and prioritized demand assignment protocols with a relatively general workload model. We consider arbitrary and station dependent message size distributions and arrival rates. This allows the modeling of LANs with heterogeneous workloads, thus permitting a larger correspondence between the modeled system and the real life network.
