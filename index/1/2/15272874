In this paper, we discuss the simultaneous existence, and relationship between binary and ternary structures. We demonstrate which binary relationship cardinalities are permitted within ternary relationships, during ER modeling. We develop an Implicit Binary Cardinality rule (B3C rule), which states that, in any ternary relationship, the cardinality of any binmy relationship embedded in the ternary, is many-to-many when there are no explicit constraints on the data instances. We then present an Explicit Binary Permission rule (EBP rule), which explains and enumerates all permitted binary relationships for various cardinalities of ternary relationships. Finally we present an Implicit Binary Override rule (IBO rule), which states that the implicit binary cardinalities can be constrained in a ternary relationship by explicit constraints imposed by a binary relationship. We also detail how the cardinalities within the ternary are altered as the binary relationship is imposed. In discussing these findings, we consider the rules in the context of decomposing ternary relationships into multiple binary relationships.
