In a previous paper we developed an optical three-axis tactile sensor that can acquire normal and shearing forces to be mounted on a robotic finger. Normal and shearing forces applied to the sensing element were detected separately; when we examined the repeatability of the present tactile sensor with 1,000 loading-unloading cycles, the respective error of the normal forces was 2%. In the present paper, the three-axis tactile sensor is mounted on a robotic finger of three degrees of freedom to evaluate it for dexterous hands. A series of three kinds of experiments were performed. First, the robotic hand touches and scans flat specimens to evaluate the sensing ability of the friction coefficient. Second, it detects the contour of parallelepiped and cylindrical objects. Finally, it manipulates a parallelepiped case put on a table by sliding it on the table. Since the present robotic hand was able to perform the above three tasks with appropriate precision, we expected that it would be applicable to dexterous hands in subsequent studies.
