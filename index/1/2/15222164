This paper proposes a practical optimization method for layered neural networks, by which the optimal model and parameter can be found simultaneously. We modify the conventional information criterion into a differentiable function of parameters, and then, minimize it, while controlling it back to the ordinary form. Effectiveness of this method is discussed theoretically and experimentally.
