We study an explicit parametric model of documents, queries, and relevancy assessment for Information Retrieval (IR). Mean-field methods are applied to analyze the model and derive efficient practical algorithms to estimate the parameters in the problem. The hyperparameters are estimated by a fast approximate leave-one-out cross-validation procedure based on the cavity method. The algorithm is further evaluated on several benchmark databases by comparing with standard algorithms in IR.
