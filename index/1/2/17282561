Recently logics for strategic ability have gained pre-eminence in the modelisation and analysis of game-theoretic scenarios. In this paper we provide a contribution to the comparison of two popular frameworks: Concurrent Game Structures (CGS) and Coalition Logic of Propositional Control (CL-PC). Specifically, we ground the abstract abilities of agents in CGS on Propositional Control, thus obtaining a class of CGS that has the same expressive power as CL-PC. We study the computational properties of this setting. Further, we relax some of the assumptions of CL-PC so as to introduce a wider class of computationally-grounded CGS.
