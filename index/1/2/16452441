We present what we believe is the most efficient and quickest four-key text entry method available. H4-Writer uses Huffman coding to assign minimized key sequences to letters, with full access to error correction, punctuation, digits, modes, etc. The key sequences are learned quickly, and support eyes-free entry. With KSPC = 2.321, the effort to enter text is comparable to multitap on a mobile phone keypad; yet multitap requires nine keys. In a longitudinal study with six participants, an average text entry speed of 20.4 wpm was observed in the 10th session. Error rates were under 1%. To improve external validity, an extended session was included that required input of punctuation and other symbols. Entry speed dropped only by about 3 wpm, suggesting participants quickly leveraged their acquired skill with H4-Writer to access advanced features.
