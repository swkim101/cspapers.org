In this paper, targeting del.icio.us tag data, we propose a method, FolksoViz, for deriving subsumption relationships between tags by using Wikipedia texts, and visualizing a folksonomy. To fulfill this method, we propose a statistical model for deriving subsumption relationships based on the frequency of each tag on the Wikipedia texts, as well as the TSD (Tag Sense Disambiguation) method for mapping each tag to a corresponding Wikipedia text. The derived subsumption pairs are visualized effectively on the screen. The experiment shows that the FolksoViz manages to find the correct subsumption pairs with high accuracy.
