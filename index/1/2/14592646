The main theme of the 8th International Conference on Software Engineering is the “establishment of a better understanding of the software process and its improvement through the provision of better models, methods and tools.” This paper addresses the second half of this theme by defining the issues involved with making strategic improvements to environments and suggesting a process for “provisioning” (or providing) better computer-aided software engineering methods and tools.
The paper focuses primarily on the process for transforming existing, large to very large scale software development and support environments into conceptual “software factories.” To achieve this goal, arguments are made for strategically planning and developing well architected, modifiable software engineering environments. This is considered a prerequisite to effective “provisioning” of new and improved methods and tools.
Taken as a whole, the paper should be useful to software developers, tool providers and major software buyers alike. Through typical environment evolution scenarios and concrete examples, many useful suggestions are provided to each of these players on how they can assist in the software engineering improvement process.
