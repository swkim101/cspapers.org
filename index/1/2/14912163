With the prevalence of the geo-position enabled devices and services, a rapidly growing amount of tweets are associated with geo-tags. Consequently, the real time search on geo-tagged Twitter streams has attracted great attentions.In this paper, we advocate the significance of the co-occurrence of keywords for the geo-tagged tweets data analytics, which is overlooked by existing studies. Particularly, we formally introduce the problem of identifying local frequent keyword co-occurrence patterns over the geo-tagged Twitter streams, namely LFP\xspace query. To accommodate the high volume and the rapid updates of the Twitter stream, we develop an inverted KMV sketch (IK\xspace sketch for short) structure to capture the co-occurrence of keywords in limited space. Then efficient algorithms are developed based on IK\xspace sketch to support LFP\xspace queries as well as its variant. The extensive empirical study on real Twitter dataset confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.
