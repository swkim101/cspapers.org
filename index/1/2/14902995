The Problem of Optimizing Computer Program Documentation 
 Thls assessment is entlrely by trial and error, usually of the most informal and anecdotal kind. Given the propensity of computer sclence to invent and propose new kinds of documentation, a useful task for engineerlng psychology is the development of a set of design guides for the selection of these devices. Not only would such information be useful for assessing new devices, but it could also be used to suggest where existing devices could be improved. Hence, development of such design guides is a task of immediate and practical relevance to improving software development and maintenance.
