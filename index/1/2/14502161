In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a static array-bound checker for a family of embedded programs: the flight control software of recent Mars missions. These codes are large (up to 280 KLOC), pointer intensive, heavily multithreaded and written in an object-oriented style, which makes their analysis very challenging. We designed a tool called C Global Surveyor (CGS) that can analyze the largest code in a couple of hours with a precision of 80%. The scalability and precision of the analyzer are achieved by using an incremental framework in which a pointer analysis and a numerical analysis of array indices mutually refine each other. CGS has been designed so that it can distribute the analysis over several processors in a cluster of machines. To the best of our knowledge this is the first distributed implementation of static analysis algorithms. Throughout the paper we will discuss the scalability setbacks that we encountered during the construction of the tool and their impact on the initial design decisions.
