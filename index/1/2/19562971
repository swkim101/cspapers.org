Distributed video coding is the promising solution for emerging applications such as wireless video surveillance, wireless video sensor networks that have not been supported by traditional video coding standards. Success of distributed video coding is based on exploiting the source statistics at the decoder with availability of some side information. The better the quality of side information, the higher the performance of the distributed video coding system. In this paper, a novel side information creation method is proposed by using different block sizes based on the residual information at the encoder. The proposed solution is compared with the previous PRISM solution and simulated results show that the proposed solution robustly improves the coding performance in some cases of test sequences.
