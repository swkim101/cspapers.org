Glove-TaikII is a system which translates hand gestures-Â· to speech through an adaptive interface. Hand gestures are mapped continuously to 10 control parameters of a parallel formant speech synthesizer. The mapping al lows the hand to act as an artificial vocal tract that produces speech in real time. This gives an unlim ited vocabulary, multiple languages in addition to di rect control of fundamental frequency and volume. Cur rently, the best version of Glove-TaikII uses several in put devices (including a Cyberglove, a ContactGlove, a polhemus sensor, and a foot-pedal), a parallel formant speech synthesizer and 3 neural networks. The gesture to-speech task is divided into vowel and consonant pro duction by using a gating network to weight the outputs of a vowel and a consonant neural network. The gating network and the consonant network are trained with ex amples from the user. The vowel network implements a fixed, user-defined relationship between hand-position and vowel sound and does not require any training ex amples from the user. Volume, fundamental frequency and stop consonants are produced with a fixed mapping from the input devices. One subject has trained for about 100 hours to speak intelligibly with Glove-TalkII. He passed through eight distinct stages while learning to speak. He speaks slowly with speech quality sim ilar to a text-to-speech synthesizer but with far more natural-sounding pitch variations.
