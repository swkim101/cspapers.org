Retaining students in computer science majors has been a persistent topic among computer science educators for almost two decades. Researchers have examined the relationship between belonging and engagement, self-efficacy, retention and persistence. Our quantitative research suggests that a student's sense of belonging is related to a student's perception of his ability, possibly more so than to actual performance. Our qualitative analysis further suggests that feelings of belonging can influence students' attitudes toward the mutability of ability, based on conversation and support from their academic and non-academic communities. Supporting a student's sense of belonging both to the discipline and their supportive communities can improve the academic resilience of computer science students, thus improving retention.
