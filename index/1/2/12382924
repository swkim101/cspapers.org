I selected the following topics for discussion by the Design Automation Panel because of their general applicability to conference attendees and their interest to me as a manager of Design Automation development and support activities.
 @@@@ Hiring Qualified People
 @@@@ Management Expectations
 @@@@ How to Reduce Design Schedules and Costs
 @@@@ The Future of Design Automation
 The Position Papers which follow are intended to stimulate discussion among the panel members and do not necessarily present new or unique solutions to Design Automation problems.
