Our goal in this paper is to design cost-aware result caching approaches for meta-search engines. We introduce different levels of eviction, namely, query-, resource- and entry-level, based on the granularity of the entries to be evicted from the cache when it is full. We also propose a novel entry-level caching approach that is tailored for the meta-search scenario and superior to alternative approaches.
