ALEX III is a bilateral exoskeleton for gait rehabilitation. It is an evolution of two previous prototypes - ALEX and ALEX II - developed at the University of Delaware. The new robot comprises a support platform and two robotic legs. Its unique characteristic is the possibility to actively control 12 degrees-of-freedom: 4 at the pelvis and 4 for each leg. This paper focuses on the design and fabrication of the robotic leg. Results from early evaluations are presented where the robotic leg is attached to a fixed frame and controlled with a zero-interaction controller.
