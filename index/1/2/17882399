This paper presents an RSSI-based packet combining (PC) scheme to improve the packet reception reliability affected by a beat interference in wireless sensor networks (WSN) using concurrent transmission (CT). To overcome the beat problem, our PC scheme exploits multiple receptions to perform simple post-detection selection combining based on RSSI values. An implementation verifies its feasibility in resource-limited sensor nodes with time-sensitive CT. Evaluations using computer simulations and hardware experiments show significant reliability improvement.
