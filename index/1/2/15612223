Simulation is an important topic in Computer Science, as is probability and statistics. Most undergraduates who take a course in probability and statistics do so through the mathematics department, and often to fulfill a college quantitative reasoning (QR) requirement. However, a course that combines the two topics can exploit some useful synergies between them. This paper describes those synergies and a one-semester course that covers both topics.
