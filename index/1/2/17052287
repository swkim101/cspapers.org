We propose an eye robot system with master-slave control using operator-gaze tracking data, which can produce a high response level such as that of the human eyes. The operators can move a remote robot camera by only moving their eye (master) in front of an eye tracking apparatus and obtain visual information of the environment surrounding the robot's eye (slave). The use of ultrasonic motors has enabled the high responsiveness of the robot eye and the compactness of the robot body. Our graphical user interface (GUI) makes the operation intuitive. We evaluate the robot system from modeling the ultrasonic motor model to the usability of GUI. Finally, the proposed robot system's usability compares well with that of the joystick typically used to operate robots.
