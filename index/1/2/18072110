Nowadays, GPS-based car navigation systems mainly use speech and aerial views of simplified road maps to guide drivers to their destination. However, drivers often experience difficulties in linking the simple 2D aerial map with the visual impression that they get from the real environment, which is inherently ground-level based. Therefore, supplying realistically textured 3D city models at ground-level proves very useful for pre-visualizing an upcoming traffic situation. Because this pre-visualization can be rendered from the expected future viewpoints of the driver, the latter will more easily understand the required maneuver. 3D city models can be reconstructed from the imagery recorded by surveying vehicles. The vastness of image material gathered by these vehicles, however, puts extreme demands on vision algorithms to ensure their practical usability. Algorithms need to be as fast as possible and should result in compact, memory efficient 3D city models for future ease of distribution and visualization. For the considered application, these are not contradictory demands. Simplified geometry assumptions can speed up vision algorithms while automatically guaranteeing compact geometry models. We present a novel city modeling framework which builds upon this philosophy to create 3D content at high speed which could allow for pre-visualization of any conceivable traffic situation by car navigation modules.
