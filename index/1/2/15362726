The design of complex systems requires powerful mechanisms for modeling state, concurrent events, and real-time behavior; as well as for visualising and structuring systems in order to control complexity. Methods integration has become a recent research trend in software specification and design. In the graphical area, many object-oriented methods have merged into one, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) which combines various diagrammatic modeling techniques to model static and dynamic aspects of software systems. Although traditional formal methods have not scale-up well, new integrated formal methods show great promise. This tutorial will present the state of the art in formal modeling techniques (state-based Object-Z and event-based Timed CSP), their integration (TCOZ), and transformation techniques from the integrated formalism to UML diagrams. An XML web environment for projecting integrated formal models to UML diagrams will also be demonstrated.
