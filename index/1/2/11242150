Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is an important primitive for many data analytics algorithms, such as Markov clustering. Unlike the dense case, where performance of matrix-matrix multiplication is considerably higher than matrix-vector multiplication, the opposite is true for the sparse case on GPUs. A significant challenge is that the sparsity structure of the output sparse matrix is not known a priori, and many additive contributions must be combined to generate its non-zero elements. We use synthetic matrices to characterize the effectiveness of alternate approaches and devise a hybrid approach that is demonstrated to be consistently superior to other available GPU SpGEMM implementations.
