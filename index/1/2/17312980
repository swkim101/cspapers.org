In 1969 a symposium involving CAD took place in Davenport -USA-. We quote from the report [1]: “we felt that the confusion regarding the definition of the term “CAD” was, in itself, a characterization of the State-of-the-art”. Four years later a certain confusion still remains. This is an evidence of the fact that the field of computer-aided design is still largely unexplored.
 We have determined three steps in the development of CAD as of the present time. In the first step, computers were used to execute a set of routines, each of them defined to work autonomously and to perform a single task. This task contributed to the evaluation or determination of a particular aspect of a design process in any field. Because there had been an opportunity to use a computer other than in batch mode, and because it was found interesting to have the possibility of communicating between several different programs which contribute to the same design process, improvement on the first step had been attempted.
