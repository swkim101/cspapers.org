In this paper we present an approach to construct dynamic test signals for analog circuits. Using the integral measure for characterizing time-domain signals, we extend the minmax formulation of the static test problem to the dynamic case. A sub-optimal solution strategy, similar to dynamic programming methods is used to construct the test waveforms. The approach presented here may be used to construct input signals for an on-chip test scheme or for the selection of an external stimulus applied through an arbitrary waveform generator.
