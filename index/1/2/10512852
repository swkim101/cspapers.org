Measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts is a crucial process to many Natural Language Processing tasks. Exiting methods exploit semantic evidence from a single knowledge source, and are predominantly evaluated only in the general domain. This paper introduces a method of harnessing different knowledge sources under a uniform model for measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts. Using Wikipedia and WordNet as examples, and evaluated in both the general and biomedical domains, it successfully combines strengths from both knowledge sources and outperforms state-of-the-art on many datasets.
