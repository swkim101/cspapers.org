We introduce the Ante framework to automate the evaluation of student tests in such a way that students will see them as an integral part of the software development process. Our unique approach is to evaluate student testing before students are allowed to submit implementations of the assignment. By evaluating student testing, we can ensure that 1) students understand the assignment before moving on to implementing it and 2) students have a set of tests to aid in implementing their assignment. In this paper we will describe the existing tools and techniques to evaluate student testing, discuss the process of utilizing this framework from both the student and instructor points of view, describe the technical and usability issues in crafting Ante, and report preliminary feedback of student attitudes towards testing in the context of this new paradigm.
