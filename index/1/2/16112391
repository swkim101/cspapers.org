This paper proposes an innovative way to detect working relationships by using only the step tracking data acquired from pedometers like Fitbit. The idea makes the cost of working-relationship detection much lower than that of previous approaches. We can find out if people have a working relationship and spend their daily lives together by making them wear a pedometer. Results of an experiment in Japan showed that this approach is very effective and practical. An organization's profile can be written automatically by analyzing the data.
