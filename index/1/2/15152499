Software Engineering environments have to support design methodologies whose main activity is not the generation of new independent programs, but the maintenance, integration, modification and explanation of existing ones. Especially for software systems in ill-structured problem domains where detailed specifications are not available (like Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Communication), incremental, evolutionary redesign has to be efficiently supported.
To achieve this goal we have designed and constructed an object-oriented, knowledge-based user interface construction kit and a large number of associated tools and intelligent support systems to be able to exploit this kit effectively. Answers to the “user interface design question” are given by providing appropriate building blocks that suggest the way user interfaces should be built. The object-oriented system architecture provides great flexibility, enhances the reusability of many building blocks, and supports redesign. Because existing objects can be used either directly or with minor modifications, the designer can base a new user interface on standard and well-tested components.
