Carrying unknown heavy payload is one of the classical problems in robotics. To realize heavy payload capability, the use of high reduction gears, which causes large motor-side inertia and large friction, is inevitable. This paper proposes a disturbance observer (DOB)-based approach that (1) reduces highly amplified motor-side inertia (2) compensates for large friction (3) compensates for the unknown heavy payload without sensory information. However, in principle, the DOB is applicable only for linear system. To overcome this, a concept of effective joint torque is introduced, which allows us to separate linear motor-side dynamics from the nonlinear robot dynamics. As a result, it becomes possible to apply high order DOB to compensate for the uncertainties. Mathematical analysis shows closed-loop stability, optimality, and passivity. Experiments and simulations are performed to verify the method.
