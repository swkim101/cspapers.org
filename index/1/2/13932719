To be a successful business data processing professional, one should possess effective written and oral communication skills; therefore, any program which prepares computing students for the business world should effectively train them in this area. Of the programs that attempt to handle this situation, most merely require their students to take several English/communication courses. From experience, this method is less effective than additionally reinforcing the students' communication skills within the entire range of the computing curriculum. This paper presents a methodology for accomplishing the task of implementing writing into an introductory data processing course.
