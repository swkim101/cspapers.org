Recent work has shown that translating segmentation lattices (lattices that encode alternative ways of breaking the input to an MT system into words), rather than text in any particular segmentation, improves translation quality of languages whose orthography does not mark morpheme boundaries. However, much of this work has relied on multiple segmenters that perform differently on the same input to generate sufficiently diverse source segmentation lattices. In this work, we describe a maximum entropy model of compound word splitting that relies on a few general features that can be used to generate segmentation lattices for most languages with productive compounding. Using a model optimized for German translation, we present results showing significant improvements in translation quality in German-English, Hungarian-English, and Turkish-English translation over state-of-the-art baselines.
