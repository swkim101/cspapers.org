Recent results have established that there is a family of languages that is exactly the class of languages generated by three independently developed grammar formalisms: Tree Adjoining Grammars, Head Grammars, and Linear Indexed Grammars. In this paper we show that Combinatory Categorial Grammars also generates the same class of languages. We discuss the structural descriptions produced by Combinatory Categorial Grammars and compare them to those of grammar formalisms in the class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems. We also discuss certain extensions of Combinatory Categorial Grammars and their effect on the weak generative capacity.
