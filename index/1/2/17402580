This paper deals with the multicommodity flow problems for two classes of planar undirected graphs. The first class C<subscrpt>12</subscrpt> consists of graphs in which each source-sink pair is located on one of two specified face boundaries. The second class C<subscrpt>01</subscrpt> consists of graphs in which some of the source-sink pairs are located on a specified face boundary and all the other pairs share a common sink located on the boundary. We show that the multicommodity flow problem for a graph in C<subscrpt>12</subscrpt> (resp. C<subscrpt>01</subscrpt>) can be reduced to the shortest path problem for an undirected (resp. a directed) graph obtained from the dual of the original undirected graph.
