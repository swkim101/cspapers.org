This study looked at the differences in how men and women in two gradi Jate classes "taik" in CMC. Research in face to face mixed group discussions documents that women tend to talk less than men do. Consequently, this work assesses the database of the discourse of students fiom two gnduate classes at the University of Toronto, to see if similar behavior continues in online environments. Analyses supported the notion thdt the difference between genden continues, as the database showed that the nurnber of notes posted by women was significantly lower than men. and the number of words written was also smaller. These findings, although in support of the hypothesis, suggest that further study is needed before it can be concluded that face to face group behaviour is tnnsferred to online discoune. Implications of study findings and future research recommendations are discussed.
