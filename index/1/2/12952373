The minimax grid matching problem is a fundamental combinatorial problem associated with the average case analysis of algorithms. The problem has arisen in a number of interesting and seemingly unrelated areas, including wafer-scale integration of systolic arrays, two-dimensional discrepancy problems, and testing pseudorandom number generators. However, the minimax grid matching problem is best known for its application to the maximum up-right matching problem. The maximum up-right matching problem was originally defined by Karp, Luby and Marchetti-Spaccamela in association with algorithms for 2-dimensional bin packing. More recently, the up-right matching problem has arisen in the average case analysis of on-line algorithms for 1-dimen-sional bin packing and dynamic allocation.
