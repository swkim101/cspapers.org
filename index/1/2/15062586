This paper presents a semi-formal denotational definition of the semantics of a version of domain relational calculus called DRC. A single basic design principle governs the semantic definition: each predicate (or formula) of DRC denotes a relation. The definition obtained is precise, short, and systematic. Generalizations of operations of the relational algebra are suggested, which correspond very directly with the semantics of DRC formulas. This work also suggests a more active role of semantic considerations in the design process of a query language, in order to simplify the specification of the language and, eventually , the language itself.
