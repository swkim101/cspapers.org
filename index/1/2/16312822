In this paper, we tackle the problem of efficiently answering queries on probabilistic RDF data graphs. Specifically, we model RDF data by probabilistic graphs, and an RDF query is equivalent to a search over subgraphs of probabilistic graphs that have high probabilities to match with a given query graph. To efficiently processqueries on probabilistic RDF graphs, we propose effective pruning mechanisms, structural and probabilistic pruning. For the structural pruning, we carefully design synopses for vertex/edge labels by considering their distributions and other structural information, in order to improve the pruning power. For the probabilistic pruning, we derive a cost model to guide the pre-computation of probability upper bounds such that the query cost is expected to be low. We construct an index structure that integrates synopses/statistics for structural and robabilistic pruning, and propose an efficient approach to answer queries on probabilistic RDF graph data. The efficiency of our solutions has been verified through extensive experiments.
