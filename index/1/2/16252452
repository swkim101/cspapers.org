A natural question is whether this CC strategy also works for SAT. The direct application of CC did not result in stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms that can compete with the current best SLS algorithms for SAT. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic based on CC for SLS algorithms for SAT, which is called configuration checking with aspiration (CCA). It is used to develop a new SLS algorithm called Swcca. The experiments on random 3-SAT instances show that Swcca significantly outperforms Sparrow2011, the winner of the random satisfiable category of the SAT Competition 2011, which is considered to be the best local search solver for random 3-SAT instances. Moreover, the experiments on structured instances show that Swcca is competitive with Sattime, the best local search solver for the crafted benchmark in the SAT Competition 2011.
