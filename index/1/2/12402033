An analysis of stability and transparency of a force feedback teleoperation system for cutting-edge robotic surgery is presented. Previous works in teleoperated robotic surgery do not consider the real behavior of the environment, which was supposed to be only elastic. However, new surgical procedures in which the environment dynamics plays a crucial role start emerging as a result of technological progress. In robotic assisted beating-heart surgery, for instance, the dynamics of the contact between surgical tools and soft tissues has an impact not only in the performance of the force control task but also in the performance of the teleoperation control scheme in terms of transparency and stability. Therefore, a more realistic description of the environment has to be adopted in order to safely operate during robot-patient interaction. For this purpose, a viscoelastic contact model is introduced into the bilateral teleoperation scheme, and a performance study is provided. The obtained results show the advantages of the selected approach when targeting teleoperated surgical interventions in which the interaction dynamics has become a significant issue.
