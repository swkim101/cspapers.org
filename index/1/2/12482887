The paper describes the first version of the TextMOLE (Text Mining Operations Library and Environment) system for textual data mining. Currently TextMOLE acts as an advanced indexing and search engine: it parses a data set, extracts relevant terms, and allows the user to run queries against the data. The system design is open-ended, robust, and flexible. The tool is designed to quickly analyze a corpus of documents and determine which parameters will provide maximal retrieval performance. Thus an instructor can use the tool to demonstrate information retrieval concepts in the classroom, or use the tool to encourage hands-on exploration of concepts often covered in an introductory course in information retrieval or artificial intelligence. Reseachers will find the tool useful when a `quick and dirty' analysis of an unfamiliar collection is required.
