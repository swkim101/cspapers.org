We present a novel approach to teleoperation of continuum robots. In contrast to previous approaches restricted to three Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) joysticks, a six degree-of-freedom rigid-link manipulator is used as the input device. Mappings from the rigid-link arm to the continuum robot are synthesized and analyzed, focusing on their potential for creating a more intuitive operational interface. The approach was implemented using a six degree-of-freedom rigid-link manipulator as input device for teleoperation of a three section, nine degree-of-freedom continuum robot. Tests were conducted across a range of planar and spatial tasks, using fifteen participant operators. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and suggest that it can be effective independent of the prior robotics, gaming, or teleoperative experience of the operator.
