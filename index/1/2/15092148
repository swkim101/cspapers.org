As the number of email users and messages continues to grow, search is becoming more important for finding information in personal archives. In spite of its importance, email search is much less studied than web search, particularly using large-scale behavioral log analysis. In this paper we report the results of a large-scale log analysis of email search and complement this with a survey to better understand email search intent and success. We characterize email search behaviors and highlight differences from web search. When searching for email, people know many attributes about what they are looking for; they often look for specific known items; their queries are shorter and they click on fewer items than in web search. Although repeat queries are common in both email and web search, repeat visits to the same search result are much less common in email search suggesting that the same query is used for different search intents over time. We consider search intent from multiple angles. In email search logs, we find that people use email search not just to find information but also to perform tasks such as cleanup or organization, and that the distribution of actions they perform depends on the type of query. In our survey, people reported that they looked for specific information in both email search and web search, but they were much less likely to search for general information on a topic in email. The differences in overall behavior, re-finding patterns and search intents we observed between email and web search have important implications for the design of email search algorithms and interfaces.
