This paper presents an Octopus inspired walking robot with pneumatic muscle actuator (PMA) driven continuum arms. Each arm is made up of 4 longitudinally arranged PMAs, consistent with octopus arm anatomy. We first present the design and construction of a single continuum arm followed by its modeling and experimental validation. The design of the walking robot is then presented followed by details of extended dynamic model describing the full walking robot with four arms. Basic control architecture is introduced for the robot to achieve walking motion and experimental results analyzed. Initial results show good agreement between the experimental results and simulation results.
