The Path Selection Problem (PSP) is essential for achieving high system capacity in IEEE 802.16j Mobile Multi-hop Relay (MMR) networks. In this paper, we focus on the PSP in IEEE 802.16j transparent MMR (T-MMR) systems, and point out the PSP is tightly bound with spectrum efficiencies and load-balance between resources. In IEEE 802.16 standard family, the resource for cyclic operations is defined as a frame, which can be further divided into multiple zones for MMR operations. Since there exists load-balance problem between zones, a path selection scheme with zone load-balance (ZLB) concept is proposed. It protects system from zone load-balance violation with an average spectrum efficiency set, which can be predicted in a deployment analysis. Besides, we will demonstrate that an optimal zone ratio can be obtained by the analytical scheme as well. The proposed analytical and path selection schemes form a fine-grained bundle for resource allocation in IEEE 802.16j T-MMR networks.
