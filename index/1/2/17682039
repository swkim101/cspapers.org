In mission-critical applications such as battlefield reconnaissance or industrial safety and security, a large number of sensor nodes are deployed in a large area to detect and report event related information to the end-users. When a critical event in the monitoring region is detected by a node, alarm should be broadcast to all the other nodes in the neighborhood. This effect is shown in Figure 1.
