A Multidatabase System (MDBS) is a software package that integrates a number of pre-existing, autonomous and heterogeneous Local Database Systems (LDBS). Ensuring the consistency of global transactions in the case of failures is a difficult problem due to heterogeneity and to the presence of local transactions at the recovering LDBSS. We present a recovery scheme for MDBS that guarantees the correctness of persistent data in the presence of transaction failures, MDBS failures or site failures. Our scheme employs a global commit protocol which can be supported at minimum cost and ensures a higher degree of local autonomy as compared to alternative schemes.
