Visual servoing based on photometric data is of great interest since it does not necessitate any image processing or visual tracking steps. A vital issue in such methods is the change in the image resulting from the appearance and disappearance of portions of the scene from the camera field-of-view during the visual servo. In this paper, we propose a spatial weighting scheme to counter this problem. A general model for photometric moments that allows for inclusion of spatial weights is presented. A custom weighting function is then chosen and specific properties of its derivative are exploited in order to develop the interaction matrix in analytical form. The resultant effects on the invariance properties are discussed. Experiments have been performed to validate the visual servoing with the proposed weighting scheme on a 4 dof robot arm.
