Given a set of multidimensional data points, skyline query retrieves a set of data points that are not dominated by any other points. This query is useful for multi-preference analysis and decision making. By analyzing the skyline query, we observe a close connection between Z-order curve and skyline processing strategies and propose to use a new index structure called ZBtree, to index and store data points based on Z-order curve. We develop a suite of novel and efficient skyline algorithms, which scale very well to data dimensionality and cardinality, including (1) ZSearch, which processes skyline queries and supports progressive result delivery; (2) ZUpdate, which facilitates incremental skyline result maintenance; and (3) k-ZSearch, which answers k-dominant skyline query (a skyline variant that retrieves a representative subset of skyline results). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithms and compare them against the best available algorithms designed for skyline search, skyline result update, and k-dominant skyline search, respectively. The result shows that our algorithms, developed coherently based on the same ideas and concepts, soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art skyline algorithms in their specialized domains.
