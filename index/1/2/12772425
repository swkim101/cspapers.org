Data sources representing social networks with additional attribute information about the nodes are widely available in today's applications. Recently, combined clustering methods were introduced that consider graph information and attribute information simultaneously to detect meaningful clusters in such networks. In many cases, such attributed graphs also evolve over time. Therefore, there is a need for clustering methods that are able to trace clusters over different time steps and analyze their evolution over time. In this paper, we extend our combined clustering method DB-CSC to the analysis of evolving combined clusters.
