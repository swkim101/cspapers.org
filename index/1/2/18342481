We suggest that the application of divergence detection to speech patterns may enable adaptation to a speaker’s increasing or decreasing level of speech impairment over time. Taking an adaptive approach toward technology development in this arena may be a first step toward empowering those with special needs so that they may live with a high quality of life.  It also represents an important step toward a notion of ambient intelligence that is personalized beyond what can be achieved by mass-produced, one-size-fits-all software currently in use on mobile devices.
