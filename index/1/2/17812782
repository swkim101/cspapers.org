The incorporation of passive compliance in robotic systems could improve their performance during interactions and impacts, for energy storage and efficiency, and for general safety for both the robots and humans. This paper presents the recently developed COMpliant huMANoid COMAN. COMAN is actuated by passive compliance actuators based on the series elastic actuation principle (SEA). The design and implementation of the overall body of the robot is discussed including the realization of the different body segments and the tuning of the joint distributed passive elasticity. This joint stiffness tuning is a critical parameter in the performance of compliant systems. A novel systematic method to optimally tune the joint elasticity of multi-dof SEA robots based on resonance analysis and energy storage maximization criteria forms one of the key contributions of this work. The paper will show this method being applied to the selection of the passive elasticity of COMAN legs. The first completed robot prototype is presented accompanied by experimental walking trials to demonstrate its operation.
