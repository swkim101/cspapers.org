We propose an approach to activity recognition based on detecting and analyzing the sequence of objects that are being manipulated by the user. In domains such as cooking, where many activities involve similar actions, object-use information can be a valuable cue. In order for this approach to scale to many activities and objects, however, it is necessary to minimize the amount of human-labeled data that is required for modeling. We describe a method for automatically acquiring object models from video without any explicit human supervision. Our approach leverages sparse and noisy readings from RFID tagged objects, along with common-sense knowledge about which objects are likely to be used during a given activity, to bootstrap the learning process. We present a dynamic Bayesian network model which combines RFID and video data to jointly infer the most likely activity and object labels. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve activity recognition rates of more than 80% on a real-world dataset consisting of 16 household activities involving 33 objects with significant background clutter. We show that the combination of visual object recognition with RFID data is significantly more effective than the RFID sensor alone. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to automatically learn object models from video of household activities and employ these models for activity recognition, without requiring any explicit human labeling.
