In this paper we present two techniques for improving min-area retiming that combine the actual register minimization with combinational optimization. First, we discuss an on-the-fly retiming approach based on a sequential AND/INVERTER/REGISTER graph. With this method the circuit structure is sequentially compacted using a combination of register “dragging” and AND vertex hashing. Second, we present an extension of the classical retiming formulation that allows an optimal sharing of fanin registers of AND clusters, similar to traditional fanout register sharing. The combination of both techniques is capable of minimizing the circuit size beyond that possible with a standard Leiserson and Saxe retiming approach on a static netlist structure. Our work is primarily aimed at optimizing the performance of reachability-based verification methods. However, the presented techniques are equally applicable for sequential redundancy removal in technology independent logic synthesis. A large set of experiments using benchmark and industrial circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the described techniques.
