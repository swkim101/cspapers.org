In any technological field, both short-term and longterm research can be aided by considering where that technology might be ten, twenty, fifty years down the pike. In the field of natural language interactive systems, a 21 year vision is particularly apt to consider, since it brings us to the year 2001. One wellknown vision [I] of 2001 includes the famous computer named Hal one offspring, so to speak, of the major theoretical and engineering breakthrough in computers that Clarke records as having occurred in the early 1980's. This computer Hal is able to understand and converse in perfect idiomatic English (written and spoken) with the crew of the spacecraft Discovery. And not just task-oriented dialogues, mind you!
