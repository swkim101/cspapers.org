High-mobility walking robots offer unique capabilities in complex off-road environments where wheeled vehicles are not able to travel. However, these environments can also pose significant autonomous navigation challenges. Key steps in planning a safe path for the robot autonomously include estimating the height of the support ground surface - which is often occluded by vegetation - and classifying the terrain and obstacles above the ground surface. This paper describes the development and experimental evaluation of a terrain classification and ground surface height estimation system to support autonomous navigation for a high-mobility walking robot. We provide experimental evaluation on an extensive, manually-labeled dataset collected from geographically diverse sites over a 28-month period.
