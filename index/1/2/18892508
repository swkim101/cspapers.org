This paper presents a mechanism for the definition and execution of viewpoints in workflow processes. The strategy proposed in this work is based on the definition of a viewpoint metamodel to express crosscutting concerns in workflow processes. This proposal includes a weaving mechanism to integrate viewpoint models and process models using aspect oriented modeling techniques. Some preliminary results and the future work of this research are also presented.
