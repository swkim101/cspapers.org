For a Direct Manipulation interface, transfer of skill between text and graphics editing tasks has been investigated. A learning experiment has been carried out with two groups of novice users starting with a series of sessions in one task domain and then switching over to the other domain. The empirical results are discussed in the framework of the “cognitive complexity” theory of Polson and Kieras.
