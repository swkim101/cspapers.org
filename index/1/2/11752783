A router-based packet-filtering firewall is an effective way of protecting an enterprise network from unauthorized access. However, it will not work efficiently in an ATM network because it requires the termination of end-to-end ATM connections at a packet-filtering router, which incurs huge overhead of SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly). Very few approaches to this problem have been proposed in the literature, and none is completely satisfactory. In this paper we present the hardware design of a high-speed ATM firewall that does not require the termination of an end-to-end connection in the middle. We propose a novel firewall design philosophy, called Quality of Firewalling (QoF), that applies security measures of different strength to traffic with different risk levels and show how it can be implemented in our firewall. Compared with the traditional firewalls, this ATM firewall performs exactly the same packet-level filtering without compromising the performance and has the same “look and feel” by sitting at the chokepoint between the trusted ATM LAN and untrusted ATM WAN. It is also easy to manage and flexible to use.
