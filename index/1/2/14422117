In this paper we report results of an investigation into EnglishJapanese Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) comparing a number of query translation methods. Results from experiments using the standard BMIR-J2 Japanese collection suggest that full machine translation (MT) can outperform popular dictionary-based query translation methods and further that in this context MT is largely robust to queries with little linguistic structure.
