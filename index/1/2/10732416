Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the practice of making clinical decisions based on rigorous scientific evidence. EBM relies on effective access to peer-reviewed literature - a task hampered by both the exponential growth of medical literature and a lack of efficient and effective means of searching and presenting this literature. This paper describes a search engine specifically designed for searching medical literature for the purpose of EBM and in a clinical decision support setting.
