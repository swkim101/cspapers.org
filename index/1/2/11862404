Guaranteeing stability of control applications in embedded systems, or cyber-physical systems, is perhaps the alpha and omega of implementing such applications. However, as opposed to the classical real-time systems where often the acceptance criterion is meeting the deadline, control applications do not primarily enforce hard deadlines. In the case of control applications, stability is considered to be the main design criterion and can be expressed in terms of the amount of delay and jitter a control application can tolerate before instability. Therefore, new design and analysis techniques are required for embedded control systems. In this paper, the analysis and design of such systems considering server-based resource reservation mechanism are addressed. The benefits of employing servers are manifold: (1) providing a compositional framework, (2) protection against other tasks misbehaviors, and (3) systematic bandwidth assignment. We propose a methodology for designing bandwidth-efficient servers to stabilize control tasks.
