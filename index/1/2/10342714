The alpha-beta tree search algorithm can be improved through the use of minimal windows. Branches are searched with a minimal window [a,a+l] with the expectancy that this will show the sub-tree to be inferior. If not, then that sub-tree must be re-searched. In this paper, several methods are discussed to minimize the cost of the re-search. Two new algorithms, INS and PNS, are introduced and their performance on practical trees is shown to be comparable to SSS*, but with considerably smaller overhead.
