With increasingly powerful mobile devices, user context information can be derived from a variety of sensing components embedded inside, such as accelerometer, GPS, microphone, Bluetooth, camera, etc. Mobile phones can build continuous sensing systems that are able to collect sensor data important to a user's daily life, namely, what is the user doing, where is the user, and whom is the user staying with? Basically user activities, locations/places and social interactions are three-dimensional domains to explore new opportunities in the area of mobile sensing and computing. The first dimension naturally includes physical activity recognition and its enabled mobile applications.
