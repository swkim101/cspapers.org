As analog and digital circuits have become more intertwined, we need to create a validation approach that handles both circuit types gracefully. This paper proposes a model-first approach, where one creates functional models of the analog blocks that will work in a HDL simulator, and then uses these models in the same way as HDL models are used for other standard cells: they are used in the full system validation, and the underlying implementations are validated to ensure they meet this specification. While creating functional models for the analog blocks might seem difficult, almost all analog blocks can be modeled as linear systems and we use this property to help create the required functional model.
