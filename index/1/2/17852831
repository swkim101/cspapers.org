Flow-driven higher-order inlining is blocked by free variables, yet current theories of environment analysis cannot reliably cope with multiply-bound variables. One of these, ΔCFA, is a promising theory based on stack change but is undermined by its finite-state model of the stack. We present Pushdown ΔCFA which takes a ΔCFA-approach to pushdown models of control flow and can cope with multiply-bound variables, even in the face of recursion.
