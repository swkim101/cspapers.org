Engineering approaches for optimizing designs withi n a market context generally take the perspective of a single producer, asking what design and price point will m aximize producer profit predicted by consumer choice simula tions. These approaches treat competitors and retailers as fixed or nonexistent, and they take business-oriented detail s, such as the structure of distribution channels, as separate iss ues that can be addressed post hoc by other disciplines. It is well established that the structure of market systems influences optimal product pricing. In this paper, we investigate whether two types of these structures also influenc e optimal product design decisions; specifically, 1) consumer heterogeneity and 2) distribution channels. We firs t model firms as players in a profit-seeking game that compete on product attributes and prices. We then model the interactio ns of manufacturers and retailers in Nash competition und er alternative market structures and compare the equil ibrium conditions for each case. We find that when consumers are modeled as homogeneous in their preferences, optimal design can be decoupled from the game, and design decisions can be made without regard to price, competition, or chann el structure. However, when consumer preferences are heterogeneous, the behavior of competitors and retailers is key to det ermining which designs are profitable. We examine the extent of this effect in a vehicle design case study from the lite rature and find that the presence of heterogeneity leads different market structures to imply significantly different profit- maximizing designs.
