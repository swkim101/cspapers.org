This paper reports on first steps towards identifying factors indicating students' performance in a CS2 course. We discuss a study undertaken to investigate the predictive and explanation power as well as the limits of weekly test items based on concept inventory questions, homework grades, and performance in a preceding CS1 course. We relate our findings for two subgroups to results on academic success in general and performance in a CS1 course in particular.
