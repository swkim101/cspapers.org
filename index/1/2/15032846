: The Palladio Component Model (PCM) is a modeling language for component-based business information systems. Its primary and original focus lies on performance prediction. Its core meta-model is organized within a package structure within one meta-model. Overtime,the meta-model was extended, which allowed to model additional concerns. The extensions were made directly into the package structure, mostly without creating sub packages. Some cross-cutting concerns were placed inconsistently. This deteriorated the organizational structure of the meta-model, which negatively inﬂu-ences maintainability, understandability and extensibility. To solve this, the meta-model should be restructured into meta-model modules. Within this paper, we identiﬁed concerns which are contained in the meta-model, to form a basis for the future modularization. This paper does not propose a deﬁnite modularization, but possible building blocks. What may be put as a single module or just a package within a module will be subject to future discussion.
