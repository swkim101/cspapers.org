Gain control by divisive inhibition, a.k.a. Heeger's normalization, seems to be a general mechanism throughout the visual cortex. We explore in this study the statistical properties of this normalization in the presence of noise. Using simulations, we show that Heeger's normalization is a close approximation to a maximum likelihood estimator, which, in the context of population coding, is the same as an ideal observer. We also demonstrate analytically that this is a general property of a large class of nonlinear recurrent networks with line attractors. Our work suggests that Heeger's normalization plays a critical role in noise ltering, and that every cortical layer may be an ideal observer of the activity in the preceding layer. Information processing in the cortex is often formalized as a sequence of a linear stages followed by a nonlinearity. In the visual cortex, the nonlinearity is best described by a rectiication and squaring combined with a divisive pooling of local activities. The divisive part of the nonlinearity, referred to here as Heeger's normal-ization, has been extensively studied by Heeger and colleagues 1]. Several authors have explored the role of Heeger's normalization in the computation of high order visual features such as orientation of edges or rst and second order motionn4]. We show in this paper that Heeger's normalization can also play a role in noise ltering. More speciically, we demonstrate through network simulations that this normal-ization can be used to perform maximum likelihood estimation of visual features encoded in a population code. Maximum likelihood estimation is a framework commonly used in the theory of ideal observers. A recent example comes from the work of Itti et al., 1998, who have shown that it is possible to account for the behavior of human subjects in simple discrimination tasks. Their model comprised two distinct stages: 1) a network
