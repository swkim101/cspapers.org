This paper introduces a novel end-to-end platform called PERSim that allows FPGA accelerated full-system simulation of complete programs on prototype hardware with detailed fault injection that can capture gate delays and digital logic behavior of arbitrary circuits and provides full coverage. We use PERSim and report on five case studies spanning a diverse spectrum of reliability techniques including wearout prediction/detection (FIRST, Wearmon, TRIX), transient faults, and permanent faults (Sampling-DMR). PERSim provides unprecedented capability to study these techniques quantitatively when applied to a full processor and when running complete programs. These case studies demonstrate PERSim's robustness and flexibility - such a diverse set of techniques can be studied uniformly with common metrics like area overhead, power overhead, and detection latency. PERSim provides many new insights, of which two important ones are: i) We discover an important modeling “hole” - when considering the true logic delay behavior, non-critical paths can directly transition into logic faults, rendering insufficient delay-based detection/prediction mechanisms targeted at critical paths alone. ii) When Sampling-DMR was evaluated in a real system running full applications, detection latency is orders of magnitude lower than previously reported model-based worst-case latency - 107 seconds vs. 0.84 seconds, thus dramatically strengthening Sampling-DMR's effectiveness. The framework is released open source and runs on the Zync platform.
