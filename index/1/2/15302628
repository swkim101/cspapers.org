Robot-assisted cochlear implant surgery was proposed and proved to be efficient in reducing insertion forces on acrylic scala tympani models. During experiments, the authors discovered that the insertion force not only depends on the shape discrepancy between the scala tympani and the inserted electrode array, but also on the insertion speed. This paper presents a friction model that describes the whole insertion process and investigates the relationship between the insertion speed and the insertion force. Experimental and statistical results show the effectiveness of the model. Applying the friction model generates safety insertion force boundaries for future insertions and gives the optimal insertion speed. It also provides predictive force information for insertion speed feedback control law design which may be applied to robot-assisted cochlear implant surgeries.
