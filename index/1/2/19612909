We consider an agricultural automation scenario where a robot, equipped with a camera mounted on a manipulator, is charged with counting the number of apples in an orchard. We focus on the subtask of planning views so as to accurately estimate the number of apples in an apple cluster. We present a method to efficiently enumerate combinatorially distinct world models and to compute the most likely model from one or more views. These are incorporated into single and multi-step planners. We evaluate these planners in simulation as well as with experiments on a real robot.
