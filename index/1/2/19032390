In this paper a set of techniques for error detection and recovery is proposed. These techniques augment a planning system (the ELMER system) which already has many features for preventing execution errors but has few features for handling errors that can't be prevented. The error handling techniques presented in this paper depend for their effectiveness on the close co-operation of the planning, execution and knowledge base components of the system, and especially make Use of knowledge learned from the earlier execution of other plans.
