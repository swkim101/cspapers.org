An architectural model of a system research tool, the Message Repository Definitional Facility (MRDF), is presented. MRDF provides for interprocess communication and synchronization by message passing, and permits the user a wide selection of policy options, promising general descriptive power. The project's current levels of system definition, design considerations and issues, and plans for future development are briefly described. The current goal for this research is the implementation of the MRDF in the data flow simulation environment for test and evaluation. Potential application of this concept beyond the research tool stage is speculated as incorporation in a computer architecture to support concurrent processes and a “self-optimizing” operating system.
