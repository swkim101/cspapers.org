We are exploring a new class of tools for learners: scaffoldedintegrated tool environments (or SITES), which address the needs oflearners trying to engage in new, complex work processes. A crucialphase within a learner-centered design approach for SITE designinvolves analyzing the work process to identify areas wherelearners need support to engage in the process. Here we discuss thedesign of Symphony, a SITE for high-school science students.Specifically, we discuss how the process-space model helped usanalyze the science inquiry process to help us identify a detailedset of learner needs, leading to a full set of process scaffoldingstrategies for Symphony.
