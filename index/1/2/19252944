The particular domain of interest for my work is the protection of cyber networks from intrusions given the presence of a strategic adversary. My thesis work allows fora defender to use game-theoretical methods that randomize her protection strategy and introduces uncertainty to the adversary that makes it more difficult to attack the defenderâ€™s network successfully.
