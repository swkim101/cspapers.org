Symmetric-ISA (instruction set architecture) asymmetric-performance multicore processors (AMPs) were shown to deliver higher performance per watt and area than symmetric CMPs for applications with diverse architectural requirements. So, it is likely that future multicore processors will combine big power-hungry fast cores and small low-power slow ones. In this paper, we propose a novel thread scheduling algorithm that aims to improve the throughput-fairness trade-off on AMP systems. Our experimental evaluation on real hardware and using scheduler implementations on a general-purpose operating system, reveals that our proposal delivers a better throughput-fairness trade-off than previous schedulers for a wide variety of multi-application workloads including single-threaded and multithreaded applications.
