Variability in device characteristics, i.e., parametric variations, is an important problem for shrinking process technologies. They manifest themselves as variations in performance, power consumption, and reduction in reliability in the manufactured chips as well as low yield levels. Their implications on performance and yield are particularly profound on 3D architectures: a defect on even a single layer can render the entire stack useless. In this paper, we show that instead of causing increased yield losses, we can actually exploit 3D technology to reduce yield losses by intelligently devising the architectures. We take advantage of the layer-to-layer variations to reduce yield losses by splitting critical components among multiple layers. Our results indicate that our proposed method achieves a 30.6% lower yield loss rate compared to the same pipeline implemented on a 2D architecture.
