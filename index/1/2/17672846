Adaptive routing techniques for multiprocessor interconnection networks have been found to significantly improve average message latency and throughput capacity. Current techniques are, however, limited by the fact that routing decisions are based only on the local conditions at each router, rather than on global knowledge of network traffic. This suggests that it might be fruitful to search for more powerful routing techniques.
