We address the problem of a mobile manipulation robot searching for an object in a cluttered domain that is populated with an unknown number of objects in an unknown arrangement. The robot must move around its environment, looking in containers, moving occluding objects to improve its view, and reasoning about collocation of objects of different types, all in service of finding a desired object. The key contribution in reasoning is a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for drawing samples of the arrangements of objects in an occluded container, conditioned on previous observations of other objects as well as spatial constraints. The key contribution in planning is a receding-horizon forward search in the space of distributions over arrangements (including number and type) of objects in the domain; to maintain tractability the search is formulated in a model that abstracts both the observations and actions available to the robot. The strategy is shown empirically to improve upon a baseline systematic search strategy, and sometimes outperforms a method from previous work.
