This paper describes a new compact omnidirectional stereovision sensor that combines a single orthographic camera and four paraboloidal mirrors. Its geometry has been designed with the help of a stochastic optimization approach in order to minimize the 3D reconstruction error. In comparison with state-of-the-art sensors described in the literature, better results are obtained for this sensor during simulations. We will especially compare it with a classical configuration with two mirrors. Two criteria will be used: the 3D reconstruction accuracy and the field of view. We illustrate the advantages of our sensor within a framework of a simulation using a realistic environment and a ray-tracing software.
