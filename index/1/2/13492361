We show that the empirical distribution of the PageRank values in a large set of Web pages does not follow a power-law except for some particular choices of the damping factor. We argue that for a graph with an in-degree distribution following a power-law with exponent between 2.1 and 2.2, choosing a damping factor around 0.85 for PageRank yields a power-law distribution of its values. We suggest that power-law distributions of PageRank in Web graphs have been observed because the typical damping factor used in practice is between 0.85 and 0.90.
