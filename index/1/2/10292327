Qualitative user-centered design processes such as contextualinquiry can generate huge amounts of data to be organized,analyzed, and represented. When you add the goal of spreading theresultant understanding to the far reaches of a large, multi-siteorganization, many practical barriers emerge.
In this paper we describe experience creating and communicatingrepresentations of contextually derived user data in a large,multi-site product development organization. We describe how weinvolved a distributed team in data collection and analysis and howwe made the data representations portable. We then describe how wehave engaged over 200 people from five sites in thinking throughthe user data and its implications on product design.
