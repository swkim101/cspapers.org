Smartphones these days are equipped with many embedded sensors which enable new applications across different domains, namely healthcare, environmental monitoring, social networks, and transportation. In our previous work, we developed a location-based Android-based application called Fitness Tour for combating obesity. In this poster, we present an enhanced location-based application called WiFiTreasureHunt that encourages young adults and school children who own smartphones to stay active physically. Our application includes several new features: (a) randomly generated exercise tours with hidden treasures at some selected locations, (b) group-based games where updates of group members' visits can be shown on each player's screen, and (c) social network interface that allows participating users to invite friends to participate in self-organized group competitions. The group feature allows users to exert social pressure on one another to adopt healthier lifestyle via outdoor physical activities. Our main goal is to use this application to encourage children and college students to adopt more active lifestyles and hence combat the obesity problem.
