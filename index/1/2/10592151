We report the first steps of a novel investigation into how a grammar induction algorithm can be modified and used to identify salient information structures in a corpus. The information structures are to be used as representations of semantic content for text mining purposes. We modify the learning regime of the ADIOS algorithm (Solan et al., 2005) so that text is presented as increasingly large snippets around key terms, and instances of selected structures are substituted with common identifiers in the input for subsequent iterations. The technique is applied to 1.4m blog posts about climate change which mention diverse topics and reflect multiple perspectives and different points of view. Observation of the resulting information structures suggests that they could be useful as representations of semantic content. Preliminary analysis shows that our modifications had a beneficial effect for inducing more useful structures.
