This paper presents a method to synthesize labeled Petri nets from state-based models. Although state-based models (such as finite state machines) are a powerful formalism to describe the behavior of sequential systems, they cannot explicitly express the notions of concurrency, causality and conflict Petri nets can naturally capture these notions. The proposed method in based on deriving an elementary transition system (ETS) from a specification model. Previous work has shown that for any ETS there exists a Petri net with minimum transition count (one transition for each label) with a reachability graph isomorphic to the original ETS. This paper presents the first known approach to obtain an ETS from a non-elementary TS and derive a place-irredundant Petri net. Furthermore, by imposing constraints on the synthesis method, different classes of Petri nets can be derived from the same reachability graph (pure, free choice, unique choice). This method has been implemented and efficiently applied in different frameworks: Petri net composition, synthesis of Petri nets from asynchronous circuits, and resynthesis of Petri nets.
