The forward kinematic model (FKM) of a redundantly actuated robot is not unique: if each actuator is equipped with an encoder, there are more joint data than strictly necessary for computing nacelle position. It is then possible to fuse competitive data to find the nacelle position. This paper proposes then a method based on a probabilistic approach to determine how computing the FKM to obtain, in terms of probability, the lowest Cartesian error.
