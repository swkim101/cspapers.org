While studies have shown that Wikipedia articles exhibit quality that is comparable to conventional encyclopedias, research still proves that Wikipedia, overall, is prone to many different types of Neutral Point of View (NPOV) violations that are explicitly or implicitly caused by bias from its editors. Related work focuses on political, cultural and gender bias. We are developing an approach for detecting both explicit and implicit bias in Wikipedia articles and observing its evolution over time. Our approach is based on different factors of bias, with the most important ones being language style, editors, and citations. In this paper we present the approach, methodology and a first analysis.
