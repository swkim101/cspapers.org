This paper addresses the problem of post-processing of ranking in search, referred to as post ranking. Although important, no research seems to have been conducted on the problem, particularly with a principled approach, and in practice ad-hoc ways of performing the task are being adopted. This paper formalizes the problem as constrained optimization in which the constraints represent the post-processing rules and the objective function represents the trade-off between adherence to the original ranking and satisfaction of the rules. The optimization amounts to refining the original ranking result based on the rules. We further propose a specific probabilistic implementation of the general formalization on the basis of the Bradley-Terry model, which is theoretically sound, effective, and efficient. Our experimental results, using benchmark datasets and enterprise search dataset, show that the proposed method works much better than several baseline methods of utilizing rules.
