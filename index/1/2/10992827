We introduce a method to generate whole body motion of a humanoid robot such that the resulted total linear/angular momenta become specified values. First, we derive a linear equation, which gives to total momentum of a robot from its physical parameters, the base link speed and the joint speeds. Constraints between the legs and the environment are also considered. The whole body motion is calculated from a given momentum reference by using a pseudo-inverse of the inertia matrix. As examples, we generated the kicking and walking motions and tested on the actual humanoid robot HRP-2. This method, the resolved momentum control, gives us a unified framework to generate various maneuvers of humanoid robots.
