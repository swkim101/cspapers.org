We present a new, method to select the optimal camera position for an active camera system from which camera pose (position and orientation) is modified according to the change of environment. We consider visibility and manipulability constraints to select the optimal position to monitor the target object and to modify the camera configurations during the task. The visibility constraint guarantees that a visual image of the target object can be obtained while the manipulability constraint guarantees that the manipulator can be controlled to locate the camera at the optimal position. From these considerations the optimal position and orientation of the eye-in-hand camera is selected and an eye-in-hand camera system automatically modifies its configuration during tasks.
