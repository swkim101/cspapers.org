This paper presents an overview of our participation in the TAC 2008 Opinion Pilot Summarization task, as well as the proposed and evaluated post-competition improvements. We first describe our opinion summarization system and the results obtained. Further on, we identify the system's weak points and suggest several improvements, focused both on information content, as well as linguistic and readability aspects. We obtain encouraging results, especially as far as F-measure is concerned, outperforming the competition results by approximately 80%.
