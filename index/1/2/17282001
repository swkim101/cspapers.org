The most critical challenge for Personal Robotics is to manage the issue of human safety and yet provide the physical capability to perform useful work. This paper describes a novel concept for a mobile, 2-armed, 25-degree-of- freedom system with backdrivable joints, low mechanical impedance, and a 5 kg payload per arm. System identification, design safety calculations and performance evaluation studies of the first prototype are included, as well as plans for a future development.
