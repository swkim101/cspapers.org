Our demo presents HDDBRS, a middle tier offering to clients a highly available distributed database interface using Reed Solomon codes to compute parity data. Parity data is stored in dedicated parity DB backends, is synchronously updated and allows recovering from multiple DB backend unavailability. HDDBRS middle tier is implemented in JAVA using standard technology, and is designed to be interoperable with any database engine that provides a JDBC driver and implements X/open XA protocol.
