We give explicit constructions of epsilon nets for linear threshold functions on the binary cube and on the unit sphere. The size of the constructed nets is polynomial in the dimension n and in 1/ε. To the best of our knowledge no such constructions were previously known. Our results match, up to the exponent of the polynomial, the bounds that are achieved by probabilistic arguments. As a corollary we also construct subsets of the binary cube that have size polynomial in n and covering radius of n/2 - c√{n log n}, for any constant c. This improves upon the well known construction of dual BCH codes that only guarantee covering radius of n/2 - c√n.
