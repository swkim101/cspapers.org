In parallel matrix manipulation operations, some data patterns need to be accessed in one memory cycle without conflict. Investigating the frequently used data patterns, we propose a powerful skewing scheme which allows most frequently used data patterns of N elements, including rows, columns, diagonals, blocks with various shapes, points scattered over various blocks, and chessboards with various shapes, to be accessed in one memory cycle. We also propose simple methods to combine different skewing schemes into a single parallel storage system such that all the frequently used data patterns of N elements (the above patterns plus folded lines, two-pairs, and column-pairs) can be accessed in one memory cycle. The storage sytem uses N memory modules where N is any (even or odd) power of two. Address generation in the system need only exclusive-or operations and can be completed in constant time. The storage scheme allows different sized matrices to be processed efficiently on large scale systems by using the skewing scheme designed according to the size of the system, i.e. address generation mechanism is independent of the size of the matrices to be processed. Data alignment requirements (connecting each memory module to a proper processor) can be easily realized on a general-purpose interconnecting network, such as a hypercube.
