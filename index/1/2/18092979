Maintenance alert systems attempt to remind people to perform maintenance. However, most of these systems do not provide alerts at the optimal timing, and nor do they take into account the time required for maintenance or compute the optimal timing for a specific user. We model the problem of maintenance performance, assuming maintenance is time consuming. We solve the optimal policy for the user, i.e., the optimal timing for a user to perform maintenance. This optimal strategy depends on the value of user's time, and thus it may vary from user to user and may change over time. %We present a game Based on the solved optimal strategy we present a personalized maintenance agent, which, depending on the value of user's time, provides alerts to the user when she should perform maintenance. In an experiment using a spaceship computer game, we show that receiving alerts from the personalized alert agent significantly improves user performance.
