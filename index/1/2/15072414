We demonstrate a system for fast and intuitive exploration of the Freebase dataset. This required solving several non-trivial problems, including: entity scores for proper ranking and name disambiguation, a unique meaningful name for every entity and every type, extraction of canonical binary relations from multi-way relations (which in Freebase are modeled via so-called mediator objects), computing the transitive hull of selected relations, and identifying and merging duplicates. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we provide for download an up-to-date version of the Freebase data, enriched and simplified as just sketched. Second, we offer a user interface for exploring and searching this data set. The data set, the user interface and a demo video are available from http://freebase-easy.cs.uni-freiburg.de.
