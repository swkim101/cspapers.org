Datagram services provide a simple, flexible, robust, and scalable communication abstraction; their usefulness has been well demonstrated by the success of IP, UDP, and RPC. Yet, the overwhelming majority of network security protocols that have been proposed are geared towards connection-oriented communications. The few that do cater to datagram communications tend to either rely on long term host-pair keying or impose a session-oriented (i.e., requiring connection setup) semantics.Separately, the concept of flows has received a great deal of attention recently, especially in the context of routing and QoS. A flow characterizes a sequence of datagrams sharing some pre-defined attributes. In this paper, we advocate the use of flows as a basis for structuring secure datagram communications. We support this by proposing a novel protocol for datagram security based on flows. Our protocol achieves zero-message keying, thus preserving the connectionless nature of datagram, and makes use of soft state, thus providing the per-packet processing efficiency of session-oriented schemes. We have implemented an instantiation for IP in the 4.4BSD kernel, and we provide a description of our implementation along with performance results.
