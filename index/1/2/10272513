The evolution of the Web requires to consider an increasing number of context-dependency issues. Therefore, in our research we focus on how to extend a Web application with additional adaptation concerns without having to redesign the entire application. Based on a generic transcoding tool we illustrate here how we can add adaptation functionality to an existing Web application. Furthermore, we consider how an aspect-oriented approach can support the high-level specification of such additional concerns in the design of the Web application.
