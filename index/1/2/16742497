This paper discusses an approach to incremental learning in natural language processing. The technique of projecting and integrating semantic constraints to learn word definitions is analyzed as implemented in the POLITICS system. Extensions and improvements of this technique are developed. The problem of generalizing existing word meanings and understanding metaphorical uses of words is addressed in terms of semantic constraint integration.
