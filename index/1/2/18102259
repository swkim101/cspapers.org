A great deal of interest has recently been focused on theories concerning parallel distributed processing in central nervous systems. In particular, many researchers have become very interested in the structure and function of "computational maps" in sensory systems. As defined in a recent review (Knudsen et al, 1987), a "map" is an array of nerve cells, within which there is a systematic variation in the "tuning" of neighboring cells for a particular parameter. For example, the projection from retina to visual cortex is a relatively simple topographic map; each cortical hypercolumn itself contains a more complex "computational" map of preferred line orientation representing the angle of tilt of a simple line stimulus.
