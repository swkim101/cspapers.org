Observable evidence from disparate sources are combined coherently and consistently through a hierarchically structured knowledge tree. Prior knowledge of spatial interactions is modeled with Markov Random Fields. A posteriori probabilities of segmentations are maintained incrementally. This paper is a shortened version of [Chou and Brown 87], which contains many more references.
