EMMA (1) is a multiprocessor system designed and built by ELSAG of Genoa, Italy, to solve problems of pattern recognition arising in automatic mail sorting.
 The resulting architecture is modular, organizable around several levels, and offers a theoretically unlimited possibility of increasing the processor power.
 EMMA runs under a simple distributed operating system, supplying process communication, synchronization primitives and some diagnostic functions that complement analysis and reconfiguration modules residing in the supervisor.
