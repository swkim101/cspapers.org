Programs are hard to build, and even harder to understand after they are built. We lack intuitive interfaces for visualizing and manipulating many parts of programs and the ways in which these parts interact. Constraint systems have addressed these problems. We generalize some of the notions inherent in constraint systems to agent-based systems, and explore the use of animated characters as interface representations of agents. In particular, conflict detection and resolution is dramatized by the use of characters and their emotions. The history of their interactions is presented as a narrative using video and storyboard techniques. Building programs out of agents and enabling users to manipulate program parts by interacting with simple animated characters can aid relatively unskilled users in understanding and modifying complex systems.
