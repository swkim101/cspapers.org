Formally defining the knowledge units taught in a course helps instructors ensure a sound coverage of topics and provides an objective basis for comparing the content of two courses. The main issue is to list and define the course concepts, down to basic knowledge units. Ontology learning techniques can help partially automate the process by extracting information from existing materials such as slides and textbooks. The TrucStudio course planning tool, discussed in this article, provides such support and relies on Text2Onto to extract concepts from course material. We conducted experiments on two different programming courses to assess the quality of the results.
