Due to globalization and especially with China becoming the world's production center, global trade is strongly increasing. The vast majority of all goods are shipped in ocean-going containers. Secure Trade Lane (STL) is a solution for making container shipments more predictable and more secure. The solution comprises an embedded controller that is mounted on ocean-going containers, and a sophisticated backend communicating with the embedded controller and integrating all trading partners. Both components are tightly linked and couldn't exist in isolation. In this paper we outline the rationale of technologies being used in this Sensor Network solution, and describe end-to-end architecture and key components. We share the key lessons learned and take a look at the future evolution of asset tracking and monitoring, in particular in transportation industries.
