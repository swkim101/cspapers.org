Unmanned construction machines are used after disasters. Compared with manned construction, time efficiency is lower because of incomplete visual information, communication delay, and lack of tactile experience. We have developed an autonomous camera control system to supply appropriate visual information. In order to inform operators the potential data in the views, we introduced several augmented reality (AR) elements to induce visual attention to suitable images in a scenario. The purpose of this study is to develop an attention inducement system using AR technique and evaluate it under different conditions. We first improve our autonomous camera control system and then implement several kinds of AR items suitable for each work situation. The experimental results conducted using our virtual reality simulator confirm that AR items can supply a better positional relationship between machine and objects in the environment which makes operator handle the conditions as experienced. The results from eye-tracker data also indicate that AR items can induce visual attention to images suitable for situations.
