We present an asymptotic (2 + ε)-approximation algorithm for the 3D-strip packing problem, for any ε > 0. In the 3D-strip packing problem the input is a set <i>L</i> = {<i>b</i><inf>1</inf>, <i>b</i><inf>2</inf>,. . ., <i>b</i><inf><i>n</i></inf>} of 3-dimensional boxes. Each box <i>b</i><inf><i>i</i></inf> has width, length, and height at most 1. The problem is to pack the boxes into a 3-dimensional bin <i>B</i> of width 1, length 1 and minimum height, so that the boxes do not overlap. We consider here only orthogonal packings without rotations; this means that the boxes are packed so that their faces are parallel to the faces of the bin, and rotations are not allowed. This algorithm improves on the previously best algorithm of Miyazawa and Wakabayashi which has asymptotic performance ratio of 2.64. Our algorithm can be easily modified to a (4 + ε)-approximation algorithm for the 3D-bin packing problem.
