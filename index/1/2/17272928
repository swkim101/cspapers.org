Hass, Lagarias, and Pippenger analyzed the computational complexity of various decision problems in knot theory. They proved that the problem whether a given knot is unknotting is in <b>NP</b>, and conjectured that the problem is contained in <b>NP</b>∩co-<b>NP.</b> Agol, Hass, and Thurston proved that the problem called <i>ManifoldGenus</i>, which is a general problem of <i>Unknotting</i>, is <b>NP</b>-complete. We construct an interactive proof system for <i>Knotting</i>, and prove that the problem is contained in <b>IP</b>(2). Consequently, <i>Unknotting</i> is contained in <b>AM</b> ∩ co-<b>AM.</b> If <i>Unknotting</i> is <b>NP</b>-complete, then Σ<inf>2</inf><sup><i>p</i></sup> = Π<inf>2</inf><sup><i>p</i></sup>.
