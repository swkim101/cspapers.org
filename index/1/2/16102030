This demonstration presents a novel mechanism for the electronic acquisition of shapes of arbitrary objects, and the the remote reproduction of these shapes: in essence a 3D fax machine. Our approach is based on Claytronics, a form of intelligent matter or "smart clay" composed of thousands of tiny particles, each of which is a small electronic device capable of sensing, computation, communication, and actuation. For our purposes, this Claytronic material is treated as a network of thousands to millions of communicating sensor nodes that must work cooperatively to determine the shape of an object. We demonstrate the highly scalable software we have designed to permit such intelligent "clay" be used as both the input and output stages of a 3D fax machine through physics-based simulations.
