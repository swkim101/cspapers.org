Nowadays, people are increasingly concerned about smog disaster and the caused health hazard. However, the current methods for big smog analysis are usually based on the traditional lagging data sources or merely adopt physical environment observations, which limit the methods' accuracy and usability. The discipline of Web Science, the research fields of which include web of people and web of devices, provides real time web data as well as novel web data analysis approaches. In this paper, both social web data and device web data are proposed for smog disaster analysis. Firstly, we utilize social web data to define and calculate Individual Public Health Indexes (IPHIs) for smog caused health hazard quantification. Secondly, we integrate social web data and device web data to build standard health hazard rating reference and train smog-health models for health hazard prediction. Finally, we apply the rating reference and models to online and location-sensitive smog disaster monitoring, which can better guide people's behaviour and government's strategy design for disaster mitigation.
