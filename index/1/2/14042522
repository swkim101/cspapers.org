This paper describes a series of experiments performed with block versions of the LU, Cholesky and QR factorizations using Level 3 BLAS on one processor of the IBM 3090/VF. We show that the LAPACK approach to designing linear algebra software that is both portable and efficient, namely calling optimized versions of the Level 3 BLAS kernels, is likely to be a successful way to exploit machines with hierarchical memories.
