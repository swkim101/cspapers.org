A computer display that is sufficiently realistic such that the difference between a presented image and a real object cannot be discerned is in high demand in a wide range of fields, such as entertainment, digital signage, and design industry. To achieve such a level of reality, it is essential to reproduce the three-dimensional (3D) shape and material appearances simultaneously; however, to date, developing a display that can satisfy both conditions has been difficult. To address this problem, we propose a system that places physical elements at desired locations to create a visual image that is perceivable by the naked eye. This configuration can be realized by exploiting characteristics of human visual perception. Humans perceive light modulation as perfectly steady light if the modulation rate is sufficiently high. Therefore, if high-speed spatially varying illumination is projected to the actuated physical elements possessing various appearances at the desired timing, a realistic visual image that can be transformed dynamically by simply modifying the lighting pattern can be obtained. We call the proposed display technology Phyxel. This paper describes the proposed configuration and required performance for Phyxel. We also demonstrate three applications: dynamic stop motion, a layered 3D display, and shape mixture.
