We propose a new framework for a self-propelled flexible cable in which the freedom of lateral motion with sliding movements is increased on the basis of simple shape information.We developed a large-scale prototype of the flexible cable that has a ciliary drive mechanism and precise shape sensors to investigate our concept.We developed a kinetic model for the prototype by employing the nonlinear driving force model and the lateral friction model for representing slippages. Further, we proposed a sliding motion control method that focus on the shape and length of the straight element. We applied the method to control the running direction. The experimental results and dynamic simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of sliding motion for controlling the running direction.
