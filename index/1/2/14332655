The ability to move in complex environments is a key property required for deployment of modular robots in challenging applications like search & rescue missions or space exploration. Wide range of motion types like crawling or walking can be achieved using Central Pattern Generators producing periodic control signals. Although these motions can be very effective to steer robots in their vicinity or in a given direction, they need to be switched to reach a far position in the environment. This paper presents a novel modification of Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for modular robots. For efficient exploration of the configuration space, predefined motion primitives are used. While the motion primitives provide effective local motions, the RRT-based planner switches them in order to reach the desired global goal.
