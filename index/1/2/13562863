The typical application of algorithm animation to assist instruction involves students viewing already prepared animations. An alternative strategy is to have the students themselves construct animations of algorithms. The Samba algorithm animation tool fosters such student-built animations. Samba was used in an undergraduate algorithms course in which students constructed algorithm animations as regular class assignments. This article describes Samba and documents our experiences using it in the algorithms course. Student reaction to the animation assignments was very positive, and the students appeared to learn the pertinent algorithms extremely well.
