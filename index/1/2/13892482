The reconstruction problem on the tree plays a key role in several important computational problems. Deep conjectures in statistical physics link the reconstruction problem to properties of random constraint satisfaction problems including random k-SAT and random colourings of random graphs. At this precise threshold the space of solutions is conjectured to undergo a phase transition from a single collected mass to exponentially many small clusters at which point local search algorithm must fail. In computational biology the reconstruction problem is central in phylogenetics. It has been shown [Mossel 04] that solvability of the reconstruction problem is equivalent to phylogenetic reconstruction with short sequences for the binary symmetric model.
 Rigorous reconstruction thresholds, however, have only been established in a small number of models. We confirm conjectures made by Mezard and Montanari for the Potts models proving the first exact reconstruction threshold in a non-binary model establishing the so-called Kesten-Stigum bound for the 3-state Potts model on regular trees of large degree. We further establish that the Kesten-Stigum bound is not tight for the $q$-state Potts model when q â‰¥ 5. Moreover, we determine asymptotics for these reconstruction thresholds.
