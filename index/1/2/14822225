This work introduces a new method called Self Organizing Neural Network (SONN) algorithm and compares its performance with Back Propagation in a signal separation application. The problem is to separate two signals; a modem data signal and a male speech signal, added and transmitted through a 4 khz channel. The signals are sampled at 8 khz, and using supervised learning, an attempt is made to reconstruct them. The SONN is an algorithm that constructs its own network topology during training, which is shown to be much smaller than the BP network, faster to trained, and free from the trial-and-error network design that characterize BP.
