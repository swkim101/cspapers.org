This paper focuses on the simplification of the on-line programming process of industrial robots. It presents a modular on-line programming environment (software and hardware), which supports an intuitive way of moving and teaching robots, while supporting the user with assisting algorithms like collision avoidance and automatic path planning. Main idea is the combination of different approaches from tele-operation, programming by demonstration and off-line programming, and reuse them in a new fashion on-line on the shopfloor. The proposed programming environment is designed to evaluate the usability of different combination of assisting techniques.
