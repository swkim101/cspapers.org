An asynchronous communication library for accessing and managing dynamic hash tables over a network of Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP) is presented. A blocking factor is shown experimentally to reduce the variance of the wall clock time. It is also shown that remote accesses to a distributed hash table can be as effective and scalable as the one-sided operations of the low-level communication middleware on an IBM SP.
