The purpose of this paper is to describe the Loper, a multi-purpose robotic platform under development at the University of Minnesota's Center for Distributed Robotics. Leper's unique Tri-lobe wheel design and highly compliant chassis make the platform especially suited for overcoming many of the challenges associated with search operations in urban settings. The mechanically simple design and use of commercially available components make Loper easily maintainable. The platform also features long operational time, onboard sensor processing, dedicated motion control, and four reconfigurable sensor bays.
