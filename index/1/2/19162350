Online evaluation allows information retrieval systems to be assessed based on how real users respond to search results presented. Compared with traditional offline evaluation based on manual relevance assessments, online evaluation is particularly attractive in settings where reliable assessments are difficult or too expensive to obtain. However, the successful use of online evaluation requires the right metrics to be used, as real user behaviour is often difficult to interpret. I will present interleaving, a sensitive online evaluation approach that creates paired comparisons for every user query, and compare it with alternative A/B online evaluation approaches. I will also show how interleaving can be parameterized to create a family of evaluation metrics that can be chosen to best match the goals of an evaluation.
