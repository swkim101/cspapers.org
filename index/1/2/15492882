On-chip performance counters play a vital role in computer architecture research due to their ability to quickly provide insights into application behaviors that are time consuming to characterize with traditional methods. The usefulness of modern performance counters, however, is limited by inefficient techniques used today to access them. Current access techniques rely on imprecise sampling or heavyweight kernel interaction forcing users to choose between precision or speed and thus restricting the use of performance counter hardware. In this paper, we describe new methods that enable precise, lightweight interfacing to on-chip performance counters. These low-overhead techniques allow precise reading of virtualized counters in low tens of nanoseconds, which is one to two orders of magnitude faster than current access techniques. Further, these tools provide several fresh insights on the behavior of modern parallel programs such as MySQL and Firefox, which were previously obscured (or impossible to obtain) by existing methods for characterization. Based on case studies with our new access methods, we discuss seven implications for computer architects in the cloud era and three methods for enhancing hardware counters further. Taken together, these observations have the potential to open up new avenues for architecture research.
