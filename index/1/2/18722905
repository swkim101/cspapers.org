For the validation of the kernel system calls of a family of UNIX 1) systems a knowledge based test environment was conceived. A prototype version is currently implemented in Prolog. The knowledge base consists essentially of three parts:test case specifications of the various system calls,
a test suite generator with predicates including information about UNIX system properties and sound test practices, and
a test protocol archive including utilities to extract and prepare reports about the test results.

All information in the knowledge base is stored as Horn clauses, i.e. facts and rules immediately to be consulted and executed by a Prolog interpreter.
