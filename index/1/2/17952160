Multi-view outlier detection is a challenging problem due to the inconsistent behaviors and complicated distributions of samples across different views. The existing approaches are designed to identify the outlier exhibiting inconsistent characteristics across different views. However, due to the inevitable system errors caused by data-captured sensors or others, there always exists another type of outlier, which consistently behaves abnormally in individual view. Unfortunately, this kind of outlier is neglected by all the existing multi-view outlier detection methods, consequently their outlier detection performances are dramatically harmed. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-regularized Multi-view Outlier Detection method (DMOD) to detect both kinds of anomalies simultaneously. By representing the multi-view data with latent coefficients and sample-specific errors, we characterize each kind of outlier explicitly. Moreover, an outlier measurement criterion is well-designed to quantify the inconsistency. To solve the proposed non-smooth model, a novel optimization algorithm is proposed in an iterative manner. We evaluate our method on five datasets with different outlier settings. The consistent superior results to other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
