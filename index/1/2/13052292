A manipulator system for micro-object handling is presented and the design concepts used for system construction are described. The manipulator consists of two robots (right- and left-hand robots) and a optical stereo microscope. The right-hand robot has a working tool and a three-axis force sensor and is equipped with two orientational DOF; the left-hand one has a work table and is equipped with two orientational and three translational DOF. This manipulator system has a wide range of translational and orientational motions. Since all axes of the orientational DOF intersect at the tip of the tool, and this tip coincides with the focus area, micro-object handling operations can subsequently be executed within the focus area. A micro air turbine (diameter = 502 /spl mu/m) comprised of three parts was successfully assembled by the manipulator system. A sucking tool composed of a drawn glass pipe and vacuum pump were used for its assembly.
