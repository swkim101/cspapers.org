Admittance control is a well-established and popular control strategy in modern robotics. However, the standard admittance controller has several limitations. First, the passivity can be guaranteed by finding a set of control parameters that makes the admittance function positive real. However, this approach cannot be applied to multi degrees-of-freedom robot because it requires transfer function analysis. Second, standard admittance controller is not suitable when the system is exposed to unexpected environmental interaction (of which interaction force is not measured) due to the wall sticking effect. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an admittance controller of which structure can be constructed by feedback interconnection of passive subsystems. The proposed approach was verified using experiments and simulations.
