Volumetric modeling surpasses surface modeling by allowing certain types of engineering analysis to be performed automatically. In this paper, we describe methods by which a designer may interact with a data base of parts. These methods afford comprehensive view control and the ability to interrogate the geometry of the model. In addition, the user may access a built-in calculator which can be programmed by means of macroinstructions. The macroinstruction definition capability allows the user to "teach" the system parameterized sequences of commands. As a library of such sequences grows, a relatively unsophisticated user is enabled to perform automated engineering analyses using the precise geometric model of a part or assembly. This avoids the tedium and errors associated with re-entering geometric information. For many applications, the integrated nature of the system significantly reduces lead time by allowing the design cycle to be executed within one run of the program.
