A natural language question answering system is presented. The system's parser maps semantic paraphrases into a single deep structure characterized by a canonical verb. A modeling scheme using semantic nets and STRIPS-like operators assimilates the sequence of input information. Natural language responses to questions are generated from a data base of semantic nets by "parsing" syntactic rules retrieved from the lexicon.
