In many cases, person re-id needs to be conducted between image and video clip, e.g., re-identifying a suspect from large quantities of pedestrian videos given a single image of him. We call re-id in this scenario as image to video person re-id (IVPR). In practice, image and video are usually represented with different features, and there usually exist large variations between frames within each video. These factors make matching between image and video become a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a joint feature projection matrix and heterogeneous dictionary pair learning (PHDL) approach for IVPR. Specifically, PHDL jointly learns an intra-video projection matrix and a pair of heterogeneous image and video dictionaries. With the learned projection matrix, the influence of variations within each video to the matching can be reduced. With the learned dictionary pair, the heterogeneous image and video features can be transformed into coding coefficients with the same dimension, such that the matching can be conducted using coding coefficients. Furthermore, to ensure that the obtained coding coefficients have favorable discriminability, PHDL designs a point-to-set coefficient discriminant term. Experiments on the public iLIDS-VID and PRID 2011 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
