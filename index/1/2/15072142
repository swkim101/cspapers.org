This paper introduces a novel method for automatic annotation of images with keywords from a generic vocabulary of concepts or objects for the purpose of content-based image retrieval. An image, represented as sequence of feature-vectors characterizing low-level visual features such as color, texture or oriented-edges, is modeled as having been stochastically generated by a hidden Markov model, whose states represent concepts. The parameters of the model are estimated from a set of manually annotated (training) images. Each image in a large test collection is then automatically annotated with the a posteriori probability of concepts present in it. This annotation supports content-based search of the image-collection via keywords. Various aspects of model parameterization, parameter estimation, and image annotation are discussed. Empirical retrieval results are presented on two image-collections | COREL and key-frames from TRECVID. Comparisons are made with two other recently developed techniques on the same datasets.
