A general purpose system for a computer simulation of pattern recognition algorithms is proposed that consists of a universal scanner for optical images input to the computer, a display for visual output, and software. A characteristic feature of the system is a blok structure of the hard-ware and software. The system allows carrying out most of the data processing necessary for simulating the algorithms of recognizing the optical images of objects of various physical natures.
