The real-time command and control environments characteristic of tactical military systems and industrial process control systems place unique and conflicting design requirements on a support computer system. These requirements include fast context switching, selective protection of programs and their files, controlled sharing of program and files, high processing speed, flexible, yet fast priority structure for interrupts and program execution, flexible high-speed I/O and flexible intercommunication and control for interacting programs. This paper describes a new computer system now being prototyped to satisfy these requirements. The system design includes a number of unique features relating to the efficient implementation of a flexible virtual memory addressing system for the stringent real-time environment.
