The study of social network evolution has attracted many attentions from both the industry and academia. In this paper we demonstrate LaFT-Explorer, a general toolkit for explaining and reproducing the network growth process based on the friendship propagation. LaFT-Explorer presents multiple perspectives for analyzing the network evolution process and structure, including LaFT-Tree, LaFT-Trace and LaFT-Flow. Upon that we build LaFT-Rec, a new visualized interactive friend recommendation service based on the friendship propagation. LaFT-Rec not only shows whom one may make friends with, but also tells the user that why you should make friends with him and how you can reach him. We demonstrate our system built upon the academic social network of DBLP.
