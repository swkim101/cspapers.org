Software systems for the analysis of image-based biomedical data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), require a flexible data model, fast computational techniques and a graphical user interface. Object-otiented programming languages, such as Java and C++ facilitate software reuse and maintainability, and provide the foundations for the development of complex data analysis applications. This paper explores the advantages and disadvantages of using these two programming environments for scientific computation.
