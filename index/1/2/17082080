One of the main challenges for service robots during operation lies in the handling of unavoidable uncertainties which originate from model and sensor inaccuracies and which are characteristic for realistic application scenarios. Robustness under real world conditions can only be achieved when the dominant uncertainties are explicitly represented and purposefully managed by the robot's control system. We therefore adopt a probabilistic approach in which perception is regarded as a sequential estimation process and follow a Bayesian filtering methodology. Under these assumptions probabilistic models of the robot's perception systems are key. In this paper we shortly describe a model based object recognition and localization system. However, we do not not focus on the 6D pose estimation procedure itself, but on the method to quantify and compute the uncertainty associated with it. We construct a Gaussian approximation of the resulting pose error using the implicit function theorem. It is then used as a proposal density for importance sampling. Our goal is to sample from the measurement model describing 6D object localization based on local features in a Bayesian filtering context.
