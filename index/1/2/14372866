As models are elevated to first-class artifacts within the software development lifecycle, new approaches are needed to address the accidental complexities associated with current modeling practice (e.g., manually evolving the deep hierarchical structures of large system models can be error prone and labor intensive). This research abstract presents a model transformation approach to automate model evolution and testing tools to improve the quality of model transformation.
