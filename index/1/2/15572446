While one-class sup-port vector machines have demonstrated their effectiveness asan anomaly detection technique, their ability to model largedatasets is limited due to their memory and time complexityfor training. To address this issue for supervised learning ofkernel machines, there has been growing interest in randomprojection methods as an alternative to the computationallyexpensive problems of kernel matrix construction and sup-port vector optimisation. In this paper we leverage the theoryof nonlinear random projections and propose the RandomisedOne-class SVM (R1SVM), which is an efficient and scalableanomaly detection technique that can be trained on large-scale datasets. Our empirical analysis on several real-life andsynthetic datasets shows that our randomised 1SVM algo-rithm achieves comparable or better accuracy to deep autoen-coder and traditional kernelised approaches for anomaly de-tection, while being approximately 100 times faster in train-ing and testing
