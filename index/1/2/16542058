Although formal methods have been successfully applied in various industrial applications, their use in software development is still restricted to individual case studies. To overcome this situation we aim at a methodology for an evolutionary formal software development which allows for a stepwise and incremental development process along the line of rapid prototyping. The approach is based on work on a formal management of change for formal developments which is able to maintain proofs when changing specifications.
