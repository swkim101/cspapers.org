Laboratory facilities as part of Computer Science departments can easily be categorized as either sufficient, or non-existent. There is no middle ground, either you are a “have” or you are a ldquo;have-not”.
 What is the reason for this apparent split? Is it economic considerations, lack of justification, poor planning, supplemental sources, or just a quirk of fate? The answer seems to be a combination of all of these reasons and forces us to ask the more important question, “Does Computer Science require laboratory facilities?” I think the answer is clearly yes and not only do I hope to show what the need is, but I also hope to show one way of developing a laboratory to meet this need. In fact, I shall conclude this paper with a discussion of the situation at the University of Massachusetts showing how we are attempting to develop the laboratory along with our department.
