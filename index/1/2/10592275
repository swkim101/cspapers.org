Complex model transformation is crucial in several domains, including Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), information visualisation and data mapping. Most current approaches use meta-model-driven transformation specification via coding in textual scripting languages. This paper demonstrates a novel approach and tool support that instead provides for specification of correspondences between models using concrete visualisations of source and target models, and generates transformation scripts from these by-example model correspondence specifications.
