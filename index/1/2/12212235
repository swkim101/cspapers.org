This paper describes an approach to robotic control that is patterned after models of human skill acquisition. The intent is to develop robots capable of learning how to accomplish complex tasks using designer-supplied instructions and self induced practice. A simulation is presented in which a rule-based system supervises the training of a neural network and controls the operation of the system during the learning process. Simulation results show the interaction between rule-based and network-based system components during various phases of training and supervision.
