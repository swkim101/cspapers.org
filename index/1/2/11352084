-4 new call admission scheme is proposed for IS-%&like CDMA voice/data network. The scheme is based on controlling the activity of asynchronous data users at the base station controller (BSC) as well as controlling the round trip frame delay between the BSC and the mobile host (for each TCP segment) which effectively reduces the airlink activity, thus leading to an increase in the CDMA soft capacity. An expression for the average data activity is derived by modeling, the interaction between the TCP and the RLP (radio link layer protocol at the BSC providing limited reliability over the airlink), using a mean value analysis. Sumerical results show the interactions between the various TCP/RLP parameters like TCP source activity and average round trip frame delay, and also capture the soft capacity enhancement. When the activities of data users are reduced, the soft capacity is enhanced by as high as 5 Erlangs.
