We study the task of learning the preferences of online readers of news, based on their past choices. Previous work has shown that it is possible to model this situation as a competition between articles, where the most appealing articles of the day are those selected by the most users. The appeal of an article can be computed from its textual content, and the evaluation function can be learned from training data. In this paper, we show how this task can benefit from an efficient algorithm, based on hashing representations, which enables it to be deployed on high intensity data streams. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on four real world news streams, compare it with standard approaches, and describe a new online demonstration based on this technology.
