We introduce the notion of self-adapting concurrency control algorithms --- concurrency control algorithms that consist of several rw and several ww synchronization techniques, and employ combinations of the techniques in a manner that attains a performance objective. We Consider synchronization techniques that use locking and certification. A general proof method for such algorithms is outlined and applied.
