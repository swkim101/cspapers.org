One of the most common problems in machine learning and statistics consists of estimating the mean response <i>Xβ</i> from a vector of observations <i>y</i> assuming <i>y</i> = <i>Xβ</i> + <i>ε</i> where <i>X</i> is known, β is a vector of parameters of interest and <i>ε</i> a vector of stochastic errors. We are particularly interested here in the case where the dimension <i>K</i> of β is much higher than the dimension of <i>y</i>. We propose some flexible Bayesian models which can yield sparse estimates of β. We show that as <i>K</i> → ∞ these models are closely related to a class of Lévy processes. Simulations demonstrate that our models outperform significantly a range of popular alternatives.
