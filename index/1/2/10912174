There are many computational methods for calculation and simulation of MHD plasma flows. This paper develops a new computational method based on the core results of the exist computations. The new computation is called non-symmetric equilibria solver (NES). The fundamental of this computation is to use a calculation similar to multi-fluid code with the external boundary wrapper. The conditions to apply this new computation are isentropic plasma and short collision time between any particles in the plasma. Thus, the MHD equations which is normally used in the non-equilibrium plasma can be solved. It is desired that this computation can be modified to consider MHD phenomena in both non-equilibrium and equilibrium plasma models.
