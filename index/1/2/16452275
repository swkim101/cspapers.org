In this paper a novel teleoperation framework for aerial robots that physically interact with the environment is presented. This framework allows to teleoperate the robot both in contact-free flight and in physical contact with the environment in order, e.g., to apply desired forces on objects of the environment. The framework is build upon an impedance-like indirect interaction force controller that allows to use standard underactuated aerial robots as force effectors. Haptic feedback from the master side enables the user to feel the contact forces exerted by the robot. An automatic potential field-based slowing-down policy is used by the robot to ensure a smooth transition between the contact-free motion phase and the force interaction phase. The effectiveness of the approach has been shown in extensive human-in-the-loop simulations including remote pressing of buttons on a surface and pushing a cart until it touches a wall.
