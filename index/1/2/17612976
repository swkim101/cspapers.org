The literature of software engineering has been growing rapidly. Yet finding out what has been done in a particular area of software engineering is frequently a difficult and unsatisfying task. Even limiting consideration to bibliographic sources of information, such as journal articles, reports, and books, one faces several cloudy courses of action when trying to search the literature. Problems of completeness, currency, and document availability abound.
 These problems are due, at least in part, to the rapid pace of events and the relative youth of the field. No truly comprehensive index to the computer science literature exists. Rather, several meritorious, partially overlapping indexes co-exist. And each offers particular advantages and disadvantages.
 In this paper, indexes and other search aids of the literature of software engineering are surveyed and and compared. Emphasis is placed on how these tools can aid the researcher in keeping up-to-date or in conducting a retrospective survey of the work on a particular topic. The utility of recently available commercial computer-aided literature searching services is stressed.
