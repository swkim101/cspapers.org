This paper presents a novel manipulator for human-robot interaction that has low mass and inertia without losing stiffness and payload performance. A lightweight tension amplifying mechanism that increases the joint stiffness in quadratic order is proposed. High stiffness is essential for precise and rapid manipulation, and low mass and inertia are important factors for safety due to low stored kinetic energy. The proposed tension amplifying mechanism was applied to a 1-DOF elbow joint and then extended to a 3-DOF wrist joint. The developed manipulator was analyzed in terms of inertia, stiffness, and strength properties. Its moving part weighs 3.37 kg, and its inertia is 0.57 kgÂ·m2, which is similar to that of a human arm. The stiffness of the developed elbow joint is 1440Nm/rad, which is comparable to that of the joints with rigid components in industrial manipulators. A detailed description of the design is provided, and thorough analysis verifies the performance of the proposed mechanism.
