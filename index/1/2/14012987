We demonstrate the closed-loop control of a magnetotactic bacterium (MTB), i.e., Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, within a micro-fabricated maze using a magnetic-based manipulation system. The effect of the channel wall on the motion of the MTB is experimentally analyzed. This analysis is done by comparing the characteristics of the transient- and steady-states of the controlled MTB inside and outside a micro-fabricated maze. In this analysis, the magnetic dipole moment of our MTB is characterized using a motile technique (the u-turn technique), then used in the realization of a closed-loop control system. This control system allows the MTB to reach reference positions within a micro-fabricated maze with a channel width of 10 μm, at a velocity of 8 μm/s. Further, the control system positions the MTB within a region-of-convergence of 10 μm in diameter. Due to the effect of the channel wall, we observe that the velocity and the positioning accuracy of the MTB are decreased and increased by 71% and 44%, respectively.
