The purpose of this paper is to describe an application program written by the International Business Machines Corporation to couple the existing Electronic Circuit Analysis Program(1) with the IBM 2250 cathode ray tube display scope. The program which, in this paper, will be referred to as 2250 ECAP is a Type III program available from IBM(2). 2250 ECAP has been in use at Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, California, for approximately four months. This paper will detail some of the experiences available from the use of this program, some of the pitfalls of its use, as well as human factor education relative to the displayed image generated throughout the application.
