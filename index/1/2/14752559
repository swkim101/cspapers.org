Pollution is one of the main problems that humans are suffering from. Moreover air pollution is one of the hardest to escape. Although human spend most of their time indoor, most of the previous pollution monitoring studies focused on outdoor air monitoring. In this paper we present a new framework for zone based indoor mobile pollution sensing. Users carry portable pollution sensors along with NFC enabled phones to detect zone (i.e. tag) proximity in a building. NFC here assists in aggregating sensor data for further processing. Our system has been deployed and evaluated through a preliminary user study.
