Interface design toolkits have proven useful, both for exploring conceptual issues in user interface design, and for constructing product quality interfaces for commercial applications. However, most such toolkits focus on a relatively low-level of abstraction, are oriented towards design of a limited set of “standard” interface types, and are intended for expert users. Our QUICK system explores the opposite pole. QUICK is a toolkit for the design of highly interactive direct manipulation interfaces oriented specifically towards nonprogrammers. The challenge we face in QUICK lies in maximizing power and flexibility in an extremely simple environment. We explore the utility of direct manipulation, the object oriented paradigm and a structure editor in this context.
