In this paper, techniques of force-feedback control are applied to the hydrodynamic study of a laboratory robotic fish. The experimental apparatus which allows a robotic model to accelerate from rest to a steady speed under self-propelled conditions is clearly described. In the current apparatus, the robotic fish is mounted on a servo guide rail system and the towing speed is not preset but determined by the measured force acting on the body of the fish. Such an apparatus enables the simultaneous measurement of power consumption, thrust efficiency and speed of a robotic model obtained under self-propelled conditions. The thrust efficiency of the robotic fish can be estimated based on a 2-D vortex ring force estimation method. By comparing the thrust performance of carangiform body-shaped robotic swimmer with different typical BCF (body and caudal fin ) swimming modes, i.e. anguilliform, carangiform and thunniform, we show that the robotic swimming fish with the thunniform kinematic movement not only reaches a higher steady swimming speed but is also more efficient than the other two modes However, in the start phase, using the anguilliform kinematic movement, the robotic swimmer accelerates faster among all kinematic movements. Ultimately, we found that the robotic fish always produce a double-row wake structure no matter which swimming mode used.
