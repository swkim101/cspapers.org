The present paper describes finite-gain L2 stability guaranteed locally by the proposed anti-windup adaptive law for Euler-Lagrange systems with actuator saturation. All constant parameters of the robot system are estimated for an arbitrary target orbit. In order to achieve finite-gain L2 stability and ensure adaptive tracking performance, an output saturation function of the tracking error is introduced. The finite L2 gains are derived considering four actuator saturation cases, and finite-gain L2 stability is guaranteed locally based on passivity. The control performance is verified through numerical simulations using a two-link robot arm.
