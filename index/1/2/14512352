The determination of appropriate values for free algorithm parameters is a challenging and tedious task in the design of effective algorithms for hard problems. Such parameters include categorical choices (e.g., neighborhood structure in local search or variable/value ordering heuristics in tree search), as well as numerical parameters (e.g., noise or restart timing). In practice, tuning of these parameters is largely carried out manually by applying rules of thumb and crude heuristics, while more principled approaches are only rarely used. In this paper, we present a local search approach for algorithm configuration and prove its convergence to the globally optimal parameter configuration. Our approach is very versatile: it can, e.g., be used for minimising run-time in decision problems or for maximising solution quality in optimisation problems. It further applies to arbitrary algorithms, including heuristic tree search and local search algorithms, with no limitation on the number of parameters. Experiments in four algorithm configuration scenarios demonstrate that our automatically determined parameter settings always outperform the algorithm defaults, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Our approach also shows better performance and greater flexibility than the recent CALIBRA system. Our ParamILS code, along with instructions on how to use it for tuning your own algorithms, is available on-line at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/ParamILS.
