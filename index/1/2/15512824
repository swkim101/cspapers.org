The laboratory part of a Computer Science course has often been a frustrating experience for my students and myself. In the past I have had two main approaches for assigning problems. One approach was to give trivial and artificial exercises whose purpose was to illustrate some important concept. For example, the students might have been asked to implement a queue of integers. This approach advantageously emphasized one concept, was easy for students to solve and easy to grade. However, a disadvantage of this approach was that the concept was learned in a meaningless context presenting the student with little motivation to master the concept. In addition, everyone solved the problem leaving little challenge for the bright students.
