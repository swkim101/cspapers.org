This paper describes three years of experience with an intensive three course summer semester on web and mobile entrepreneurship for second year CS students and beyond. The program is similar in structure to a high school summer camp or to a summer accelerator/incubator program except that it has a much higher level of academic content and provides the credit equivalent to three Computer Science electives and a full semester of residency. The program has been effective at teaching students production programming and entrepreneurship and has stimulated entrepreneurial activity during the academic year. It is taken by about half of the CS majors in the department which is surprising since it requires them to spend their summer months in a very intense academic and entrepreneurial experience which is quite different from the usual summer experience of their peers.
