Internet of Things (IoT) have been connecting the physical world seamlessly and provides tremendous opportunities to a wide range of applications. However, potential risks exist when IoT system collects local sensor data and uploads to the Cloud. The private data leakage can be severe with curious database administrator or malicious hackers who compromise the Cloud. In this demo, we solve this problem of guaranteeing the user data privacy and security using compressive sensing based cryptographic method. We present CScrypt, a compressive-sensing-based encryption engine for the Cloud-enabled IoT systems to secure the interaction between the IoT devices and the Cloud. Our system exploits the fact that each individual's biometric data can be trained to a unique dictionary which can be used as an encryption key meanwhile to compress the original data. We will demonstrate a functioning prototype of our system using live data stream when attending the conference.
