A simple and efficient algorithm for generating bottom-up rewrite system (BURS) tables is described. A small prototype implementation produces tables 10 to 30 times more quickly than the best current techniques. The algorithm does not require novel data structures or complicated algorithmic techniques. Previously published methods for the on-the-fly elimination of states are generalized and simplified to create a new method, triangle trimming, that is employed in the algorithm.
