This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in using virtualization technologies in embedded devices. The uses and requirements that have shaped the current generation of Hypervisors for data centers and server farms are introduced. The paper then explores how Multicore processors and Hypervisors can be used to design embedded devices with more features, higher performance and lower power consumption. However, use in a wide range of embedded devices requires new Hypervisor capabilities. These new requirements are analyzed. Finally, the paper looks into areas of Hypervisor design related to meeting the requirements of embedded devices.
