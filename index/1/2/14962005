Traditional document retrieval has shown to be a competitive approach in XML element retrieval, which is counter-intuitive since the element retrieval task requests all and only relevant document parts to be retrieved. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of document and element retrieval, highlights the relative strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, and explains the relative effectiveness of document retrieval approaches at element retrieval tasks.
