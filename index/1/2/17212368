This work proposes a number of different approaches for incorporating temporal extensions to object-oriented databases. One important question that arises when dealing with temporal databases in the context of objec&oriented systems is whether to associate time with objects or with attributes. Results of previous work comparing tuple (ob ject) versioning and attribute versioning — such as whether to extend flat (F’NF) or nested (NF’NF) relational models — are not applicable to temporal object-oriented databases. This is because object-oriented models provide more powerful constructs than traditional modeis for structuring complex objects. Our goal in this paper is to study alternative temporal object-oriented database representations by identifying the different techniques for representing temporal databases in an object-riented framework. This is in contrast to other work that adopts a single particular approach. Our goal is to determine the particular situation for which each repr~ sentation is applicable. We define the concepts of object versioning and attribute versioning in temporal object-oriented models, and we concentrate on identifying the various representations of temporal relationships between objects. Another contribution of this paper is to analyze our different temporal representations and to determine their storage requirement. A general framework is defined in which the characteristics of various temporal models are studied. A simulation study is performed comparing storage costs of our various temporal representations, and also a temporal FNF relational representation. * Computer Science Engineering Department ,The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas 76019, Fax: (817) 2733784, Telephone: (817) 273-3785, Email: ehnasri@cse.uta.edu. t Office Of The Vice President for Resemch & Information Technology, Rice University, P.O.
