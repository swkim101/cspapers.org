The HYPERchannel communication network configured around one to four channels is considered. We develop a queueing model which characterizes the network performance as a function of the number of channels, the channel load and the number of stations in the network. The model is used to analyze the multichannel system performance and to evaluate the effect of the channel selection mechanism, as implemented by the HYPERchannel station interface units, on the performance.
It is shown that the network bandwidth utilization is directly related to the channel selection process and that it varies with network configuration and load. These observed relations are especially significant since they are most pronounced in networks with small number of stations, the typical configuration in the majority of operational HYPERchannel networks.
