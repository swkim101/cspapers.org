paper, we describe an innovative project where Web technologies are exploited to foster science learning in an integrated but mobile smart learning environment. Context- awareness is considered a crucial skill in science learning, therefore we imagined a solution to train students for context awareness by illustrating context gaps based on on-site observations and measurements. A component named MazCalc contains the parameters of each context and allows us to compute the context gap and its potential to stimulate context-awareness among students. International collaborative learning is structured in such a way to induce students to make comparisons and discuss the topic studied. Experiments are being conducted in Biology and are in preparation in Geology.
