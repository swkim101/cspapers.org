We provide a framework for studying a wide variety of randomized on-line problems (including k-server, Metrical Task Systems, and File Allocation). We show how to construct a linear program whose solution gives an upper bound on the best possible competitive ratio. An optimal solution to the linear program also constructs an algorithm achieving this bound. By examining an optimal solution of the dual, we can construct another linear program which provides a lower bound. We give sufficient conditions for these bounds to agree, thus determining the best possible competitive ratio for the on-line problem. We use this framework to prove a lower bound of 1.5 on the competitive ratio of any a-server algorithm on any space of at least three points.
