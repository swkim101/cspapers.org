Some work showed that segmenting web pages into "semantic independent" blocks could help to improve the whole page retrieval. One key and unexplored issue is how to combine the block importance and relevance to a given query. In this poster, we first propose an automatic way to measure block importance to improve retrieval. After that, user information need is also concerned to refine block importance for different users.
