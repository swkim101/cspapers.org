This paper describes the issues underlying the development of 64-bit C-MPI (C-DAC Message Passing Interface) and the porting semantic and strategies of 64-bit C-MPI. This work discusses various issues arising during the porting from 32-bit C-MPI to 64-bit C-MPI that will serve as guidelines to scientific community for their advanced MPI porting work. The ported 64-bit C-MPI is tested, results of some initial experiments comparing 32-bit and 64-bit C-MPI performance under Ethernet and PARAMNet-II interconnect network is presented.
