The word “context” in the title is chosen quite specifically. In design automation the data base structure and organization are relevant but not of primary concern: rather, the content of a data base and its interaction with various processes are of greater importance. It might appear that the word “environment” is more appropriate in this context, but this is true only if it is further qualified. Therefore, I have chosen to use the word “context”, since where a design automation data base is utilized it should explain its own meaning by virtue of being there; otherwise, it is not performing the function for which it was designed.
 The words “design automation” are not well defined in common usage. In the eyes of some people design automation is a very restrictive discipline relating only to the actual design of a device as small as a circuit composed of only a few electrical components, or a piece of mechanical cabinetry. Design automation in its broadest sense must be concerned with the life of a device from conception to end of life. Under this definition of design automation a device is a complete entity.
