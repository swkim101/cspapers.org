HPC++ is a C++ library and language extension framework that is being developed by the HPC++ consortium as a standard model for portable parallel C++ programming. This paper describes an initial implementation of the HPC++ Parallel Standard Template Library (PSTL) framework. This implementation includes seven distributed containers as well as selected algorithms. We include preliminary performance results from several experiments using the PSTL.
