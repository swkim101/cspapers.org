Identifying documents that describe a specific type of event is challenging due to the high complexity and variety of event descriptions. We propose a multi-faceted event recognition approach, which identifies documents about an event using event phrases as well as defining characteristics of the event. Our research focuses on civil unrest events and learns civil unrest expressions as well as phrases corresponding to potential agents and reasons for civil unrest. We present a bootstrapping algorithm that automatically acquires event phrases, agent terms, and purpose (reason) phrases from unannotated texts. We use the bootstrapped dictionaries to identify civil unrest documents and show that multi-faceted event recognition can yield high accuracy.
