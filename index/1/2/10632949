How to make vision system work robustly under dynamic light conditions is still a challenging research focus in computer/robot vision community. In this paper, a novel camera parameters auto-adjusting technique based on image entropy is proposed. Firstly image entropy is defined and its relationship with camera parameters is verified by experiments. Then how to optimize the camera parameters based on image entropy is proposed to make robot vision adaptive to the different light conditions. The algorithm is tested by using the omnidirectional vision in indoor RoboCup Middle Size League environment and the perspective camera in outdoor ordinary environment, and the results show that the method is effective and color constancy to some extent can be achieved.
