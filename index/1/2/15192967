This paper proposes a novel translation-based knowledge graph embedding that preserves the logical properties of relations such as transitivity and symmetricity. The embedding space generated by existing translation-based embeddings do not represent transitive and symmetric relations precisely, because they ignore the role of entities in triples. Thus, we introduce a role-specific projection which maps an entity to distinct vectors according to its role in a triple. That is, a head entity is projected onto an embedding space by a head projection operator, and a tail entity is projected by a tail projection operator. This idea is applied to TransE, TransR, and TransD to produce lppTransE, lppTransR, and lppTransD, respectively. According to the experimental results on link prediction and triple classification, the proposed logical property preserving embeddings show the state-of-the-art performance at both tasks. These results prove that it is critical to preserve logical properties of relations while embedding knowledge graphs, and the proposed method does it effectively.
