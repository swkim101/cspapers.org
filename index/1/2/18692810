The internet is a rich source of information where the user can find almost everything s/he is looking for. In the last years, the internet has grown exponentially and the information overload problem has appeared. In order to deal with these issues, Recommender Systems have been developed (Resnick et al. 1994). The main characteristic of recommender system is the ability to aggregate information and to match the recommendations with the information people is looking for. Despite recommender systems being efficient, for some recommender applications it is possible that a single information source does not contain the complete information needed for the recommendation. For example, in the tourism domain, the travel package recommendation is composed by several information components such as flights, hotels and entertainment, and specific knowledge to assemble all the components is necessary. Due for the distributed nature of the information, multiagent systems (MAS) are promising to retrieve, filter and use information relevant to the recommendation. MAS can be use to avoid unnecessary processing and can be built to deal with dynamic changes in the information source. We propose a multiagent recommender approach where the agents work in a distributed and cooperative way, sharing and negotiating knowledge with the global objective of recommending the best travel package to the user. In order to achieve this goal, this approach uses a combination of a distributed truth maintenance system (TMS) as in (Huhns & Bridgeland 1991) and a distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) (Modi et al. 2003). The distributed TMS helps to keep the integrity of the knowledge base of each agent, while the distributed constraint optimization approach is used to help the coordination among the agents during the search processes. This novel combination is applied in the tourism domain to be validated in a real-world application.
