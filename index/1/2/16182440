We have previously developed a collaborative infrastructure called SCAPE - an acronym for Stereoscopic Collaboration in Augmented and Projective Environments - that integrates the traditionally separate paradigms of virtual and augmented reality. In this paper, we extend SCAPE by formalizing its underlying mathematical framework and detailing three augmented Widgets constructed via this framework: CoCylinder, Magnifier, and CoCube. These devices promote intuitive ways of selecting, examining, and sharing synthetic objects, and retrieving associated documentary text. Finally we present a testbed application to showcase SCAPE's capabilities for interaction in large, augmented virtual environments.
