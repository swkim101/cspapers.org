In this paper, the effects of adaptive robotic behavior via learning momentum in the context of a robotic team are studied. Learning momentum is a variation on parametric adjustment methods that has previously been successfully applied to enhance individual robot performance. In particular, we now assess, via simulation, the potential advantages of a team of robots using this capability to alter behavioral parameters when compared to a similar team of robots with static parameters.
