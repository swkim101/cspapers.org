This paper describes Marquette University's efforts to build an experimental embedded systems laboratory for hands-on projects in an operating systems course. Our prototype laboratory is now serving as the basis for a coherent sequence of class projects threaded throughout courses in hardware systems, operating systems, networking, and embedded systems. We describe the major components of our Embedded XINU laboratory environment, the operating systems course, and related improvements in other core courses of our curriculum.
