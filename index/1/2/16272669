R-tree based spatial join is useful because of both its superior performance and the wide spread implementation of R-trees. We present a new R-tree join method called BFRJ (Breadth-First R-tree Join). BFRJ synchronously traverses both R-trees in breadthfirst order while processing join computation one level at a time. At each level, BFRJ creates an intermediate join index and deploys global optimization strategies (ordering, memory management, buffer management) to improve the join computation at the next level. We also present an experimental evaluation of the proposed optimizations as well as a performance comparison between BFRJ and the state-of-the-art approach. Our experimental results indicate that BFRJ with global optimizations can outperform the competitor by a significant margin (up to 50%).
