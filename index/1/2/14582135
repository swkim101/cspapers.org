Nowadays, we can find part of people into the suboptimal health status. However, most of them have not enough time for health examinations regularly. Smart clothes which are wearable and convenient devices for monitoring physiological signals solve this problem. In this study, we develop an efficient multilevel healthy cloud system to analyzing data collected from CGU smart clothes. The cloud system classifies the raw data into three types: normal data, continuous data, and multimedia data. After that, the cloud system analyzes data and predict diseases using Apache Spark. And then, the system will transfer final results to smartphones. The experimental result shows that the cloud system achieves very high-speed performance. Moreover, the system has friendly health information presentation and effective authorization process to help doctors and patients contact each other.
