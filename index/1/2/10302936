We study the problem of statistically correct inference in networks whose basic representations are population codes. Population codes are ubiquitous in the brain, and involve the simultaneous activity of many units coding for some low dimensional quantity. A classic example are place cells in the rat hippocampus: these fire when the animal is at a particular place in an environment, so the underlying quantity has two dimensions of spatial location. We show how to interpret the activity as encoding whole probability distributions over the underlying variable rather then just single values, and propose a method of inductively learning mappings between population codes that are computationally tractable and yet offer good approximations to statistically optimal inference. We simulate the method on some simple examples to prove its competence.
