Generative software development aims at modeling and implementing product lines in such a way that all or a substantial part of the desired system can be automatically generated from a specification written in one or more domain-specific languages (DSLs). The tutorial will explore several techniques of generative software development and show how they can help address software evolution and reuse challenges.
