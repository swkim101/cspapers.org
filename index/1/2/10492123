Most previous studies of morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing have been pursued independently. Morphological taggers operate on n-grams and do not take into account syntactic relations; parsers use the "pipeline" approach, assuming that morphological information has been separately obtained. 
 
However, in morphologically-rich languages, there is often considerable interaction between morphology and syntax, such that neither can be disambiguated without the other. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.
