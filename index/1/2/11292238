Workshops on the theme of “Teaching Ethics and Computing” were sponsored by the National Science Foundation's Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement program. This paper outlines the results of the workshops, available at marathon. csee.usf.edu/~kwb/naf-ufe/. Preparation for the workshops included a survey of videos that are potentially useful in teaching ethics and computing. This paper reviews some of the “best of” these videos.
