Temporal information can be leveraged and incorporated to improve web search ranking. In this work, we propose a method to improve the ranking of search results by identifying the fundamental properties of temporal behavior of low-quality hosts and spam-prone queries in search logs and modeling those properties as quantifiable features. In particular, we introduce the concepts of host churn, a measure of changes in host visibility for user queries, and query volatility, a measure of semantic instability of query results, and propose the methods for construction of temporal profiles from search query logs that can be used for estimation of a set of features based on the introduced concepts. The utility of the proposed concepts has been experimentally demonstrated for two language-independent search tasks: the regression-based ranking of search results and a novel classification problem of detecting spam-prone queries introduced in this work.
