A large alphabet of similar letters and marks, wide and inconsistent variation in fonts and handwriting, and the absence of spaces between woru%all fmstrate standard methodr and applications for Thai-language OCR We consider an alternative approach aimed at building information recognition and retrieval systems, rather than using OCR as a substitutejor character-b~haracter data entry. Instead of trying to identi~ individual ~bols, we dejine an apprdmatw â€œ n alphabet of similar shapes and clusters, targeted to the predicted lower-bound accuracy of existing OCR. We test the eflecthwness of approximation alphabets of 3, 7, 9, and 27 symboIsfor two tasks: discriminating between ambiguous input or queries (a &m handwritten orpen-basedinput), and indexing scanned documents (imthe basis of document-basedlR systems).
