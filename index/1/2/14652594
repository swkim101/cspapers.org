Over the past few years a lot of different information visualization techniques have been proposed. Being a relatively new and large field, the spectrum of emerging techniques has not clearly been identified. Another major consequence of the youthfulness of the field is that very few evaluation have been conducted so far. The aim of the panel will be to address these two points. First, panelist will characterize the spectrum of information visualization technology depending on tasks, users or data. Panelists will further discuss future trends in visualization technology by determining which are the most important features or challenges that information visualization systems should address. Second, the discussion will focus on how these systems m to be evaluated through controlled experiments, system evaluation, long-time studies, verbal protocols, theoretical evaluations, or else? INTRODUCTION Most information visualization systems that have been proposed over the past few years have been designed for very specific tasks, users or data structures. Characterizing the spectrum of information visualization technology often ends up in a long catalog of diffenmts ystem. Nevertheless, the field is now mature enough to extract from all these systems some of the main characteristics they share. The aim of the panel will be to determine the most important features of these systems and to discuss the future trends and challenges that they will have to face.
