We propose a new computer vision task we call “distractor prediction.” Distractors are the regions of an image that draw attention away from the main subjects and reduce the overall image quality. Removing distractors-for example, using in-painting - can improve the composition of an image. In this work we created two datasets of images with user annotations to identify the characteristics of distractors. We use these datasets to train an algorithm to predict distractor maps. Finally, we use our predictor to automatically enhance images.
