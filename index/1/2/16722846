This paper examines and extends the work of Linsker (1986) on self organising feature detectors. Linsker concentrates on the visual processing system, but infers that the weak assumptions made will allow the model to be used in the processing of other sensory information. This claim is examined here, with special attention paid to the auditory system, where there is much lower connectivity and therefore more statistical variability. On-line training is utilised, to obtain an idea of training times. These are then compared to the time available to pre-natal mammals for the formation of feature sensitive cells.
