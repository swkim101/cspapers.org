A performance study is made of dynamic and static memory versions of the CRAY-2. This includes comparative kernel-level performance as well as direct measurement of memory accessing delays. A “black-box” memory accessing model is proposed and the results of preliminary tests on this model are given. Open questions in relating memory characteristics and code performance are reviewed.
