This paper describes a student peer review process that has been incorporated within an introductory course in formal methods. As a course project, a team of students develops a formal specification of the requirements for a software system. The final part of the project involves the inspection of the specification by another team of student reviewers. The paper presents a rationale for including inspections as part of a formal methods course. It provides a detailed description of the inspection process and reports on the application of the process to a specific class project. Finally, the paper assesses the results of the use of such a paradigm and discusses how to improve it.
