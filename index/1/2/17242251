This paper deals with wireless ATM and in particular with channel access mechanisms. The requirements for wireless ATM MAC are discussed, and contention-based and TDMA!reservation based MAC protocols are compared. The objective is to find out the suitability of current radio access technologies for ATM interworking, in comparison to new wireless ATM radio interface proposals. Two channel access mechanisms, EY-NPMA used in HIPERLAN type /, and a modified MDR protocol, are discussed in more detail and their performance in different traffic scenarios is evaluated through simulations.
