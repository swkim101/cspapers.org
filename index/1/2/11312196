This paper describes a computer program for the layout design of transfer machines. The program groups machining operations with the objective of minimizing initial transfer machine cost. The program operates in two stages. The first stage groups operations into the minimum number of machining stations, and the second stage determines minimum cost head groupings. The various technical constraints are characterized, and Dynamic Programming is applied. A mergetechnique for efficient design of large two-sided machines is describes. Program operation is illustrated by a shop-machine layout design.
