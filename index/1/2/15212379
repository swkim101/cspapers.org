Geometric distortion associated with underwater flat port housings considerably affects the accuracy of scene depth and visual pose estimation. To compensate for this, a new solution for the forward projection is proposed based on the refractive camera model and Taylor expansion. This allows for an easy integration of the flat refractive camera model into non-linear optimization problems like bundle adjustment.
