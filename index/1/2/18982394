We describe here a simple probabilistic model for graphs that are lifts of a fixed base graph <i>G</i>, i.e., those graphs from which there is a covering man onto <i>G</i>. Our aim is to investigate the properties of typical graphs in this class. In particular, we show that almost every lift of <i>G</i> is δ(<i>G</i>)-connected where δ(<i>G</i>) is the minimal degree of <i>G</i>. We calculate the typical edge expansion of lifts of the bouquet <i>B<subscrpt>d</subscrpt></i> and
