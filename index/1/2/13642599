This paper presents a survey of the Visual Information Environment Prototype (VIEP), a system which demonstrates the next generation of Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence (C31) systems. In particular, VIEP provides a novel integration of user interaction techniques including wireless input and large-screen output to facilitate the task of collaborating with media such as large images, audio, and video. The prototype has been implemented and demonstrated over both local and wide area networks.
