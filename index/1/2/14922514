Many researchers have attempted to predict the Enron corporate hierarchy from the data. This work, however, has been hampered by a lack of data. We present a new, large, and freely available gold-standard hierarchy. Using our new gold standard, we show that a simple lower bound for social network-based systems outperforms an upper bound on the approach taken by current NLP systems.
