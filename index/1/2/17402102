OOPS (Object-Oriented Parallel System) is a framework designed to support programming of concurrent scientific applications for parallel execution. The high level abstractions provided by OOPS free the programmer from dealing with many parallel implementation details, such as the ones found in hand-coded MPI programs. However, for performance reasons, parallelism is not completely hidden. The use of the classes supplied by OOPS simplifies the implementation of parallel applications, without introducing significant overhead.
