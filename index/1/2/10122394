Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) represents a promising technique to enhance parallelism of concurrent applications relying on conventional, lock-based synchronization. The idea at the basis of current HLE approaches is to wrap critical sections into hardware transactions: this allows critical sections to be executed in parallel using a speculative approach, while leveraging on conflict detection capabilities provided by hardware transactions to ensure equivalent semantics to pessimistic lock-based synchronization. In this paper we present RW-LE, the first HLE approach targeting read-write locks. RW-LE introduces an innovative hardware-software co-design that exploits two recent micro-architectural features of POWER8 processors: suspending/resuming transaction execution and rollback-only transactions. RW-LE's original design provides two major benefits with respect to existing HLE techniques: i) eliding the read lock without resorting to the use of hardware transactions, and ii) avoiding to track read memory accesses issued in the write critical section. We evaluate RW-LE by means of an extensive experimental study based on a variety of benchmarks and real-life, complex applications. Our results demonstrate that RW-LE can provide striking performance gain of up to one order of magnitude with respect to state of the art HLE approaches.
