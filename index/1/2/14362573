In tele-robotics, time delay is a significant problem. When video feedback is delayed, operators adopt inefficient move-wait strategies, so system performance decreases. Predictive display (PD) is an effective solution to compensate for delays by graphics rendering of predicted visual feedback. Using advanced computer vision technology, we implemented a PD system based-on online real-time 3D reconstruction from monocular video. This paper describes the client-server system architecture. Experimental results indicate it can capture 3D models and render the predicted image in realistic applications covering outdoor rover operation on earth, Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) Mars analogue environment, UAV operation.
