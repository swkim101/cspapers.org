We propose CL-PRE, a certificateless proxy re-encryption scheme for secure data sharing with public cloud, which leverages maximal cloud resources to reduce the computing and communication cost for data owner. Towards running proxy in public cloud environment, we further propose multi-proxy CL-PRE and randomized CL-PRE, which enhance the security and robustness of CL-PRE. We implement all CL-PRE schemes and evaluate their security and performance.
