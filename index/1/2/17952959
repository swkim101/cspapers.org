Motion picture studios and equipment are out of reach for most people putting together presentations that include moving imagery. Fortunately, the presentation designer can draw upon a vast and constantly growing pool of film and video footage. 3-D Video Modeling augments the footage with a 3D structural model of the set where the footage was filmed. The model can be used as a description of the footage to aid in cataloging, referencing and retrieving the footage. The footage and model together can be used to create new footage, freeing the designer from decisions made by the film maker. Objects can be altered (such as by colorization) or entirely replaced, the camera's position can be changed, the lighting can be modified, and the depth of field can be narrowed, creating a focus pull in post-production.
