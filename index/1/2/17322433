We present a hierarchical scheme for efficiently maintaining all-pairs approximate shortest paths in undirected unweighted graphs under deletions of edges.An α-approximate shortest-path between two vertices is a path of length at-most α times the length of the shortest path. For maintaining α-approximate shortest paths for all pairs of vertices separated by distance ≤ <i>d</i> in a graph of n vertices, we present the first <i>o</i>(<i>nd</i>) update time algorithm based on our hierarchical scheme. In particular, the update time per edge deletion achieved by our algorithm is Õ(min{√nd,(nd)<sup>2/3</sup>}) for 3-approximate shortest-paths, and Õ(min{√nd,(nd)<sup>4/7</sup>}) for 7-approximate shortest-paths. For graphs with <i>θ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) edges, we achieve even further improvement in update time : Õ(√nd) for 3-approximate shortest-paths, and Õ(3√nd<sup>2</sup>) for 5-approximate shortest-paths.For maintaining all-pairs approximate shortest-paths, weimprove the previous Õ(<i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup>)bound on the update time per edge deletion for approximation factor ≥ 3. In particular, update time achieved by our algorithm is Õ(<i>n</i><sup>10/9</sup>) for 3-approximate shortest-paths, Õ(<i>n</i><sup>14/13</sup>) for 5-approximate shortest-paths, and Õ(<i>n</i><sup>28/27</sup>) for 7-approximate shortest-paths.All our algorithms achieve optimal query time and are simple to implement.
