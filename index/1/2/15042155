Requirements engineering is a core activity in software engineering. However, formal requirements engineering methodologies and documented requirements are often missing in scientific computing projects. We claim that there is a need for methodologies, which capture requirements for scientific computing projects, because traditional requirements engineering methodologies are difficult to apply in this domain. We propose a novel domain specific requirements model to meet this need. We conducted an exploratory experiment to evaluate the usage of this model in scientific computing projects. The results indicate that the proposed model facilitates the communication across the domain boundary, which is between the scientific computing domain and the software engineering domain. It supports requirements elicitation for the projects efficiently.
