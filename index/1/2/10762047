We propose a novel index structure, A-tree (Approximation tree), for similarity search of high-dimensional data. The basic idea of the A-tree is the introduction of Virtual Bounding Rectangles (VBRs), which contain and approximate MBRs and data objects. VBRs can be represented rather compactly, and thus affect the tree configuration both quantitatively and qualitatively. Firstly, since tree nodes can install large number of entries of VBRs, fanout of nodes becomes large, thus leads to fast search. More importantly, we have a free hand in arranging MBRs and VBRs in tree nodes. In the A-trees, nodes contain entries of an MBR and its children VBRs. Therefore, by fetching a node of an A-tree, we can obtain the information of exact position of a parent MBR and approximate position of its children. We have performed experiments using both synthetic and real data sets. For the real data sets, the A-tree outperforms the SR-tree and the VA-File in all range of dimensionality up to 64 dimension, which is the highest dimension in our experiments. The A-tree achieves 77.3% (77.7%, resp.) savings in page accesses compared to the SR-tree (the VA-File, resp.) for 64-dimensional real data.
