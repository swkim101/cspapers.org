It's challenging to predict actions at the early stage because of the large variations between early observed videos and complete ones. Besides, intra-class variations cause confusions to the predictors as well. In this paper, we propose a mem-LSTM model to predict actions in the early stage, in which a memory module is introduced to record several "hard-to-predict" samples and a variety of early observations. Our method uses Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to model partial observed video input. We augment LSTM with a memory module to remember challenging video instances. With the memory module, our mem-LSTM model not only achieves impressive performance in the early stage but also makes predictions without the prior knowledge of observation ratio. Information in future frames is also utilized using a bi-directional layer of LSTM. Experiments on UCF-101 and Sports-1M datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
