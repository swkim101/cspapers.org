This paper will discuss the design of a TCP/IP implementation and its upper level protocols on the University of Illinois supercomputer. We will also discuss some of the issues peculiar to TCP communication with a supercomputer, and some of the special problems encountered while writing and debugging under CTSS, which is not an environment particularly conducive to network development.
