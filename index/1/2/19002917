Transparent teleoperation under rate mode has proven to be difficult in terms of stability, performance and implementation. This is mainly due to the need for the exchange of derivatives and integral of measured positions and forces. This paper proposes a new control architecture designed based on the environment impedance reflection concept. The performance of this controller is compared to that of a conventional controller, under different operational conditions using both analytical methods and numerical simulations.
