We present a technique for computing a dense pixel correspondence between two images of a scene containing multiple large, rigid motions. We model each motion with either a homography (for planar objects) or a fundamental matrix. The various motions in the scene are first extracted by clustering an initial sparse set of correspondences between feature points; we then perform a multi-label graph cut optimization which assigns each pixel to an independent motion and computes its disparity with respect to that motion. We demonstrate our technique on several example scenes and compare our results with previous approaches.
