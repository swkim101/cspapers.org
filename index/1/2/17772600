Central to the performance improvement of a committee relative to individual networks is the error correlation between networks in the committee. We investigated methods of achieving error independence between the networks by training the networks with different resampling sets from the original training set. The methods were tested on the sinwave artificial task and the real-world problems of hepatoma (liver cancer) and breast cancer diagnoses.
