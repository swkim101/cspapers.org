1. I N T R O D U C T I O N Recently, adyances in hardware technology have enabled a new type of application i n t e r a c t i v e v i sua l i za t ions . One example is the 3D Urban Simulation system (USim) developed at UCLA [1], in which, users can navigate through various neighborhoods and inspect realistic architectural models of buildings in a virtual-reality-like environment in realtime. The da ta set for a urban model is often huge (more than 1TB). However, by spatial ly dividing a urban model into individually reconstructible scene objects, only a relatively small port ion of the da ta set (usually a few tens of MB) is actually needed by the application at any one t ime to generate the current display image during a user session. Therefore, it is possible to build a storage server, similar to a video-on-demand (VOD) server, which holds the ent ire model da t a set; and have the da ta tha t is predicted to be needed by the applications continuously requested and delivered to the rendering clients. As with VOD systems, in order to provide users with the desired level of perceived qualities, such as f lame rate and picture quality, the required da ta has to arrive at the clients before it comes into users' views. Due to l imited amount of system resources, such as network bandwidth, admission control is required for providing on-time da ta delivery. The overall goal of this work is to achieve a reasonably high system util ization along with providing guaranteed on-time da ta delivery for USim-like interactive visualization applications.
