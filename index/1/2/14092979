The paper deals with the control of multivariable systems with the same number of inputs as the number of outputs using a decentralized approach. The controlled system is divided into single input-single output (SISO) subsystems and adaptive controllers are used to control each subsystem. This paper is focused to the usage of self-tuning controllers (STC) which are a subset of adaptive controllers characterized by on-line identification of controlled system. The control part of individual controllers are based on polynomial approach (dead-beat in the weak and strong version, pole assignment in the 1DOF and 2DOF configurations, controllers based on minimization of quadratic criterion). A supervisory logic block is used in the control scheme to increase the stability of the on-line identification process by ensuring that just one of the controllers is in adaptive mode at a particular time. The logic supervisor is purposed as a simple and reliable technique for designing the supervisory logic. The basic idea of the logic supervisor is based on assigning priorities to individual outputs of controlled multivariable system and on-line evaluation of criterions for each subsystem. The usage of this approach has been tested in simulation experiments and in real-time applications and some results are presented in the paper
