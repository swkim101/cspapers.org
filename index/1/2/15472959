The computational heart of modern mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables is a powerful system-on-chip (SoC) with rich parallelism and heterogeneity. While the hardware parallelism of these mobile systems continues to increase year-over-year, they remain resource constrained with respect to power consumption and thermal dissipation. Efficient use of multi-core processors in mobile devices is a key requirement for improving performance, while staying within the power and thermal limits of mobile devices.
