We reveal that the Okapi BM25 retrieval function tends to overly penalize very long documents. To address this problem, we present a simple yet effective extension of BM25, namely BM25L, which "shifts" the term frequency normalization formula to boost scores of very long documents. Our experiments show that BM25L, with the same computation cost, is more effective and robust than the standard BM25.
