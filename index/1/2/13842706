Introduction: The recent trend toward developing a new generation of robots capable of operating in human-centered environments, interacting with people, and participating and helping us in our daily lives, has introduced the need for robotic systems capable of learning to use their embodiment to communicate and to react to their users in a social and engaging way. Social robots that interact with humans have thus become an important focus of robotics research. Nevertheless, HumanRobot Interaction (HRI) for assistive applications is still in its infancy. In this work, the target user population is post-stroke patients. Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability among adults, with over 750,000 people suffering a new stroke each year in the US alone. Therefore, in this work we investigated the role of robot’s active learning in the assistive therapy process. We tried to address the following research question: How should the behavior and encouragement of the therapist robot adapt as a function of the user’s personality, profile, preferences, and task performance?
