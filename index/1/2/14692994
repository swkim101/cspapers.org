Indoor localization and monitoring system of robots and people are essential issues in robotics research. Several monitoring systems are currently under development by different investigators but they do encounter significant difficulties. For instance, a Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) system provides less accurate information of human location and is restricted when there are multiple targets. Furthermore, a Radio Frequency (RF) localization system is constrained by its limited accuracy. In this study, we develop a system which combines PIR and RF localization system as wireless pyroelectric infrared sensory fusion system to monitor the location information of robots and people. We will reduce the error of RF localization information through tile proposed dynamic triangulation (DTN) method. We also develop a sensory fusion algorithm called the WPIR inference algorithm. This algorithm determines the fused position from both the PIR localization system and radio frequency signal localization system which utilize tile received signal strength (RSS) propagation model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a WPIR sensory fusion system which can be successfully applied in locating targets such as people and robot. With an accurate localization mechanism for tile indoor environment, tile provision of appropriate services to people can be realized.
