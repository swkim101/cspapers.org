In automated text categorization, given a small number of labeled documents, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to build a reliable classifier that is able to achieve high classification accuracy. To address this problem, a novel web-assisted text categorization framework is proposed in this paper. Important keywords are first automatically identified from the available labeled documents to form the queries. Search engines are then utilized to retrieve from the Web a multitude of relevant documents, which are then exploited by a semi-supervised framework. To our best knowledge, this work is the first study of this kind. Extensive experimental study shows the encouraging results of the proposed text categorization framework: using Google as the web search engine, the proposed framework is able to reduce the classification error by 30% when compared with the state-of-the-art supervised text categorization method.
