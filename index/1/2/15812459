The End-User Friendly Interface to Data Management (EUFID) is a processing system of programs which permits users to query a database in a natural English-like way. The EUFID system translates the user's question into a query expressed in the query language of the target DataBase Management System (DBMS). EUFID makes use of two very different views of the applications data: that of the users, and that of the DBMS. This paper describes the mapping of query statements from one view to the other. Mapping is discussed in general terms as well as in terms of the specific algorithms of EUFID. Examples are given.
