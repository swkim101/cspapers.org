The layout problem requires a combination of space costs and communication costs to be minimized. The special problem of planar, rectangular spaces occurs, for example, in floor plans for electronic planar packages and for buildings. Here we describe a number of algorithms, embedded in an interactive system, that solve the layout problem efficiently when it is expressed in terms of the package planning algorithm. A hierarchical approach is used to contain computational growth.
