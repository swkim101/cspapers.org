In this paper we investigated the socio-cultural behavior of users reflected in the two different social media channels, YouTube and Twitter. We conducted the comparative analysis of the networks generated from the two channels. The relationship we set for each network is the relatedness on YouTube and the co-links on Twitter. From the results, we revealed that the social media influenced the distinct socio-cultural behaviors of their users. Specifically, Twitter network better showed the actual consumption of contents in the field of the k-pop culture than YouTube. From this study, we contributed to offer a novel approach for exploring the socio-cultural behavior of users on the social media.
