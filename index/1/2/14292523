We describe the FastScatTM program for electromagnetic scattering calculations and its parallel implementation on the SGI Origin 2000. FastScat recently computed the radar cross section of a sphere having an area of 45,239\lambda2 to high accuracy in about a day. This is contrasted with a result for an 354\lambda2 sphere reported at Supercomputing '92. Taking both size and accuracy into account, the FastScat result represents an improvement in solution time of over nine orders of magnitude. This improvement was due to systematically focusing on several issues that impact the scalability of electromagnetic scattering calculations.
