This paper is devoted to the collective control and group navigation based on hydroacoustic communication intended for marine autonomous robotic complex (MARC) including autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). The structures of control and navigation systems are considered and some results of the systems operation in the real marine environment are supplemented. The contribution of this paper is in review of current hydroacoustic (HA) modems for marine robots, implementation details of MARC structure and HA communication and some field test results.
