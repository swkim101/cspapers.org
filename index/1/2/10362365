In this paper, a novel pointing device is proposed which utilizes the deformation of the fingerprint. When the fingertip is pressed and slid slightly on a rigid plate, a partial slip, called "incipient slip", occurs on the contact surface. Since the deformation around the center of the contact surface is small, the center of the fingerprint can be detected during the incipient slip. The group delay spectrum (GDS) tracking is utilized to detect the center of the fingerprint. The velocity of the pointer is controlled by the changes of the contact area on the basis of the tracked center. A prototype pointing device is developed to examine the operationality of the proposed method. The experimental results show that an operator can control the pointer with high accuracy.
