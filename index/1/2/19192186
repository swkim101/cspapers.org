Two-dimensional directed self-assembly (2D-DSA), a promising nanotechnology, manipulates the orientation of double posts to guide block copolymers to fabricate 2D patterns in nanoscale. In this paper, we present the first detailed placement algorithm for 2D-DSA. We first propose an orientation-number model for nets to estimate post orientations. Then, a cost model based on the orientation numbers is defined to estimate the 2D-DSA routability efficiently during placement, and a novel detailed placement framework is proposed to consider the orientations to optimize wirelength. In this framework, we develop a dynamic-programming-based algorithm for single-row detailed placement with a specialized pruning technique based on the defined orientation cost. Experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively generate a 2D-DSA friendly placement solution.
