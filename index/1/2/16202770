This abstract describes ongoing work in developing large-scale knowledge repositories. The project addresses three primary aspects of such systems: integration of knowledge sources; access and retrieval of stored knowledge; scalable, effective repositories. Previous results have shown the effectiveness of description logic-based representations in integrating knowledge sources and the role of non-standard inferences in supporting repository reasoning tasks. Current efforts include developing general-purpose mechanisms for adapting reasoning algorithms for optimized inference under known domain structure and effective use of database technology as a large-scale knowledge base backend.
