Graphical presentations can be very effective in communicating large datasets and the patterns, trends and relationships in them. Charts and graphs used in reporting data usually tend to highlight relevant points and suppress unnecessary ones. This can be problematic, since such charts can be used to selectively emphasize desired aspects: in fact, a recent study of several hundred annual reports found that more than 30% of charts regarding a companyâ€™s financial performance used design parameters that facilitated favorable inferences by users and hindered others that were not. Furthermore, since studies show that average users are not graphically sophisticated, many of the techniques used to achieve these biased effects may not be obvious to them. One solution to this problem is to make these design choices explicit to the user. This paper presents a data analysis interface that allows users to explore the visualization space by modifying these design decisions. This interface is based on an analysis of a large corpus of charts and graphs and uses knowledge about techniques for emphasizing different aspects in 2-D charts and graphs. We have used this interface to generate charts from the same dataset that are interpreted quite differently by the average user.
