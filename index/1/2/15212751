One of the challenging issues in the energy-constrained ad~hoc wireless networks is to find ways that increase their lifetime. Squeezing maximum energy from the battery of the nodes of these networks requires the communication protocols to be designed such that they are aware of the state of the batteries. Traditional MAC protocols for ad~hoc networks are designed without considering the battery state. Major contributions of this paper are: (a) a novel distributed Battery Aware Medium Access Control (BAMAC(k)) protocol that takes benefit of the chemical properties of the batteries, to provide fair scheduling and increased network and node lifetime through uniform discharge of batteries, (b) a discrete time Markov chain analysis for batteries of the nodes of ad~hoc wireless networks, and (c) a thorough comparative study of our protocol with IEEE 802.11 and DWOP (Distributed Wireless Ordering Protocol) MAC protocols. The key idea proposed in this paper is to piggy-back nodes' battery-state information with the packets sent by the nodes by means of which the nodes are scheduled to ensure a uniform battery discharge. We model the operation of the battery using a discrete time Markovian chain. Using the theoretical analysis, we calculate lifetime of the battery in terms of maximum number of packets that a node can transmit before its battery drains fully. Extensive simulations have shown that our protocol extends the battery lifetime consuming 96% and 60% less percentage nominal capacity spent per packet transmission compared to the IEEE 802.11 and the DWOP MAC protocols, respectively. In general, performance results show that BAMAC(k) outperforms IEEE 802.11 and DWOP MAC protocols, in terms of power consumption, fairness, and lifetime of the nodes. We have also analyzed the factors that influence the uniform discharge of batteries and their lifetime.
