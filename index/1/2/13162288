Mobile devices, especially smart phones, have been popular in recent years. With users spending much time on mobile devices, service providers deliver advertising messages to mobile device users and look forward to increasing their revenue. However, delivery of proper advertising messages is challenging since strategies of advertising in TV, SMS, or website may not be applied to the banner-based advertising on mobile devices. In this work, we study how to properly recommend advertising messages for mobile device users. We propose a novel approach which simultaneously considers several important factors: user profile, apps used, and clicking history. We apply experiments on real-world mobile log data, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
