Most algorithms dedicated to the generation of referential descriptions widely suffer from a fundamental problem: they make too strong assumptions about adjacent processing components, resulting in a limited coordination with their perceptive and linguistics data, that is, the provider for object descriptors and the lexical expression by which the chosen descriptors is ultimately realized. Motivated by this deficit, we present a new algorithm that (1) allows for a widely unconstrained, incremental, and goal-driven selection of descriptors, (2) integrates linguistic constraints to ensure the expressibility of the chosen descriptors, and (3) provides means to control the appearance of the created referring expression. Hence, the main achievement of our approach lies in providing a core algorithm that makes few assumptions about other processing components and improves the flow of control between modules.
