In this paper we present a multi-agent coordination algorithm suitable for systems with aircraft-like kinematic constraints. A model of a system of input-constrained non-holonomic agents is constructed, suitable for use with formal verification tools. The agents considered are uniform and have bounded velocities and limited turning capabilities. We demonstrate how a model checker can be used to generate a counterexample trace for such a system, usable as a trajectory that satisfies our safety and liveness requirements.
