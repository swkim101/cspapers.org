This paper focuses on the problem of improving distributed query throughput of the RDBMS-based data integration system that has to inherit the query execution model of the underlying RDBMS: execute each query independently and utilize a global buffer pool mechanism to provide disk page sharing across concurrent query execution processes. However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently: issue data requests and fetch data over the network. 
 
This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support. Our experimental results show that Request Window makes IGNITE achieve a 1.7x speedup over a commercial data integration system when running a workload of distributed TPC-H queries.
