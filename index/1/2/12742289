A behavioral theory of information processing based on ethological observations has been tested experimentally by programming a robot control system. The resultant software has successfully simulated robot operation. Three basic types of software modules are assumed as elements. These accept input stimuli and generate detailedstrings of motor response "units" to attain design goals. A complex process of interaction between the modules permits the consideration of many alternative actions while focusing attention on a selected set of input signals. ' The organization is shown to have especially flexible characteristics adapted to robot control and permits a recursive definition of some of the modules. Brief comparisons with other robot systems in being indicate some of the relationships between the different design approaches so far proposed.
