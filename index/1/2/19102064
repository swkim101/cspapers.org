We describe self-assembling robot arm systems composed of active modular robots and passive bars. We present a case study where the robotic module is the Shady3D robot and the passive component is a rigid bar with embedded IR LEDs. We propose algorithms that demonstrate the cooperative aggregation of modular robotic manipulators with greater capability and workspace out of these two types of elements. We present results from physical experiments in which two 3DOF Shady3D robots and one rigid bar coordinate to self-assemble into a 6DOF manipulator. We then demonstrate cooperative algorithms for forward and inverse kinematics, grasping, and mobility with this arm.
