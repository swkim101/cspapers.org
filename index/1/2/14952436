In this paper we study a well known broadcasting heuristic for heterogenous networks of workstations, called fastest node first. We show that this heuristic produces an optimal solution for minimizing the sum of all completion times, and in addition produces a 1.5 approximation for the problem of minimizing the maximum completion time. We extend these results to show that the same bounds can be obtained for the multicast operation on such heterogenous networks. In addition we show that the problem of minimizing the maximum completion time is N P-hard, which settles the complexity of this open problem.
