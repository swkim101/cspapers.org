There have been many queueing models of computer systems published in the literature, but relatively few studies have appeared in which the models have been validated on actual systems. A procedure is described which permits an analyst to obtain values for the parameters of queueing models using measured statistics of operational computer systems. The particular model which was validated is the first queueing network model which will permit more than one class of customer. Partitioning a computer system environment into classes of timesharing and batch jobs appears to be useful, and the model was validated with these classes on an IBM 370/155-2 and an IBM 370/168.
