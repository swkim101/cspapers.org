Queries have specific properties, and may need individualized methods and parameters to optimize retrieval. Length is one property. We look at how two-word queries may attain higher precision by re-ranking using word co-occurrence evidence in retrieved documents. Co-occurrence within document context is not sufficient, but window context including sentence context evidence can provide precision improvements at low recall region of 4 to 10% using initial retrieval results, and positively affects pseudo-relevance feedback.
