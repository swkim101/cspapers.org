The notion of a minimum spanning ellipsoid in any dimension is explained. Basic definitions and theorems provide the ideas for an algorithm to find the minimum spanning ellipsoid of a set of points, i.e., the ellipsoid of minimum volume containing the set. The run-time of the algorithm O (n2) independent of dimension, where n is the number of points.
