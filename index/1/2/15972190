Co-design efforts attempt to account for many diverse viewpoints. However, design teams lack support for meaningful real-time interaction with a large community of potential stakeholders. We present Crowdboard, a novel whiteboard system that enables many potential stakeholders to provide real-time input during early-stage design activities, such as concept mapping. Local design teams develop ideas on a standard whiteboard, which is augmented with annotations and comments from online participants. The system makes it possible for design teams to solicit real-time opinions and ideas from a community of people intrinsically motivated to shape the product/service.
