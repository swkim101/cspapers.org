The MIDAS Program (Material Inventory & Data Acquisition System) came on-line at the MMA Orlando Division in July 1976, affording the Orlando Division a real time system that effectively controls the logistics of material and attendant paper work from engineering release through to work-in-process disbursal. This basically paperless system (forms and reports reduced 95%) as developed, moves the Materiel Division operations, including status, from a batch control mode to an instantaneous real-time response and activity for all facets of the division's responsibilities that embrace the status of material.
