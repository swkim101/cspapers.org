We present LINQits, a flexible hardware template that can be mapped onto programmable logic or ASICs in a heterogeneous system-on-chip for a mobile device or server. Unlike fixed-function accelerators, LINQits accelerates a domain-specific query language called LINQ. LINQits does not provide coverage for all possible applications---however, existing applications (re-)written with LINQ in mind benefit extensively from hardware acceleration. Furthermore, the LINQits framework offers a graceful and transparent migration path from software to hardware. LINQits is prototyped on a 2W heterogeneous SoC called the ZYNQ processor, which combines dual ARM A9 processors with an FPGA on a single die in 28nm silicon technology. Our physical measurements show that LINQits improves energy efficiency by 8.9 to 30.6 times and performance by 10.7 to 38.1 times compared to optimized, multithreaded C programs running on conventional ARM A9 processors.
