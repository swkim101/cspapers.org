In this paper, we address the problem of the image-based 3D pose computation of a semi-circle suturing needle using monocular image feedback for laparoscopy. We propose a constrained two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) geometry-based modelling method to parametrise the needle's 6-DOF pose, including depth information. The modelling solely relies on the simultaneous observation of the needle's apparent tip and junction. No external markers are needed for extra constraints. An adaptive controller combining gradient descent and vector-flow method is introduced to iteratively guide the needle's initial guessing pose to its real pose by minimizing image-based position errors. Experiments have been conducted using both numerical simulations and simulated laparoscopic scenarios to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
