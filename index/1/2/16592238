This paper extends Yeap's [1988] computational theory of cognitive maps, focusing on the problem of computing a raw cognitive map by an autonomous agent. In addition to having a 150Â° view of the environment as input, the agent also maintains a representation of her immediate surroundings. This representation is referred to as an MFIS, a Memory For one's Immediate Surroundings. Arguments for the use of the MFIS are presented. The main questions that we ask in implementing our ideas are: (i) what frame of reference is appropriate for the MFIS? and (ii) how does the MFIS change as the agent moves through the environment? A program has been implemented successfully and the main algorithms used and the results of running the program are presented.
