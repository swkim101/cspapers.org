Quadruped walking robot can walk in discrete environment. In quadruped walking robot, traditional control method of the swing leg is either a simple feedback based on potentiometer or only feedforward. But in such environment, we think that using the accurate positioning control of swing leg to safe landing point by 'visual servoing' is required. However, the conventional visual servoing methods have some problems. For example, they require complex nonlinear calculation with the exact camera angles and joint angles. To solve these problems, 'linear visual servoing' (indicated as LVS) was proposed. In this paper, we propose a positioning control method of the leg of the quadruped robot by LVS. Furthermore, we propose a method to introduce positioning control of the leg by LVS into gait. We show that the robot can do minor adjustment even if there is an error between planned landing point and safe landing point.
