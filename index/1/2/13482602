Flexible and reliable connection is critical for self-reconfiguration, self-assembly, or self-healing. However, most existing connection mechanisms suffer from a deficiency that a connection would seize itself if one end malfunctions or is out of service. To mitigate this limitation on self-healing, this paper presents a new SINGO connector that can establish or disengage a connection even if one end of the connection is not operational. We describe the design and the prototype of the connector and demonstrate its performance by both theoretical analysis and physical experimentations.
