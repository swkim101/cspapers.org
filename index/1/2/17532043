In this paper the information processing theory of problem solving is extended to include ill-defined problems. A protocol of problem solving in architectural design and its analysis is presented. The significant difference between well-and ill-defined problem solving is shown to be a specification process similar to information retrieval processes now studied in artificial intelligence. A variety of issues in this retrieval process are examined. The search process involved in the space planning aspect of design is shown to correspond well with existing formulations of search. The interactive effects of retrieval and search processes are examined.
