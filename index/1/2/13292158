As an empirical discipline, information access and retrieval research requires substantial software infrastructure to index and search large collections. This workshop is motivated by the desire to better align information retrieval research with the practice of building search applications from the perspective of open-source information retrieval systems. Our goal is to promote the use of Lucene for information access and retrieval research.
