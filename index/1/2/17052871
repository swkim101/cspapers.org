It has recently been demonstrated that the effect of visual measurement errors on the open-loop control in visual servoing can be estimated using linear propagation of errors. The uncertainty estimation offers a tool to build and analyze hybrid control systems such as switching or partitioning control. In earlier works, position-based and 2.5D servoing have been analysed. This work extends the approach to the analysis of closed loop uncertainty, showing how the path uncertainty can be approximated. The uncertainty is analyzed in Cartesian reference to make the approach general over different hardware. In addition, we show how image-based visual servoing can be analysed using the same approach.
