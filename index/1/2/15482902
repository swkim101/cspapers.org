It has been hoped that computational approaches can help resolve some well-known paradoxes in game theory. We prove that tf the repeated prisoner’s dilemma M played by finite automata with less than exponentially (in the number of rounds) many states, then cooperation can be achieved an equilibrium (while with ezponentiaily many states, defection is the only equtlibrzum). We furthermore prove a generalization to arbitrary games and Pareto optimai points. Finally, we present a general model of poiynomially computable games, and characterize in terms of fami!iar complexity classes ranging from NP to NEXP the natural problems that arise in relation with such games. 1. GAMES AND BOUNDED RATIONALITY The theory of games [AH], founded by von Neumann and Morgenstern, is supposed to model the behavior of rational economic agents. Very often, however, game theory predicts behavior that can be criticized as unnatural and nonrational —we describe a famous instance below. It has been hoped that the situation can be remedied if the model is modified to take into account appropriate notions of complexity. This work is a contribution in this line of research. To describe and motivate the results, we shall first need some definitions and
