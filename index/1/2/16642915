In this paper, we proposed a new paddling type of microrobot that can move in human organs such as intestines, even blood vessels as an assumption has a great potential application for microsurgery. Based on the previous researches, the structure of the paddling microrobot has been designed. By applying the alternate magnetic field, the paddling of the developed microrobot can be manipulated with the frequency of input current. And also, the motion mechanism, and characteristic evaluation of the microrobot have been discussed. And then, in order to generate the propulsive force, we improved the structure of the paddling microrobot, the fin was fixed at the end of the body. The characteristic of the fin also has been evaluated in this research. The microrobot has a rapid response, and it can clear out dirt which is adhering to the inner wall of pipes. This microrobot will play an important role in both industrial and medical applications such as microsurgery.
