The desktop search tools provide powerful query capabilities and result presentation techniques. However, they do not take the user context into account. We propose to exploit collected information about user activities with desktop files and applications for activity-based desktop search. When I prepare for a project review and type in a search box the name of a colleague, I expect to find her last deliverable draft, but not her email with a paper review or our joint conference presentation. Ideally, the desktop search system should be able to infer my current task from the logs of my previous activities and present task-specific search results.
