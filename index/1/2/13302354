We present test results from spike-timing correlation learning experiments carried out with silicon neurons with STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) synapses. The weight change scheme of the STDP synapses can be set to either weight-independent or weight-dependent mode. We present results that characterise the learning window implemented for both modes of operation. When presented with spike trains with different types of synchronisation the neurons develop bimodal weight distributions. We also show that a 2-layered network of silicon spiking neurons with STDP synapses can perform hierarchical synchrony detection.
