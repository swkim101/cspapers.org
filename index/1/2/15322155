It is well-known that planning is hard but it is less well-known how to approach the hard parts of a problem instance effectively. Using static domain analysis techniques we can identify and abstract certain combinatorial sub-problems from a planning instance, and deploy specialised technology to solve these sub-problems in a way that is integrated with the broader planning activities. We have developed a hybrid planning system (STAN4) which brings together alternative planning strategies and specialised algorithms and selects them according to the structure of the planning domain. STAN4 participated successfully in the AIPS-2000 planning competition. We describe how sub-problem abstraction is done, with particular reference to route-planning abstraction, and present some of the competition data to demonstrate the potential power of the hybrid approach.
