To support privacy-aware management of data in social spaces, the user personal data needs to be stored at each user device, and shared only with a trusted subset of other users. To date, social spaces only have fairly limited access control capabilities, that do not protect the possibly sensitive data of the users. In this demonstration, we showcase our SPAC system, a distributed, peer-to-peer, secure and privacy-aware social space system. SPAC is equipped with: (i) an SQL-based declarative distributed query language to specify which data to share and whom to share with. Such a language guarantees the fine-grained access to the data, (ii) a fully-decentralized authorization that relies on classic cryptographic protocols to provide robust and resilient key-based encryption for access control enforcement, and (iii) an update-friendly access control mechanism, that also addresses the updates on both the network and the access control policies.
