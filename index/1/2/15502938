1. I n t r o d u c t i o n Relevance feedback in document r e t r i e v a l u s u a l l y i n v o l v e s an Inquirer revising a query to obtain better retrieval effectiveness [Rocehlo] and [Salton]. The revised query is adjusted to correspond to the descriptions o f known documents which the inquirer has found relevant. Several problems exist wlth such methods, however, and will be described in this paper. Lass frequently, the descriptions of documents, themselves, have been a l t e r e d on the basis o f i n q u i r e r feedback. The advantages tha t a r i se from a l low ing a document d e s c r i p t i o n to change over tlme wlll be discussed. The heart of thls paper will then be devoted to discussing how an algorlthm used in artificial Inte111gence can be used to help redescrlbe documents. A simulation of a document retrleval system subject to such redescription was conducted, and the results o f the simulation are descrlbed. 2. query M o d i f i c a t i o n Oonument retrieval is known to be a trial and error process CSwanson]. As a result, it IS understandable that attempts have been made to build feedback Into the process to improve retrieval e f f e c t i v e n e s s .
