This research investigates the preference for a graphical method (structured flowcharts) or for a verbal method (pseudocode) when learning short, relatively complex algorithms. The research summarizes the data from 6 replications using 193 students of data structures and 16 data structures classes. A preference for flowcharts was hypothesized under eight conditions. All eight conditions produced large differences which were statistically significant, p < .0001. The preferences for flowcharts ranged from 75.1% to 89.1%. No significant preferences were found for pseudocode. The results indicate that graphical methods should be strongly considered when teaching relatively complex algorithms. Most importantly, the results signify that there may be two types of learners: (1) a type which prefers flowcharts (a graphical method) and (2) a type which prefers pseudocode (a verbal method). Since most textbooks only express algorithms verbally, one must question the wisdom for using only one method.
