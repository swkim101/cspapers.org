This paper presents the ongoing work towards enabling humanoid robots to achieve dynamic behaviors comparable to humans. By using the concept of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) first in introduced in [1], the present paper permits operator and robot balance synchronization using the mutual dynamics of the Center of Mass (CoM) and Center of Pressure (CoP). The Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) with a reaction mass [2] is utilized to capture the humanoid behavior which interacts with the human operator under the Equilibrium Point (EP) [3] control assumption. Remarkable similarities between the physical system behavior and simulated results suggest the feasibility of the strategy. Experiments conducted with the MIT HERMES humanoid robot further show the performance of the proposed method.
