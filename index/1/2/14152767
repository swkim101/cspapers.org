Screw path drilling is an important process among many orthopedic surgeries. To guarantee the safety and correctness of this process, a model-based drilling state recognition method is proposed in this paper. The thrust force in the drilling process is modeled based on an accurate 3D bone model restructured by means of Micro-CT images. In theoretical modeling of the thrust force, the resistance and the elasticity of the bone tissues are considered. The cutting energy and elastic modulus are defined as the material parameters in the theoretical model, which are identified via a least square method. Some key parameters are proposed to support the state recognition: the peak forces in the first and the second cortical layers, the average force in the cancellous layer and the thickness of each layer. Based on these key parameters in the model, a state recognition strategy with a robotic orthopedic surgery system is proposed to recognize the switch position of each layer. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling approach and the state recognition method.
