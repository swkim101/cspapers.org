The First International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and PrivaCy (CPS-SPC) is being held in conjunction with the 22nd ACM CCS Conference. The workshop was motivated by several observations. First, cyber-physical systems represent the new frontier for cyber risk. The attack surface imposed by the convergence of computing, communications and physical control represents unique challenges for security researchers and practitioners. Second, majority of the published literature addressing the security and privacy of CPS reflect a field still in its infancy. As such, the overall principles, models, and theories for securing CPS have not yet emerged. Third, the organizers of this workshop strongly felt that a premiere forum associated with a premiere conference was needed for rapidly publishing diverse, multidisciplinary in-progress work on the security and privacy of CPS and galvanizing the research community. The set of accepted papers reflect this vision. Papers span cyber and control-theoretic foundations, intrusion detection, forensics management, vulnerability analysis and elimination, and field studies. We have organized an exciting program for this workshop and look forward to active participation in this and future workshops.
