This paper summarizes the design optimization of a parallel mechanism using on human hip joint power assisting. Manipulability Inclusive Principle (MIP) evaluation criterion for evaluating assisting mechanism's assisting feasibility and assisting effect is proposed. The design of parallel assisting mechanism and building kinematical Jacobian are discussed. Moreover, as an important part of this paper, in order to finding out a architecture, which can satisfy assisting feasibility and realize higher assisting efficiency, more assisting ability and better feature on assisting isotropy, design optimization MIP is shown in this paper.
