Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) is a cryptographic tool that enables a set of parties to jointly compute any function of their inputs while keeping the privacy of inputs. The paper "High Throughput Semi-Honest Secure Three-Party Computation with an Honest Majority" in this ACM CCS 2016 [4] presents a new protocol which its implementation carried out over 1,300,000 AESs per second and was able to support 35,000 login queries of Kerberos authentication per second. This poster/demo presents the design of the implementation and demonstrates the Kerberos authentication over here. The design will show how this high-throughput three-party computation can be done using simple servers. The demonstration proves that secure multiparty computation of Kerberos authentications in large organizations is now practical.
