The paper presents a novel method for mobile robot localization using visual appearance features. A multidimensional histogram is used to describe the global appearance features of an image such as colors, edge density, gradient magnitude, textures and so on. The matching of histograms determines the location of the robot. The method has been evaluated in an indoor environment, and the system correctly determines the location of 82.9% of the input scene images.
