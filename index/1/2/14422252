Developing motivational technology to support long-term behavior change is a challenge. A solution is to incorporate insights from behavior change theory and design technology to tailor to individual users. We carried out two studies to investigate whether the processes of change, from the Transtheoretical Model, can be effectively represented by motivational text messages. We crowdsourced peer-designed text messages and coded them into categories based on the processes of change. We evaluated whether people perceived messages tailored to their stage of change as motivating. We found that crowdsourcing is an effective method to design motivational messages. Our results indicate that different messages are perceived as motivating depending on the stage of behavior change a person is in. However, while motivational messages related to later stages of change were perceived as motivational for those stages, the motivational messages related to earlier stages of change were not. This indicates that a person's stage of change may not be the (only) key factor that determines behavior change. More individual factors need to be considered to design effective motivational technology.
