The dec is ion-making component of a robo t t h a t operates in a poo r l y known environment is cons idered. The usual p rob lem-so lv ing approach to hand l ing a task is not s u i t a b l e when each dec i s i on may t u r n ou t in severa l ways, and many dec is ions are needed to complete the t a s k . An a l t e r n a t i v e approach, which is based on maximizing the es t imated u t i l i t y r e s u l t i n g from each d e c i s i o n , is i l l u s t r a t e d . The example descr ibes the p l a n s , u t i l i t y f unc t i ons and dec i s i on procedures of a s imula ted i n s e c t l i k e robo t c a l l e d PERCY. I n s p i t e o f i t s l i m i t e d a b i l i t y t o perce ive and s to re i n fo rmat i o n about the envi ronment , PERCY can achieve s a t i s f a c t o r y performance on i t s t a s k . 1 . I n t r o d u c t i o n Robot experiments are c u r r e n t l y c a r r i e d on i n l i m i t e d task environments. I n such c i r cumstances, i t i s f e a s i b l e t o p rov ide the system w i t h comprehensive, i f not p e r f e c t l y accu ra te , i n f o rma t i on cover ing those fea tu res o f the environment t h a t r e l a t e t o i t s t a s k s . But t o depend on p lann ing methods t h a t r e q u i r e such comprehensive i n f o r m a t i o n w i l l h inder the extens ion of the work t h a t is now being done. Systems w i l l have to be able to operate in environments where much of the knowledge t h a t would help in c a r r y i n g out t h e i r tasks cannot be prov ided beforehand, and where the approach o f s t o r i n g d e t a i l e d i n f o r m a t i o n a s i t i s r e ce ived is u n s a t i s f a c t o r y , because the re is more i n f o r m a t i o n than can be s t o r e d , or because i t changes too o f t e n . Comprehensive models of the environment are needed when p lann ing is based on a problemso l v i ng approach. Th is approach makes an exp l o r a t o r y ana l ys i s o f i t s model , and lays out an in tended course o f a c t i o n be fore the f i r s t a c t i o n i s t aken . But i f i t i s l i k e l y t h a t the course o f a c t i o n w i l l not reach i t s in tended outcome, because the system's knowledge of i t s environment i s incomplete o r i n a c c u r a t e , p l a n n ing as though the outcome were c e r t a i n can be a waBte of e f f o r t . The p o s s i b i l i t y o f us ing mul t ip le -ou tcome opera tors in p lann ing has been discussed by Munson and by F i k e s , Har t and N i l s s o n 1 . However, these d iscuss ions make i t appear t h a t m u l t i p l e outcomes do not mesh w e l l w i t h a p rob lem-so lv ing approach. Every p lan w i t h a des i red goa l s t a t e as one o f i t s poss ib le outcomes may have to ass ign low p r o b a b i l i t y to t h a t outcome, because the cond i t i ons to be met in g e t t i n g t he re are not known, and no t because i t i s r e a l l y improbable t h a t the goa l w i l l be reached. I t i s no t obvious how to formula te the d e c i s i o n process when t h a t case i s l i k e l y to come up. A d i f f e r e n t approach to the use o f m u l t i p l e outcome opera to rs has been descr ibed in a se r ies o f a r t i c l e s 2 , 3 , 4 Th is type o f p lann ing focuses on i n te rmed ia te o b j e c t i v e s , and uses p r o b a b i l i t y es t imates t o take account o f i t s i n a b i l i t y to p r e d i c t how a course o f a c t i o n w i l l t u r n o u t . The approach has been t e s t e d in experiments w i t h a s imu la ted robo t t h a t has on l y crude knowledge o f i t s environment. The design of the robo t i nvo l ves a h ie ra rchy o f c o n t r o l , w i t h s e l e c t i o n o f p lans handled a t the h ighes t l e v e l , and the d i r e c t c o n t r o l o f pe rcep t i on and a c t i o n de legated to the lowest l e v e l . Var ious types o f p lann ing can f u n c t i o n w i t h t h i s h i e r a r c h i c a l o r g a n i z a t i o n . I n the exper iments , the s e l e c t i o n of p lans has been based on a p o l i c y of maximiz ing u t i l i t y . Thus, the r o b o t ' s dec is ion-mak ing component has some fea tu res o f the " c o s t e f f e c t i v e execu t i ve " descr ibed by Munson. But the re are d i f f e r e n c e s . For one t h i n g , u t i l i t y i s assoc ia ted not w i t h a s p e c i f i c g o a l , bu t w i t h events t h a t occur i n the course o f the t a s k , and c o n t r i b u t e to o r d e t r a c t f rom the o v e r a l l measure of the success i n per fo rming the t a s k .

PERCY can comp l e t e the nest in a very l a rge number of ways; i t s problem i s to f i n d a way t h a t keeps i t adequately f e d , and s t i l l does not excess ive ly delay the comp le t i on , i n the l a t e s t exper iment , PERCY must a lso min imize encounters w i t h an enemy â€” the s t i n g e r ; the r i s k o f p a i n f u l s t i ngs can be t o t a l l y e l i m i n a t e d on ly a t the cos t o f an unacceptable s lowing of progress on the nes t . PERCY has very poor knowledge of i t s e n v i r o n ment.

These landmarks he lp i t t o l oca te the nest s i t e , severa l p laces where m a t e r i a l can be found, and the entrances to the area where i t s food can be hunted.

The s i t u a t i o n is more l i k e the p l a y i n g of a game, i n which the course o f a c t i o n i s l i m i t e d by and responsive to the moves of the opponent. And in f a c t , dec is ions are t r e a t e d as the system's moves in a game p layed aga ins t the environment. In t h i s game, the environment r e p l i e s to a d e c i s i o n by choosing one of i t s poss ib l e outcomes, and t h a t outcome i d e n t i f i e s the stage o f the task a t which the nex t d e c i s ion must be made. A game t r e e summarizes the se t o f complete sequences o f a l t e r n a t i n g d e c i s ions and outcomes; each sequence descr ibes a poss ib l e ins tance o f per fo rming the system's t a s k . Each such complete sequence has a s s o c i a ted w i t h i t a u t i l i t y v a l u e , which measures the q u a l i t y o f performance when the task e f f o r t has f o l l owed the course descr ibed by the sequence. A component of the system produces the system's s t r a t e g y in the game, and the success o f t he s t r a t e g y is measured by the average u t i l i t y over a s e r i e s o f performances
