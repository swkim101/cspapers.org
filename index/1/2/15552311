We consider a single-pursuer-multiple-evader pursuit-evasion game in which a team of evaders aims to delay the capture by a faster pursuer. We extend our previous open-loop formulation (and its solution) of the game to incorporate more realistic settings: a pursuer with uncertain position and evaders with limited turning rates. The formulation provides a guaranteed lower bound on the team survival time. The survival time performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared to that of the existing approaches. It is shown to be highly effective even when the evaders can not detect the pursuer. A noticeable trend of potentially practical importance is that larger teams benefit more from an increase in turning rates than smaller teams.
