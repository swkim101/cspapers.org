We have developed a correct, general, and efficient procedure of synthesizing two-party error-recoverable protocols for noisy channels where messages could be lost, corrupted, and/or missequenced. The state explosion problem has been tackled by synthesizing the error-recoverable protocol (ERP) from its noiseless local entity model using certain rules. This reduction arises from the approaches of local modeling and elaboration. We expect that these two approaches will also play a major role in tackling the complexity problems in designing multi-party protocols. Measures of efficiency and functionality improvements have been discussed.
