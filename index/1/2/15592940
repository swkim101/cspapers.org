Understanding the temporal orientation of web search queries is an important issue for the success of information access systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective ensemble learning solution that (1) allows to accurately classify queries along their temporal intent and (2) identifies a set of performing solutions thus offering a wide range of possible applications. Experiments show that correct representation of the problem can lead to great classification improvements when compared to recent state-of-the-art solutions and baseline ensemble techniques.
