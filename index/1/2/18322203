The adjective “object-oriented” achieved the status of a buzzword several years ago, with usage almost as ubiquitous as that enjoyed by “structured” in the 1970s, In fact, it is commonly stated that object-oriented programming will revolutionize software development in the nineties the way structured programming did in the seventies. Although it is not the purpose of this article to debate this statement, there certainly is much interest within the academic community concerning these matters.
