One important assumption of information extraction is that extractions occurring more frequently are more likely to be correct. Sparse information extraction is challenging because no matter how big a corpus is, there are extractions supported by only a small amount of evidence in the corpus. A pioneering work known as REALM learns HMMs to model the context of a semantic relationship for assessing the extractions. This is quite costly and the semantics revealed for the context are not explicit. In this work, we introduce a lightweight, explicit semantic approach for sparse information extraction. We use a large semantic network consisting of millions of concepts, entities, and attributes to explicitly model the context of semantic relationships. Experiments show that our approach improves the F-score of extraction by at least 11.2% over state-of-the-art, HMM based approaches while maintaining more efficiency.
