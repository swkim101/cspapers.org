We are interested in developing programs that reason about digital electronic circuits, in order to design, redesign, and debug them. The first step toward developing such programs is to determine a useful way of representing the design and operation of circuits. A useful representation must make apparent the roles of various circuit components in implementing the overall circuit function, and must allow a program to reason about the operation of the circuit at various levels of abstraction. This paper summarizes our efforts to develop such a representation This work is closely related to other Al work on representing plans and on representing and reasoning about complex physical processes.
