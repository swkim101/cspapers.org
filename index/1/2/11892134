This paper presents the design and evaluation of a text categorization method based on the Hierarchical Mixture of Experts model. This model uses a divide and conquer principle to define smaller categorization problems based on a predefined hierarchical structure. The final classifier is a hierarchical array of neural networks. The method is evaluated using the UMLS Metathesaurus as the underlying hierarchical structure, and the OHSUMED test set of MEDLINE records. Comparisons with traditional Rocchioâ€™s algorithm adapted for text categorization, as well as flat neural network classifiers are provided. The results show that the use of the hierarchical structure improves text categorization performance significantly.
