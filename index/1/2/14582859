In order to obtain high-precision and high-speed motion and reduce the residual vibration for vacuum robot, an asymmetric trajectory planning method with jerk bounded is presented. In this paper we discuss all possible profile shapes for the asymmetric trajectory planning. And then the algorithm and its implementation are proposed with a direct and complete method. At the end, we apply the proposed approach to high-precision vacuum cluster tool robot which is used in the vacuum chambers for handling semiconductor wafer. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach.
