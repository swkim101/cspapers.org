However, to efficiently scale to large domains one should also exploit hierarchical structure if present. In such hierarchical domains, finding rewarded states typically requires to search deeply; covering enough such informative states very far from the root becomes computationally expensive in flat non-hierarchical search approaches. We propose novel, scalable MCTS methods which integrate atask hierarchy into the MCTS framework, specifically lead-ing to hierarchical versions of both, UCT and POMCP. The new method does not need to estimate probabilistic models of each subtask, it instead computes subtask policies purely sample-based. We evaluate the hierarchical MCTS methods on various settings such as a hierarchical MDP, a Bayesian model-based hierarchical RL problem, and a large hierarchical POMDP.
