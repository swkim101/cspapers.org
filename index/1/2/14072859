As the time goes on, it is a question of common sense to involve in the process of decision making people scattered around the globe. Groups are created in a formal or informal way, exchange ideas or engage in a process of argumentation and counter-argumentation, negotiate, cooperate, collaborate or even discuss techniques and/or methodologies for problem solving. In this work it is proposed an agent-based architecture to support a ubiquitous group decision support system, i.e. based on the concept of agent, which is able to exhibit intelligent , and emotional-aware behaviour, and support argumentation, through interaction with individual persons or groups. It is enforced the paradigm of Mixed Initiative Systems, so the initiative is to be pushed by human users and/or intelligent agents.
