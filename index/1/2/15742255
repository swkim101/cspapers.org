Based on a recently developed "generalized averaging theory", we present a generic approach for the design of stabilizing feedback controller for biomimetic locomotive systems. The control laws exponentially stabilize in the average, and they apply to a very wide class of systems. Two examples are given: a "kinematic biped" that demonstrates how our theory handles discontinuities, and the snakeboard, which is an underactuated mechanical system with drift.
