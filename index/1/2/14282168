Cross-DR WAN (Datacenter Region Wide Area Network) with various services are deployed to provide timely data information and analytics for users in a wide range of geographical locations. For its reliability and performance, data duplication synchronization is essential among different IDCs (Internet datacenters). However, this problem poses a challenge. First, data duplication requires huge amount of bandwidth whereas the bandwidth of cross-DR links and the upload/download rates of server interfaces are limited. Second, data transmissions are time sensitive, but the current network cannot complete such tasks in a timely manner. In this work, we present PieBridge, a cross-RD data duplicate transmission platform that accommodates hundreds of TBs of data generated from user applications online data analytics. We deployed PieBridge on the IDCs of Baidu and obtained promising performance results in comparison with the prevalent approaches.
