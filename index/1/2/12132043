An extension to a language-based custom VLSI design approach is proposed in which the designer supplies just enough up-front semantic information to allow a substantial amount of beneficial design consistency checking with a minimum of computation. The computational load is reduced by using a bottom-up hierarchical design approach, with incremental checking as the design is built. The load is also reduced by imposing minor restrictions upon the layout designer, by requiring that all active elements be prechecked, and by attaching "type" attributes to interconnecting signals. The method is very efficient for highly "regular" designs. Checks performed are geometrical design rules, connectivity, static electrical consistency, and node rise-and-fall times.
