This work investigates selecting concise labels for the newly-arising topics in community question answer. Previous methods of generating labels do not take the information of the existing category hierarchy into consideration. The main motivation of our paper is to utilize this information into the label generation process. We propose a general framework to address this problem. Firstly, we map the questions into Wikipedia concept sets, which are more meaningful than terms. Secondly, important concepts are identified to represent the main focus of the newly-arising topics. Thirdly, candidate labels are extracted from Wikipedia category graph. Finally, candidate labels are filtered and reranked by combination of structure information of existing category hierarchy and Wikipedia category graph. The experiments show that in our test collections, about 80% "correct" labels appear in the top ten labels recommended by our system.
