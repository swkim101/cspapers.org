Modern cars are already able to park in parking spaces adjacent to streets. Soon autonomous cars will be able to navigate themselves through parking garages to find a parking lot assigned to them. Indoor localization is essential to qualify cars and parking garages to perform this operation. Currently the reliability of many indoor localization schemes suffers from non-line-of-sight propagation paths. We present a position estimation algorithm for indoor localization systems based on phase measurements of electromagnetic signals. Our algorithm is designed to detect and exclude measurements originating from these non-line-of-sight paths to reduce their harmful influence on the localization.
