This paper deals with the design of the housings of electrostatic precipitators. While it is expected that few people will be concerned with electrostatic precipitator housings, the general principle should have broad applicability. The product being designed here is a large and expensive piece of capital equipment. It is essentially custom designed for each installation. In this situation, the design cost for each item sold becomes a significant factor.
 The method presented in this paper is applicable if the item being design is one that is somewhat standardized, but within that standardization, there are so many options that the problem approaches a customized design.
