Given multiple possible models <b>b</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>b</b><sub>2</sub>, ... <b>b</b><sub><i>n</i></sub> for a protein structure, a common sub-task in <i>in-silico</i> Protein Structure Prediction is ranking these models according to their quality. Extant approaches use MLE estimates of parameters <b>r</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> to obtain point estimates of the Model Quality. We describe a Bayesian alternative to assessing the quality of these models that builds an MRF over the parameters of each model and performs approximate inference to integrate over them. Hyperparameters <b>w</b> are learnt by optimizing a list-wise loss function over training data. Our results indicate that our Bayesian approach can significantly outperform MLE estimates and that optimizing the hyper-parameters can further improve results.
