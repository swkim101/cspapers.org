The most fundamental building blocks in any CAD system are the data structure and associated data base management routines. The performance of application programs is directly dependent on the data base access time and the efficiency of the management subroutines which are the interface between data base and application programs. The designer of a minicomputer based CAD system is always faced with the need to design a data structure and interface since the available commercial Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) cannot be used due to special restrictions imposed on the data base and associated management routines by the minibased CAD environment. This paper discusses the requirements and design of such a minibased CAD data base and management system.
