The purpose of this study was to create and validate a tool which could be administered to students enrolled in or considering enrollment in an introductory programming course to predict success in the course or alternatively to segregate enrolled students into fast and slow paced sections. Previous work which met the criteria of a self contained predictive tool included the work of Barry Kurtz [5] of the University of California, Irvine using abstract reasoning development as the predictive measure. The test Kurtz developed had been tested only on a small sample (23 students) in a controlled environment (one instructor - the researcher) and the test required up to 80 minutes to complete.
 This study modified the Kurtz test to require 40 minutes and administered it to 353 students learning two different languages from a variety of instructors. This predictor successfully predicted the advanced students from average to below average students. When used in conjunction with other known factors, e. g., GPA, the authors feel it is a viable tool for advising and placement purposes.
