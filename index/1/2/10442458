Shifting from traditional software development approaches, based on functional decomposition, to object-oriented development is not just a matter of programming languages. Object-oriented training should cover all aspects of object-oriented development. Effective training requires case studies and hands-on experiences. To run an ~troductoryproject using object-oriented technology is one way to KKl all of the above requirements. But to organize and run an initial object-oriented project is d33icult without any reliable experiences. The workshop brought together people from industryandacsdemiato discusspositive andnegative experiences with such transition projects. The goal of the workshop was to to come up with a condensed list of recommendations for the organization and implementation of initial object+ oriented projects. All workshop participants were therefore required to prepare ‘“top-ten” lists of recommendations, which were made available in advauce of the workshop. Since we were only 10 participants, we kept the presentations informal to foster lively discussions. During the discussions we recorded csndidates for our &al “top-ten” list of recommendations. About half of these candidates were selected as the preliminary results of the workshop and presented at the poster session. We then collectedvotes on our recommendation (see section 4 for the results of the “election”). 2 Summary of Presentations
