A new algorithm is proposed which transforms f-structures into discourse representation structures (DRSs). Its primary features are that it works bottom up, that it is capable of translating f-structures without pre imposing any arbitrary order on the attributes occurring in it, and that it handles indeterminacy of scoping by using sets of translations. The approach sheds light on how an efficient interaction of different components of a natural language processing model can be achieved.
