In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of TempoString, an easy-to-use tool which assists children with music creation. It provides such a fun and novel platform by allowing children to "draw" music on a canvas and then edit it using a rope. The main contribution of our work is the novel access which allows children to "paint" music on a canvas and then edit using a rope.
