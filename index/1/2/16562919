It is well known that paper is a very fluid, natural, and easy to use medium for manipulating some kinds of information. It is familiar, portable, flexible, inexpensive, and offers good readability properties. Paper also has well known limitations when compared with electronic media. Work in hybrid paper electronic interfaces seeks to bring electronic capabilities to real paper in order to obtain the best properties of each. This paper describes a hybrid paper electronic system — the Paper PDA — which is designed to allow electronic capabilities to be employed within a conventional paper notebook, calendar, or organizer. The Paper PDA is based on a simple observation: a paper notebook can be synchronized with a body of electronic information much like an electronic PDA can be synchronized with information hosted on a personal computer. This can be accomplished by scanning, recognizing and processing its contents, then printing a new copy. This paper introduces the Paper PDA concept and considers interaction techniques and applications designed to work within the Paper PDA. The StickerLink technique supports on-paper hyperlinking using removable paper stickers. Two applications are also considered which look at aspects of electronic communications via the Paper PDA.
