We present a system for the large scale induction of cognate groups. Our model explains the evolution of cognates as a sequence of mutations and innovations along a phylogeny. On the task of identifying cognates from over 21,000 words in 218 different languages from the Oceanic language family, our model achieves a cluster purity score over 91%, while maintaining pairwise recall over 62%.
