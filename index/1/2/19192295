Brackman describes a l a t t i ce l i ke structured inheritance network (KLONE) as a language for exp l i c i t representation of natural language conceptual information. Multiple descriptions can be represented. How does the f a c i l i t y d i f fe r from a similar one in KRL? Belief representations appear to be only impl ic i t . Quantification is handled through a set of "structural descriptions." I t is not clear how negation is handled. The main application is for the command and control of advanced graphics manioulators through natural language. Is there an impl ic i t claim here that the KLONE representations are suitable for both natural language concepts as well as for those in the visual domain?
