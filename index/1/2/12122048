This paper focuses on high-performance robotic contour tracking under the uncertainties that commonly exist in actual robotic applications. These uncertainties can be attributed to the robot itself (such as modeling errors or mechanical defects like backlash) or to environmental issues (such as calibration errors or misalignment of the workpiece). We propose a non-model-based dynamic compensation approach based on the coarse-to-fine philosophy, which enables contour tracking with both high speed and good accuracy. This is achieved by adopting a methodology in which a main robot performs fast but coarse motion, while an add-on module conducts accurate compensation for the overall uncertainties using a high-speed camera and high-speed compensation actuator. An algorithm called pre-compensated proportionalderivative sliding mode control (pre-compensated PD-SMC) is proposed to control the compensation actuator. The effectiveness of the proposed contour tracking approach and control algorithm are experimentally verified using two typical planar-contour shapes: a random smooth-curvature and rectangle.
