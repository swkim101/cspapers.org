In this paper, we propose novel ranking methods of effectively finding content descriptions of classical music compositions. In addition to rather naive methods using technical term frequency and latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA), we proposed a novel classification of web pages about classical music and used the characteristics of the classification for our method of search by labeled LDA(L-LDA). The experimental results showed our method performed well at finding content descriptions of classical music compositions.
