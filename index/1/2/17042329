ARACHNID is a distributed algorithm for information discovery in large, dynamic, distributed environments such as the World Wide Web. The approach is based on a distributed , adaptive population of intelligent agents making local decisions. The behavior of the algorithm is analyzed using a simpliied model of the Web environment. This analysis highlights an interesting feature of the Web environment that bodes well for ARACH-NID's search methods. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using both simulated environments and preliminary experiments in which prototype agents search real Web environments. Interactions are also discussed between unsupervised learning by individual agents and evolution at the population level, along with the role played in both by user relevance feedback.
