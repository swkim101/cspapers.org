Statement from Michael Berman: We started using C++ in CS2 in Fall 1993. In Fall 1994 we will start using C++ in our CS 1 class. Our motivation for using C++ came from several directions. First, we use C in advanced courses, and needed a better place in the curriculum to introduce C (or, better, C++). Second, we wanted a language that could fully support implementation of abstract data types and OOP. Third, external forces (employers, MIS department, and a future Engineering School) pointed towards C++. There’s no time in CS UCS2 to learn everything about C++, but I don’t think you need to. Ideally, the relevant features are covered as they are needed. I am developing a CS2 textbook based on this approach. Introducing features in this way is nearly impossible in C, but is actually easier in C++ because pre-written classes can be used to hide some of the complexity of the language.
