This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of Concurrent-MAC, a MAC protocol for increasing concurrent transmissions in multi-AP wireless LANs. Based on SINR values between stations and APs, sets of concurrent transmitters are identified by the backhaul of APs. A station gaining access to the channel, schedules a set of its neighbors for concurrent transmissions. Neighbors chosen for concurrent transmission can start transmitting on the channel, immediately after they overhear the privilege given to them for concurrent transmission. Our simulation results show that, in dense wireless LANs, Concurrent-MAC can improve aggregate throughput significantly compared to 802.11 DCF.
