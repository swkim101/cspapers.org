Efficient on-chip resource management is crucial for Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) to achieve high resource utilization and enforce system-level performance objectives. Existing multiple resource management schemes either focus on intra-core resources or inter-core resources, missing the opportunity for exploiting the interaction between these two level resources. Moreover, these resource management schemes either rely on trial runs or complex on-line machine learning model to search for the appropriate resource allocation, which makes resource management inefficient and expensive. To address these limitations, this paper presents a predictive yet cost effective mechanism for multiple resource management in CMP. It uses a set of hardware-efficient online profilers and an analytical performance model to predict the application's performance with different intra-core and/or inter-core resource allocations. Based on the predicted performance, the resource allocator identifies and enforces near optimum resource partitions for each epoch without any trial runs. The experimental results show that the proposed predictive resource management framework could improve the weighted speedup of the CMP system by an average of 11.6% compared with the equal partition scheme, and 9.3% compared with existing reactive resource management scheme.
