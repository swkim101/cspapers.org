For several years, there has been considerable interest in an alignment network that is used in SIMD array computers. To avoid conflicts, the main storage in an array computer is divided into memory blocks, which are at least as numerous as the processing elements (Figure 1). The performance of the alignment network is critical with respect to the overall performance of an array computer. Its design must be aimed at achieving low cost of hardware, high operating speed, large combinational power, and simple control.
 We describe the principle and the structure of a Î» alignment network. We also introduce the simulation algorithms of the interconnection functions mentioned previously, show how to implement the conflict-free access of rows, columns, diagnonals, and back diagonals of an array, and show how to simulate the larger scale interconnection functions with a relatively smaller alignment network.
