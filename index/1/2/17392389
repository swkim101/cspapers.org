Previous work studied one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) problems including pointwise methods, pairwise methods, and content-based methods. The fundamental assumptions made on these approaches are roughly the same. They regard all missing values as negative. However, this is unreasonable since the missing values actually are the mixture of negative and positive examples. A user does not give a positive feedback on an item probably only because she/he is unaware of the item, but in fact, she/he is fond of it. Furthermore, content-based methods, e.g. collaborative topic regression (CTR), usually require textual content information of items. This cannot be satisfied in some cases. In this paper, we exploit latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on OCCF problem. It assumes missing values unknown and only models the observed data, and it also does not need content information of items. In our model items are regarded as words and users are considered as documents and the user-item feedback matrix denotes the corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous methods on various ranking-oriented evaluation metrics.
