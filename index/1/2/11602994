Cache affinity is important to the performance of scalable shared memory multiprocessors. For multiprocessors without hardware cache coherence support, software cache coherence is the only alternative. Most existing software cache schemes ignore cache affinity across parallel loops. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, Cache Affinity-based Software cache coherence scheme (CAS), that exploits cache affinity across parallel loops to achieve high cache hit ratios without requiring extra hardware support. The experimental results show that the new scheme outperforms other existing schemes.
