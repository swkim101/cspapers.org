A graph is vertex-transitive if all of its vertices are equivalent under automorphisms. Confirming a conjecture of Jon Kleinberg and l&a Tardos, we prove the following trichotomy theorem concerning locally finite vertex-transitive planar graphs: the rate of growth of a graph with these properties is either linear or quadratic or exponential. The same result holds more generally for locally finite, almost vertextransitive planar graphs (the automorphism group has a finite number of orbits). The proof uses the elements of hyperbolic plane geometry.
