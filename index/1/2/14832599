Collaborative filtering has been very successful in both research and applications such as information filtering and E-commerce. The k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method is a popular way for its realization. Its key technique is to find k nearest neighbors for a given user to predict his interests. However, this method suffers from two fundamental problems: sparsity and scalability. In this paper, we present our solutions for these two problems. We adopt two techniques: a matrix conversion method for similarity measure and an instance selection method. And then we present an improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on these two methods. In contrast with existing collaborative algorithms, our method shows its satisfactory accuracy and performance.
