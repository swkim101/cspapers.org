Child semantic development includes learning the meaning of words as well as the semantic relations among words. A presumed outcome of semantic development is the formation of a semantic network that reflects this knowledge. We present an algorithm for simultaneously learning word meanings and gradually growing a semantic network, which adheres to the cognitive plausibility requirements of incrementality and limited computations. We demonstrate that the semantic connections among words in addition to their context is necessary in forming a semantic network that resembles an adultâ€™s semantic knowledge.
