In 1990 Boyar, Cha.um, Damgard and Pedersen introduced the concept of convertible, undeniable signatures. They proved that those schemes exist iff oneway functions exist and further gave an example of a practical convertible undeniable scheme which is based on the ElGamal signature scheme. In this paper we present an attack on this signature scheme. After the conversion, that means, the signer releases the secret parameter so that his signature can be checked by any verifier, we can show that there is no security at all: A key only-attacker can forge the signature scheme universally. Thus this scheme might still be used as an undeniable signature scheme but it possesses only selective but no total convertibility. The attack can also be applied to Pedersen's modification of that scheme. We further show how the convertible, undeniable signature scheme can be repaired so that the attack doesn't fails and discuss a possibility to strengthen the security of the scheme.
