This paper presents a novel deterministic algorithm for implicit Semantic Role Labeling. The system exploits a very simple but relevant discursive property, the argument coherence over different instances of a predicate. The algorithm solves the implicit arguments sequentially, exploiting not only explicit but also the implicit arguments previously solved. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that the algorithm obtains very competitive and robust performances with respect to supervised approaches that require large amounts of costly training data.
