XQBE (XQuery By Example, [1]), a visual dialect of XQuery, uses hierarchical structures to express transformations between XML documents. XSLT, the standard transformation language for XML, is increasingly popular among programmers and Web developers for separating the application and presentation layers of Web applications. However, its syntax and its rule-based execution paradigm are rather intricate, and the number of XSLT experts is limited; the availability of easier "dialects" could be extremely valuable and may contribute to the adoption of XML for developing data-centered Web applications and services. With this motivation in mind, we adapted XQBE to serve as a visual interface for expressing XML-to-XML transformations and generate the XSLT code that performs such transformations.
