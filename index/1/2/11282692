We present a new LR algorithm for tree-adjoining grammars. It is an alternative to an existing algorithm that is shown to be incorrect. Furthermore, the new algorithm is much simpler, being very close to traditional LR parsing for context-free grammars. The construction of derived trees and the computation of features also become straightforward.
