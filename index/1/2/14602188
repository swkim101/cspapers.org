Modulo Scheduling is an instruction scheduling technique that is used by many current compilers. Different approaches have been proposed in the past but there is not a quantitative comparison among them, using the same compiling platform, benchmarks and architectures.This paper presents a performance comparison of the most relevant Modulo Scheduling techniques, based on a detailed quantitative evaluation of them. The results point out which are the most effective techniques for different architectures, which is useful for compiler designers when choosing the most appropriate technique for a particular processor architecture.
