This paper describes CALOS, our application of computer-aided learning to a third-year Computer Science course in Operating Systems. The delivery tool we choose is the World Wide Web. The course material consists of interactive exercises, interactive simulations and demonstrations, on-line notes, student - instructor communication mechanisms, student - student communication mechanisms, progress tracking, navigational aids, student evaluations, a glossary and a bibliography. We make use of text, images, animations and voice. We plan to offer the course experimentally in several modes in order to determine the best use of the hypermedia presentation.
