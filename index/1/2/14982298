We present a randomized 2^{<italic>O(n)</italic>} time algorithm to compute a shortest non-zero vector in an <italic>n</italic>-dimensional rational lattice. The best known time upper bound for this problem was 2^{<italic>O(n</italic>\log <italic>n</italic>)} first given by Kannan [7] in 1983. We obtain several consequences of this algorithm for related problems on lattices and codes, including  an improvement for polynomial time approximations to the shortest vector problem. In this improvement we gain a factor of log log <italic>n</italic> in the exponent of the approximating factor.
