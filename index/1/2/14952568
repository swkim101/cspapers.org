The primary goals of this paper are two-fold: 1) to present the design and hardware implementation of the interface transmitter for the Distributed Loop Computer Network (DLCN), using a novel shift-register insertion message transmission mechanism, and 2) to discuss simulation results comparing DLCN with Pierce and Newhall loops, which verify earlier claims as to DLCN's superior performance.
