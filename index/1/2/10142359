We performed an experiment in which subjects were asked to find a gift for a friend using the Web. The subjects were divided into two groups, only one of which was instructed to form a mental image prior to the search. We found that subjects who formed a prior mental image took longer to complete their search and also reported higher degrees of satisfaction with their search result. We present a cognitive model in which the search takes place as an incremental refinement of search target candidates and their attributes.
