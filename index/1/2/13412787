In conjunction with the development of a new Master's degree program, yet to receive final approval, the University of Kentucky Computer Science Department has devised and implemented a problem seminar. Students who enter graduate training in the department are required to present four of six specified items of academic background. It has been our experience that they present these credentials but have little working knowledge of their relation to Computer Science.
 The seminar is therefore designed to encourage the student to use and apply certain techniques he is expected already to know. On the other hand, we make no great point of this with the students-the problems are presented to them (usually) without comment on the expected method of solution; although the background, importance and relevance of the problem is discussed.
 In what follows we discuss the objectives of our seminar, how it is organized to attain these objectives, and finally our plans for the future development of the course. We conclude by speculating briefly how we might best employ a third classroom hour.
