The panel focuses on the following theme: how do we give the users of real-time applications sufficient and timeIy information needed to make critical decisions without overload or distraction? The key words are sufficient information (enough? too much? studies of acceptable ranges?) and time& information (computer and human response time) sufficient to accomplish this mission. The panel session builds on ideas developed at two workshops held at CHI’88 and CHI’89 [6,7].
