We develop the dynamic model for a planar rollerblader. The robot consists of a rigid platform and two planar, two degree-of-freedom legs with in-line skates at the foot. The dynamic model consists of two unicycles coupled through the rigid body dynamics of the planar platform. We derive the Lagrangian reduction for the rollerblading robot. We show the generation of some simple gaits that allow the platform to move forward and rotate by using cyclic motions of the two legs.
