This paper addresses the problem of estimating the size of a deep web data source that is accessible by queries only. Since most deep webs are non-cooperative, a data source size can only be estimated by sending queries and analyzing the returning results. Depending on the returning results, there are two approaches to size estimation. One is based on the document ids returned, the other is based on both the ids and the downloaded document contents which is computationally more expensive. We propose an efficient estimator based on Capture Recapture method that relies on the document ids only. First we derive an equation between the overlapping rate and the percentage of the data examined when random samples are obtained from a uniform distribution. In reality, documents are selected from a power law distribution, where large documents are easier to be captured. Based on the equation derived from uniform distribution, we empirically derived an equation for real data sources.
