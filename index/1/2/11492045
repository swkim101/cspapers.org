In this paper we study the problem of designing scheduling strategies when the demand on the system is known and waiting time requirements are pre-specified. This important synthesis problem has received little attention in the literature, and contrasts with the common analytical approach to the study of computer service systems. This latter approach contributes only in-directly to the problem of finding satisfactory scheduling rules when the desired (or required) response-time performance is specifiable in advance.
