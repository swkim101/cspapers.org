LDA-frames is an unsupervised approach for identifying semantic
frames from semantically unlabeled text corpora, and seems to
be a useful competitor for manually created databases of
selectional preferences. The most limiting property of the
algorithm is such that the number of frames and roles must be
predefined. In this paper we present a modification of the
LDA-frames algorithm allowing the number of frames and roles to
be determined automatically, based on the character and size of
training data.
