We present freeform interactive speakers for creating spatial sound experiences from a variety of surfaces. Traditional surround sound systems are widely used and consist of multiple electromagnetic speakers that create point sound sources within a space. Our proposed system creates directional sound and can be easily embedded into architecture, furniture and many everyday objects. We use electrostatic loudspeaker technology made from thin, flexible, lightweight and low cost materials and can be of different size and shape. In this demonstration we will show various configurations such as single speaker, speaker array and tangible speakers for playful and exciting interactions with spatial sounds. This is an example of new possibilities for the design of various interactive surfaces.
