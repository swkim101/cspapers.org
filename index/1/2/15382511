In video communication, social telepresence is essential for enabling users to communicate naturally in the same manner as in face-to-face meetings. In an attempt to enhance social telepresence, we propose an advanced video communication system with a simple equipment setup that imparts motion parallax which adjusts to the viewpoint position of the user in addition to providing life-size, eye contact, and high quality images. Evaluation experiment results on the system showed that motion parallax enhances social telepresence.
