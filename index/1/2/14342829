For each representation, we define a transition function for computing the successor belief state resulting from the execution of an action in a belief state; results concerning soundness and completeness are provided. The paper describes a system (PIP) which dynamically selects either of these two forms to represent belief states, and an experimental evaluation of PIP against state-of-the-art conformant planners. The results show that PIP has the potential of scaling up better than other planners in problems rich in disjunctive information about the initial state.
