The problem of time series classification has attracted great interest in the last decade. However current research assumes the existence of large amounts of labeled training data. In reality, such data may be very difficult or expensive to obtain. For example, it may require the time and expertise of cardiologists, space launch technicians, or other domain specialists. As in many other domains, there are often copious amounts of unlabeled data available. For example, the PhysioBank archive contains gigabytes of ECG data. In this work we propose a semi-supervised technique for building time series classifiers. While such algorithms are well known in text domains, we will show that special considerations must be made to make them both efficient and effective for the time series domain. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse data sources including electrocardiograms, handwritten documents, and video datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach requires only a handful of labeled examples to construct accurate classifiers.
