The evolution of DRAM technology has been driven by capacity and bandwidth during the last decade. In contrast, DRAM access latency stays relatively constant and is trending to increase. Much efforts have been devoted to tolerate memory access latency but these techniques have reached the point of diminishing returns. Having shorter bitline and wordline length in a DRAM device will reduce the access latency. However by doing so it will impact the array efficiency. In the mainstream market, manufacturers are not willing to trade capacity for latency. Prior works had proposed hybrid-bitline DRAM design to overcome this problem. However, those methods are either intrusive to the circuit and layout of the DRAM design, or there is no direct way to migrate data between the fast and slow levels. In this paper, we proposed a novel asymmetric DRAM with capability to perform low cost data migration between subarrays. Having this design we determined a simple management mechanism and explored many management related policies. We showed that with this new design and our simple management technique we could achieve 7.25% and 11.77% performance improvement in single- and multi-programming workloads, respectively, over a system with traditional homogeneous DRAM. This gain is above 80% of the potential performance gain of a system based on a hypothetical DRAM which is made out of short bitlines entirely.
