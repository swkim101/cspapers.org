The ability to write programs that execute efficiently on modern parallel computers has not been fully studied. In this DARPA-sponsored project, we are looking at measuring the development time for programs written for high performance computers (HPC). Our goal is to measure such development time in both student programming (initially), and then later with professional expert programmers. This paper describes the overall goals of the program and our progress to date.
