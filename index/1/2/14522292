This paper presents an interaction technique for walkthrough in virtual 3D spaces, where the user draws the intended path directly on the scene, and the avatar automatically moves along the path. The system calculates the path by projecting the stroke drawn on the screen to the walking surface in the 3D world. Using this technique, the user can specify not only the goal position, but also the route to take and the camera direction at the goal with a single stroke. A prototype system is tested using a displayintegrated tablet, and experimental results suggest that the technique can enhance existing walkthrough techniques.
