We study the spatiotemporal correlation in natural time-varying images and explore the hypothesis that the visual system is concerned with the optimal coding of visual representation through spatiotemporal decorrelation of the input signal. Based on the measured spatiotemporal power spectrum, the transform needed to decorrelate input signal is derived analytically and then compared with the actual processing observed in psychophysical experiments.
