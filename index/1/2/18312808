Algorithms developed for scheduling applications on heterogeneous multiprocessor system focus on asingle objective such as execution time, cost or total data transmission time. However, if more than oneobjective (e.g. execution cost and time, which may be in conflict) are considered, then the problem becomes more challenging. This project is proposed to develop a multiobjective scheduling algorithm using Evolutionary techniques for scheduling a set of dependent tasks on available resources in a multiprocessor environment which will minimize the makespan and reliability cost. A Non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm-II procedure has been developed to get the pareto- optimal solutions. NSGA-II is a Elitist Evolutionary algorithm, and it takes the initial parental solution without any changes, in all iteration to eliminate the problem of loss of some pareto-optimal solutions.NSGA-II uses crowding distance concept to create a diversity of the solutions.
