WWW-based information service has grown enormously during the last few years, and major performance bottlenecks have been caused by WWW server and Internet bandwidth inadequacies. Augmenting a server with multiprocessor support and shifting computation to client-site machines can substantially improve system response times and for some applications, it may also reduce network bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we propose adaptive scheduling techniques that optimize the use of a multiprocessor server with client resources by predicting demands of requests on I/O, CPU and network capabilities. We also provide a performance analysis under simplified assumptions for understanding the impact of system loads and network bandwidth when using our scheduling strategy. Finally we report preliminary experimental results to examine the system performance and verify the usefulness of the analytic model.
