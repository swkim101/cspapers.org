In this paper, we introduce a walking load control strategy with a cane-type robot for gait training. The population of elderly people is increasing in most of the developed countries, and there is a growing demand for caregivers. Assistive robots are expected as a solution to provide aid in order to reduce the burden of caregivers in gait training of elderly people. Our research group has been developing a series of cane-type walking assistive robots named Intelligent Cane on admittance control to provide safe and efficient gait training. We propose an adaptive design method of the admittance control model in order to control user's walking load for the purpose of rapid improvement of user's physical strength. In the proposed method, the cane robot automatically adjusts control parameters of an admittance control model based on a correlation between a set of admittance parameters and a user's walking energy consumption. We conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed adaptive control strategy through a convergence error between estimated walking load and target one while walking training. We confirm the advantage of using the cane robot in rehabilitation.
