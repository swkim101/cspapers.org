We present a digital signature scheme which combines high security with the property of being based on a very general assumption: the existence of trapdoor permutations. Previous signature schemes with comparable levels of security were based on assumptions of the computational hardness of particular algebraic problems such as factoring. Our contribution is to free this important cryptographic primitive from the fortunes of any specific algebraic problem by establishing a truly general signature scheme.
