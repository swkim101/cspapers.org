Hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) has recently emerged as a promising framework for solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action variables. Our work addresses its major computational bottleneck - constraint satisfaction in large structured domains of discrete and continuous variables. We analyze this problem and propose a novelMarkov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC) method for finding the most violated constraint of a relaxed HALP. This method does not require the discretization of continuous variables, searches the space of constraints intelligently based on the structure of factored MDPs, and its space complexity is linear in the number of variables. We test the method on a set of large control problems and demonstrate improvements over alternative approaches.
