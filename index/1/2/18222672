In an era when power constraints and data movement are proving to be significant barriers for high-end computing, multicore architectures offer a low-power and highly scalable platform suitable for both data- and compute-intensive applications. MapReduce is a popular framework to facilitate the management and development of big-data workloads. In this work, we demonstrate that by using a wireless NoC-enabled Voltage Frequency Island (VFI)-based multicore platform it is possible to enhance the energy efficiency of MapReduce implementations without paying significant execution time penalties. Our experimental results show that for the benchmarks considered, the designed VFI system can achieve an average of 33.7% energy-delay product (EDP) savings over the standard baseline non-VFI mesh-based system while paying a maximum of 3.22% execution time penalty.
