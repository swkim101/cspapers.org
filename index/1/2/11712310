To enhance the safety of a humanoid robot when it is operating a complex environment, a number of methods that combine visual and force information have been presented. These methods are generally divided into two approaches. The first approach is to coordinate the visual controller and force controller in a parallel way, and the second approach is to coordinate them in series. However, these two approaches do not consider the interaction between the visual controller and force controller. Specifically, the first approach does not consider the interaction between the controllers. The second approach only considers the effect of the output of the visual controller on the force controller, while the effect of the force controller on the visual controller is not considered. This study presents a design for a new flexible controller for a humanoid robot that considers the interaction of visual and force information. The advantages of the proposed method are that it simultaneously incorporates the functions of a visual servo controller and a flexible controller as well as its ability to consider the interaction of visual and force information when a humanoid robot is operating.
