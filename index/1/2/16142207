In this paper, we propose a data representation model that demonstrates hierarchical feature learning using nsNMF. We extend unit algorithm into several layers. Experiments with document and image data successfully discovered feature hierarchies. We also prove that proposed method results in much better classification and reconstruction performance, especially for small number of features. feature hierarchies.
