This paper deals with the problem of computing the motions of a robot observer in order to maintain visibility of a moving target. The target moves unpredictably, and the distribution of obstacles in the workspace is known in advance. Our algorithm computes a motion strategy based on partitioning the configuration space and the workspace in non-critical regions separated by critical curves. In this work, the existence of a solution for a given polygon and delay are determined.
