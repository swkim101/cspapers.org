Stochastic computation, as presented in this paper, exploits the statistical nature of application-level performance metrics, and matches it to the statistical attributes of the underlying device and circuit fabrics. Nanoscale circuit fabrics are viewed as noisy communication channels/networks. Communications-inspired design techniques based on estimation and detection theory are proposed. Stochastic computation advocates an explicit characterization and exploitation of error statistics at the architectural and system levels. This paper traces the roots of stochastic computing from the Von Neumann era into its current form. Design and CAD challenges are described.
