This paper introduces a new controller for dual-user training systems, designed by way of an energy based approach. Dual-user training systems are useful for supervised hands-on training when a trainer shows the right gestures to a trainee and where the forces to apply on the tools are difficult to dose. An energy shared control (ESC) based architecture is proposed, based on an intrinsically passive authority sharing mechanism which is enhanced to provide a full force feedback to both users. As this enhancement may violate the natural passivity of the system, a passivity controller is introduced. A task based comparative study with two other dual-user schemes (Complementary Linear Combination (CLC) and Masters Correspondence with Environment Transfer (MECT) from is conducted, which reveals analogous performances. Real-time experiments demonstrate good tracking performances.
