Truth tables are a basic tool for teaching propositional logic. However, when students are unfamiliar with logic or come from educationally disadvantaged baekgmnnds, definitions of logical connective based on truth tables are unintuitive and difficult to remember. This is especially the case with the truth table for material implication. Possible Models Diagrams are a visual representation of propositional expressions and hence offer an rdtemative to truth tables. Like truth tables, Possible Models Diagrams can be used to define basic logical connective and to classify wffs as tautological, contingent or inconsistent. In addhion, they show greater expressibility than truth tables in that they ean be used to show whether or not a sequent is provable. Furthermore, they are simpler to learn and to remember beeause of their visual appeal.
