Active learning (AL) consists of asking human annotators to annotate automatically selected data that are assumed to bring the most benefit in the creation of a classifier. AL allows to learn accurate systems with much less annotated data than what is required by pure supervised learning algorithms, hence limiting the tedious effort of annotating a large collection of data. We experimentally investigate the behavior of several AL strategies for sequence labeling tasks (in a partially-labeled scenario) tailored on Partially-Labeled Conditional Random Fields, on four sequence labeling tasks: phrase chunking, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and bioentity recognition.
