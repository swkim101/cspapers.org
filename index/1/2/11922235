OTM is a concurrent object language presently being implemented at the University of Toronto. It provides a novel, simple and powerful way of structuring tasks or collections of operations. This paper describes the concurrency control features of OTM, which include external termination of tasks. An example demonstrates how the language can be used to cleanly and concisely control cooperating objects.
