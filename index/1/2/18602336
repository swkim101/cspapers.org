NAND flash storage is widely adopted in all classes of computing devices. However, random write performance and lifetime issues remain to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel buffer replacement algorithm called TS-CLOCK that effectively resolves the remaining problems. Our experimental results show that TS-CLOCK outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of performance and lifetime.
