A tree transformation is sensible if the size of each output tree is uniformly bounded by a linear function in the size of the corresponding input tree. Every sensible tree transformation computed by an arbitrary weighted extended top-down tree transducer can also be computed by a weighted multi bottom-up tree transducer. This further motivates weighted multi bottom-up tree transducers as suitable translation models for syntax-based machine translation.
