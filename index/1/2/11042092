Writing my first textbook was an eye-opening experience. I had to dig deep. I had ideas I was excited about and found others that were excited about them as well. I also found strong opposition to my approach, which was difficult for publishers to evaluate. My experience raised a number of questions that I have outlined below. These questions range from personnel motivation to future trends in computing. I have gathered a panel of respected authors. I have asked each to respond to some of these questions. Time will also be available for the audience to ask questions and share their own experiences.
