The volume of data required for decision making is growing fast. With technology advancement, decision makers not only face massive amounts of data to process, but also have to make their decisions quickly. This leaves current database technology for some domains limited in use. We propose a function-based system (FUN BASE) which automates information management for domains where current database technology does not scale up. The strength of FUNBASE stems from its three fold capability: first to share knowledge among users, second to use external criteria for accessing underlying data in a database, and third to automate the acquisition of data from flat files with short life spans. These features make FUNBASE a collaborative medium for information exchange as well as a vehicle for speeding the processing of results by integrating data and functions while keeping them modular for changes and updates.
