This paper presents a pose estimation approach that is resilient to typical sensor failure and suitable for low cost agricultural robots. Guiding large agricultural machinery with highly accurate GPS/INS systems has become standard practice, however these systems are inappropriate for smaller, lower-cost robots. Our positioning system estimates pose by fusing data from a low-cost global positioning sensor, low-cost inertial sensors and a new technique for vision-based row tracking. The results first demonstrate that our positioning system will accurately guide a robot to perform a coverage task across a 6 hectare field. The results then demonstrate that our vision-based row tracking algorithm improves the performance of the positioning system despite long periods of precision correction signal dropout and intermittent dropouts of the entire GPS sensor.
