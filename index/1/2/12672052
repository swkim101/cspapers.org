We introduce a novel method to jointly parse and detect disfluencies in spoken utterances. Our model can use arbitrary features for parsing sentences and adapt itself with out-ofdomain data. We show that our method, based on transition-based parsing, performs at a high level of accuracy for both the parsing and disfluency detection tasks. Additionally, our method is the fastest for the joint task, running in linear time.
