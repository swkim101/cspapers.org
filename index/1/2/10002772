In information retrieval relevance ranking of the results is one of the most important single tasks there are. There are many diffierent ranking algorithms based on the content of the documents or on some external properties e.g. link structure of html documents.We present a temporally adaptive content-based relevance ranking algorithm that explicitly takes into account the temporal behavior of the underlying statistical properties of the documents in the form of a statistical topic model. more we state that our algorithm can be used on top of any ranking algorithm.
