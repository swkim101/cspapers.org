This paper presents the design and validation of a wearable glove-based multi-finger motion capture device (SmartGlove) with a specific focus on the development of a new optical linear encoder (OLE). The OLE specially designed for this project has a compact size, light weight and low power consumption. The characterization tests also show that the OLE's digital output has good linearity and accuracy. The first prototype of SmartGlove which uses ten OLEs to capture the flexion/extension motion of the 14 finger joints is constructed based on the multi-point sensing method. A user study for the evaluation of SmartGlove using a standard protocol shows high repeatability and reliability in both the gripped and flat hand positions compared with four other evaluated data gloves using the same protocol.
