In this paper, we propose the employment of a combination of multi-document summarization[2] and automated layout[3] as a post-processing step in document retrieval. We examine the use of an interactive textual fisheye that employs automated layout techniques to present a generated natural language summary as a replacement to the standard ranked list. Our presentation system is novel because it employs a natural language summarization system to generate informative as well as indicative summaries of varying lengths to create an effective layout given the constraints of a specific amount of available screen space. In addition, the system leverages the topical structure of the generated summary to create a textual fisheye for navigating and interacting with the presentation where the actual length of the text is varied to provide different levels of detail rather than the more conventional change in rendering parameters such as font size.
