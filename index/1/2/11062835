In this paper, we present a hybrid method for word segmentation and POS tagging. The target languages are those in which word boundaries are ambiguous, such as Chinese and Japanese. In the method, word-based and character-based processing is combined, and word segmentation and POS tagging are conducted simultaneously. Experimental results on multiple corpora show that the integrated method has high accuracy.
