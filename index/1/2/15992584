Ultrasound (US) is one the most commonly used medical imaging techniques in percutaneous needle procedures. However, US images are inherently noisy and contain excessive number of artifacts. Hence, it is not easy to track the needle tip in the US images during the needle insertions. At this point, image based visual tracking techniques can be used for needle tip tracking. This paper presents a method for visual tracking of biopsy needles in 2D US images using sum of squared differences and sum of conditional variances. Second order Gauss-Newton optimization is used to decrease processing time and make the tracking more robust. The needle template images used in the method are updated with a strategy to prevent needle loss and detection failures during tracking. The paper also explains how to identify needle losses during tracking and how to recover the needle position without using a needle localization algorithm. We demonstrate the precision of the visual needle tip tracking method with experiments under challenging tracking conditions.
