Expert and advice-giving systems produce complex multi-sentential responses to user's queries. Results from analyses of novice/expert dialogues indicate that novices often do not understand an expert's response and rarely ask a well-formulated follow-up question. Thus systems must be able to provide further information in response to vaguely articulated questions. However, current systems cannot clarify misunderstood explanations or elaborate on previous explanations. In this paper we describe an approach to explanation generation that expands a system's explanatory capabilities and enables the production of clarifying or elaborating explanations in response to follow-up questions or indication that the explanation was not understood.
