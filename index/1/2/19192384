The existing works assume that all objects are present in all views. However, in real-world applications, it is often the incomplete case that every view may suffer from some missing samples, resulting in partial objects difficult to detect outliers from. To address this problem, we propose a novel Collective Learning (CL) based framework to detect outliers from partial multi-view data in a self-guided way. More specifically, by well exploiting the inter-dependence among different views, we develop an algorithm to reconstruct missing samples based on learning. Furthermore, we propose similarity-based outlier detection to break through the dilemma that the number of clusters is unknown priori. Then, the calculated outlier scores act as the confidence levels in CL and in turn guide the reconstruction of missing data. Learning-based missing sample recovery and similarity-based outlier detection are iteratively performed in a self-guided manner. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
