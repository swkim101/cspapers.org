This work presents a novel multi-robot coverage scheme for an unknown number of robots; it focuses on optimizing the number of robots and each path cost. Coverage problems traditionally deal with how a given number of robots covers the entire environment. This work, however, presents solutions of not only (i) how to cover the area (locations of interest) within the minimum time, but simultaneously (ii) how to find the optimal number of robots for a given time. Also, we consider the worst but realistic case of all robots starting at the same location instead of assuming randomly initialized positions. The minimum coverage time depends upon the number of robots used. Our research specifies (iii) how to find the minimum coverage time without knowing the number of robots. Finally, we present a deterministic coverage algorithm based on finding the shortest paths in order to optimize the number of robots and corresponding paths.
