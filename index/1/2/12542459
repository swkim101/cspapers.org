The ASKNet project is an attempt to automatically generate semantic knowledge networks from natural language text. NLP tools such as parsers and semantic analysers are used to turn input sentences into fragments of semantic network, and these network fragments are combined using spreading activation algorithms that utilise both lexical and semantic information. The ultimate goal of the project is to create a semantic resource on a scale that has never before been possible.
