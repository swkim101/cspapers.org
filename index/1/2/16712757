Fourteen factors that influence the efficiency of programming projects were identified in a corporate-wide study of 44 ITT programming projects in nine countries. Productivity factors were classified according to project management's ability to control them. Product-related factors are not generally under the control of project management. They describe intrinsic properties of the programming product and tend to place limitations on achievable productivity. Project-related factors, on the other hand, are controllable by project management to varying degrees. These factors provide real opportunities for productivity improvement. The analysis indicates that productivity variation is almost equally attributable to product-related and project-related factors.
