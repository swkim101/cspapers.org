This paper describes our experience in redeveloping an object-oriented system. Experience working with the system along with new requirements that were introduced as the system matured motivated a significant redesign and reimplementation effort. The initial object-oriented design helped to allow extension as well as restructuring of system objects. Experience in integrating new objects into the system and reimplementing objects in different languages drove a refactoring process. The Web interface to the system was reimplemented as a Grid portal.
