In most monitoring applications, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are configured to monitor and transmit the sensing data periodically. In case of normal conditions, when the environment does not change frequently, the collected values are usually the same. Hence, the received data do not provide enough meaningful information for making decisions. In this paper, we propose a flexible context-aware monitoring model based on fuzzy logic which can analyze and give the corresponding actions according to the environment changes for logistics contexts. This model can make sensor nodes more advanced to prolong the node lifetime and reduce the number of transmissions of unnecessary information. The simulation and experiment are performed to illustrate advantages of the proposed model and compared with the normal monitoring of sensor nodes in term of generated traffic load and energy efficiency.
