Many applications require the ability to manipulate sequences of data. We motivate the importance of sequence query processing, and present a framework for the optimization of sequence queries based on several novel techniques. These include query transformations, optimizations that utilize meta-data, and caching of intermediate results. We present a bottom-up algorithm that generates an efficient query evaluation plan based on cost estimates. This work also identifies a number of directions in which future research can be directed.
