An effective CS1 approach has been developed for encouraging diverse students without prior computer science experiences to select computing majors. Separation of CS1 sections by prior experience level concentrates diverse students in the inexperienced section. Within that section we use several techniques to increase student comprehension and participation, including an integrated lecture/lab, many small examples and assignments, student participation, etc. We discuss the approach and evaluate its performance over a four-year time period.
