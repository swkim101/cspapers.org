Database queries are often exploratory and users often find their queries return too many answers, many of them irrelevant. Existing work either categorizes or ranks the results to help users locate interesting results. The success of both approaches depends on the utilization of user preferences. However, most existing work assumes that all users have the same user preferences, but in real life different users often have different preferences. This paper proposes a two-step solution to address the diversity issue of user preferences for the categorization approach. The proposed solution does not require explicit user involvement. The first step analyzes query history of all users in the system offline and generates a set of clusters over the data, each corresponding to one type of user preferences. When user asks a query, the second step presents to the user a navigational tree over clusters generated in the first step such that the user can easily select the subset of clusters matching his needs. The user then can browse, rank, or categorize the results in selected clusters. The navigational tree is automatically constructed using a cost-based algorithm which considers the cost of visiting both intermediate nodes and leaf nodes in the tree. An empirical study demonstrates the benefits of our approach.
