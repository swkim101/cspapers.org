Developers modify their systems by changing source code, updating test suites, and altering their system's execution context. When they make these modifications, they have an understanding of the behavioural changes they expect to happen when the system is executed; when the system does not conform to their expectations, developers try to ensure their modification did not introduce some unexpected or undesirable behavioural change. We present an approach that integrates with existing continuous integration systems to help developers identify situations whereby their changes may have introduced unexpected behavioural consequences. In this research demonstration, we show how our approach can help developers identify and investigate unanticipated behavioural changes.
