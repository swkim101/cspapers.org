With the rapid development of information technology, the availability of huge amounts of online information makes retrieval a hard task for the average user. Recommender systems (RS) have been employed across several domains to ease this so-called “information overload” problem since the mid-1990s. Recently, context-aware recommender systems (CARS), aiming to further improve the performance accuracy and user satisfaction by fully utilizing contextual information (such as time, location, mood and company) into RS, has become one of the hottest topics [1]. Although a certain progress has been made, CARS still has to face to many challenges. This thesis investigates some key problems in CARS and then proposes some tested and untested approaches to mine the latent relationship among users, contextual information and items (such as movies, web pages and mobile services). In this thesis, the first task is how to elicit contextual user preferences implicitly. All of the existing CARS are based on the assumption that there are available explicit contextual user ratings (e.g., “Sam × Avatar × Morning × Home  3”). However, it is hard to obtain sufficient contextual user preferences in practice. This thesis proposes a MAUT (multi attribute utility theory)-based approach to implicitly elicit contextual user preferences through analyzing contextual user behaviors. It considers every type of context as an attribute of items, elicit every unidimensional contextual user preferences based on a new context-based IF-IDF formula, and finally elicit multidimensional contextual user preferences after identifying different weights of different contexts. We design a personalized mobile services-oriented prototype system as a test bed to elicit contextual user preferences as well as generate contextual recommendations. I perform experimental comparison of this approach against the other baseline approaches
