A knowledge-based question-answering system (KB-QA) is one that answers natural language questions with information stored in a large-scale knowledge base (KB). Existing KB-QA systems are either powered by curated KBs in which factual knowledge is encoded in entities and relations with well-structured schemas, or by open KBs, which contain assertions represented in the form of triples (e.g., subject; relation phrase; argument). We show that both approaches fall short in answering questions with complex prepositional or adverbial constraints. We propose using n-tuple assertions, which are assertions with an arbitrary number of arguments, and n-tuple open KB (nOKB), which is an open knowledge base of n-tuple assertions. We present TAQA, a novel KB-QA system that is based on an nOKB and illustrate via experiments how TAQA can effectively answer complex questions with rich semantic constraints. Our work also results in a new open KB containing 120M n-tuple assertions and a collection of 300 labeled complex questions, which is made publicly available for further research.
