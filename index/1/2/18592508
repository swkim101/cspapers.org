We show that the class of string languages generated by linear context-free rewriting systems is equal to the class of output languages of deterministic tree-walking transducers. From equivalences that have previously been established we know that this class of languages is also equal to the string languages generated by context-free hypergraph grammars, multicomponent tree-adjoining grammars, and multiple context-free grammars and to the class of yields of images of the regular tree languages under finite-copying top-down tree transducers.
