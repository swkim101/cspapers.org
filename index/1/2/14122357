In this paper we revisit Safra's determinization constructions. We show how to construct deterministic automata with fewer states and, most importantly, parity acceptance conditions. Specifically, starting from a nondeterministic Buchi automaton with n states our construction yields a deterministic parity automaton with n<sup>2n+2</sup> states and index 2n (instead of a Rabin automaton with (12)<sup>n</sup>n<sup>2n</sup> states and n pairs). Starting from a nondeterministic Streett automaton with n states and k pairs our construction yields a deterministic parity automaton with n<sup>n(k+2)+2</sup>(k+1)<sup>2n(K+1)</sup> states and index 2n(k+1) (instead of a Rabin automaton with (12)<sup>n(k+1)</sup>n <sup>n(k+2)</sup>(k+1)<sup>2n(k+1)</sup> states and n(k+1) pairs). The parity condition is much simpler than the Rabin condition. In applications such as solving games and emptiness of tree automata handling the Rabin condition involves an additional multiplier of n<sup>2</sup>n!(or(n(k+1))<sup>2</sup>(n(k+1))! in the case of Streett) which is saved using our construction
