In our previous work we have introduced the Distributed Active/Semi-Active actuation concept. This paper presents the design of a novel three Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) robot manipulator based on the DASA actuation approach. The robot is developed as a proof-of-concept prototype intended to demonstrate the capacity of the DASA approach to achieve a high degree of interaction safety as well as performance. Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches form the basis of the Semi-active actuation component, while a unidirectional motor provides the active drive for the robot. An antagonistic clutch configuration is implemented at the joints to achieve bi-directional actuation without reversal of the motor. MR clutches have been shown to exhibit excellent torque-to-inertia and torque-to-mass ratios making them likely candidates for the development of human-safe actuators. In this paper, the safety characteristics of the DASA approach are qualitatively discussed. Experimental results highlighting the performance capability of the developed robot are given.
