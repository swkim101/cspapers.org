In the context of approximate computing, Approximate Dynamic Random Access Memory (ADRAM) enables the tradeoff between energy efficiency, performance and reliability. The inherent error resilience of applications allows sacrificing data storage robustness and stability by lowering the refresh rate or disabling refresh in DRAMs completely. Consequently, it is important to know exactly the statistical DRAM behavior with respect to retention time, process variation and temperature to manage this trade-off and thereby deliberately exploiting the error resilience of different target applications.
