The paper deals with the problem of planning movements of dual-arm anthropomorphic systems, with the aim of reducing the computational cost of the problem and making the movements look as human-like as possible. The key idea of the proposal is the search of synergies of the dual-arm anthropomorphic system in order to use them to reduce the dimension of the search space while preserving human-like appearance. This idea was already developed and successfully used to plan movements of robotic hands, thus the extension to a dual-arm system is attractive. The paper presents a description of the proposed approach as well as real experimental results that encourage doing further research in this line.
