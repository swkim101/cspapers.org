Hashing techniques have been extensively investigated to boost similarity search for large-scale high-dimensional data. Most of the existing approaches formulate the their objective as a pair-wise similarity-preserving problem. In this paper, we consider the hashing problem from the perspective of optimizing a list-wise learning to rank problem and propose an approach called List-Wise supervised Hashing (LWH). In LWH, the hash functions are optimized by employing structural SVM in order to explicitly minimize the ranking loss of the whole list-wise permutations instead of merely the point-wise or pair-wise supervision. We evaluate the performance of LWH on two real-world data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art hashing approaches due to both structural large margin and list-wise ranking pursuing in a supervised manner.
