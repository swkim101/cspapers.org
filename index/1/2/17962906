New estimates are established for the error between a function and its linear interpolant over a triangular domain. Results previously established using compactness arguments are established here using combinatorial arguments which provide explicit estimates of the constants. New results include new path embeddings for “convex” graphs and bounds on the Rayleigh quotient of complete bipartite graphs. These results are applicable to anisotropic fmite
