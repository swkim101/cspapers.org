This paper overviews and discusses model representations and control structures in image understanding. Hierarchies are observed in the levels of description used in image understanding along a few dimensions: processing unit, detail, composition and scene/view distinction . Emphasis is placed on the importance of explicitly handling the hierarchies both in representing knowledge and in using it . A scheme of "knowledge block" representation which is structured along the processing-unit hierarchy is also presented.
