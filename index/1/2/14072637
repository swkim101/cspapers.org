A Riemannian-geometry approach for control and stabilization of dynamics of object manipulation under holonomic or non-holonomic (but Pfaffian) constraints is presented. First, position/force hybrid control of an endeffector of a multi-joint redundant (or nonredundant) robot under a nonholonomic constraint is reinterpreted in terms of “submersion” in Riemannian geometry. A force control signal constructed in the image space spanned from the constraint gradient can be regarded as a lifting in the direction orthogonal to the kernel space. By means of the Riemannian distance on the constraint submanifold, stability on a manifold for a redundant system under holonomic constraints is discussed. Second, control and stabilization of dynamics of two-dimensional object grasping and manipulation by using a pair of multi-joint robot fingers are tackled, when a rigid object is given with arbitrary shape. Then, it is shown that rolling contact constraint induce the Euler equation of motion in an implicit function form, in which constraint forces appear as wrench vectors affecting on the object. The Riemannian metric can be introduced in a natural way on a constraint submanifold induced by rolling contacts. A control signal called “blind grasping” is defined and shown to be effective in stabilization of grasping without using the details of information of object shape and parameters or external sensing. The concept of stability of the closed-loop system under constraints is renewed in order to overcome the degrees-of-freedom redundancy problem. An extension of Dirichlet-Lagrange's stability theorem to a system of DOF-redundancy under constraints is presented by using a Morse-Lyapunov function.
