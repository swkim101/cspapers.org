Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as a scalable and power efficient technology to architect future main memory systems. The scalability of PCM is enhanced by the property that PCM devices can store multiple bits per cell. While such Multi-Level Cell (MLC) devices can offer high density, this benefit comes at the expense of increased read latency, which can cause significant performance degradation. This paper proposes Morphable Memory System (MMS), a robust architecture for efficiently incorporating MLC PCM devices in main memory. MMS is based on observation that memory requirement varies between workloads, and systems are typically over-provisioned in terms of memory capacity. So, during a phase of low memory usage, some of the MLC devices can be operated at fewer bits per cell to obtain lower latency. When the workload requires full memory capacity, these devices can be restored to high density MLC operation to have full main-memory capacity. We provide the runtime monitors, the hardware-OS interface, and the detailed mechanism for implementing MMS. Our evaluations on an 8-core 8GB MLC PCM-based system show that MMS provides, on average, low latency access for 95% of all memory requests, thereby improving overall system performance by 40%.
