We describe a general software architecture employing handheld comnuters, that provides pen-based interfaces to existing graphical applications thatâ€˜ were designed with a conventional mouse-based interface. This architecture allows delivery of computationally intensive applications to mobile users, and is flexible enough to accommodate interface devices with a wide range of capabilities. To illustrate the functionality of the architecture, we describe a system that we have constructed which is based on the architecture.
