From a user interface point of view, expert systems are different from applications in general in that the reasoning process of the system often defines the dialogue structure. This has several advantages, but there may also be problems due to the lack of separation between functionality and user interface. This paper investigates the possibility of treating an expert system user interface as separate from the reasoning process of the system, and the consequences thereof.
We propose that an expert system user interface can be seen as a combination of two different structures; the surface dialogue, comprising mainly lexical and syntactical aspects, and the session discourse which represents the interaction between user and system on a discourse level. A proposed architecture for a software tool managing these two structures is presented and discussed, with particular emphasis on the session discourse manager.
