In this demonstration, we present new capabilities of Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) Radio Frequency Network Emulation Simulation Tool (RFnestTM) (www.i-a-i.com/rfnest). RFnestTM is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based network channel emulator that allows all of the channels of a full network of radio nodes to be emulated in real time, with all communication nodes experiencing a realistic channel impulse response. This allows RFnestTM to be used for protocol testing, replaying field tests, and model validation. RFnestTM has a modular design with three main capabilities: 1) FPGA based emulation hardware with RF front ends that allows nodes with real radios to send their RF signal over an emulated channel without any modification to the radio, 2) modeling of time-varying channel impulse responses within the emulation hardware, with channel properties based on mobility defined with a scripted or interactive Graphic User Interface (GUI) environment, and 3) integration with network emulators and monitoring functionality that allows the user to instantiate, manage, and monitor real and virtual network nodes within the scenario. In the new version of RFnestTM we now support: Frequency programmability: The new RFnestTM allows users to change the center frequency through software from 800 Mhz to 2.7GHz. Increased bandwidth: RFnestTM supports a bandwidth of 60 MHz. Higher fidelity channel modeling: Through software and hardware updates RFnestTM support wireless channels with up to 20 taps and a wide range of Doppler frequencies. MIMO: RFnestTM now supports different combination of MIMO channel between transmitters and receivers. We will demonstrate the capabilities of RFnestTM with scenarios, including multi-hop bulk data transfer in mixed real virtual network, bulk data transmission at 900MHz and video transfer between two real nodes.
