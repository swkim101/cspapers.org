In image deblurring, a fundamental problem is that the blur kernel suppresses a number of spatial frequencies that are difficult to recover reliably. In this paper, we explore the potential of a class-specific image prior for recovering spatial frequencies attenuated by the blurring process. Specifically, we devise a prior based on the class-specific subspace of image intensity responses to band-pass filters. We learn that the aggregation of these subspaces across all frequency bands serves as a good class-specific prior for the restoration of frequencies that cannot be recovered with generic image priors. In an extensive validation, our method, equipped with the above prior, yields greater image quality than many state-of-the-art methods by up to 5 dB in terms of image PSNR, across various image categories including portraits, cars, cats, pedestrians and household objects.
