This paper presents an experimental system for demonstrating a new concept for retinal micro-vascular surgery. This concept involves the use of stents to maintain the structural integrity in artery/vein crossings. A design of an 11 degree of freedom robot that includes a 6 DoF Stewart-Gough platform, a two DoF differential wrist, and a three DoF actuator for deployment of stent and bridge vessel separators is proposed as a validated robotic system for ophthalmic microsurgery. The robot also allows for quick exchange of surgical graspers and the integration of a custom made B-mode OCT probe. The paper presents the kinematic modeling and calibration of the robot for demonstration of ocular and intraocular manipulation. The system telemanipulation framework is constructed and experimental evaluations of stent deployment and membrane peeling are shown with a verification of results using OCT probe images. We believe these preliminary results demonstrate new technology that may enable micro-vascular stenting for treatment of branch retinal vein occlusion while offering a general platform for dexterous retinal surgery.
