The safety of wearable walking assistant robots (W2ARs) is expected to be guaranteed as they are spreading. From our experience of the risk assessments on Robot Suit HAL, we assume that the mechanical angle stoppers and appropriate assembling are inherent safety measures for the W2ARs. These measures prevent the hazardous situations: excess assistance and collision with floor or wall. In this paper, we develop the testing machines to prove their strength. They have the weights imitating a leg or a whole body and simulate cyclic impulsive load during walking by exploiting free fall. We hope this paper helps to develop safer W2ARs and to establish safety standards of the W2ARs.
