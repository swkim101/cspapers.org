In this paper we present PaCCSS–IT, a Parallel Corpus of Complex–Simple Sentences for ITalian. To build the resource we develop a new method for automatically acquiring a corpus of complex–simple paired sentences able to intercept structural transformations and particularly suitable for text simpliﬁcation. The method requires a wide amount of texts that can be easily extracted from the web making it suitable also for less–resourced languages. We test it on the Italian language making available the biggest Italian corpus for automatic text simpliﬁcation.
