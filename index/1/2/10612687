This paper presents a general approach to parallelizing direct method circuit simulation. The approach extracts parallel tasks at the algorithmic level for each compute-intensive module and therefore is suitable for a wide range of shared-memory multiprocessors. The implementation of the approach in SPICE2 resulted in a portable parallel direct circuit simulator, PARASPICE. The superior performance of PARASPICE is demonstrated on an 8-CE Alliant FX/80 using a number of benchmark circuits.
