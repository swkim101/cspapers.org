This keynote presentation will focus on the challenges and opportunities imposed on mobility and wireless communications technologies by the emerging and explosive needs of the future Internet of Things. As traditional (wireless) networking meets the "real world", with its highly mobile requirements, its noisy and lossy environments, its need to optimize communications across multiple, non-homogeneous wireless technologies, with often intermittent connectivity, its requirements for more deterministic exchanges, the urgent need of innovation and accelerated research into a number of relevant and exiting domains become apparent. We will describe the ICT Infrastructure developments needed to support these new requirements, and identify broad open mobility and wireless research topics, which may help catalyze innovation affecting our industry. In particular, among other topics, we will deal with the issue of IP mobility, and will discuss technologies responding to these requirements (LISP among them). We will then consider the need to support and manage non-homogeneous, multi-homed, highly lossy wireless connectivity, and will highlight the potential roles of Distributed Computing and of Network Coding in this domain. Finally, we will detail the deterministic networking requirements arising in a number of Internet of Things verticals, and highlight progress towards the definition and standardization of techniques enabling more predictable exchanges even in wireless networks.
