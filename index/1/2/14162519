We present a real-time system for 3D head pose estimation and facial landmark localization using a commodity depth sensor. We introduce a novel triangular surface patch (TSP) descriptor, which encodes the shape of the 3D surface of the face within a triangular area. The proposed descriptor is viewpoint invariant, and it is robust to noise and to variations in the data resolution. Using a fast nearest neighbor lookup, TSP descriptors from an input depth map are matched to the most similar ones that were computed from synthetic head models in a training phase. The matched triangular surface patches in the training set are used to compute estimates of the 3D head pose and facial landmark positions in the input depth map. By sampling many TSP descriptors, many votes for pose and landmark positions are generated which together yield robust final estimates. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available Biwi Kinect Head Pose Database to compare it against state-of-the-art methods. Our results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of both pose and landmark location estimates while maintaining real-time speed.
