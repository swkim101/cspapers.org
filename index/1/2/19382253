This paper shows propose the inexpensive and flexible carrier system with the AGV (automated guided vehicle) which is practical in the manufacturing process, making use of IDC (Intelligent Data Career) with the big capacity data and two-way communications. The characteristics of this system are "the simple and easy change of AGV route and number", "easily coexistence with a person". In order to verify the possibility of the system realization, we developed an algorithm of AGV traffic rule on our new concept and confirmed the effect of proposal system by computer simulation.
