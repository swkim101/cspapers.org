GOLDIE is a system that has been developed to provide the top-down control of the low and intermediate level processes that create and modify the intermediate-level descriptions of image data used in image interpretation. The basic control structure of GOLDIE is the schema, a declarative specification of control strategies invoked in response to a request (goal) for a particular form of intermediate-level data. Using this control paradigm, high-level interpretation processes gain the ability to create or refine the intermediate-level data according to pre-defined goals and/or current hypotheses during interpretation. A variety of schemas for tasks such as region segmentation, line extraction, collinear line grouping, and line-based segmentation are currently implemented within the GOLDIE system.
