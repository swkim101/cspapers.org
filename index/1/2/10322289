Over the past decade, empirical methods have gained acceptance for validating tools and methods in software research. This tutorial aims at acquainting participants with the main methods used in empirical work in software research, enabling them to evaluate empirical results for validity as well as providing the basis for carrying out empirical studies. A wide range of empirical approaches are covered, including case studies, experiments, field studies, and surveys. These approaches are introduced by prominent examples from the software engineering literature. Common pitfalls are pointed out. Participants also critique empirical papers in small discussion groups, based on worksheets with prepared questions.
