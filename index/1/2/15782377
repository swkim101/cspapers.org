A fundamental task of data analysis is comprehending what distinguishes clusters found within the data. We present the problem of mining distinguishing sets; which seeks to find sets of objects or attributes that induce the most incremental change between adjacent bi-clusters of a binary dataset. Viewing the lattice of bi-clusters formed within a data set as a weighted directed graph, we mine the most significant distinguishing sets by growing a maximal-cost spanning tree of the lattice.
