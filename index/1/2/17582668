A reconfigurable robot society built from scratch with LEGO Mindstorms was presented at the IJCAI 2009. This paper describes the robots as well as the algorithms developed over the last few months. A leader selection as well as a formation for area coverage algorithm were tested and presented at the conference. For localization a birds-eye-view camera system based on reacTIvision fiducial markers is used.
