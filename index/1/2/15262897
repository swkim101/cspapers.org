Transforming a natural language (NL) question into a corresponding logical form (LF) is central to the knowledge-based question answering (KB-QA) task. Unlike most previous methods that achieve this goal based on mappings between lexicalized phrases and logical predicates, this paper goes one step further and proposes a novel embedding-based approach that maps NL-questions into LFs for KBQA by leveraging semantic associations between lexical representations and KBproperties in the latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms three KB-QA baseline methods on two publicly released QA data sets.
