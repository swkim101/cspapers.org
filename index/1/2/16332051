The way people create and share content has radically changed in the past few years thanks to the advent of social networks, web communities, blogs, wikis, and other online collaborative media. Such online social data are continuously growing in a way that makes it difficult to efficiently aggregate them, since they are the expression of a multitude of single content creators that most of the times show only a small percentage of originality. The act of 'sharing' is still tied to a pre-Internet fashion that sees it as a step following (and never preceding) content creation, as enforced by the rules of publishing and copyright. In the Internet era, the pieces of the puzzle of a valuable work might be scattered throughout the whole Web. In order to hinder the obsolete create-then-share trend that is killing creativity and usefulness of the Web, we propose a novel concept of copyright, which allows content to be shared while being created, in a way that they can gain increasing value as they become part of an increasingly richer puzzle.
