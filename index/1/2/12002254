This paper proposes a method of determining two pairs of vanishing points from an H-pattern, which consists of two parallel lines and another line perpendicular to the two, in a spherical image. In contrast to the conventional methods which determine a vanishing point (a pair of vanishing points at a spherical image) from a group of parallel lines, the proposed method first determines a pair of vanishing points by the two parallel lines and then compute the other pair of vanishing points from the remaining line in terms of the inherent relation of the H-pattern. The experimental result of estimating the pose of a camera mounted at the rear of a vehicle is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
