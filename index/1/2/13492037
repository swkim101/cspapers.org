Statistically independent features can be extracted by finding a factorial representation of a signal distribution. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accomplishes this for linear correlated and Gaussian distributed signals. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), formalized by Comon (1994), extracts features in the case of linear statistical dependent but not necessarily Gaussian distributed signals. Nonlinear Component Analysis finally should find a factorial representation for nonlinear statistical dependent distributed signals. This paper proposes for this task a novel feed-forward, information conserving, nonlinear map - the explicit symplectic transformations. It also solves the problem of non-Gaussian output distributions by considering single coordinate higher order statistics.
