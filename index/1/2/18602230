Multipath routing in WSN has been a long wish in security scenario where nodes on next-hop may be targeted to compromise. Many proposals of Multipath routing has been proposed in ADHOC Networks but under constrained from keying environment most seems ignorant. In WSN where crucial data is reported by nodes in deployment area to their securely located Sink, route security has to be guaranteed. Under dynamic load and selective attacks, availability of multiple secure paths is a boon and increases the attacker efforts by many folds. We propose to build a subset of neighbors as our front towards destination node. We also identified forwarders for query by base station. The front is optimally calculated to maintain the security credential and avail multiple paths. According to our knowledge ours is first secure multipath routing protocol for WSN. We established effectiveness of our proposal with mathematical analysis
