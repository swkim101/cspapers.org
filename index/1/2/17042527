Four techniques for performing a compound drawing/color selection task were studied: one unimanual, one bimanual where different hands controlled independent subtasks, and two bimanual, where the action of the right hand depended on that of the left. We call these latter two “asymmernc dependent.” Since they closely conform to everyday bimanual tasks, we predict they would give rise to the best performance. One, called Toolglass, did. The reasons and implications for design are discussed. These are contrasted with other kinds of two-handed techniques, and it is shown below how, if designed inappropriately, two hands can be worse than one.
