A new interface paradigm is required for effective supervisory control of multiple unmanned vehicles by a single operator. A temporal-based display is potentially useful for these time-critical cognitively demanding task environments. However, designs of candidate temporal interfaces for unmanned vehicles have been limited and related publications have not described the approaches used by computer scientists in the development of these interfaces. Recently, a temporal display was designed and implemented that will soon undergo extensive evaluation. This paper documents the design decisions made in the course of developing this interface in regards to the underlying temporal data structures and how they are organized and updated. 1
