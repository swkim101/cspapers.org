This paper describes a tool for characterizing the TCP behavior of a remote host on the Internet. The tool allows the researcher to manipulate TCP communication with a remote TCP. The specific goal in building this tool was to answer the question “What fraction of web servers use NewReno instead of Reno or Tahoe TCP congestion control mechanisms, for TCP connections with non-Sack-enabled clients”. The more general goal was to provide a tool for efficiently probing the TCP congestion control behaviors of remote hosts in the Internet. This paper describes both TBIT (the TCP Behavior identification Tool) and our specific results about the TCP congestion control behaviors of major web servers. Both TBIT and the experimental results are available from the TBIT Web Page [TBI]. The tool uses some of the code developed by the Sting project [Sav99].
