This paper presents a novel, fully data-driven, and knowledge-grounded neural conversation model aimed at producing more contentful responses.  We generalize the widely-used Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) approach by conditioning responses on both conversation history and external “facts”, allowing the model to be versatile and applicable in an open-domain setting.  Our approach yields significant improvements over a competitive Seq2Seq baseline. Human judges found that our outputs are significantly more informative.
