Since the introduction of microblogging services, there has been a continuous growth of short-text social networking on the Internet. With the generation of large amounts of microposts, there is a need for effective categorization and search of the data. Twitter, one of the largest microblogging sites, allows users to make use of hashtags to categorize their posts. However, the majority of tweets do not contain tags, which hinders the quality of the search results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for unsupervised and content-based hashtag recommendation for tweets. Our approach relies on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the underlying topic assignment of language classified tweets. The advantage of our approach is the use of a topic distribution to recommend general hashtags.
