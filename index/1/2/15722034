User-generated content is becoming increasingly valuable to both individuals and businesses due to its usefulness and influence in e-commerce markets. As consumers rely more on such information, posting deceptive opinions, which can be deliberately used for potential profit, is becoming more of an issue. Existing work on opinion spam detection focuses mainly on linguistic features such as n-grams, syntactic patterns, or LIWC. However, deep semantic analysis remains largely unstudied. In this paper, we propose a frame-based deep semantic analysis method for understanding rich characteristics of deceptive and truthful opinions written by various types of individuals including crowdsourcing workers, employees who have expert-level domain knowledge about local businesses, and online users who post on Yelp and TripAdvisor. Using our proposed semantic frame feature, we developed a classification model that outperforms the baseline model and achieves an accuracy of nearly 91%. Also, we performed qualitative analysis of deceptive and truthful review datasets and considered their semantic differences. Finally, we successfully found some interesting features that existing methods were unable to identify.
