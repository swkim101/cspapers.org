New placement techniques are presented which substantially improve the process of automatic layout generation of analog IC's. Extremely tight specifications can be enforced on high-performance analog circuits by using simultaneous placement and module optimization. An algorithmic approach to module generation provides alternative sets of modules optimized with respect to area and performance but equivalent in terms of parasitics and topology. The final module selection is performed during the placement phase, based on Simulated Annealing. The flexibility of the annealing algorithm has been significantly improved, thus making it possible to more efficiently exploit the tradeoffs between area, parasitics and matching.
