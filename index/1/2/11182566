Efficient processing of tera-scale text data is an important research topic. This paper proposes lossless compression of N-gram language models based on LOUDS, a succinct data structure. LOUDS succinctly represents a trie with M nodes as a 2M + 1 bit string. We compress it further for the N-gram language model structure. We also use 'variable length coding' and 'block-wise compression' to compress values associated with nodes. Experimental results for three large-scale N-gram compression tasks achieved a significant compression rate without any loss.
