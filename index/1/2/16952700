This paper describes the architecture and prototype of a system which dynamically determines how to present information to a user. The system utilizes a rule based approach to select one or more modalities for presenting information. Next the system determines one or more techniques to present the information within each of the previously selected modalities. This system also adapts to individual users providing flexibility not found in traditional presentation systems. Finally, models are used for storing knowledge about the user resulting in a system which can be easily enhanced as new data is obtained and can adapt to the needs of its users.
