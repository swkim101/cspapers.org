GeoSensor is a novel system that enriches change detection over satellite images with event detection over news items and social media content. GeoSensor faces the major challenges of Big Data: volume (a single satellite image may be a few GBs), variety (its data sources include two different types of satellite images and various types of user-generated content) and veracity, as the accuracy of the end result is crucial for the usefulness of our system. To overcome these three challenges, while offering on-line functionality, GeoSensor comprises a complex architecture that is based on the open-source platform developed in the H2020 project Big Data Europe. Through the presented demonstration, both the effectiveness and the efficiency of GeoSensor's functionalities are highlighted.
