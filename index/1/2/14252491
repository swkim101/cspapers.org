In this video we demonstrate a novel system which allows wireless full-body interaction between a human participant and a graphical world inhabited by autonomous agents. The system is called "ALIVE", an acronym for Artificial Life Interactive Video Environment. The goal of ALIVE is to present a virtual environment in which a user can interact, in natural and believable ways, with autonomous semi-intelligent agents whose behavior is equally natural and believable.
