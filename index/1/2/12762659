I will address the questions posed to the panel from wlthln the context of a project at SRI, TEAM [Grosz, 1982b], that is developing techniques for transportable natural-language interfaces. The goal of transportability is to enable nonspeciallsts to adapt a natural-language processing system for access to an existing conventional database. TEAM is designed to interact with two different kinds of users. During an acquisition dlalogue, a database expert (DBE) provides TEAM with information about the files and fields in the conventlonal database for which a natural-language interface is desired. (Typlcally this database already exists and is populated, but TEAM also provides facillties for creating small local databases.) This dlalogue results in extension of the language-processlng and data access components that make it possible for an end user to query the new database in natural language.
