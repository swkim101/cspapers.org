Measurement of ground contact forces (GCF) provides necessary information to detect human gait phases. In this paper, a new analysis method of the GCF signals is discussed for detection of the gait phases. Human gaits are complicated, and the gait phases can not be exactly distinguished by comparing sensor outputs to a threshold. This paper mainly discusses how to detect the gait phases continuously and smoothly. The proposed analysis method is intended for applications to power assistive devices for patients, as well as diagnostics of pathological gait. Smooth and continuous detection of the gait phases enables a full use of information obtained from GCF sensors. For experimental verification, smart shoes have been developed. Each smart shoe has four GCF sensors embedded between the cushion pad and the sole. The performances are experimentally verified for both normal and abnormal gaits, and a means for quantification of abnormalities in the gait is also introduced in this paper.
