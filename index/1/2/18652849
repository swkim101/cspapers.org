Previously, we proposed a scheme that determines the position of a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) from the signal strengths of commercial radio-frequency sensors and antennas. This scheme provides accurate position information in a structured environment but is limited to two-dimensional (2D) environments because the radiation power of the antenna depends on the elevation angle between the sending and receiving antennas. To overcome this problem, we propose a 3D localization scheme that considers the electromagnetic (EM) wave attenuation over the range of reliable elevation angles. In order to determine the reliable elevation scope, we analyzed the radiation patterns of dipole antennas. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in distance estimation and 3D localization experiments by varying the distance and elevation angle. Encouraged by these results, we constructed an underwater wireless sensor network in the experimental basin, and performed ROV position tracking with the depth sensor. The scheme achieved reliable localization accuracy at a fast sampling rate, demonstrating the feasibility of exploiting EM wave attenuation in localization.
