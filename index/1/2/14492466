Digital simulation is defined as the process of exercising a realistic software model of a digital system, with sets of input stimuli, to generate signal behavior versus time. Simulation processes can be categorized by their simulation atom. Gate-level simulation 1,2,3,4 is simply one in which the atoms of simulation are gates. Functional simulation 5,6,7,8 simulates larger units, such as adders, decoders, registers, etc.
 It appears that gate-level simulators can perform accurate simulation4, 9. However, they present some operational limitations, such as the maximum number of gates that can be simulated. Further- more, the host computer time often becomes intolerable for large nets. An additional problem is encountered when the logical net is encoded for input to the simulator. Clerical errors in encoding the net, and their detection and correction, can cause costly delays. Finally, for gate-level simulators, MSI-LSI functional modules must be expanded to a gate-level description. The logical solution to the above limitations is the use of functional simulation techniques.
