In this talk I introduce cloud computing based cross-media knowledge discovery. We propose a framework for cross-media semantic understanding which contains discriminative modeling, generative modeling and cognitive modeling. In cognitive modeling a new model entitled CAM is proposed which is suitable for cross-media semantic understanding. We develop an agent-aid model for load balance in cloud computing environment. For quality of service we present a utility function to evaluate the cloud performance. A Cross-Media Intelligent Retrieval System (CMIRS), which is managed by ontology-based knowledge system KMSphere, will be illustrated. Finally, the directions for further researches on cloud computing based cross-media knowledge discovery will be pointed out and discussed.
