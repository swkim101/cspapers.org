HTTP/2 (h2) was standardized in 2015 as an improvement to HTTP/1.1 (h1) to achieve faster webpage load times (PLTs) [5]. Previous studies have shown both improvement and degradation in PLT when using h2 with respect to h1 [6, 8]. The disagreement about h2 performance from these studies motivates further investigation as to whether and under what conditions h2 brings the performance benefits that were originally envisioned [5].
