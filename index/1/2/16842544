We study the following fundamental problem in computational molecular biology: Given a set of DNA sequences representing some species and a phylogenetic tree depicting the ancestral relationship among these species, compute an optimal alignment oft he sequences by the means of constructing a minimum-cost evolutionary tree. The problem is an important variant of multiple sequence alignment, and is widely known as tree alignment. A more generalized version of the problem, called generalized trâ€™ee alignment in this paper, is that we are given the DNA sequences only and still have to construct a minimum-cost evolutionary tree. The paper presents some hardness results as well as approximation algorithms. It is shown that tree alignment is NP-hard and generalized tree alignment is MAX SNP-hard. On the positive side, we design an etiicient approximation algorithm with performance ratio 2 for tree alignment. The algorithm is then extended to a polynomialtime approximation scheme. The construction actually works for Steiner trees in any metric space, and thus implies a polynomial-time approximation scheme for planar Steiner trees under a given topology (with any constant degree). To our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time approximation scheme in the fields of computational biology and Steiner trees.

The approximation algorithms may be useful in evolutionary genetics practice as they can provide a good initial alignment for the iterative method in [24].
