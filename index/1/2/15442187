This work deals with issues of interactive debugging for the concurrent language ECSP. The debugger matches a formal specification of the expected behavior of a program against its actual behaviour. This specification can be given at different levels of abstraction. Control is returned to the user when an error is detected. The user can then modify the flow of the computation and/or dynamically change the specification of the expected behavior. The debugger implementation is based on program transformation techniques.
