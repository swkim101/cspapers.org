We present the architecture of our web question answering (fact seeking) system and introduce a novel algorithm to validate semantic categories of the expected answers. When tested on the questions used by the prior research, our system demonstrated the performance comparable to the current state of the art systems. Our semantic verification algorithm has improved the accuracy of answers of the affected questions by 30%.
