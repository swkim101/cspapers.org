We describe a general framework for online adaptation of optimization hyperparameters by `hot swapping' their values during learning. We investigate this approach in the context of adaptive learning rate selection using an explore-exploit strategy from the multi-armed bandit literature. Experiments on a benchmark neural network show that the hot swapping approach leads to consistently better solutions compared to well-known alternatives such as AdaDelta and stochastic gradient with exhaustive hyperparameter search.
