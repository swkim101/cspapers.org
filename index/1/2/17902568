The timed Petri net model introduces the possibility of applying a set of mathematical results, mainly based on the use of max-plus algebra, for performance analysis. This paper aims to build a new scheduling method for a flexible manufacturing work-cell by merging the timed Petri net model and max-plus algebra. The results can be computed as functions of a certain set of decision parameters. These functions can be used to schedule, plan and control the flexible manufacturing work-cell, so that it can real-timely adapt itself to machine faults.
