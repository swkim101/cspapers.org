We combine techniques of XML Mining and Text Mining for the benefit of Information Retrieval. By manipulating the word sequence according to the XML structure of the marked-up text, we strengthen phrase boundaries so that they are more obvious to the algorithms that extract multiword sequences from text. Consequently, the quality of the indexed phrases improves, which has a positive effect on the average precision measured by the INEX 2007 standards.
