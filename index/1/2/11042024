(MATH) In the bounded-storage model for information-theoretically secure encryption and key-agreement one can prove the security of a cipher based on the sole assumption that the adversary's storage capacity is bounded, say by s bits, even if her computational power is unlimited. Assume that a random t-bit string R is either publicly available (e.g. the signal of a deep space radio source) or broadcast by one of the legitimate parties. If s$xi;t, the adversary can store only partial information about R. The legitimate sender Alice and receiver Bob, sharing a short secret key K initially, can therefore potentially generate a very long n-bit one-time pad X with n»|K| about which the adversary has essentially no information, thus at first glance apparently contradicting Shannon's bound on the key size of a perfect cipher.All previous results in the bounded-storage model were partial or far from optimal, for one of the following reasons: either the secret key K had in fact to be longer than the derived one-time pad, or t had to be extremely large (tρns), or the adversary was assumed to be able to store only actual bits of R rather than arbitrary s bits of information about R, or the adversary could obtain a non-negligible amount of information about X.In this paper we prove the first non-restricted security result in the bounded-storage model, exploiting the full potential of the model: K is short, X is very long (e.g. gigabytes), t needs to be only moderately larger than s, and the security proof is optimally strong. In fact, we prove that s/t can be arbitrarily close to 1 and hence the storage bound is essentially optimal.
