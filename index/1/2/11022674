Reactive deliberation is a novel robot architecture that has been designed to overcome some of the problems posed by dynamic robot environments. It is argued that the problem of action selection in nontrivial domains cannot be intelligently resolved without attention to detailed planning. Experimental evidence is provided that the goals and actions of a robot must be evaluated at a rate commensurate with changes in the environment. The goal-oriented behaviours of reactive deliberation are a useful abstraction that allow sharing of scarce computational resources and effective goal-arbitration through inter-behaviour bidding. The effectiveness of reactive deliberation has been demonstrated through a tournament of one-on-one soccer games between real-world robots. Soccer is a dynamic environment; the locations of the ball and the robots are constantly changing. The results suggest that the architectural elements in reactive deliberation are sufficient for real-time intelligent control in dynamic environments.
