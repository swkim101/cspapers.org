We describe an experience using online multimedia instruction and just-in-time teaching in an introductory programming course. Survey data has shown that students are strongly in favour of the approach. A series of screencasts was developed to replace the traditional lecture component of the course. Students were asked to review a small number of screencasts before each class and were assessed on their comprehension at the start of class using a series of "clicker" questions. A just-in-time mini-lecture was provided in response to the initial assessment, on an as-needed basis. The remaining class time was devoted to small-group exercises.
