We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative goal. We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal. We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal. We show empirically that our approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally matches or surpasses the state of the art. Further, we show that our approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals, including negated goals.
