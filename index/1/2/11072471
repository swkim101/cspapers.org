Recent research suggests children with autism show certain positive social behaviors while interacting with robots without the presence of peer pressure. This paper explores possible use of interactive robots for interaction with children with autism. Logical artificial intelligence, reasoning about beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI model) serve as a basis to construct a set of scenarios. The present invention also describes a novel real-world motivated learning method. It uses a supervised reinforcement learning approach combined with goal creating. Autonomous agent learns problems in the real world through interaction with the patient. Methods and systems for management of brain and body functions and sensory perception, observing/analyzing, interactive behavior are presented. In one instance, the virtual agent is integrated with a computer-aided system for diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy.
