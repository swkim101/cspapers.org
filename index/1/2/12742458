Nilsson's Probabilistic Logic is a set theoretic mechanism for reasoning with uncertainty. We propose a new way of looking at the probability constraints enforced by the framework, which allows the expert to include conditional probabilities in the semantic tree, thus making Probabilistic Logic more expressive. An algorithm is presented which will find the maximum entropy point probability for a rule of entailment without resorting to solution by iterative approximation. The algorithm works for both the propositional and the predicate logic. Also presented are a number of methods for employing the conditional probabilities.
