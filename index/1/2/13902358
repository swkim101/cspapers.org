Glue is a procedural language for deductive databases. It is designed to complement the purely declarative NAIL! language, firstly by performing system functions impossible to write in NAIL!, and secondly by allowing the procedural specification of algorithms for critical code sections. The two languages together are sufficient to write a complete application. Glue was designed to be as close to NAIL! as possible, hence minimizing the impedance mismatch problem. In this paper we concentrate on Glue. Pseudo-higher order programming is used in both languages, in the style of HiLog [1]. In particular Glue-Nail can handle set valued attributes (non1NF schemas) in a clean and efficient manner. NAIL! code is compiled into Glue code, simplifying the system design. An experimental implementation has been written, a more efficient version is under design.
