In this work, we describe our approach for making the interactive data exploration system, called XmdvTool, quality-aware to assure informed decision-making. XmdvToolQ, makes quality or lack thereof explicit for all stages of the data exploration process from raw data, to abstracted data, to the final visual displays, allowing users to query and navigate through data-, structure- and quality-spaces.
