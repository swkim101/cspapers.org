A well-known result of Tarjan states that for all n and m n there exists a sequence of n&1 Union and m Find operations that needs at least 0(m .:(m, n)) execution steps on a pointer machine that satisfies the separation condition. Later the bound was extended to 0(n+m .:(m, n)) for all m and n. In this paper we prove that this bound holds on a general pointer machine without the separation condition and we prove that the same bound holds for the Split Find problem as well. ] 1996 Academic Press, Inc.
