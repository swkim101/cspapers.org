The aim of this paper is to present a new method for identifying linguistic structure in the aggregate analysis of the language variation. The method consists of extracting the most frequent sound correspondences from the aligned transcriptions of words. Based on the extracted correspondences every site is compared to all other sites, and a correspondence index is calculated for each site. This method enables us to identify sound alternations responsible for dialect divisions and to measure the extent to which each alternation is responsible for the divisions obtained by the aggregate analysis.
