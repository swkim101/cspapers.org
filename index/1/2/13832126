In this paper, we present a new scalar architecture for high-speed vector processing. Without using cache memory, the proposed architecture tolerates main memory access latency by introducing slide-windowed floating-point registers with data preloading feature and pipelined memory. The architecture can hold upward compatibility with existing scalar architectures. In the new architecture, software can control the window structure. This is the advantage compared with our previous work of register-windows. Because of this advantage, registers are utilized more flexibly and computational efficiency is largely enhanced. Furthermore, this flexibility helps the compiler to generate efficient object codes easily.
We have evaluated its performance on Livermore Fortran Kernels. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture reduces the penalty of main memory access better than an ordinary scalar processor and a processor with cache prefetching. The proposed architecture with 64 registers tolerates memory access latency of 30 CPU cyles. Compared with our previous work, the proposed architecture hides longer memory access latency with fewer registers.
