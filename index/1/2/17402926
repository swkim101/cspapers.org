A mathematical model is developed to determine the probability of successful transmission of a packet over a fading land mobile data channel.
 The model is further extended to packet radio channels and the throughput degradation of three random access schemes is analyzed. A relationship between throughput degradation and distance from the base station is finally derived and numerical results presented.
