This paper describes a rapid prototyping system for physical interaction devices in immersive virtual environments. Because of the increased complexity of 3D interactive environments and the lack of standard interactive tools, designers are unable to use traditional 2D hardware in 3D virtual environments, As a result, designers must create entirely new interaction devices, a both slow and expensive process. We propose a system which allows hardware designers to experiment with the construction of new 3D interaction devices both quickly and inexpensively.
