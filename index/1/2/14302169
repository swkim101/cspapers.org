This paper describes a facility for integrated hardware and software development in the microprocessor area by graduate students. The constraints of a low budget, the necessity of providing fast turn-around time for software development, and tightly scheduled laboratory sessions, all of which are necessary in a university environment, precluded the use of methods such as primitive handtranslation of code (too slow), separate floppy-based development systems (too expensive) and in-circuit emulators (too expensive). The result was a hierarchical network of microprocessors whose design and development is described in detail. Experience with its operation and the applicability of the system for more general use is also discussed.
