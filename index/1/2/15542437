In this paper, we consider various spatial relationships that are of general interest in pictorial database systems. We present a set of rules that allow us to deduce new relationships from a given set of relationships. A deductive mechanism using these rules can be used in query processing systems that retrieve pictures by content. The given set of rules are shown to be sound, i.e. the deductions are logically correct. The rules are also shown to be complete for three dimensional systems, i.e. every relationship which is implied by a given consistent set of relationships F is deducible from F using the given rules. In addition, we show that the given set of rules is incomplete for two dimensional systems.
