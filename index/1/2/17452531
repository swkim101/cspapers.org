XML has emerged as an important standard for data integration. Despite the importance of XML, the development of XML processing applications in object-oriented programming languages such as Java can be tedious. Programmers use low-level APIs such as DOM, which provide minimal support for ensuring that programs that process XML are correct with respect to the XML Schemas governing the XML data. Furthermore, the runtime performance of XML processing is a limitation of XML. Runtime libraries do not take advantage of static analysis of programs or XML Schema information to optimize accesses to XML data. XJ [2] is a research language that integrates XML as a first-class construct into Java (a prototype is available for download from http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/ xj). Salient features of XJ include:
