Rounds and fillets are important design features. We introduce a new point-based method for constant radius rounding and filleting. Based on the mathematical definitions of offsetting operations, discrete offsetting operations are introduced. Steps of our approach are discussed and analyzed. The methodology has been implemented and tested. We present the experimental results on accuracy, memory and running time for various input geometries and radius. Based on the test results, the method is very robust for all kinds of geometries.Copyright Â© 2005 by ASME
