Passages can be hidden within a text to circumvent their disallowed transfer. Such release of compartmentalized information is of concern to all corporate and governmental organization. We explore the methodology to detect such hidden passages within a document. A document is divided into passages using various document splitting techniques, and a text classifier is used to categorize such passages. We present a novel document splitting technique called dynamic windowing, which significantly improves precision, recall and F1 measure.
