In this poster, we propose a new tool, i.e. a node placement adviser, which supports deployment workers of sensor networks. The adviser tool is realized in the form of mobile terminal software and acts as a proxy of an additional node, as well as communicating with those already placed. Based on the communication results, it indicates how favorable the current location is to a worker.
