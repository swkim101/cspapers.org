In this paper we investigate the applicability of different methods for dynamic updating to component-oriented embedded systems. The systems for dynamic updating that exist today vary widely in method, conception and applicability. After reviewing the state-of-the-art, common problems in the domain of live updating are given and the solutions that currently available systems provide are discussed. We summarize this discussion in an overview table. Then we discuss to what extent existing methods for dynamic updating are suitable for component-oriented embedded systems and examine whether it is desirable to modify available techniques to update those systems.
