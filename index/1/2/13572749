This paper addresses integrated circuit (IC) security issues by using supply voltage based gate-level characterization (GLC). Our GLC scheme is capable of characterizing both manifestation and physical level properties of an IC accurately using variable supply voltage. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme can detect three types of IC attacks with low false positives and false negatives.
