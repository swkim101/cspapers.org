Combining the principle of Differential Latent Semantic Index (DLSI) (Chen et al., 2001) and the Template Matching Technique (Tokuda and Chen, 2001), we propose a new user queries-based patent document retrieval system by NLP technology. The DLSI method first narrows down the search space of a sought-after patent document by content search and the template matching technique then pins down the documents by exploiting the words-based template matching scheme by syntactic search. Compared with the synonymous search scheme by thesaurus dictionaries, the new method results in an improved overall retrieval efficiency of patent documents.
