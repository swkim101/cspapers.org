Improving studentsâ€™ understanding of software engineering concepts and increasing the productivity of softwaze engineers requires new ways of thlnklng and reasoning about software and better ways of producing it. To gain intellectual control over the software development process and become more productive and efficient, we encourage the use of formal methods. The use of formal methods requires that students be educated and software engineers be trained. We make a distinction between education and training. Educ~ tion is the long term goal designed to build a foundation of knowledge for the students while training is a short term activity designed for software engineers. The challenge to educators is to provide the appropriate foundation for software engineering students. This issue is discussed in the paper.
