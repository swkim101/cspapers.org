We present a new approach to the computational differential geometry of curves, with applications to shape analysis and the discovery and recognition of objects in images. The main idea is to specify a space of curves with constraints suited to the application, and exploit the differential geometry of this space to solve optimization and inference problems. Applications of this approach include the statistical analysis of planar shapes, curve interpolations with elasticae and local elasticae, and the Bayesian discovery of contours of objects in noisy images.
