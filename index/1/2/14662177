Forwarding in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) is a challenging problem. We focus on the specific issue of forwarding in an environment where mobile devices are carried by people in a restricted physical space (a conference) and contact patterns are not predictable. We show for the first time a path explosion phenomenon between most pairs of nodes. This means that, once the first path reaches the destination, the number of subsequent paths grows rapidly with time, so there usually exist many near-optimal paths. We study the path explosion phenomenon both analytically and empirically. Our results highlight the importance of unequal contact rates across nodes for understanding the performance of forwarding algorithms. We also find that a variety of well-known forwarding algorithms show surprisingly similar performance in our setting and we interpret this fact in light of the path explosion phenomenon.
