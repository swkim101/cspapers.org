An increasing number of temporally versioned text collections is available today with Web archives being a prime example. Search on such collections, however, is often not satisfactory and ignores their temporal dimension completely. Time-travel text search solves this problem by evaluating a keyword query on the state of the text collection as of a user-specified time point. This work demonstrates our approach to efficient time-travel text search and its implementation in the FLUXCAPACITOR prototype.
