This paper presents a new method for estimating which outlet an electrical appliance is plugged into by using the electrical wiring installed in the building. By making use of the voltage drop caused by the wire, we can estimate the distance between the sensor and an electrical appliance plugged into an outlet on an electrical circuit. If we have a floor plan of an environment of interest showing a wiring diagram and where a sensor is attached, we can determine which outlet an electrical appliance is plugged into from the distance between the sensor and the appliance. The estimated outlet position of an appliance is very useful for understanding real-world events and developing real-world applications, e.g., providing user location and appliance location aware services, daily activity recognition, and estimating a user's indoor location through electrical appliance use under specific conditions.
