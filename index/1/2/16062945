Evaluation of user interfaces in the early stages of design process requires the use of simulations or prototypes. However, building prototypes with extensive functionality could take up lot of time and efforts. Several strategies can be adopted to cut down the complexity of prototypes. Nielsen [2] introduced two kinds of prototypes namely horizontal prototypes that include various system features and vertical prototypes that reduce the number of features but implement the full functionality of those features chosen. Virzi [3] proposed a third dimension similarity of interaction to Nielsen's model. Similarity essentially means the proximity of the prototype to the actual system and takes into account any distortions created due to prototyping tools, representation etc.
