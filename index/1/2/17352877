Visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as a novel form of near-field communication, and it offers a user-friendly, infrastructure-less and secure communication, which is highly competitive for one-time file transfer [1 - 4]. However, the limitations of smart devices and the uncertainty of user behaviors seriously impair the transmission reliability and hinder its applicability. Worse still, existing approaches [1, 2, 4]mostly focus on improving the transmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability. Hence, RDCode is proposed to boost the throughput over screen-camera links, by making use of a novel barcode design and several effective techniques to enhance the transmission reliability. In this demo, we show that our RDCode prototype system addresses many practical challenges. A short video on our prototype system is accessible from http://mashuai.buaa.edu.cn/demo/RDCode.mp4.
