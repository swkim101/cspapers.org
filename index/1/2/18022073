The PPDB is an automatically built database which contains millions of paraphrases in different languages. Paraphrases in this resource are associated with features that serve to their ranking and reﬂect paraphrase quality. This context-unaware ranking captures the semantic similarity of paraphrases but cannot serve to estimate their adequacy in speciﬁc contexts. We propose to use vector-space semantic models for selecting PPDB paraphrases that preserve the meaning of speciﬁc text fragments. This is the ﬁrst work that addresses the substitutability of PPDB paraphrases in context. We show that vector-space models of meaning can be successfully applied to this task and increase the beneﬁt brought by the use of the PPDB resource in applications.
