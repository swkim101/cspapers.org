Existing geographic face routing algorithms use planarization techniques that rely on the unit-graph assumption, and thus can exhibit persistent routing failure when used with real radios, whose connectivity violates that assumption. In this paper, we describe the Cross-Link Detection Protocol (CLDP), which enables provably correct geographic routing on arbitrary graphs. Our simulations show that the protocol is practical: it incurs low overhead and exhibits low path stretch in wireless networks.
