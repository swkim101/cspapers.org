The folksonomies built from the large-scale social annotations made by collaborating users are perfect data sources for bootstrapping Semantic Web applications. In this paper, we develop an ontology induction approach to harvest the emergent semantics from the folksonomies. We propose a latent subsumption hierarchy model to uncover the implicit structure of tag space and develop our ontology induction approach on basis of this model. We identify tag subsumptions with a set-theoretical approach and model the tag space as a tag subsumption graph. While turning this graph into a concept hierarchy, we address the problem of inconsistent subsumptions and propose a random walk based tag generality ranking procedure to settle it. We propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm utilizing the result of tag generality ranking to generate the concept hierarchy. We conduct experiments on the Delicious dataset. The results of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
