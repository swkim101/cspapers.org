We investigate the complexity of computing approximate Nash equilibria in anonymous games. Our main algorithmic result is the following: For any $n$-player anonymous game with a bounded number of strategies and any constant $\delta>0$, an $O(1/n^{1-\delta})$-approximate Nash equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time. Complementing this positive result, we show that if there exists any constant $\delta>0$ such that an $O(1/n^{1+\delta})$-approximate equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, then there is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for this problem. 
We also present a faster algorithm that, for any $n$-player $k$-strategy anonymous game, runs in time $\tilde O((n+k) k n^k)$ and computes an $\tilde O(n^{-1/3} k^{11/3})$-approximate equilibrium. This algorithm follows from the existence of simple approximate equilibria of anonymous games, where each player plays one strategy with probability $1-\delta$, for some small $\delta$, and plays uniformly at random with probability $\delta$. 
Our approach exploits the connection between Nash equilibria in anonymous games and Poisson multinomial distributions (PMDs). Specifically, we prove a new probabilistic lemma establishing the following: Two PMDs, with large variance in each direction, whose first few moments are approximately matching are close in total variation distance. Our structural result strengthens previous work by providing a smooth tradeoff between the variance bound and the number of matching moments.
