Hand-eye systems combine computer vision with kinematics and dynamics calculations to achieve dexterous manipulation. These versatile platforms for teaching robotics principles have not been widely used in undergraduate laboratories due to cost. We describe a new hand-eye system constructed from Robotis Dynamixel servos, a USB interface module, and a webcam, that can be built for under $500 and run by a PC using the Tekkotsu open source software framework. A suggested curriculum is outlined.
