We present the design, implementation, and preliminary results of PAM - a low-cost and portable personal air quality monitor that provides real-time air quality measurements for the user's immediate environment. PAM consists of a PAM client and a cloud-side PAM service. The PAM client utilizes two inexpensive dust sensors to obtain raw particulate concentration measurement, and two Arduino boards for local filtering, web services, and communication with PAM service. The cloud-side PAM service constructs a statistical model of air quality and provides PAM clients with context-dependent calibration curves. Together, PAM is able to approximate PM2.5, PM10, and AQI measurement for users in-situ and at low cost.
