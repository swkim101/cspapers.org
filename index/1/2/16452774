We describe a method for obtaining subject-dependent word sets relative to some (subject) domain. Using the subject classifications given in the machine-redable version of Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English, we established subject-dependent co-occurrence links between words of the defining vocabulary to construct these "neighborhoods". Here, we describe the application of these neighborhoods to information retrieval, and present a method of word sense disambiguation based on these co-occurrences, an extension of previous work.
