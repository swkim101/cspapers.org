Apparatus is provided for lifting a container and dumping its contents into a receptacle such as a truck body. The apparatus has a horizontal fulcrum mounted on the outside of the receptacle and an elongated frame is swingable about the fulcrum between a lowered and a raised position. Endless chains on the frame have drive sprockets coaxial with the fulcrum and hooks on the chains engage the container to first lift the same while the frame remains in its lowered position. In the lifted position of the container the hooks cooperate with abutments on the frame so that continued movement of the chains swings the frame with the container to a raised position in which contents of the container are dumped into the receptacle.
