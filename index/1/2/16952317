This paper presents an approach for computing power grasps for hands with kinematic structure similar to the human hand, which allows the implementation of strategies inspired in human grasping actions. The proposed method first samples the object surface to look for the best spots for creating an opposing grasp with two or three fingers, and then aligns the other fingers to match the local curvature of the object surface. Different grasp strategies are considered, depending on the relative size of the object with respect to the hand, and on the location of potential obstacles in the environment. Several application examples are provided with two different hand models.
