A new class of general topologies is proposed in this paper for interconnecting a large network of computers in parallel and distributed environment. These structures have been shown to possess small internode distances, fairly low number of links per node, easy message routing and large number of alternate paths that can be used in case of faults in the system. The interconnection is based on a mixed radix number system, presented in this paper. The technique results in a variety of structures for a given number of processors N, depending on the required diameter in the network.
 A bus oriented structure is also introduced here, based on the same mathematical framework. These structures possess only two I/O ports per processor and are also shown to have small internode distances.
