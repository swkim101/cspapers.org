In this paper, as one approach for mathematical analysis of evolutionary algorithms with real number chromosomes, we focus our attention on crossovers, give a general framework of the description for the change of the distribution of the population through them, and verify the properties of crossovers based on the framework. This framework includes various crossover which have been proposed and we apply our result to these crossover methods.
