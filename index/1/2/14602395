In this paper, a deterministic yaw moment controller for four wheel independent steering and drive vehicles is proposed to enhance driving stability and controllability. Different to conventional methods that track a desired yaw rate, the proposed controller stabilizes a vehicle by additionally tracking the heading angle of a vehicle which is more efficient and robust. The heading angle of a vehicle is obtained by a novel method which is based on centripetal force detection. It eliminates the prerequisite knowledge of the characteristics between wheels and road surface which are time varying and difficult to be measured in real time. The proposed system only requires low cost sensing equipment such as wheel speed sensor and accelerometer that makes the system practical to be utilized. The proposed heading angle detection method can be generally applied to any kind of vehicle. The deterministic yaw moment controller is also applicable to any type of four wheel independent drive vehicles.
