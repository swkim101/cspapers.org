We propose a new local data perturbation method called Aroma. We first show that Aroma is sound in its privacy protection. For that, we devise a realistic privacy game, called the exposure test. We prove that the αβ algorithm, a previously proposed method that is most closely related to Aroma, performs poorly under the exposure test and fails to provide sufficient privacy in practice. Moreover, any data protection method that satisfies ε-differential privacy will succeed in the test. By proving that Aroma satisfies ε-differential privacy, we show that Aroma offers strong privacy protection. We then demonstrate the utility of Aroma by proving that its estimator has significantly smaller errors than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms such as αβ, AM, and FRAPP. We carry out a systematic empirical study using real-world data to evaluate Aroma, which shows its clear advantages over previous methods.
