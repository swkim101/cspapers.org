This paper proposes a methodology for generating specialized Japanese data sets for textual entailment, which consists of pairs decomposed into basic sentence relations. We experimented with our methodology over a number of pairs taken from the RITE-2 data set. We compared our methodology with existing studies in terms of agreement, frequencies and times, and we evaluated its validity by investigating recognition accuracy.
