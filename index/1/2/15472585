Query performance is a critical factor in modern business intelligence and data warehouse systems. An increasing number of companies uses detailed analyses for conducting daily business and supporting management decisions. Thus, several techniques have been developed for achieving near realtime response times - techniques which try to alleviate I/O bottlenecks while increasing the throughputs of available processing units, i.e. by keeping relevant data in compressed main-memory data structures and exploiting the read-only characteristics of analytical workloads.
 However, update processing and skews in data distribution result in degenerations in these densely packed and highly compressed data structures affecting the memory efficiency and query performance negatively. Reorganization tasks can repair these data structures, but -- since these are usually costly operations -- require a well-considered decision which of several possible strategies should be processed and when, in order to reduce system downtimes.
 In this paper, we address these problems by presenting an approach for online reorganization in main-memory database systems (MMDBS). Based on a discussion of necessary reorganization strategies in IBM Smart Analytics Optimizer, a read optimized parallel MMDBS, we introduce a framework for executing arbitrary reorganization tasks online, i.e. in the background of normal user workloads without disrupting query results or performance.
