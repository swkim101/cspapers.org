We have investigated the deformation of a soft fingertip when it slides. This process was first simulated using the non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. Based on the results of this simulation, we designed experiments to observe the sliding and object grasping of a soft fingertip, in which a 3-DOF (degree of freedom) micro force/moment sensor was embedded. With this sensor, forces and moments acting in the fingertip are measured based on the piezoresistive effect. These measurements provide information on the status of contact and sliding of a soft fingertip on a surface. Based on these results, incipient slip, which has an important role in object gripping by a robot manipulator, can be realized. Textile's texture recognition experiments were also conducted to assess potentials of the fingertip in tactile and texture perception.
