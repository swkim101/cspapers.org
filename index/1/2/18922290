Humanoid robot is able to execute various behavior to manipulate objects because of high degree-of-freedom around the whole-body. Although hands contact with objects and exert force in ordinary pushing motion by robot, pushing motion contacting with the object at various regions of whole-body has potential for extending the scope of feasible manipulation. We derive the fundamental formulas of humanoid robot in the situation that the external force is applied to the arbitrary region of whole-body, and then propose the method to generate and execute the pushing motion based on the formulas. The proposed method is generalized for enabling to select a contact point with an object from whole-body regions and control the pushing force applied to the sensorless region. In order to verify the effectiveness, we show the experimental result that a lifesized humanoid carries large and heavy objects by pushing with various regions of whole-body.
