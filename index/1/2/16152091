We consider the problem of minimizing the total flow time on multiple machines with preemption, where the flow time of a job is the time spent since it arrives until it finishes. Our main result is a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme for a constant number of machines (<i>m</i>). The result also extends to total weighted flow time where either the job weights <i>or</i> the job sizes are polynomially bounded by the number of jobs (<i>n</i>). We also show that the dependence on <i>m</i> cannot be substantially improved. In particular, obtaining an <i>O</i>(1) approximation for the weighted case (even when all weights and sizes are polynomially bounded by <i>n</i>) by an algorithm with running time <i>n</i><sup><i>polylog(n,m)</i></sup> would imply that <i>NP âŠ‚ DTIME</i>(<i>n</i><sup><i>polylog(n)</i></sup>).
