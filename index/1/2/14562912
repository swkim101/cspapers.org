Remote code execution (RCE) attacks are one of the most prominent security threats for web applications. It is a special kind of cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack that allows client inputs to be stored and executed as server side scripts. RCE attacks often require coordination of multiple requests and manipulation of string and non-string inputs from the client side to nullify the access control protocol and induce unusual execution paths on the server side. We propose a path- and context-sensitive interprocedural analysis to detect RCE vulnerabilities. The analysis features a novel way of analyzing both the string and non-string behavior of a web application in a path sensitive fashion. It thoroughly handles the practical challenges entailed by modeling RCE attacks. We develop a prototype system and evaluate it on ten real-world PHP applications. We have identified 21 true RCE vulnerabilities, with 8 unreported before.
