This paper briefly presents the TOPCASED project which gathers industrialists, researchers, universities and SMEs, aiming at producing a free/open-source system/software/hardware-engineering toolkit, implemented over the Eclipse platform, using only standard components. An important aspect of TOPCASED is that it enables researchers to plug in their tools easily. TOPCASED is meant to be used on actual industrial projects and may therefore be considered as an important target by researchers working on formal methods and foundations of software engineering for critical systems
