In this paper, we specifically examine the training of a multi-label classifier from data with incompletely assigned labels. This problem is fundamentally important in many multi-label applications because it is almost impossible for human annotators to assign a complete set of labels, although their judgments are reliable. In other words, a multilabel dataset usually has properties by which (1) assigned labels are definitely positive and (2) some labels are absent but are still considered positive. Such a setting has been studied as a positive and unlabeled (PU) classification problem in a binary setting. We treat incomplete label assignment problems as a multi-label PU ranking, which is an extension of classical binary PU problems to the wellstudied rank-based multi-label classification. We derive the conditions that should be satisfied to cancel the negative effects of label incompleteness. Our experimentally obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of these conditions.
