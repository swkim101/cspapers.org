The goal of this paper is to compile a method for multi-word term extraction, taking into account both the linguistic properties of Bulgarian terms and their statistical rates. The method relies on the extraction of term candidates matching given syntactic patterns followed by statistical (by means of Log-likelihood ratio) and linguistically (by means of inflectional clustering) based filtering aimed at improving the coverage and the precision of multi-word term extraction.
