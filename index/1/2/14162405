Mining from data streams has become an important and challenging task for many real-world applications such as credit card fraud protection and sensor networking. One popular solution is to separate stream data into chunks, learn a base classifier from each chunk, and then integrate all base classifiers for effective classification. In this paper, we propose a dynamic classifier selection (DCS) mechanism to integrate base classifiers for effective mining from data streams. The proposed algorithm dynamically selects a single "best" classifier to classify each test instance at run time. Our scheme uses statistical information from attribute values, and uses each attribute to partition the evaluation set into disjoint subsets, followed by a procedure that evaluates the classification accuracy of each base classifier on these subsets. Given a test instance, its attribute values determine the subsets that the similar instances in the evaluation set have constructed, and the classifier with the highest classification accuracy on those subsets is selected to classify the test instance. Experimental results and comparative studies demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method. Such a DCS scheme appears to be promising in mining data streams with dramatic concept drifting or with a significant amount of noise, where the base classifiers are likely conflictive or have low confidence.
