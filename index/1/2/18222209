We present a new technique to synthesize high throughput pipelined data paths for those algorithms containing nested loops. Given an initiation interval constraint, the objective is to synthesize a low cost data path for the problem in register transfer level (RTL). Mapping algorithms for processor array synthesis which do not take initiation interval into account cannot be applied to our case; while traditional pipeline synthesis techniques suffer from complex interconnection and high register cost. Our contributions include proposing (1) an approach which conserves the regularities of nested loops, and (2) an architecture which possesses the advantages of both the highly multiplexed and lowly multiplexed architecture styles. Experiments on several algorithms in the image and DSP applications show this approach is very efficient.
