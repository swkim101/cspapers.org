There is significant evidence in the literature that integrating knowledge about multiword expressions can improve shallow parsing accuracy. We present an experimental study to quantify this improvement, focusing on compound nominals, proper names and adjective-noun constructions. The evaluation set of multiword expressions is derived from Word-Net and the textual data are downloaded from the web. We use a classification method to aid human annotation of output parses. This method allows us to conduct experiments on a large dataset of unannotated data. Experiments show that knowledge about multiword expressions leads to an increase of between 7.5% and 9.5% in accuracy of shallow parsing in sentences containing these multiword expressions.
