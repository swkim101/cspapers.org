SuperSQL is an extension of SQL that allows query results presented in various media for publishing and presentations with simple but sophisticated formatting capabilities. SuperSQL query can generate various kinds of materials, for example, a LaTeX source file to publish query results in a nested table, HTML or Java source files to present the result on WWW browsers, and other media including MS-Excel worksheet, Tcl/Tk, O2C, etc. O2C is a data manipulation language of O2 and thus useful to migrate data in a relational database to an object oriented database.
SuperSQL is meant to provide a theoretical and practical foundation for 4GL-type applications such as report writers and DB/WWW coordinators.
In this demonstration, we show how TFE reorganize the query results into various media in a universal way, first by grouping tuples according to an arbitrary tree structured schema, and by translating them with the constructors available in the target media.
