Point set registration-the task of finding the best fitting alignment between two sets of point samples, is an important problem in mobile robotics. This article proposes a novel registration algorithm, based on the distance between Three-Dimensional Normal Distributions Transforms. 3D-NDT models - a sub-class of Gaussian Mixture Models with uniformly weighted, largely disjoint components, can be quickly computed from range point data. The proposed algorithm constructs 3D-NDT representations of the input point sets and then formulates an objective function based on the L2 distance between the considered models. Analytic first and second order derivatives of the objective function are computed and used in a standard Newton method optimization scheme, to obtain the best-fitting transformation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and shown to be more accurate and faster, compared to a state of the art implementation of the Iterative Closest Point and 3D-NDT Point-to-Distribution algorithms.
