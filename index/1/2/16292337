Various application domains exist where the advantages of the event-based paradigm make it a key technology. In general, this architectural style allows better control of the structural and behavioral complexity of applications: components can be developed independently and loosely integrated. The computational behavior of this paradigm, however, remains poorly understood. This position paper argues on the necessity of a new methodology for constructing event-based applications as well as a new logic that clarifies the computational behavior of such applications. For this, the paper presents some factors that make the eventbased style so troublesome and discusses the (non-) adequacy of existing formal techniques for the construction of event-based applications.
