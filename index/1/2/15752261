Context sensing is an important part of building ubiquitous smart and assistive environments. It is the major data source for intention recognition and strategy generation systems. Device-free localization systems (DFL) join the efforts of non-instrumentation of users maintaining their privacy. In recent publications we propose an innovative approach utilizing a cluster of passive Radio Frequency Identification Transponders (pRFID) for device-free radio-based positioning. Due to the point that the RFID technology is typically not designed for that purpose we have to deal with certain drawbacks. A high number of transponders typically conclude in lower measurement frame rates while generating substantially more information for accurate positioning. To fix this tradeoff this work presents a transponder clustering approach based on inherent EPC protocol based bit masking, which allows us to calculate fast coarse grained localization results and increase the precision by time, so that the user is able to adjust between localization speed and accuracy. We made simulations and conducted experiments in an indoor room DFL scenario for validation.
