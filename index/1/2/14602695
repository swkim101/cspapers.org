A Framework-Specific Modeling Language (FSML) is a kind of Domain-Specific Modeling Language that is used for modeling framework-based software. FSMLs enable automated round-trip engineering over non-trivial model-to-code mappings and thereby simplify the task of creating and evolving framework-based applications. In this demonstration, we present a prototype implementation of Eclipse Workbench Part Interaction, a FSML capturing an aspect of Eclipse plug-in development. We walk through an example Eclipse plug-in development scenario and demonstrate the round-trip engineering capabilities of the prototype.
