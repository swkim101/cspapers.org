The problem of learning a proper distance or similarity metric arises in many applications such as content-based image retrieval. In this work, we propose a boosting algorithm, MetricBoost, to learn the distance metric that preserves the proximity relationships among object triplets: object i is more similar to object j than to object k. Metric-Boost constructs a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix that parameterizes the distance metric by combining rank-one PSD matrices. Different options of weak models and combination coefficients are derived. Unlike existing proximity preserving metric learning which is generally not scalable, MetricBoost employs a bipartite strategy to dramatically reduce computation cost by decomposing proximity relationships over triplets into pair-wise constraints. Met-ricBoost outperforms the state-of-the-art on two real-world medical problems: 1. identifying and quantifying diffuse lung diseases; 2. colorectal polyp matching between different views, as well as on other benchmark datasets.
