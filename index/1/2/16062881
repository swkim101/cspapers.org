The Robotic Gait Rehabilitation (RGR) Trainer, was designed and built to target secondary gait deviations in patients post - stroke. Using an impedance control strategy and a linear electromagnetic actuator, the device applies a force field to control pelvic obliquity through an orthopedic brace while the patient ambulates on treadmill. Healthy human subject testing confirmed efficacy of the method to impart significant gait restoration forces as a response to abnormal pelvic obliquity (hip hiking). This novel approach to application of force fields using endpoint impedance controlled linear actuators takes into account soft tissue compliance.
