manticl data models which often is For the conceptual level of database schemes a abstractions, static and dynamic constraints, and a functional programing language for queries and updates. The specification is analysed w.r.t. syn- tactic and semantic aspects. Then the behaviour and the implementation of database specifications are discussed. Furthermore, algebraic conditions are presented that guarantee a sound specification according to criteria evolved from database theory. necessary defini- ine is a For every specification technique it is to develop criteria for a sound database tion (/Casanova et al. Sl/). One guide1 syntactic and semantic analysis of database speci- fication in order to check whether the class of ad- mitted models Indeed meets the informal ideas in mind.
