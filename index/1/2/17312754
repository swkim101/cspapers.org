Due to sparse characteristic of data in real-world applications, DL uses a set of learned dictionary bases to represent the linear decomposition of a data point. Fisher discrimination DL (FDDL) is a representative supervised DL method, which constructs a structured dictionary whose atoms correspond to the class labels. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in multi-view (more than two views) feature learning techniques. Although some multi-view (or multi-modal) DL methods have been presented, there still exists much room for improvement. How to enhance the total discriminability of dictionaries and reduce their redundancy is a crucial research topic. To boost the performance of multi-view DL technique, we propose an uncorrelated multi-view discrimination DL (UMDDL) approach for recognition. By making dictionary atoms correspond to the class labels such that the obtained reconstruction error is discriminative, UMDDL aims to jointly learn multiple dictionaries with totally favorable discriminative power. Furthermore, we design the uncorrelated constraint for multi-view DL, so as to reduce the redundancy among dictionaries learned from different views. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
