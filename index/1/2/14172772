We study how to improve the throughput of high-bandwidth traffic such as large file transfers in a network where resources are fairly shared among connections. While it is possible to devise priority or reservation-based schemes that give high-bandwidth traffic preferential treatment at the expense of other connections, we focus on the use of routing algorithms that improve resource allocation while maintaining max-min fair share semantics. In our approach, routing is closely coupled with congestion control in the sense that congestion information, such as the rates allocated to existing connections, is used by the routing algorithm. To reduce the amount of routing information that must be distributed, an abstraction of the congestion information is introduced. Using an extensive set of simulation, we identify a link-cost or cost metric for "shortest-path" routing that performs uniformly better than the minimal-hop routing and shortest-widest path routing algorithms. To further improve throughput without reducing the fair share of single-path connections, we propose a novel prioritized multi-path routing algorithm in which low priority paths share the bandwidth left unused by higher priority paths. This leads to a conservative extension of max-min fairness called prioritized multi-level max-min fairness. Simulation results confirm the advantages of our multi-path routing algorithm.
