We consider graphs with d-dimensional integer vector weights and rational cost values associated with the edges. We analyze the problem of finding a minimum cost path between two given vertices such that the vector sum of ail edges in the path ecp& a given target vector m. If the dimension of the vector weights is bounded by a constant, the MINIMUM COST m-PATH problem is shown to be solvable in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input graph, the size of the representation of m, and the integers in the vector weights of the edges. The MINIMUM COST mPATH problem is strongly related to the problem of finding optimal schedules for the computation of uniform recurrence equations.
