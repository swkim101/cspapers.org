The problem of continuous curvature path planning for passages is considered. This problem arises when an autonomous vehicle traverses between prescribed boundaries such as corridors, tunnels, channels, etc. Passage boundaries with curvature and heading discontinuities pose challenges for generating smooth paths passing through them. Continuous curvature half-S shaped paths derived from the Four Parameter Logistic Curve family are proposed as a prospective path planning solution. Analytic conditions are derived for generating continuous curvature paths confined within the passage boundaries. Zero end curvature highlights the scalability of the proposed solution and its compatibility with other path planners in terms of larger path planning domains. Various scenarios with curvature and heading discontinuities are considered presenting viability of the proposed solution.
