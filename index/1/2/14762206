NON-VON is a highly parallel machine designed to support the efficient implementation of very large scale knowledge-based systems. The utility of such a machine has been demonstrated analytically [1, 2] and through implementation of a working knowledge-based information retrieval system in which the NON-VON machine instructions were emulated in software [3]. In cooperation with the Stanford Computer Science Department, we have recently begun to implement the most important components of the machine as custom VLSI circuits.
