Abstract Vinci is a local-area service-oriented architecture (SOA) designed for rapid development and management of robust Web applications. Based on XML document exchange, Vinci is designed to complement and interoperate with wide-area SOAs such as SOAP/UDDI and .NET. This paper presents the Vinci architecture, the rationale behind its design, and an evaluation of its performance. Specifically, we show how systems architected with Vinci are developed quickly, scaled effortlessly, and easily moved from prototype to production.
