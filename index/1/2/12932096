The “On-Line Logical Simulation System” (OLLS) is a complete software package which permits a logic designer to interactively design, layout and simulate large digital systems using the IBM 2250 CRT. The user communicates with OLLS through a set of interactive displays using the light-pen, keyboard and programmed-function buttons. The major subsystems include file handling, device definition, drawing manipulation, simulation and input-output. OLLS is unique in its freedom of device definition, generality and adaptability. Its major contributions to the design process are fast, precise system documentation and accurate logic simulation.
