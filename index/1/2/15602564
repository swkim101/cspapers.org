In this paper, we present deformable configuration control - a fully distributed algorithm that allows multiple robots to deform their configuration to avoid various shapes of obstacles while maintaining connectivity. Robots contacted with an obstacle first estimate the width of an obstacle by sharing bumped status of individual robots, and choose an appropriate obstacle avoidance scenarios between obstacle detouring and bouncing off a wall. Second, for both scenarios, robots switch their motion model to a parent following motion to avoid the obstacle. Finally, robots keep sensing the maximum tree angle to estimate whether they are completely escaped from the obstacle, and return to flock formation motion model. We provide theoretical analysis about maintaining connectivity while robots are avoiding an obstacle. Simulation results show a group of 36 robots successfully avoid three different kinds of obstacles including 1) a small bar, 2) a narrow corridor, and 3) a large wall while maintaining connectivity.
