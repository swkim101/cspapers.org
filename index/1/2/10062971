In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling a network of locally interacting mobile agents, subject to a set of non-local topology constraints, towards a group flocking objective. As opposed to switching network links directly in the space of discrete graphs, yielding a divide in spatial configuration and communication topology, we regulate topology through mobility, enabling adjacent agents to retain or deny links spatially on the basis of constraint satisfaction. Specifically, we propose a distributed formulation consisting of a switching control and smooth potential fields for local link discrimination and flocking, coupled with consensus-based coordination over proposed topology changes, yielding transitions in communication that respect non-local constraints and correspond to agent configuration. An analysis of the interplay between the topology consensus and constraint composition, together with a Lyapunov-like convergence argument guarantees the flocking, collision avoidance, and constraint satisfaction properties of the system. Finally, simulations of a novel constrained coordination scenario highlight the correctness and applicability of our proposed methods.
