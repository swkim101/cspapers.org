While intelligent writing assistants have become more common, they typically have little support for revision behavior. We present ArgRewrite, a novel web-based revision assistant that focus on rewriting analysis. The system supports two major functionalities: 1) to assist students as they revise, the system automatically extracts and analyzes revisions; 2) to assist teachers, the system provides an overview of studentsâ€™ revisions and allows teachers to correct the automatically analyzed results, ensuring that students get the correct feedback.
