We examine a chse of collective coin-j?ipping game8 that arises from randomized distributed algorithms with halting failures. In these games, a sequence of local coin flips is generated, which must be combined to form a single global coin flip. An adversary monitors the game and may attempt to bits outcome by hhiing the result of up ta t local coin tlipa. We show that to guarantee at moat constant bias, fl(t2) local coins are needed, even if (a) the local coins can have arbitrary distributions and ranges, (b) the adversary is required to decide immediately whether to hide or reveal each local coin, and (c) the game cart detect which local coins have been hidden. If the adversary ia permitted to control the outcome of the coin except for cases whose probability is pdynomid in t,f2(t2 /log2 t) local coins are needed. Combtig this fact with an extended veraion of the well-known Fiecher-Lynch-Pateraort impossibility proof of determirtis tic consensus, we show that given an adaptive adversary, arty t-resilient asynchronous consensus protocol requires 0(t2/ log2 t) local coin fips in arty model that can be simulated deterministically using atomic registers. This gives the first non-trivial lower bound on the totaJ work required by wait-free consensus and is tight to within logarithmic factors.
