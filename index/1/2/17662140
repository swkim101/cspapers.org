In the near future GPS will be widely used, thus allowing a broad variety of location dependent services such as direction giving, navigation, etc. In this paper we propose and evaluate a Touting and addressing method to integrate geographic coordinates into the Internet Protocol to enable the creation of location dependent services. The main challenge is to integrate the concept of physical location into the current design of the Internet which relies on logical addressing.
