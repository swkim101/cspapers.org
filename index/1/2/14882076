Electric motors clearly constitute the most common drive principle in robotics and mechatronics. Smart materials, however, offer considerably higher power-to-mass ratios than electric motors. If mechanical energy instead of electrical energy can be distributed through a system, highly dynamic and efficient torque transmission elements based on smart materials, e.g. piezoceramics, can be used to transmit torque from an input to an output element. Just like electric motors, they can thus provide position, velocity, and force-torque control of the output element. This paper introduces machine components, called adaptronic couplers, which can transmit variable torques highly dynamically from an input element to an output element employing static and/or dynamic friction. In the long run, systems (e.g. robots) based on these machine components are envisaged to compete with systems based on classic drive principles - especially electric motors - w.r.t. dynamics and power-to-mass-ratio. Apart from the concept itself, this paper addresses different control approaches and discusses their influence on energy consumption and wear. Moreover, various experimental results proving the basic concept are presented.
