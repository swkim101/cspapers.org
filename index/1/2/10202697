The EXODUS database toolkit, and in particular the E persistent programming language, have been used in two substantial database system implementation efforts by the authors (the Ariel database rule system and the Triton nested relation DBMS). Observed advantages of using a persistent programming language for database system implementation include ease of implementation of specialpurpose persistent objects used by the DBMS such as catalogs, data indexes, rule indexes, and nested relational structures. Other advantages of using E (a persistent version of C++) that are independent of the persistence issue are the usefulness of objectoriented programming in developing large software systems, and the utility of the Collection abstraction in E. Observed disadvantages include (1) the inability to map the type system of the DBMS to the type system of the underlying programming language while still retaining good performance for tEric Hanson is with the Artificial Intelligence Technology Office (WL/AAA-l), Air Force Wright Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433, and with Wright State University.
