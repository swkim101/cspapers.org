Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) techniques are being adopted with more frequency in the engineering of computer based systems, especially in the area of distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems. This brief summary presents two research objectives for supporting software evolution in MDSD. First, the concept of model-driven program transformation is introduced to support evolution of large legacy software systems. The second research objective that is presented involves the application of a mature program transformation engine to automate model interpreter evolution in the presence of meta-model schema changes.
