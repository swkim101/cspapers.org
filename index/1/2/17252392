of SNOBOL [Farber et al. 19641 and its descendant, SNOBOL4 ~Griswold et al. 19711, has found widespread appl~cation in a great variety of string manipulation problems. .—— Although SNOBOL4 is dominant in the field, other string manipulation languages have been developed, among them AXLE [Cohen and Wegstein 1965], PANON [di Forino 1968], and COMIT [Yngve 19721. Each of these languages provides facilities for the grouping, rearranging, inserting, deleting, sorting, testing, tagging, and counting of strings. Accordingly, they share a common set of design difficulties, characteristic of this class of languages.
