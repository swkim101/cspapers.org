This paper discusses the use of a parallel discrete-event network emulator called the Internet Protocol Traffic and Network Emulator (IP-TNE) for Web server benchmarking. The experiments in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of high-performance WAN emulation using parallel discrete-event simulation techniques on shared-memory multiprocessors. Our experiments with the Apache Web server achieve 3400 HTTP transactions per second for simple Web workloads, and 1000 HTTP transactions per second for realistic Web workloads, for static document retrieval across emulated WAN topologies of up to 4096 concurrent Web/TCP clients. The results show that WAN characteristics, including round-trip delays, link speeds, packet losses, packet sizes, and bandwidth asymmetry, all have significant impacts on Web server performance. WAN emulation enables stress testing and benchmarking of Web server performance in ways that may not be possible in simple LAN test scenarios.
