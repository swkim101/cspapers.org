Photo publishing in Social Networks and other Web2.0 applications has become very popular due to the pervasive availability of cheap digital cameras, powerful batch upload tools and a huge amount of storage space. A portion of uploaded images are of a highly sensitive nature, disclosing many details of the users' private life. We have developed a web service which can detect private images within a user's photo stream and provide support in making privacy decisions in the sharing context. In addition, we present a privacy-oriented image search application which automatically identifies potentially sensitive images in the result set and separates them from the remaining pictures.
