This is a natural and necessary interaction in real systems such as Visio where very similar shapes exist. First, a novel algorithm is proposed to mine the prior shape knowledge for three editing modes. Second, to differentiate visually similar shapes, a novel symbol recognition algorithm is introduced by leveraging the learnt shape knowledge. Then, a novel editing detection algorithm is proposed to facilitate symbol recognition. Furthermore, both of the symbol recognizer and the editing detector are systematically incorporated into the full sketch recognition. Finally, based on the proposed algorithms, a real-time sketch recognition system is built to recognize hand-drawn flowcharts and diagrams with flexible interactions. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
