We present a novel stereo-based obstacle avoidance system on a vision-guided micro air vehicle (MAV) that is capable of fully autonomous maneuvers in unknown and dynamic environments. All algorithms run exclusively on the vehicle's on-board computer, and at high frequencies that allow the MAV to react quickly to obstacles appearing in its flight trajectory. Our MAV platform is a quadrotor aircraft equipped with an inertial measurement unit and two stereo rigs. An obstacle mapping algorithm processes stereo images, producing a 3D map representation of the environment; at the same time, a dynamic anytime path planner plans a collision-free path to a goal point.
