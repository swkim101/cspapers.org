The challenge of including both theory and practical experience to reinforce the concepts of theory in Introductory Operating Systems is discussed. The traditional approaches to answering this challenge are presented. A practical approach that uses straightforward programming problems rather than problems that involve modification of an existing operating system is described. Examples of the types of problems used are presented and experience with the proposed approach is described.
