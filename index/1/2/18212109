The idea of weak mutation testing is to construct test data which would force program components such as expressions and variable references to produce a wrong 'result' if they were to contain certain types of error, for example, off-by-a-constant or wrong-variable. The idea of data flow driven testing is to construct test data which forces the execution of different interactions between variable definitions and references in a program.
This paper describes a tool for FORTRAN 77 programs which has been developed to help a user apply the weak mutation and data flow testing techniques. The tool instruments a given source program and collects a program execution history. It is then able to report on the completeness of the test data with respect to weak mutation and a family of data flow path selection criteria. Some preliminary experiments with use of the tool are described.
