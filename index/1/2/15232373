In social networks such as Orkut, www.orkut.com, a large portion of the user queries refer to names of other people. Indeed, more than 50% of the queries in Orkut are about names of other users, with an average of 1.8 terms per query. Further, the users usually search for people with whom they maintain relationships in the network. These relationships can be modelled as edges in a friendship graph, a graph in which the nodes represent the users. In this context, search ranking can be modelled as a function that depends on the distances among users in the graph, more specifically, of shortest paths in the friendship graph. However, application of this idea to ranking is not straightforward because the large size of modern social networks (dozens of millions of users) prevents efficient computation of shortest paths at query time. We overcome this by designing a ranking formula that strikes a balance between producing good results and reducing query processing time. Using data from the Orkut social network, which includes over 40 million users, we show that our ranking, augmented by this new signal, produces high quality results, while maintaining query processing time small.
