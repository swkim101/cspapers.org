In this paper, we propose a new type of visual features for visual servoing: photometric moments. These global features do not require any segmentation, matching or tracking steps. The analytical form of the interaction matrix is developed in closed form for these features. Results from experiments carried out with photometric moments have been presented. The results validate our modelling and the control scheme. They perform well for large camera displacements and are endowed with a large convergence domain. From the properties exhibited, photometric moments hold promise as better candidates for IBVS over currently existing geometric and pure luminance features.
