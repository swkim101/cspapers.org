The STOCHOPT automatic file migration policy (proposed by A.J. Smith) minimizes the expected retention and recall costs of an abitrarily sized file. We consider the application of the STOCHOPT policy to a file system in which the file inter-reference time (IRT) distributions are characterized by strictly monotonically decreasing hazard rates (SDHR) (also known as decreasing failure rates, DFR). We show that in this case the STOCHOPT policy can be simply stated in terms of a scaled hazard rate, i.e., the hazard rate divided by the file size. Such decreasing failure rate distributions have been used by Smith to model empirically observed file inter-reference times.
