Existing multi-robot cooperative perception solutions can be mainly classified into two categories, measurement-based and belief-based, according to the information shared among robots. With well-controlled communication, measurement-based approaches are expected to achieve theoretically optimal estimates while belief-based approaches are not because the cross-correlations between beliefs are hard to be perfectly estimated in practice. Nevertheless, belief-based approaches perform relatively stable under unstable communication as a belief contains the information of multiple previous measurements. Motivated by the observation that measurement sharing and belief sharing are respectively superior in different conditions, in this paper a hybrid algorithm, communication adaptive multi-robot simultaneous localization and tracking (ComAd MR-SLAT), is proposed to combine the advantages of both. To tackle the unknown or unstable communication conditions, the information to share is decided by maximizing the expected uncertainty reduction online, based on which the algorithm dynamically alternates between measurement-sharing and belief-sharing without information loss or reuse. The proposed ComAd MR-SLAT is evaluated in communication conditions with different packet loss rates and bursty loss lengths. In our experiments, ComAd MR-SLAT outperforms measurement-based and belief-based MR-SLAT in accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithm and exhibit that ComAd MR-SLAT is robust under different communication conditions.
