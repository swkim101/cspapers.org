This paper presents a comparison of controls for manipulators whose dynamics is expressed in terms of quasi-velocities. Robot dynamic algorithms in terms of quasi-velocities are recursive in nature and consists of two recursions: one starts from a base of the manipulator towards its tip and the second in opposite direction. Both recursions are described by using vector-matrix notation. Quasi-velocities are a result of numerical mass matrix factorization. They were tested on a model of manipulator with two degrees of freedom. In this paper we adopt standard control algorithms known in robotic literature to a case when robot dynamics is formulated in terms of quasi-velocities.
