In this paper, we use multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to improve the reading experience of parallel texts on mobile devices. Such enterprise poses multiple challenging issues both from the NLP and from the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) perspectives. We discuss these problems, and report on our own solutions, now implemented in a full-fledged bilingual reading device.
