In order to be successful in the rapidly expanding field of LSI and VLSI development, there must be a close interrelationship between the software engineers who develop CAD tools and the hardware engineers who must use those tools. Any new CAD tool must encompass three areas: it must be able to handle complex circuits efficiently; it must be a complete package, including simulation, layout, checking and test program generation; and it must be useable.
 The hardware engineer can provide valuable system integration experience when the time comes to incorporate each new tool into the complete package. If new tools do not properly interface with existing or projected tools, they will induce errors and not be useful. Finally, if hardware engineers are involved in each of the phases of CAD tool development, they will have a vested interest in ensuring that the package works, and just as importantly, they will use the tools.
