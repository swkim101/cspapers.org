The rise of computer graphics offers a new challenge for information retrieval: how to search and retrieve information which is partly or wholly graphical. As an example, procedures for handling geographical information, such as street maps and directories are explained. With this data, it is possible to find routes on maps, retrieve locations and names of people or businesses, and draw maps. But a comparison of these programs with programs for face processing or computer typesetting makes clear how far we are from general purpose routines. Today successful graphics routines contain a great deal of local domain knowledge. There is no analog of the simple keyword systems that handle textual documents in any subject area. Just as computational linguists have found that subject matter expertise is necessary to do really sophisticated processing of English, it seems also necessary to sophisticated processing of pictures; the difference is that we don't know how to do unsophisticated processing of graphics.
