Contextual Advertising is a type of Web advertising, which, given the URL of a Web page, aims to embed into the page (typically via JavaScript) the most relevant textual ads available. For static pages that are displayed repeatedly, the matching of ads can be based on prior analysis of their entire content; however, ads need to be matched also to new or dynamically created pages that cannot be processed ahead of time. Analyzing the entire body of such pages on-the-fly entails prohibitive communication and latency costs. To solve the three-horned dilemma of either low-relevance or high-latency or high-load, we propose to use text summarization techniques paired with external knowledge (exogenous to the page) to craft short page summaries in real time. Empirical evaluation proves that matching ads on the basis of such summaries does not sacrifice relevance, and is competitive with matching based on the entire page content. Specifically, we found that analyzing a carefully selected 5% fraction of the page text sacrifices only 1%-3% in ad relevance. Furthermore, our summaries are fully compatible with the standard JavaScript mechanisms used for ad placement: they can be produced at ad-display time by simple additions to the usual script, and they only add 500-600 bytes to the usual request.
