Current environmental monitoring systems assume particles to be spherical, and do not attempt to classify them. A laser-based system developed at the University of Hertfordshire aims at classifying airborne particles through the generation of two-dimensional scattering profiles. The pedormances of template matching, and two types of neural network (HyperNet and semi-linear units) are compared for image classification. The neural network approach is shown to be capable of comparable recognition pedormance, while offering a number of advantages over template matching.
