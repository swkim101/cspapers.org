This paper presents a task-space robot controller composed of two nested loops. The inner loop corresponds to a Proportional-Derivative joint-position controller and the outer loop consists of a Proportional-Integral controller fed by task space measurements. The Lyapunov method allows concluding closed loop stability and a visual servoing application permits assessing the performance of the proposed controller.
