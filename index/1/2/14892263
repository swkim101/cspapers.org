This paper describes TOS - an educational distributed operating system implemented in Java. First the current trends in commercial operating systems are shortly presented and compared with several available educational operating systems. Next we give our rationals to use Java as the TOS implementation language. Then the architecture of the system and its components - launchers and servers are described. Finally we explain the advantages of this architecture and give some examples of possible student projects and assignments.
