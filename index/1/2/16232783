We present a new floorplan representation, called circular-packing trees (CP-trees), for the problem of macro placement. Our CP-trees can flexibly pack movable macros toward corners or preplaced macros along chip boundaries circularly to optimize macro positions/orientations for better wirelength and routing congestion. Unlike previous macro placers that often consider only the interconnections among macros, we develop a routability-aware wirelength model to fast estimate the wirelength among macros and standard cells and to consider macro porosity effects for better routability. Compared with leading academic mixed-size placers, experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve the shortest routed wirelength for industrial benchmarks.
