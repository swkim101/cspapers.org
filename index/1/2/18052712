Object-oriented databases are being increasingly used to model non-standard applications that emphasize modularity, composition, and rapid prototyping. A semantic locking protocol is presented for transaction management for such object-oriented databases. In particular, the protocol incorporates the semantics of complex objects, nested executions and dynamic conflicts resulting from referentially shared objects.
