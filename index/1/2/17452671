Consequently, several algorithms now exist for automatically aligning ontologies, with mixed success in their performances. Crucial challenges for these algorithms involve scaling to large ontologies, and as applications of ontology alignment evolve, performing the alignment in a reasonable amount of time without compromising on the quality of the alignment. A class of alignment algorithms is iterative and often consumes more time than others while delivering solutions of high quality. We present a novel and general approach for speeding up the multivariable optimization process utilized by these algorithms. Specifically, we use the technique of block-coordinate descent in order to possibly improve the speed of convergence of the iterative alignment techniques. We integrate this approach into three well-known alignment systems and show that the enhanced systems generate similar or improved alignments in significantly less time on a comprehensive testbed of ontology pairs. This represents an important step toward making alignment techniques computationally more feasible.
