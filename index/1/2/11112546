System design, i.e. the design of board-level circuits andsystems-on-a-chip, focuses on the integration of off-the-shelf andapplication-specific VLSI components. A key aspect of systemdesign is to ensure the satisfaction of component interface timingrequirements. This is necessary for the correct exchange ofinformation among components on a system. We present amethodology for the interface timing verification and subsequenttiming-driven floorplanning of systems. We present results on theapplication of this methodology to real-world circuits.
