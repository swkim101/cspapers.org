Raouralva rules, such as "Your parents ancestors are your ancestors", although very useful for theorem proving, natural language understanding, question-answering and Information retrieval systems, present problems for many such systems, either causing infinite loopa or requiring that arbitrarily many copies of them be made. SNIP, the SNaPS Inference Package, can use reouralva rules without either of these problems. A raouralva rule oauaaa a cycle to ba built in an Active connection graph. Each pass of data through the cycle results in another answer. Cycling stops as soon as either the desired answer is produoed, no more answers can be produced or resource bounds are exceeded.
