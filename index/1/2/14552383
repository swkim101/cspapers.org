This paper introduces a client-server suite, which provides a readily configurable and simple to use network distributed computing framework. The suite will allow users to easily operate a distributed computing environment and solve real probls with a hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) grid. This tool is most useful in a pedagogical setting such as an introductory computing course or as an adjunct to a computationally intensive course that addresses parallel computing issues.
