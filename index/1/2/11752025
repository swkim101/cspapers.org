To efficiently program massively parallel systems we propose to use a form of parallelism known as data parallelism along with a SPMD programming model. We describe how a sequential Object Oriented Language (OOL) can embed data parallelism in a clean and elegant fashion—without language extensions— to exploit the potential power of massively parallel systems. To illustrate our ideas, we present EPEE (our OOL Parallel Execution Environment) and an application of this approach to a well known parallel paradigm. After some remarks on our implementation, we show experimental performance results and draw some conclusions on the generality of this approach.
