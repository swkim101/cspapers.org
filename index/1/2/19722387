With the surge of deep learning, more and more attention has been put on the sequential recommender. It can be casted as sequence prediction problem, where we will predict the next item given the previous items. RNN approaches are able to capture the global sequential features from the data compared with the local features derived in Markov Chain methods. However, both approaches rely on the independence of users' sequences, which are not true in practice. We propose to formulate the sequential recommendation problem as collaborative sequence prediction problem to take the dependency of users' sequences into account. In order to solve the collaborative sequence prediction problem, we define the dynamic neighborhood relationship between users and introduce manifold regularization to RNN on the basis of the multi-facets of collaborative filtering, referred to as MrRNN. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
