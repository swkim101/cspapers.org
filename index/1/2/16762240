This paper describes the assembly language course we teach, using a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX-11/780 minicomputer, in which structured programming is stressed. It also discusses the relative merits and disadvantages of choosing the VAX as the computer to be used in such a course.
 The first section of the paper provides a quick survey of the VAX architecture. The second describes our course in assembly language, including our method of structuring assembly language programs. The final section details some of the positive and negative aspects we discovered in using the VAX in our course.
