It has been recognised that languages like Concurrent Prolog and Parlog which use committed choice non-determinism have departed from the original concept of logic programming, but no new paradigm has been suggested. In this paper we propose that programs in such languages be viewed as rewrite rules that hierarchically decompose a process into a network of distributed processes. Logical variables and unification provide a powerful means of communication, and annotations can provide a synchronization mechanism that complements them.
