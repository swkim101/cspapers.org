We describe an electronic photoreceptor circuit that is sensitive to small changes in incident light intensity. The sensitivity to changes in the intensity is achieved by feeding back to the input a filtered version of the output. The feedback loop includes a hysteretic element. The circuit behaves in a manner reminiscent of the gain control properties and temporal responses of a variety of retinal cells, particularly retinal bipolar cells. We compare the thresholds for detection of intensity increments by a human and by the circuit. Both obey Weber's law and for both the temporal contrast sensitivities are nearly identical.
