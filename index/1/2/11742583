In this paper, we present Fastrack, a parameter-free algorithm for dynamic resource provisioning that uses simple statistics to promptly distill information about changes in workload burstiness. This information, coupled with the application's end-to-end response times and system bottleneck characteristics, guide resource allocation that shows to be very effective under a broad variety of burstiness profiles and bottleneck scenarios.
