In Computer Science courses, we ask students to write a lot of code. All too often, the resulting code quality is poor. While it is widely believed that students would write better code if they spent more time reading code, it is difficult to get students to read code effectively. We present a web-based application supporting generation and delivery of quizzes designed to evaluate and improve code reading skills.
