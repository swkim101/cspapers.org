The last two decades witnessed a great success of revived empiricism in NLP research. However, there are still several NLP tasks that are not successful enough. As one of many directions for going beyond the revived empiricism, this paper introduces a project for annotating annotations with annotatorsâ€™ rationales behind them. As a first step of this enterprise, the paper particularly focuses on data collection during the annotation and discusses their potential uses. Finally a preliminary experiment for data collection is described with the data analysis.
