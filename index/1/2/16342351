To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function which “explains” the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example trajectories from two participants performing a collaborative assembly task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict a human's motion for a given task by iteratively replanning a trajectory for a 23 DoF human kinematic model using the STOMP algorithm with the learned cost function in the presence of a moving collaborator. Our results suggest that our method outperforms baseline methods and generalizes well for tasks similar to those that were demonstrated.
