Following its long-standing tradition, SPLASH 2013 will host 19 high-quality workshops, allowing their participants to meet and discuss research questions with peers, to mature new and exciting ideas, and to build up communities and start new collaborations. SPLASH workshops complement the main tracks of the conference and provide meetings in a smaller and more specialized setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and concepts for the future, optionally recorded in formal proceedings. We invite you to explore the workshops program online at http://splashcon.org/2013/program/workshops. This paper contains brief summaries of each of the accepted workshops, grouped by topic. The SPLASH-E workshop is separate from the regular workshop program, and its program is available at http: //splashcon.org/2013/program/educator-symposium.
