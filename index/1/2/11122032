The XWeb architecture delivers interfaces to a wide variety of interactive platforms. XWeb's SUBSCRIBE mechanism allows multiple interactive clients to synchronize with each other. We define the concept of Join as the mechanism for acquiring access to a service's interface. Join also allows the formation of spontaneous collaborations with other people. We define the concept of Capture as the means for users to assemble suites of interactive resources to apply to a particular problem. These mechanisms allow users to access devices that they encounter in their environment rather than carrying all their devices with them. We describe two prototype implementations of Join and Capture. One uses a Java ring to carry a user's identification and to make connections. The other uses a set of cameras to watch where users are and what they touch. Lastly we present algorithms for resolving conflicts generated when independent interactive clients manipulate the same information.
