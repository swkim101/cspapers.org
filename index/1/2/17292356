The concept and application of “patterns” are as old as organized human endeavor. Recently, patterns have become the focus of much discussion within the objectoriented community. Papers, discussion groups, conferences, and books have focused on identifying, discussing and applying patterns. To establish a common base terminology for the panel [from Webster]: cult a group with great devotion to some person, idea, or thing, particularly when such devotion may be viewed as some sort of intellectual fad (in the sense of early adopters of a new technology, i.e. the leaders) culture a group that has achieved a state of advancement in civilization with distinctive beliefs, traditions, etc. (in the sense of the creation of a broad following, where the “new” technology is part of the established business practice) Using the above definitions, the journey from “cult” to “culture” requires increasing maturity in discipline, learning, and mechanisms for transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations. This panel will focus on the evolution of the development/application of patterns from a cult to a culture. Our panelists represent a wide base of expertise that includes: design methodologies; education; management practices; patterns; process; programming languages and team organization. The objective of the panel is to share the experiences of the panelists and offer some practical advice on how the identification and application of patterns can evolve from a cult to a culture.
