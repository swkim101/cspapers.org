This paper presents a novel robotic platform for experimental research in large-scale distributed robotics and mobile sensor networks. The MICAbot is both inexpensive and flexible making it useful for a wide range of experimental goals. In this paper, we provide a description of the MICAbot design. Furthermore, we also discuss general design considerations involved in designing large-scale distributed robots focusing on cost, size, and functionality.
