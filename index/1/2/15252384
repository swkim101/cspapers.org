This paper presents a preliminary performance analysis of a new large-scale multiprocessor: the Wisconsin Multicube. A key characteristic of the machine is that it is based on shared buses and a snooping cache coherence protocol. The organization of the shared buses and shared memory is unique and non-hierarchical. The two-dimensional version of the architecture is envisioned as scaling to 1024 processors.
We develop an approximate mean-value analysis of bus interference for the proposed cache coherence protocol. The model includes FCFS scheduling at the bus queues with deterministic bus access times, and asynchronous memory write-backs and invalidation requests.
We use our model to investigate the feasibility of the multiprocessor, and to study some initial system design issues. Our results indicate that a 1024-processor system can operate at 75 - 95% of its peak processing power, if the mean time between cache misses is larger than 1000 bus cycles (i.e. 50 microseconds for 20 MHz buses; 25 microseconds for 40 MHz buses). This miss rate is not unreasonable for the cache sizes specified in the design, which are comparable to main memory sizes in existing multiprocessors. We also present results which address the issues of optimal cache block size, optimal size of the two-dimensional Multicube, the effect of broadcast invalidations on system performance, and the viability of several hardware techniques for reducing the latency for remote memory requests.
