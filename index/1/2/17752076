A prototype implementation has been built as part of the Heterogeneous Computer Systems project at the University of Washington. This service supports RPC binding and other applications in our heterogeneous environment. Measurements of the performance of this prototype show that it is close to that of the underlying name services, due largely to the use of specialized caching techniques.
