The COMPOSE project aims to provide an open Marketplace for the Internet of Things as well as the necessary platform to support it. A necessary component of COMPOSE is an API that allows things, COMPOSE users and the platform to communicate. The COMPOSE API allows for things to push data to the platform, the platform to initiate asynchronous actions on the things, and COMPOSE users to retrieve and process data from the things. In this paper we present the design and implementation of the COMPOSE API, as well as a detailed description of the main key requirements that the API must satisfy. The API documentation and the source code for the platform are available online.
