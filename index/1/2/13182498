We propose ontology for which agents communicate with human and other agents according to an environmental information situation. Recently, various types of robot and information tool are developed and used. But still now, the system is promoted by human and is developed by human. The system cannot build interaction between human. And the agent processes information all by itself, which cannot utilize relationship with human or other agents. Therefore, we focus attention on ontology technology. Human can communicate with other that combined with a situation and body language. This is because human has the ontology. The agent created the ontology from observed human motion and situation, and communication with human or other agents use ontology. In this paper, we show the composition of ontology from the interaction between human and agent, and experiment of the communication with robot using ontology.
