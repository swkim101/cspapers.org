Most embedding methods cannot well align the input and output, which leads to degradation in prediction performance. Besides, they suffer from expensive prediction computational costs when applied to large-scale datasets. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Co-Hashing (CoH) method by formulating multi-label learning from the perspective of cross-view learning. CoH first regards the input and output as two views, and then aims to learn a common latent hamming space, where input and output pairs are compressed into compact binary embeddings. CoH enjoys two key benefits: 1) the input and output can be well aligned, and their correlations are explored; 2) the prediction is very efficient using fast cross-view kNN search in the hamming space. Moreover, we provide the generalization error bound for our method. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CoH over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
