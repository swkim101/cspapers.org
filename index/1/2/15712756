This paper describes a computer-aided, decision-making technique by which the suitability of any site or area may be evaluated with respect to any type of usage or development. The method described provides the designer with the means for making judgments as to locational desirability even with limited data availability. The procedure also raises the level of decision parameter selection above the “local” level to include “universal” or “global” inter-relationships. The means for utilizing macro-level data and information to make micro-level decision is demonstrated. An actual case study for housing site suitability near Chicago is presented to illustrate the approach. The merits of the technique over previous approaches and the problem of designer “judgment” in computer-aided methods is also discussed.
