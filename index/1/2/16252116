In a recent paper the authors presented a new and very fast algorithm for accurate computation and inclusion of the sum and dot product of floating point numbers. In this paper we show that the algorithms can be used to compute a very accurate inclusion of the solution of systems of linear equations. As a basic building block, accurate solution of linear equations has applications in very many areas
