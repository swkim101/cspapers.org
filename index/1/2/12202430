This paper presents a heading drift correction method and experimental results for position tracking of human movement based on the use of foot-mounted inertial/magnetic sensor modules. A position tracking algorithm was previously developed, which incorporated a zero velocity update technique for correcting accelerometer drift. Previous experiments indicated the presence of a persistent heading drift in the estimated position. In this paper, a simple method for correcting this drift is presented. The method requires the user to walk over a closed loop path with the foot-mounted sensor module. Assuming a constant sensor bias for this initial walk, the resulting position error is then used to accomplish an in situ correction for position estimates during future walks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the drift correction method and show a significant improvement in position tracking accuracy. Accuracy is determined based on the final position estimates following walks of 100 and 400 meters. Estimated distance traveled averages within 0.2% of actual distance traveled and distance from the actual position averages within 0.28% of actual distance traveled.
