Persuasive technologies aim to influence user's behaviors. In order to be effective, many of the persuasive technologies developed so far relies on user's motivation and ability, which is highly variable and often the reason behind the failure of such technology. In this paper, we present the concept of Mindless Computing, which is a new approach to persuasive technology design. Mindless Computing leverages theories and concepts from psychology and behavioral economics into the design of technologies for behavior change. We show through a systematic review that most of the current persuasive technologies do not utilize the fast and automatic mental processes for behavioral change and there is an opportunity for persuasive technology designers to develop systems that are less reliant on user's motivation and ability. We describe two examples of mindless technologies and present pilot studies with encouraging results. Finally, we discuss design guidelines and considerations for developing this type of persuasive technology.
