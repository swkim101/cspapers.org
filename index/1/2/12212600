This paper describes a depth image enhancement method for consumer RGB-D cameras. Most existing methods use the pixel-coordinates of the aligned color image. Because the image plane generally has no relationship to the measured surfaces, the global coordinate system is not suitable to handle their local geometries. To improve enhancement accuracy, we use local tangent planes as local coordinates for the measured surfaces. Our method is composed of two steps, a calculation of the local tangents and surface reconstruction. To accurately estimate the local tangents, we propose a color heuristic calculation and an orientation correction using their positional relationships. Additionally, we propose a surface reconstruction method by ray-tracing to local tangents. In our method, accurate depth image enhancement is achieved by using the local geometries approximated by the local tangents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using synthetic and real sensor data. Our method has a high completion rate and achieves the lowest errors in noisy cases when compared with existing techniques.
