Existence of superdecomposable pure-injective modules reflects complexity in the category of finite-dimensional representations. We describe the relation in terms of pointed modules. We present methods for producing superdecomposable pure-injectives and give some details of recent work of Harland doing this in the context of tubular algebras. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.
