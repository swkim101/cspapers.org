This paper presents a novel methodology for viewing large graphs. The basic concept is to allow the user to interactively navigate through large graphs learning about them in appropriately small and concise pieces. An architecture is present to support graph exploration. It contains methods for building custom layout algorithms hierarchically, interactively decomposing large graphs, and creating interactive parameterized layout algorithms. As a proof of concept, examples are drawn from a working prototype that incorporates this methodology.
