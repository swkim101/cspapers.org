The panel will discuss emerging “industrial” solutions that help programmers to develop distributed and client/server applications based on objects supporting so-called openness and heterogeneity.
The goal of the panel is to help answer the question whether there can be one single solution or whether various (integrated) approaches are needed. The panel will also compare industrial solutions such as COM, DSOM, CORBA and OODCE with results that came out of academia. Finally, a set of questions will be answered by each panelist according to the approach he will propose.
