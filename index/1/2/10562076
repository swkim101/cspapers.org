Leakage is the most important factor for unaccounted losses in any pipe network around the world. Most state of the art leak detection systems have limited applicability, lack in reliability and depend on user experience for data extraction. This paper is about a novel system for robotic pipe integrity inspection. Unlike existing systems, detection in based on the presence of a pressure gradient in the neighborhood of a leak. This phenomenon is translated into force measurements via a specially designed and instrumented mechanical embodiment (detector). In this paper an analytic dynamic model of the robotic detector is derived and studied. A prototype is built and the main concepts are validated via experiments.
