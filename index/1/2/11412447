This is the first demonstration of a modular and reconfigurable magnetic-manipulation system with integral ferromagnetic material. This system-which includes multiple Omnimagnets, each comprising three orthogonal solenoids and a spherical ferromagnetic core-is capable of dexterous manipulation of a magnetic tool. The magnetization coupling of an arbitrary arrangement of spherical ferromagnetic cores is solved, enabling an analytical solution for the magnetic forces and torques. Thus, the system does not require extensive field maps or in situ field characterization. If the positions and orientations of the Omnimagnets are sensed, the Omnimagnets can be actively rearranged during manipulation while maintaining control of the tool. This could enable new capabilities in medical procedures because the manipulation system can be modified to accommodate the imaging systems and enable physician access without loss of control. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated through five-degree-of-freedom manipulation (position and heading) of a permanent-magnetic tool with several arbitrary Omnimagnet configurations.
