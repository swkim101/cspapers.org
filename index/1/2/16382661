This paper introduces column caching, a exible mechanism that allows software to dynamically customize cache behavior through ne-grain control of its placement policy. For a set-associative cache, speci c data can be restricted to a subset of the usual target cache set during replacement. Through this simple enhancement, column caching enables the cache to be partitioned. When done properly, this improves cache utilization through both constructive and destructive interference, leading to overall better system performance. Column caching provides a basic mechanism which can emulate many di erent hard-wired specializations, such as dedicated SRAM and separate temporal and spatial cache, and further o ers the advantage of dynamical repartitioning under software control. This paper introduces column caching, describes possible implementations and presents a few example usages including preliminary performance numbers.
