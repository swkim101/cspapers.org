Within the field of Design Automation, the term “data base” has generally lacked a precise definition, but it usually describes a system which integrates, organizes, and controls a large amount of data. In this paper, we will examine two approaches to implementing a CAD data base - an MIS-type system where one logical and one physical representation of data exist, and an alternate system where one logical data base structure is physically utilized many times. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the second approach, which we implemented at Raytheon.
