Some important concepts in serial data communications may be demonstrated “live” in the lectureroom using a PC equipped with videoprojector, analog input board, and pickup circuitry. The apparatus displays the wave-shape of the serial signal, along with characters sent or received. It has proven useful for “seeing” the signal and for exploring hardware/software setttings, cable type, cable length and other characteristics of a serial interface./
