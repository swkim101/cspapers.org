The Process Design Engineering Program, under the direction of the Ballistic Missile Defense Advanced Technology Center, has as its objective the development of a unified software engineering discipline addressing all software development problems from receipt of software requirements to delivery of the operational software system. During the first two years of this program, initial process design engineering and management procedures were developed which led to the systematic top-down development of real-time software processes. A prototype set of software tools to support these procedures was designed and implemented as Process Design System 1 (PDS 1 ), and an experimental BMD baseline software process was then designed and implemented using these techniques and tools.
 The baseline experiment demonstrated that although the basic concepts employed were effective for the tactical software (1), there were several deficiencies in the process design tools. The most important deficiency stemmed from the fact that the system was designed to support the development of only the tactical software. This resulted in the operating system software (the most difficult component) being implemented without the aid of PDS and in assembly language at cost of thirty percent of the budget for nine percent of the code. Additional problem areas were the lack of positive control over data accessing, inadequate data structuring capability, and the interruption and synchronization of operations.
