With the advent of the 'big data' era, there are unprecedented opportunities and challenges to explore complex and large datasets. In the paper, we introduce Polyspector, a web-based interactive visualization platform optimized for interactive visual analysis with two distinguishing features. Firstly, a visualization-specific database engine based on pixel-aware aggregation is implemented to generate views of hundreds of millions of data items within a second even with an off-the-shelf PC. Secondly, a novel deep-linking mechanism, combined with the pixel-aware aggregation, is exploited to realize interactive visual analysis interfaces such as zooming, overview + detail, context + focus etc.
