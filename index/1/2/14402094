We describe a recurrent connectionist network, called CONCERT, that uses a set of melodies written in a given style to compose new melodies in that style. CONCERT is an extension of a traditional algorithmic composition technique in which transition tables specify the probability of the next note as a function of previous context. A central ingredient of CONCERT is the use of a psychologically-grounded representation of pitch.
