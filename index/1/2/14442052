Structured design has been widely used in the software industry with good results. On the other hand, program development hand-in-hand with program-correctness proof techniques has shown promising signs for future software development. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between structured design and program development with proofs. Three basic constructs used in structure charts have been modified to incorporate guarded commands. Software design can be proved informally using the modified structure charts. With this technique, the benefits of both structured design and program correctness proofs can be applied to the development of large programs.
