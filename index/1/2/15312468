This paper describes a software user interface that enables programmers to provide and maintain online aids in an interactive system. Through the interface, users are given a set of consistent and unobtrusive aids that display summary information, command descriptions, explanations of error messages, and other online documentation. The interface is presented here from the views of both the end-user and the programmer.
