The difficult language in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents a challenge to patientsâ€™ understanding of their own conditions. One approach to lowering the barrier is to provide tailored patient education based on their own EHR notes. We are developing a system to retrieve EHR note-tailored online consumer oriented health education materials. We explored topic model and key concept identification methods to construct queries from the EHR notes. Our experiments show that queries using identified key concepts with pseudo-relevance feedback significantly outperform (over 10-fold improvement) the baseline system of using the full text note.
