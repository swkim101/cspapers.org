Due to mobility, energy limitations, and unreliable wireless channels, applications running on mobile devices suffer from faults such as temporary disconnection and data loss. We, therefore, need a fault tolerance mechanism to guarantee their smooth working and performance. In this paper, we present a novel proxy-based uncoordinated checkpointing scheme with pessimistic message logging for efficient fault recovery in mobile Grid system. Simulation results show that this scheme is reliable, efficient and, at the sametime, consumes less network traffic.
