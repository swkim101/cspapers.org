The challenge of aerial robotic physical interaction towards inspection of infrastructure facilities through contact is the main motivation of this paper. A hybrid model predictive control framework is proposed, based on which a typical quadrotor vehicle becomes capable of stable physical interaction, accurate trajectory tracking on environmental surfaces as well as force control with only minor structural adaptations. Convex optimization techniques enabled the explicit computation of such a controller which accounts for the dynamics in free-flight and during physical interaction, ensures the stability of the hybrid system as well as response optimality, while respecting system constraints and imposed logical rules. This control framework is further extended to include obstacle avoidance capabilities. Extensive experimental studies that included complex “aerial-writing” tasks, interaction with non-planar and textured surfaces and obstacle avoidance maneuvers, indicate the efficiency of the approach and the potential capabilities of such aerial robotic physically interacting operations.
