A parameterized family of non-linear, link analytic ranking functions is proposed that includes Pagerank as a special case and uses the convexity property of those functions to be more resistant to link spam attacks. A contribution of the paper is the construction of such a scheme with provable uniqueness and convergence guarantees. The paper also demonstrates that even in an unlabelled scenario this family can have spam resistance comparable to Trustrank [3] that uses labels of spam or nat-spam on a training set. The proposed method can use labels, if available, to improve its performance to provide state of the art level of link spam protection.
