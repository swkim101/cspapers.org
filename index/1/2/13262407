ARGuE (Advanced Research Guard for Experimentation) is a prototype guard being developed as a basis for experimentation. ARGuE is based on Network Associates' Gauntlet firewall. By integrating capabilities developed under several government programs, we were able to create a system which is easier to extend than other guards, provides significant new features (such as integration with an intrusion detection system), and yet has a reasonable degree of assurance.
