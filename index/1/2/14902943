Source to source translation tools provide a way of integrating the strengths of production programming environments like C/UNIX#8482; with rapid prototyping environments like Smalltalk-80#8482; into a comprehensive hybrid environment that spans more of the software development life-spiral than ever before. This paper describes a tool-assisted process for translating Smalltalk-80 programs into Objective-C#8482;, and shows how the tool, called Producer, is used in practice. To assist others in using this translation tool, we have made Producer publicly available without charge on USENET.
