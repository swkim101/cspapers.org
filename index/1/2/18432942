An approach to the implementation and simulation of system software for multicomputer architectures is described. OASIS, a variant of the SIMULA 67 language, provides tools for both hardware modelling and system software development. The latter includes an extensible module type with flexible intermodule access control. Hardware is characterized at the processor/memory level so that system software resource control and allocation policies can be implemented at a functional level. Concurrent module execution by multiple processors, with or without shared memory, can be simulated directly. The OASIS modules in such a simulation can closely parallel the structure of actual system software. Thus, once a design is shown viable by simulation, the implementation of actual software can be a simple translation of OASIS modules. A brief overview of OASIS features is presented followed by a simple example.
