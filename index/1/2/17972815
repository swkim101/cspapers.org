The paper argues that Napoleon, a flexible, role-based access control (RBAC) modeling environment, is also a practical solution for enforcing business process control, or workflow policies. Napoleon provides two important benefits for workflow: simplified policy management and support for heterogeneous, distributed systems. We discuss our strategy for modeling workflow in Napoleon, and we present an architecture that incorporates Napoleon into a workflow management system.
