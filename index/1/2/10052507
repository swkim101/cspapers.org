Partitioned global address space (PGAS) programming models have been identified as one of the few viable approaches for dealing with emerging many-core systems. These models tend to generate many small messages, which requires specific support from the network interface hardware to enable efficient execution. In the past, Cray included E-registers on the Cray T3E to support the SHMEM API; however, with the advent of multi-core processors, the balance of computation to communication capabilities has shifted toward computation. This paper explores the message rates that are achievable with multi-core processors and simplified PGAS support on a more conventional network interface. For message rate tests, we find that simple network interface hardware is more than sufficient. We also find that even typical data distributions, such as cyclic or block-cyclic, do not need specialized hardware support. Finally, we assess the impact of such support on the well known RandomAccess benchmark.
