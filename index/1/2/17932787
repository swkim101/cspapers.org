The face of the student body in post-secondary degree programs in the United States is changing as an increasing number of students work full-time while attaining an advanced degree [13]. As the student population includes greater numbers of working professionals, a corresponding change in the instructional approaches used to educate the maturing student population is required. Knowles' theory of andragogy [9] is a set of principles that can be used to guide adult learning. This paper describes an application of andragogy to a graduate-level Web Technologies course comprised of working professional students. In this paper, the working professional is characterized and an educational philosophy based on the theory of andragogy is presented. The application of andragogy to a Web Technologies course is described and the results are discussed.
