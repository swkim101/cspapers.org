Integrated environmental management in urban areas is nowadays considered as a sine qua non objective of Community and national environmental and development policies. Large amounts of scientific information on the state of the environment are now available from a large pool of data sources. This work presents the on-going research efforts at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission towards integration of these data sources and effective coupling of the environmental information with appropriate models and decision-support tools. State-of-theart data fusion techniques and inference systems are used in an integrated environment in support of multi-criteria environmental assessment and policy-making.
