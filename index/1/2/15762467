Several standard text-categorization techniques were applied to the problem of automated essay grading. Bayesian independence classi(cid:12)ers and k-nearest-neighbor classi(cid:12)ers were trained to assign scores to manually-graded essays. These scores were combined with several other summary text measures using linear regression. The classi(cid:12)ers and regression equations were then applied to a new set of essays. The classi(cid:12)ers worked very well. The agreement between the automated grader and the (cid:12)nal manual grade was as good as the agreement between human graders.
