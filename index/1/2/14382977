We design simple real-time algorithms for the following problems for any text string T = tltz...tn and pattern string P = plpz...pm: (a) given T#P as input, test whether Pfi is a substring of T, and (b) given T#P as input, test whether P is a substring of T. Even though these results were claimed in a voluminous paper by Slisenko, the design of a convincing and underst anrlable solution is a well-known open problem. Our algorithm is based on a novel top-down suffix tree construction algorithm. This algorithm does not construct the suffix tree in real-time; but. it constructs enough of the suffix tree in real-time so that it can respond to pattern match queries in real-time.
