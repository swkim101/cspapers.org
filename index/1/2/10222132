Multi-path TCP (MP-TCP) has the potential to greatly improve application performance by using multiple paths transparently. We propose a fluid model for a large class of MP-TCP algorithms and identify design criteria that guarantee the existence, uniqueness, and stability of system equilibrium. We characterize algorithm parameters for TCP-friendliness and prove an inevitable tradeoff between responsiveness and friendliness. We discuss the implications of these properties on the behavior of existing algorithms and motivate a new design that generalizes existing algorithms. We use ns2 simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithm and illustrate its superior overall performance.
