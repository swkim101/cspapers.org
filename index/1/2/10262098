A tufting machine utilizing a plurality of yarn ends proceeding through a single needle cooperates with a yarn tension device which selectively applies a different tension to at least one of the plurality of yarn ends proceeding through the needle. Accordingly, a pattern or design can be provided in tufted fabric as the lower tension (higher speed) yarn ends will extend a higher distance from a fabric than lower tension yarn ends.
