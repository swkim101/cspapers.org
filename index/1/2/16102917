It is a challenging task to identify sentiment polarity of Chinese reviews because the resources for Chinese sentiment analysis are limited. Instead of leveraging only monolingual Chinese knowledge, this study proposes a novel approach to leverage reliable English resources to improve Chinese sentiment analysis. Rather than simply projecting English resources onto Chinese resources, our approach first translates Chinese reviews into English reviews by machine translation services, and then identifies the sentiment polarity of English reviews by directly leveraging English resources. Furthermore, our approach performs sentiment analysis for both Chinese reviews and English reviews, and then uses ensemble methods to combine the individual analysis results. Experimental results on a dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The individual analysis of the translated English reviews outperforms the individual analysis of the original Chinese reviews, and the combination of the individual analysis results further improves the performance.
