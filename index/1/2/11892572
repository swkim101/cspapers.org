This paper focuses on the design and quantitative characterization of a debriding tool integrated with a robotic system to treat osteolysis (bone degradation). Osteolysis typically occurs due to wear of the polyethylene liner of the acetabular implant after total hip replacement surgery. In less invasive treatment of osteolysis, surgeons conventionally use rigid tools to debride the lesion, however with these inflexible instruments, complex lesion shapes are not completely treatable (about 50%). To address this issue, we have developed a debriding tool that passes through the lumen of a continuum dexterous manipulator (CDM). Integration of the CDM with a robotic arm assists the surgeon to reach the desired region behind the implant. Performance of the debriding tool integrated with this system was quantitatively evaluated during a simulated robot-assisted lesion debriding scenario. Rotational speed, aspiration pressure and irrigation flow of the debriding tool, as well as the sweeping velocity of the robotic system were identified as effective parameters in this procedure. Results indicate that maximum efficiency of the tool is achievable in a particular combination of these parameters.
