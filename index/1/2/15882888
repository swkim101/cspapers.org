The selection of languages for use as pedagogical aids in the teaching of computer science is still a big issue at most universities. The rebellion against FORTRAN has given rise to numerous heirs to the throne, eg, PL/1, ALGOL, PASCAL, etc. In deciding how to resolve this issue small departments have to consider the effect the decision might have on the productivity of their faculty. The analysis of this problem as viewed at SIU-Carbondale is described within. The analysis is performed by applying a set of criteria to a list of potential languages.
