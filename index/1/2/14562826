We study the fundamental problem of finding the set of top-k edge colors that maximizes the reliability between a source node and a destination node in an uncertain and edge-colored graph. Our top-k reliable color set problem naturally arises in a variety of real-world applications including pathway finding in biological networks, topic-aware influence maximization, and team formation in social networks, among many others. In addition to the #P-completeness of the classical reliability finding problem between a source and a destination node over an uncertain graph, we prove that our problem is also NP-hard, and neither sub-modular, nor super-modular. To this end, we aim at designing effective and scalable solutions for the top-k reliable color set problem. We first introduce two baselines following the idea of repetitive inclusion of the next best edge colors, and we later develop a more efficient and effective algorithm that directly finds the highly-reliable paths while maintaining the budget on the number of edge-colors. An extensive empirical evaluation on various large-scale and real-world graph datasets illustrates that our proposed techniques are both scalable and highly accurate.
