Microprogramming has progressed from a method for systematically designing control units to its wide-spread application to the design, emulation, analysis, and implementation of instruction sets for general-purpose computers. The application was greatly enhanced through the family-oriented architectures of the IBM System 360 and on into the DEC PDP-11 family, culminating in the VAX family of machines. Today, systolic, VLSI, and VHSIC microarchitectures are demanding increased centralized microprogrammable control capability. However, microprogramming has always been a tedious, time consuming, difficult to verify and, therefore, costly exercise. A new rapid prototyping firmware (RPF) tool is described which ameliorates most of the problems.
