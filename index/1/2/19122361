Existing works have demonstrated the success of many complex ensemble systems that are typically conducted by firstly generating object proposals, and then extracting handcrafted and/or CNN features of each proposal for matching. However, object bounding box proposals and feature extraction are often conducted in two separated steps, thus the effectiveness of these methods collapses. Also, due to the large amount of generated proposals, matching speed becomes the bottleneck that limits its application to large-scale datasets. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose an effective and efficient Deep Region Hashing (DRH) approach for large-scale INS using an image patch as the query. Specifically, DRH is an end-to-end deep neural network which consists of object proposal, feature extraction, and hash code generation. DRH shares full-image convolutional feature map with the region proposal network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. Also, each high-dimensional, real-valued region features are mapped onto a low-dimensional, compact binary codes for the efficient object region level matching on large-scale dataset. Experimental results on four datasets show that our DRH can achieve even better performance than the state-of-the-arts in terms of mAP, while the efficiency is improved by nearly 100 times.
