Meaningful evaluation of web search must take account of spam. Here we conduct a user experiment to investigate whether satisfaction with search engine result pages as a whole is harmed more by spam or by irrelevant documents. On some measures, search result pages are differentially harmed by the insertion of spam and irrelevant documents. Additionally we find that when users are given two documents of equal utility, the one with the lower spam score will be preferred; a result page without any spam documents will be preferred to one with spam; and an irrelevant document high in a result list is surprisingly more damaging to user satisfaction than a spam document. We conclude that web ranking and evaluation should consider both utility (relevance) and "spamminess" of documents.
