Yoking-proofs show an interesting application in Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) that a verifier can check whether two tags are simultaneously scanned by a reader. We consider a scenario that multi-group of tags can be proved to be scanned simultaneously. Grouping-proof, which is an extension of yoking-proofs, allows multiple tags to be proved together, while existing protocols cannot support multiple groups. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept called "yoking-group proofs". Additionally, we propose an anonymous yoking-proof protocol and an anonymous yoking-group proof protocol and prove their security in Universal Composability framework.
