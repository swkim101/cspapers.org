This demonstration presents a completely new resource to support the multilingual information requirements of crosslanguage information retrieval and statistical machine translation. The resource can create both customized bilingual dictionaries and multilingual query mappings from a source language to many target languages. The resource coverage is broad (over 100 written languages can potentially be supported) and is truly multilingual as opposed to bilingual pairings. Our current prototype software maps between ten languages (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) but extensions to additional languages are straightforward. Our search for this new source of multilingual resources derives from a background of library research. The world's great research university libraries have book content which spans the world's languages. Through the o√Üces of the University of California Digital Library, we obtained a private copy of the University of California Book Catalog with 10,091,737 records, of which 4,626,793 were non-English. We utilized our entry vocabulary index technology (described in [1]) to create maximum likelihood mappings from Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) to words found in
