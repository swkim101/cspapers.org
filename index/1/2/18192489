Robots based on tensegrity structures have the potential to be robust, efficient and adaptable. While traditionally being difficult to control, recent control strategies for ball-shaped tensegrity robots have successfully enabled punctuated rolling, hill-climbing and obstacle climbing. These gains have been made possible through the use of machine learning and physics simulations that allow controls to be “learned” instead of being engineered in a top-down fashion. While effective in simulation, these emergent methods unfortunately give little insight into how to generalize the learned control strategies and evaluate their robustness. These robustness issues are especially important when applied to physical robots as there exists errors with respect to the simulation, which may prevent the physical robot from actually rolling. This paper describes how the robustness can be addressed in three ways: 1) We present a dynamic relaxation technique that describes the shape of a tensegrity structure given the forces on its cables; 2) We then show how control of a tensegrity robot “ball” for locomotion can be decomposed into finding its shape and then determining the position of the center of mass relative to the supporting polygon for this new shape; 3) Using a multi-step Monte Carlo based learning algorithm, we determine the structural geometry that pushes the center of mass out of the supporting polygon to provide the most robust basic mobility step that can lead to rolling. Combined, these elements will give greater insight into the control process, provide an alternative to the existing physics simulations and offer a greater degree of robustness to bridge the gap between simulation and hardware.
