Every solution seems to generate a new problem. The problem of accurately assessing public opinion led to the invention of the sample survey. The subsequent problem of analyzing survey responses brought widespread use of machine-readable data. The problem of preserving machine-readable data for secondary analysis stimulated the creation of data depositories or "archives." Growth over time in the holdings of these social science data archives, however, has aroused needs for improved retrieval of data. This paper explains one method of dealing with such needs. It involves an interactive search of the holdings of the most diversified social science data archive, the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, using a general-purpose information retrieval system, RIQS, written for CDC computers.
