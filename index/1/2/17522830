Modern infrastructures feature complex cyclic interdependencies and require a holistic restoration process. This paper presents the first scalable approach for the last-mile restoration of the joint electrical power and gas infrastructures. It builds on an earlier three-stage decomposition for restoring the power network that decouples the restoration ordering and the routing aspects. The key contributions of the paper are (1) mixed-integer programming models for finding a minimal restoration set and a restoration ordering and (2) a randomized adaptive decomposition to obtain high-quality solutions within the required time constraints. The approach is validated on a large selection of benchmarks based on the United States infrastructures and state-of-the-art weather and fragility simulation tools. The results show significant improvements over current field practices.
