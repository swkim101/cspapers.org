Efficient web caching in mobile apps eliminates unnecessary network traffic, reduces web accessing latency, and improves smartphone battery life. However, recent research has indicated that current mobile apps suffer from poor implementations of web caching. In this work, we first conducted a comprehensive survey of over 1000 Android apps to identify how different types of mobile apps perform in web caching. Based on our analysis, we designed CacheKeeper, an OS web caching service transparent to mobile apps for smartphones. CacheKeeper can not only effectively reduce overhead caused by poor web caching of mobile apps, but also utilizes cross-app caching opportunities in smartphones. Furthermore, CacheKeeper is backward compatible, meaning that existing apps can take advantage of CacheKeeper without any modifications. We have implemented a prototype of CacheKeeper in Linux kernel. Evaluation on 10 top ranked Android apps shows that our CacheKeeper prototype can save 42% networks traffic with real user browsing behaviors and increase web accessing speed by 2x under real 3G settings. Experiments also show that our prototype incurs negligible overhead in most aspects on cache misses.
