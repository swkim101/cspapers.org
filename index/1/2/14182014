Hydro Muscles are linear actuators resembling ordinary biological muscles in terms of active dynamic output, passive material properties and appearance. The passive and dynamic characteristics of the latex based Hydro Muscle are addressed. The control tests of modular muscles are presented together with a muscle model relating sensed quantities with net force. Hydro Muscles are discussed in the context of conventional actuators. The hypothesis that Hydro Muscles have greater efficiency than McKibben Muscles is experimentally verified. Hydro Muscle peak efficiency with (without) back flow consideration was 88% (27%). Possible uses of Hydro Muscles are illustrated by relevant robotics projects at WPI. It is proposed that Hydro Muscles can also be an excellent educational tool for moderate-budget robotics classrooms and labs; the muscles are inexpensive (in the order of standard latex tubes of comparable size), made of off-the-shelf elements in less than 10 minutes, easily customizable, lightweight, biologically inspired, efficient, compliant soft linear actuators that are adept for power-augmentation. Moreover, a single source can actuate many muscles by utilizing control of flow and/or pressure. Still further, these muscles can utilize ordinary tap water and successfully operate within a safe range of pressures not overly exceeding standard water household pressure of about 0.59 MPa (85 psi).
