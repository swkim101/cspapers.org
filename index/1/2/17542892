Recent research in spin torque nano-oscillators (STNO) have opened the possibility of using electron spin to generate sustained microwave oscillations. Furthermore, the experimental verification of synchronization of STNOs could allow communication and computation with nanoscaled oscillators. In this paper, we propose a hybrid MOSFET/STNO array which can be used for pattern recognition applications. First, we show that an array of electrically coupled STNOs obey the dynamics of Kuramoto's weakly coupled oscillators [1]. This behavior allows us to use the STNO array to implement the oscillatory neurocomputer proposed by Hoppensteadt et. al. [2]. We next consider practical STNO device geometries which can be used in a parallel-connected array. We propose using a dual barrier magnetic tunnel junction (DMTJ) to produce strong, harmonic oscillation signals in the absence on an external magnetic field. Finally, we perform HSPICE simulations of a hybrid MOSFET/STNO array to show how it can be used for pattern recognition.
