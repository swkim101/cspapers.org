We address the question of how resource-aware concepts can be utilized in motion planning algorithms. Resource-awareness facilitate better resource allocation on global system level, e.g. when a humanoid robot needs to distribute and schedule a wide variety of concurrent algorithms. We present a motion planning approach that employs self-monitoring concepts in order to identify the difficulty of the planning problem. Resources are requested dynamically and adapted based on problem difficulty and current planning progress. We show how dynamic adaptation of resource allocation on algorithmic level can reduce the system workload as compared to static resource allocation while meeting Quality of Service (QoS) measures such as average workload or efficiency. We evaluate our approach both in several synthetic setups with varying difficulty and with the humanoid robot ARMAR-4.
