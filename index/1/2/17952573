An experimental graphical control specification system, called Panther, has been written in C for UNIXÂ®-based applications. Unlike similar systems, which focus on combining interaction techniques, Panther allows the specification of low-level interactions by invoking user-selectable subroutines for input-device transitions. A Panther interface is specified in a textual table as a set of hierarchically nested regions. Regions can model any control device, such as menu buttons, slider-bars, switches, alphanumeric displays, or even combinations of other regions. Panther does not rely on special hardware, extensive software, or interprocess communication.
