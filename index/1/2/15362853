Extracting advertising keywords from web-pages is important in keyword-based online advertising. Previous works have attempted to extract advertising keywords from the whole content of a web-page. However, in some scenarios, it is necessary to extract keywords from just the URL string itself. In this work, we propose an algorithm for extracting advertising keywords from the URL string alone. Our algorithm has applications in contextual and paid search advertising. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm on publisher URLs and show that it produces very good quality keywords that are comparable with keywords produced by page based extractors.
