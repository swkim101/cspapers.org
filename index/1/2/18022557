The automatic assessment of the level of independence of a person, based on the recognition of a set of Activities of Daily Living, is among the most challenging research fields in Ambient Intelligence. The article proposes a framework for the recognition of motion primitives, relying on Gaussian Mixture Modeling and Gaussian Mixture Regression for the creation of activity models. A recognition procedure based on Dynamic Time Warping and Mahalanobis distance is found to: (i) ensure good classification results; (ii) exploit the properties of GMM and GMR modeling to allow for an easy run-time recognition; (iii) enhance the consistency of the recognition via the use of a classifier allowing unknown as an answer.
