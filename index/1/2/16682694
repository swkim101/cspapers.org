We demonstrate the use of a digital signal processing board to construct hybrid networks consisting of computer model neurons connected to a biological neural network. This system operates in real time, and the synaptic connections are realistic effective conductances. Therefore, the synapses made from the computer model neuron are integrated correctly by the postsynaptic biological neuron. This method provides us with the ability to add additional, completely known elements to a biological network and study their effect on network activity. Moreover, by changing the parameters of the model neuron, it is possible to assess the role of individual conductances in the activity of the neuron, and in the network in which it participates.
