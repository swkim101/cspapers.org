In this tool demonstration we present an implementation for interactively validating requirements for multi-user software systems and the processes they support with end users. The tool combines the advantages of requirements animation and scenario synthesis to gather stakeholder feedback and create a common understanding amongst stakeholders. Additionally, the users' behavior during the simulation is captured and used to automatically derive new behavioral specifications.
