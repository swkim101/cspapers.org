Aggregated search is the task of blending results from different search services, or verticals, into a set of web search results. Aggregated search coherence is the extent to which results from different sources focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. Prior work investigated the "spill-over" effect between a set of blended vertical results and the web results. These studies found that users are more likely to interact with the web results when the vertical results are more consistent with the user's intended query-sense. We extend this prior work by investigating three new research questions: (1) Does the spill-over effect generalize across different verticals? (2) Does the vertical rank moderate the level of spill-over? and (3) Does the presence of a border around the vertical results moderate the level of spill-over? We investigate four different verticals (images, news, shopping, and video) and measure spill-over using interaction measures associated with varying levels of engagement with the web results (bookmarks, clicks, scrolls, and mouseovers). Results from a large-scale crowdsourced study suggest that: (1) The spill-over effect generalizes across verticals, but is stronger for some verticals than others, (2) Vertical rank has a stronger moderating effect for verticals with a mid-level of spill-over, and (3) Including a border around the vertical results has a subtle moderating effect for those verticals with a low level of spill-over.
