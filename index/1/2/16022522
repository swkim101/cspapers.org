This paper presents the modeling and control of a Flexure-Based Electromagnetic Linear Actuator (FELA) that is employed as a high-precision imprinting actuator of a desktop hot-embossing imprinter. In this work, a systematic approach of obtaining the unknown physical parameters of FELA is presented. Subsequently, these parameters are used to design two model-based PID controllers that allow the FELA to perform high-precision positioning tasks and directforce imprinting tasks respectively. As the imprinting tasks require the FELA to operate in both position and direct-force control modes, two types of control strategies are explored and their competency of enabling the FELA to perform such tasks are investigated. Lastly, the selected control strategy is implemented on the FELA to assist the hot-embossing imprinter in fabricating micro-channels on polymer substrates via a hot-embossing process.
