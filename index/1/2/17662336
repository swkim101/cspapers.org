In this paper we present and compare two different approaches to the notion of relational role and connected issues. Both approaches are based on the introduction of the notion of qua-individual and on the reification of relations. We use a classical problem in the literature on roles, namely the counting problem, as testbed, and we show how the two approaches deal with it in a similar way. We nevertheless show that they are to be distinguished, examining several aspects emerging from their relation with the notion of trope.
