SUMMARY SIGCSE 2004 marked the official announcement of the ACM Java Task Force, which is working to develop a stable collection of pedagogical resources that will make it easier to teach Java to first-year computing students. The Task Force published a draft report in February 2005 and presented the highlights of that report at SIGCSE 2005. Based on the feedback we received at SIGCSE and in the comment period that extended over the next two months, the Task Force redesigned some features of the library packages and extended their capabilities in areas that seemed to be of particular importance to the community. The final report of the Task Force will be published in the fall of 2005. The purpose of the special session is to highlight the features of the Java packages described in the report and show how those packages can be used to enhance introductory computer science education. The work of the Java Task Force has been supported by funding from the ACM Education Board, the SIGCSE Special Projects Fund, and the National Science Foundation (NSF Award DUE-0411905).
