This document presents the design of a 6-degree of freedom fiberoptic force-torque-sensor for integration in instruments for minimally invasive robotic surgery. The measuring system based on fiber Bragg gratings as well as the calibration procedure are explained. Measurement properties of the sensor are verified in a test setup.
