Solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous state spaces is a challenge due to, among other problems. the well-known curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, numerous real-world applications such as transportation planning and telescope observation scheduling exhibit a critical dependence on continuous states. Current approaches to continuous-state MDPs include discretizing their transition models. In this paper, we propose and study an alternative, discretization-free approach we call lazy approximation. Empirical study shows that lazy approximation performs much better than discretization, and we successfully applied this new technique to a more realistic planetary rover planning problem.
