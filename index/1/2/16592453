The object-oriented modeling (OOM) workshop was held on Sunday October 5th, 1991 in conjunction with the OOPSLA'91 conference at the Hyatt Hotel Phoenix, Arizona. Participants were invited based on a short position paper. We received 12 position papers and invited all who submitted a paper. Attendance was limited to one author per paper to encourage maximum participation by each attendee. Only 11 authors were able to attend. The position papers were copied, bound, and sent to each participant by the 15th of September, 1991. The workshop goals were to identify the operational goals of Object-Oriented Models (OOM) and to identify the representation mechanisms that supported these goals. The participants had reviewed the position papers prior to the workshop and everyone made insightful observations and contributions. The workshop began with each participant defining on one slide their goals for OOM. This short presentation introduced each participant, their background, perspective, and goals for OOM. During the morning, the group brainstomled, refined, and clarified a set of OOM goals; these goals were then grouped them into categories. The afternoon session followed a similar format. The participants made presentations that identified their representation techniques and related to their goals. These representation techniques were discussed, criteria for OOMs were defined, the parts of an OOM were identified and defined, and future work that is needed on object-oriented modeling was identified. A short sumnmry of the workshop was given by the organizer, and the workshop concluded at approximately 5:00 PM. In section 1, we describe the activities and results of the discussion of OOM goals. In Section 2, the activities and results of the discussion on representation techniques for OOM are discussed. Section 3 is a summary followed by a list of the participants and their position papers.
