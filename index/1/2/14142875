This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a mobile robot with a limited sensory field-of-view in an unknown dynamic environment. In such a situation, the upper-bounded planning time prevents from computing a complete motion to the goal, partial motion planning is in order. Besides the presence of moving obstacles whose future behaviour is unknown precludes absolute motion safety (in the sense that no collision will ever take place whatever happens) is impossible to guarantee. The stance taken herein is to settle for a weaker level of motion safety called passive motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision takes place, the robot will be at rest. The primary contribution of this paper is PassPMP, a partial motion planner enforcing passive motion safety. PassPMP periodically computes a passively safe partial trajectory designed to drive the robot towards its goal state. Passive motion safety is handled using a variant of the Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS, i.e. states such that, whatever the future braking trajectory of the robot, a collision occurs before it is at rest. Simulation results demonstrate how PassPMP operates and handles limited sensory field-of-views, occlusions and moving obstacles with unknown future behaviour. More importantly, PassPMP is provably passively safe.
