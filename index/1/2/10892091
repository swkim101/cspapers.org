The Cooperative Education (CO-OP) Program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI&SU) and its impact in a Computer Science (CS) discipline are described. CO-OP certification and a comparison of the academic performance of the CO-OPing student and the non-CO-OPing student are discussed. In particular, the CS CO-OP students' attitudes on the program and their acquisition of knowledge outside the traditional classroom environment are presented. Options for earning academic credit in computer science, the growth of CO-OPing in computer science, and the typical job assignments and monetary compensation are also included.
