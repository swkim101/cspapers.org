Temporal logics have proven effective for correct-by-construction synthesis of controllers for a wide range of robotic applications. Receding horizon frameworks mitigate the computational intractability of reactive synthesis for temporal logic, but have thus far been limited by pursuing a single sequence of short horizon problems to the goal. We propose a receding horizon algorithm for reactive synthesis that automatically determines a path to the currently pursued goal at runtime, responding as needed to nondeterministic environment behavior. This is achieved by allowing each short horizon to have multiple local goals, and determining which local goal to pursue based on the current global goal, the currently perceived environment and a pre-computed invariant dependent on the global goal. We demonstrate the utility of this additional flexibility in grant-response tasks, using a search-and-rescue example. Moreover, we show that these goal-dependent invariants mitigate the conservativeness of the receding horizon approach.
