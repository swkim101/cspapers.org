This paper describes the tools and techniques used to allow students to produce a compiler in a ten-week term. Individualized subsets of ANSI-C source code are compiled to Motorola 68020 assembly language. The source-language specifications consist of eleven language features common to alI students, plus ten individually-prescribed features. The individuahzations am derived from student numbers, and ensure a reasonable degree of independent work. Students can aid each other, and are asked to give acknowledgements in their code to others who have aided them. Completed compilers are judged using a set of programs that invoke common language features only, plus an appropriate set containing individualized-language features.
