The integration of database and information retrieval techniques provides users with a wide range of high quality services. We present a prototype system, called NUITS, for efficiently processing keyword queries on top of a relational database. Our NUITS allows users to issue simple keyword queries as well as advanced keyword queries with conditions. The efficiency of keyword query processing and the user-friendly result display will also be addressed in this paper.
