We present integration mechanisms for combining heterogeneous components in a situated information processing system, illustrated by a cognitive robot able to collaborate with a human and display some understanding of its surroundings. These mechanisms include an architectural schema that encourages parallel and incremental information processing, and a method for binding information from distinct representations that when faced with rapid change in the world can maintain a coherent, though distributed, view of it. Provisional results are demonstrated in a robot combining vision, manipulation, language, planning and reasoning capabilities interacting with a human and manipulable objects.
