Cloud storage supplies enormous convenience for numerous companies and individuals to manage their data. However, data owners lose ultimately physical control of their data, which introduces many potential safety hazards in the cloud storage environment. Many scholars have made studies on the security problem of cloud storage data. To solve the problem, we propose a secure audit scheme supporting dynamic operation and transparent verification. Utilizing BLS short signature as well as the sequence-enforced B+ Hash Tree structure, the audit scheme is more effective. The scheme introduces an organizer in the auditing process to prevent the TPA from getting any information about the data's location. Thus, the scheme is completely transparent for TPA. Meanwhile, the scheme utilizes random mask and bilinear aggregate signature technology to realize privacy protection and batch audit.
