Two of the mechanisms for creating natural transitions between adjacent sentences in a text, resulting in local coherence, involve discourse relations and switches of focus of attention between discourse entities. These two aspects of local coherence have been traditionally discussed and studied separately. But some empirical studies have given strong evidence for the necessity of understanding how the two types of coherence-creating devices interact. Here we present a joint corpus study of discourse relations and entity coherence exhibited in news texts from the Wall Street Journal and test several hypotheses expressed in earlier work about their interaction.
