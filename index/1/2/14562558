In this paper, we consider a passive approach to tactile presentation based on changing the surface textures of objects that might naturally be handled by a user. This may allow devices and other objects to convey small amounts of information in very unobtrusive ways and with little attention demand. This paper considers several possible uses for this style of display and explores implementation issues. We conclude with results from our user study, which indicate that users can detect upwards of four textural states accurately with even simple materials.
