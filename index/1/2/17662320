We present WatchWriter, a finger operated keyboard that supports both touch and gesture typing with statistical decoding on a smartwatch. Just like on modern smartphones, users type one letter per tap or one word per gesture stroke on WatchWriter but in a much smaller spatial scale. WatchWriter demonstrates that human motor control adaptability, coupled with modern statistical decoding and error correction technologies developed for smartphones, can enable a surprisingly effective typing performance despite the small watch size. In a user performance experiment entirely run on a smartwatch, 36 participants reached a speed of 22-24 WPM with near zero error rate.
