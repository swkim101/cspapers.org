The use of pseudo-code and the stepwise refinement process in developing the logic of modules is discussed, and the advantages of this method are analyzed. An example is given to illustrate the steps to be taken in analyzing the function, selecting data structure and algorithm, abstracting the function in pseudo-code, expanding the function into subfunctions, and finally, verifying the function.
