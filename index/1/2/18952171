Although the states as well as the number representation of virtually every digital computer are implemented for the most part with binary logic, there are other systems such as the ternary or quinary that could just as well be used. The choice of which logic system to use should be determined primarily on the basis of cost, reliability, and operating speeds of the physical realization. This paper will be concerned with the potential of ternary logic, advantages of this logic, and whether in the future it could be expected to be utilized in digital systems.
