A new architecture for local area networks, based on the carry-lookahead circuit has been described in recent papers. It features a cost-effective hardware round-robin priority circuit, a bus and a shift register ring network that uses the same hardware. This paper shows that such an architecture can be used to minimize Î£ U<sub>i</sub> W<sub>i</sub> where U<sub>i</sub> is a real number urgency and W<sub>i</sub> is the waiting time of message i, where U<sub>i</sub> is a constant, or a time varying function which is a sequence of constant steps. Such a capability is useful in distributed real-time control systems. This paper demonstrates that a network that implements priority, bus and shift register ring-hardware can create new capabilities for local area networks.
