Commercial, coin-sized iButton temperature logger devices are well-suited for densely instrumenting large outdoor areas. An efficient workflow for deploying and maintaining those devices is necessary when striving to deploy and operate several hundreds of data logger devices. Additionally, a sophisticated data management is required for handling the emerging, large amounts of meta and measurement data. Therefore, we developed iAssist, a solution that integrates the handling of iButton data logger devices together with a GPS receiver and a digital camera for gathering accurate location information. iAssist efficiently supports the whole workflow consisting of deploying, relocating and reading tiny sensing systems. iAssist is especially tailored for outdoor operation asking for as little user interaction as possible.
