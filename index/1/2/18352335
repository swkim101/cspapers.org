In this paper, we present a medical record search system which is useful for identifying cohorts required in clinical studies. In particular, we propose a query-adaptive weighting method that can dynamically aggregate and score evidence in multiple medical reports (from different hospital departments or from different tests within the same department) of a patient. Furthermore, we explore several informative features for learning our retrieval model.
