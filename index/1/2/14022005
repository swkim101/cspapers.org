We consider the problem of bearing-based visual homing: Given a mobile robot which can measure bearing directions corresponding to known landmarks, the goal is to guide the robot toward a desired “home” location. We propose a control law based on the gradient field of a Lyapunov function, and give sufficient conditions for global convergence. We show that the well-known Average Landmark Vector method (for which no convergence proof was known) can be obtained as a particular case of our framework. We then derive a sliding mode control law for a unicycle model which follows this gradient field. Both controllers do not depend on range information. Finally, we also show how our framework can be used to characterize the sensitivity of a home location with respect to noise in the specified bearings.
