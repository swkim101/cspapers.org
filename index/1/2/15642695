CSCW research and groupware development represent converging interests from two contexts of interactive systems development. Issues of group dynamics and organizational impact have primarily been explored in the in-house development of systems for organizations â€” systems that support organizational goals. Similar issues are now being encountered by researchers and developers with a product development orientation who are seeking to support small groups. We have not integrated effectively the interests, experiences and approaches arising in these two development contexts. To do so, we have to go beyond what is shared and explore the differences.
