We consider that ultrasonic waves can be used not only for measuring the distance to a target but also for comprehending what the target is simultaneously. We assumed that the physical characteristics of a target object (especially, surface information) are embedded in the power spectrum structure of the ultrasonic waves reflected from the target. The results of our investigation to analyze the characteristics of the power spectrum structure of waves reflected from various kinds of target materials showed whether target objects are soft and deformable or hard and undeformable.
