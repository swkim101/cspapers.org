An experimental term selection strategy for document visualization is described. Strong discriminators with few co-occurrences increase the clustering tendency of low-dimensional document browsing spaces. Clustering tendency is tested with diagnostic measures adapted from the field of cluster analysis, and con6rrned using the VIBE visualization tool. This method supports browsing in high recall, low precision document retrieval and classification tasks.
