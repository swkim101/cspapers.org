In year 2015, we experience a proliferation of scientific publications, conferences and funding programs on KDD for medicine and healthcare. However, medical scholars and practitioners work differently from KDD researchers: their research is mostly hypothesis-driven, not data-driven. KDD researchers need to understand how medical researchers and practitioners work, what questions they have and what methods they use, and how mining methods can fit into their research frame and their everyday business. Purpose of this tutorial is to contribute to this learning process. We address medicine and healthcare; there the expertise of KDD scholars is needed and familiarity with medical research basics is a prerequisite. We aim to provide basics for (1) mining in epidemiology and (2) mining in the hospital. We also address, to a lesser extent, the subject of (3) preparing and annotating Electronic Health Records for mining.
