Ensemble feature selection where multiple feature selection outputs are combined to yield more robust results without sacrificing the performance is an effective method for stable feature selection. In order to make further improvements of the performance (classification accuracy), the diversity regularized ensemble feature weighting framework is presented, in which the base feature selector is based on local learning with logistic loss for its robustness to huge irrelevant features and small samples. At the same time, the sample complexity of the proposed ensemble feature weighting algorithm is analyzed based on the VC-theory. The experiments on different kinds of data sets show that the proposed ensemble method can achieve higher accuracy than other ensemble ones and other stable feature selection strategy (such as sample weighting) without sacrificing stability
