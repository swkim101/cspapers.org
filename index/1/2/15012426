Inhibitory synapse is an important component both in physiology and artificial neural network, which has been widely investigated and used. A typical inhibitory synapse in very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuit is simplified from related research and applied in a VLSI chip for spike train reregistration. The spike train reregistration network is derived from a neural network model for sensory map realignment for network adaptation. In this paper, we introduce the design of spike train registration in CMOS circuit and analyze the performance of the inhibitory network in it, which shows representative characters for the firing rate of inhibited neuron and information transmission in circuit compared to math model.
