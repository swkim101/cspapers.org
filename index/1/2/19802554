Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) refers to a query expansion strategy based on top-retrieved documents, which has been shown to be highly effective in many retrieval models. Previous work has introduced a set of constraints (axioms) that should be satisfied by any PRF model. In this paper, we propose three additional constraints based on the proximity of feedback terms to the query terms in the feedback documents. As a case study, we consider the log-logistic model, a state-of-the-art PRF model that has been proven to be a successful method in satisfying the existing PRF constraints, and show that it does not satisfy the proposed constraints. We further modify the log-logistic model based on the proposed proximity-based constraints. Experiments on four TREC collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constraints. Our modification the log-logistic model leads to significant and substantial (up to 15%) improvements. Furthermore, we show that the proposed proximity-based function outperforms the well-known Gaussian kernel which does not satisfy all the proposed constraints.
