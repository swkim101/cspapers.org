Optical depth cameras, including both time-of-flight and structured-light sensors, have led to dramatic improvements in robot sensing and perception. We propose the use of millimeter-wave (mmW) radar as an important complement to optical sensors. While the millimeter wavelengths of radar sensors do not support as high resolution as the nanometer wavelength of optical sensors, the ability of mmW signals to penetrate smoky and foggy environments as well as see through many opaque objects makes them a compelling sensor for navigation as well as manipulation in challenging environments. We present a series of 2D and 3D mmW images made with a hand-held antenna grasped by a PR2 robot. The radar image sensor uses a mechanical “painting” motion to acquire multiple views of the target object over the 15 - 26.5 GHz K-band. A GPU-based reconstruction algorithm synthesizes 2D and 3D images of the target object. We demonstrate a ground range resolution of 13.6 mm and a cross-range resolution of 7.1 mm for objects up to 0.5 m away from the robot. We further demonstrate imaging objects through fog, as well as through opaque paper.
