INTRODUCTION Support for concurrent programming, traditionally provided to the programmer by means of calls to operating system services, has received considerable attention from language designers in recent years. The goal of this effort has been to raise the level of abstraction of concurrent programming, providing ever more powerful language primitives, transferring responsibility for the details from the programmer to the compiler implementer, Indeed, what is happening now in concurrent programming echoes what happened in sequential “structured programming” perhaps fifteen years ago.
