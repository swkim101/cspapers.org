Sensor technologies have been adapted to performing arts, and owing to the recent advancement of low-cost mobile electroencephalography devices, brain-computer interface (BCI) is integrated to dance performances as well. Nevertheless, BCI is less accessible to artists compared to other sensors because signal processing and machine learning are required. This paper proposes a work-in-progress example of BCI applications for performances that has been designed in collaboration with contemporary dancers. Its contribution is that the piece is not an add-on to a performance, but the implementation reflects practices of contemporary dance.
