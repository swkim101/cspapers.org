Harmonic broadcasting was introduced by Juhn and Tseng as a way to reduce the bandwidth requirements required for video-on-demand broadcasting. In this paper, we note that harmonic broadcasting is actually a special case of the priority encoded transmission scheme introduced by Albanese et al. and prove---using an information theoretic argument---that it is impossible to achieve the design goals of harmonic broadcasting using a shorter encoding.
