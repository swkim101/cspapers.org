In this paper, we show how pattern matching can be seen to arise from a proof term assignment for the focused sequent calculus. This use of the Curry-Howard correspondence allows us to give a novel coverage checking algorithm, and makes it possible to give a rigorous correctness proof for the classical pattern compilation strategy of building decision trees via matrices of patterns.
