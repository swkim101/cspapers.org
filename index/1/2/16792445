Precision at k documents retrieved (P@k), a common measure of information retrieval performance, is the fraction of relevant documents in the first k returned by an information retrieval system in response to a query. It has been observed that P@k increases with collection size, all other variables being equal. An explanation for this increase derives from the probability ranking principle: information retrieval systems score documents by likelihood of relevance and return the documents in decreasing order of score. In a larger collection there are more high-scoring documents and therefore the average score of the first k will be higher, resulting in higher P@k.
