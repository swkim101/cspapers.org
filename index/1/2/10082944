We explore the visual recognition problem from a main data view when an auxiliary data view is available during training. This is important because it allows improving the training of visual classifiers when paired additional data is cheaply available, and it improves the recognition from multi-view data when there is a missing view at testing time. The problem is challenging because of the intrinsic asymmetry caused by the missing auxiliary view during testing. We account for such view during training by extending the information bottleneck method, and by combining it with risk minimization. In this way, we establish an information theoretic principle for leaning any type of visual classifier under this particular setting. We use this principle to design a large-margin classifier with an efficient optimization in the primal space. We extensively compare our method with the state-of-the-art on different visual recognition datasets, and with different types of auxiliary data, and show that the proposed framework has a very promising potential.
