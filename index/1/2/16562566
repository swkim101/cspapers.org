 
 We propose revisions to the research agenda in Automated Planning. The proposal is based on a review of the role of the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) in the activities of the AI planning community and the impact of PDDL on parts of its research agenda. We specifically show how specific properties of PDDL have impacted research on planning, by putting emphasis on certain research topics and complicating others. We argue that the development of more advanced modeling languages would be — analogously to the impact PDDL has had — a low overhead and smooth route for the ICAPS community shift its research focus to increasingly promising and relevant research topics.
