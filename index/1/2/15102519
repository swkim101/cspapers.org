Managing and querying Semantic Web are important issues for Semantic Web applications. Therefore, we have developed a Semantic Web database system with logically and physically optimized SPARQL engines to manage and query RDF data, named LuposDate. In order to present the functionalities of the LUPOSDATE system and engines, we have developed an online demonstration, which is available at http://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/index.php?id=luposdate-demo.
