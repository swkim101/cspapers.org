SwissQM is a novel sensor network platform for acquiring data from the real world. Instead of statically hand-crafted programs, SwissQM is a virtual machine capable of executing bytecode programs on the sensor nodes. By using a central and intelligent gateway, it is possible to either push aggregation and other operations into the network, or to execute them on the gateway. Since the gateway is built in an entirely modular style, it can be dynamically extended with new functionality such as user interfaces, user defined functions, or additional query optimizations. The goal of this demonstration is to show the flexibility and the unique features of SwissQM.
