However, the sparse representation is performed for each datum separately without taking into account the geometric structure of the data. Motivated by L1-Graph and manifold leaning, we propose Laplacian Regularized L1-Graph (LRℓ1-Graph) for data clustering. The sparse representations of LRℓ1-Graph are regularized by the geometric information of the data so that they vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold by the graph Laplacian according to the manifold assumption. Moreover, we propose an iterative regularization scheme, where the sparse representation obtained from the previous iteration is used to build the graph Laplacian for the current iteration of regularization. The experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared to L1-Graph and other competing clustering methods.
