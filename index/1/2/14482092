Some problems are discussed that arise for incremental processing using certain flexible categorial grammars, which involve either undesirable parsing properties or failure to allow combinations useful to incrementality. We suggest a new calculus which, though 'designed' in relation to categorial interpretations of some notions of dependency grammar, seems to provide a degree of flexibility that is highly appropriate for incremental interpretation. We demonstrate how this grammar may be used for efficient incremental parsing, by employing normalisation techniques.
