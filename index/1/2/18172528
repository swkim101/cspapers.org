The performance sensitivity of Albus' CMAC network was studied for the scenario in which faults are introduced into the adjustable weights after training has been accomplished. It was found that fault sensitivity was reduced with increased generalization when "loss of weight" faults were considered, but sensitivity was increased for "saturated weight" faults.
