Recent extensions of the Perceptron as the Tempotron and the Chronotron suggest that this theoretical concept is highly relevant for understanding networks of spiking neurons in the brain. It is not known, however, how the computational power of the Perceptron might be accomplished by the plasticity mechanisms of real synapses. Here we prove that spike-timing-dependent plasticity having an anti-Hebbian form for excitatory synapses as well as a spike-timing-dependent plasticity of Hebbian shape for inhibitory synapses are sufficient for realizing the original Perceptron Learning Rule if these respective plasticity mechanisms act in concert with the hyperpolarisation of the post-synaptic neurons. We also show that with these simple yet biologically realistic dynamics Tempotrons and Chronotrons are learned. The proposed mechanism enables incremental associative learning from a continuous stream of patterns and might therefore underly the acquisition of long term memories in cortex. Our results underline that learning processes in realistic networks of spiking neurons depend crucially on the interactions of synaptic plasticity mechanisms with the dynamics of participating neurons.
