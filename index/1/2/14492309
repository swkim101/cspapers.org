This paper proposes using a 2D waveguide for a novel means of authentication in public Wi-Fi infrastructures. The design of the system is presented, and its practicability and usability is comparatively discussed with that of five other tag and context based authentication schemes, two of which have not been previously realized. In accordance with the presented application scenarios, all of the schemes were implemented in a platform-independent fashion built on web technology.
