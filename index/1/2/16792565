In this paper we review and qualitatively evaluate schemes to maintain cache coherence in tightly-coupled multiprocessor systems. This leads us to propose a more economical (hardware-wise), expandable and modular variation of the “global directory” approach. Protocols for this solution are described. Performance evaluation studies indicate the limits (number of processors, level of sharing) within which this approach is viable.
