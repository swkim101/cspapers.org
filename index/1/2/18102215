We have tabulated retrieval effectiveness claims from a large number of information retrieval research papers from 1998â€“2008, a period that has seen many innovations. The results of our analysis are not encouraging. Over this period, although a great many papers claimed significant effectiveness improvements, there has been no overall gain in absolute retrieval effectiveness on TREC ad hoc collections. A decade of development has not, it appears, led to better systems. To promote verifiable improvement, reporting practices that allow rigorous comparison with prior results are needed. We propose several measures: ongoing longitudinal surveys; better reporting of baselines and use of standard systems; and use of resources such as our evaluatIR.org, an accessible database of test results.
