In this paper, we propose an attention-aware deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) method for video face recognition, which aims to discard the misleading and confounding frames and find the focuses of attentions in face videos for person recognition. We formulate the process of finding the attentions of videos as a Markov decision process and train the attention model through a deep reinforcement learning framework without using extra labels. Unlike existing attention models, our method takes information from both the image space and the feature space as the input to make better use of face information that is discarded in the feature learning process. Besides, our approach is attention-aware, which seeks different attentions of videos for the recognition of different pairs of videos. Our approach achieves very competitive video face recognition performance on three widely used video face datasets.
