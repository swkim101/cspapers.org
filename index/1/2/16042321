In this paper we propose a new method of affective cognitive of  images. We use  9  pictures that constitute the famous psychologist  Furnham’s Shape & Color  Test as standard templates. In the HSV color space, we get a vector which has 72 dimensions by using part-division method on color character.¿and color characters are normalized¿ We measure the template image and other images the similarity with euclidean distance method¿final display expression of different expression variation.
