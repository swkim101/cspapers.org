In this paper, we explain the mobile robot localization system, which consists of ultrasonic emitters and receiving sensor array. Two or more ultrasonic emitters are installed on the beacon, which is also a charging station and ultrasonic signal receivers on the robot pick up the signal from the beacon. Based on the time measurement of the traveled ultrasonic waves, the robot determines its distance and orientation relative to the beacon. This system is actually deployed in the commercial cleaning robot, Roboking, released in the market in late 2004.
