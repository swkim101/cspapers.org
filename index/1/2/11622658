We study differentially private mechanisms for answering smooth queries on databases consisting of data points in ℝd. A K-smooth query is specified by a function whose partial derivatives up to order K are all bounded. We develop an e-differentially private mechanism which for the class of K-smooth queries has accuracy $O (\left{n}^{-\frac{K}{2d+K}}/\epsilon)$). The mechanism first outputs a summary of the database. To obtain an answer of a query, the user runs a public evaluation algorithm which contains no information of the database. Outputting the summary runs in time $O(n^{1+\frac{d}{2d+K}})$, and the evaluation algorithm for answering a query runs in time $\tilde O (n^{\frac{d+2+\frac{2d}{K}}{2d+K}} )$. Our mechanism is based on L∞-approximation of (transformed) smooth functions by low degree even trigonometric polynomials with small and efficiently computable coefficients.
