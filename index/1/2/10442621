Although many problems in MAX-SNP admit a PTAS for dense graphs, that is not the case for Vertex Cover, which is MAX-SNP hard even for dense graphs. This paper presents a randomized approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover on dense graphs, i.e., graphs whose average degree <i>d</i> is Ω(<i>n</i>). (i) Our algorithm improves the best-known bound for the approximation factor by Karpinski and Zelikovsky. For example, our bound is 2/1 + d/2Δ for dense graphs such that |<i>E</i>| ≤ Δ(<i>n</i> - Δ) where Δ is the maximum degree. The improvement is especially large when <i>d</i> ≈ Δ; if <i>d</i> ≥ 2/3Δ for instance, our bound is at most 1.5 while the previous bound approaches to 2.0 as <i>n</i>/Δ increases. (ii) It achieves the same factor for a wider range of graphs, i.e., for the graphs whose Δ is Ω(<i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>/log <i>n</i>). (iii) It is probably optimal in the sense that if we can achieve a better approximation factor by Δ > 0 for the above range of graphs, then we can achieve a factor of 2 - Δ for general graphs.
