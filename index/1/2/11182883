Word sense disambiguation is typically phrased as the task of labeling a word in context with the best-fitting sense from a sense inventory such as WordNet. While questions have often been raised over the choice of sense inventory, computational linguists have readily accepted the best-fitting sense methodology despite the fact that the case for discrete sense boundaries is widely disputed by lexical semantics researchers. This paper studies graded word sense assignment, based on a recent dataset of graded word sense annotation.
