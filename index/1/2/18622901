We present a drift-free pose estimation scheme for rigid body and its supporting platform by fusing only two gyroscopes and the relative complementary measurements. The fusion design not only provides robust relative attitude estimation between the rigid body and the platform, but also is capable of identifying partial global absolute attitudes without capturing any absolute attitude information. The pose estimation is built on a special design of the coupled kinematic model with the relative measurements between the rigid body and its supporting platform. We compare the fusion design with an alternative kinematic model and the posterior Cramer-Rao bound analyses are presented to show the completely different estimation performances. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) implementation of the fusion design is presented for the bicycle riding application.
