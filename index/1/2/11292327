The role of search queries, as available within query sessions or in isolation from one another, in examined in the context of ranking the class labels (e.g., brazilian cities, business centers, hilly sites) extracted from Web documents for various instances (e.g., rio de janeiro). The co-occurrence of a class label and an instance, in the same query or within the same query session, is used to reinforce the estimated relevance of the class label for the instance. Experiments over evaluation sets of instances associated with Web search queries illustrate the higher quality of the query-based, re-ranked class labels, relative to ranking baselines using document-based counts.
