A general methodology is presented for the generation of a complete set of constraints on interconnect parasitics, parasitic mismatch and on the physical topology of analog circuits. The parasitic and matching constraints are derived from high-level performance specifications by means of sensitivity analysis in time and frequency domain using quadratic optimization. Topological constraints are obtained by using sensitivity and matching information on devices and interconnect as well as graph-based techniques to extract the necessary geometric information.
