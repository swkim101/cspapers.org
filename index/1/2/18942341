Ethernet -like local area network links have been studied by a number of researchers. Most of these studies have involved extensive simulation models operating at the level of individual packets. However, as we begin building models of systems built around such links, detailed simulation models are neither necessary, nor cost-effective. Instead, a simple analytical model of the medium should be adequate as a component of the higher level system models. This paper discusses a number of analytical models and identifies a last-in-first-out M/G/1 model with slightly increased service time as one which adequately captures both the mean and the coefficient of variation of the response time. Given any offered load, this model can be used to predict the mean waiting time and its coefficient of variation. These two can be used to construct a suitable 2 stage hyperexponential distribution. Random numbers can then be drawn from this distribution for use as waiting times of individual packets.
