This paper presents a cable-driven parallel mechanism as a haptic interface and its underlying control method. This human-sized, three-degree-of-freedom mechanism has a tetrahedral architecture, four cables and evolves in three-dimensional space. A brief review of the kinematics of the mechanism is presented. Also, an admittance control law coupled with a closed-loop velocity controller is proposed. The control method is then refined by introducing adaptations for smooth surfaces and sharp edges. This control method is then validated by experimental results. Furthermore, the geometry of the mechanism is identified by a method that does not require any other sensor than the motor encoders.
