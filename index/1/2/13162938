Support Vector Machines work by mapping training data for classiication tasks into a high dimensional feature space. In the feature space they then nd a maximal margin hyperplane which separates the data. This hyperplane is usually found using a quadratic programming routine which is computation-ally intensive, and is non trivial to implement. In this paper we propose an adaptation of the Adatron algorithm for clas-siication with kernels in high dimensional spaces. The algorithm is simple and can nd a solution very rapidly with an exponentially fast rate of convergence (in the number of iterations) towards the optimal solution. Experimental results with real and artiicial datasets are provided.
