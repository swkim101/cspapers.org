In this paper, I revise generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) linguistic theory so that it is more tractable and linguistically constrained. Revised GPSG is also easier to understand, use, and implement. I provide an account of topicalization, explicative pronouns, and parasitic gaps in the revised system and conclude with suggestions for efficient parser design.
