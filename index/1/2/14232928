As an experiment for the application of knowledge-based techniques to large-scale software maintenance, a program called PROMPTER which produces annotations for programs written in an assembly language is being developed. PROMPTER adopts object-oriented approach and represents both hardware and programming knowledge as class/instance definitions. Object-oriented representation helps decompose the knowledge and organize it in a hierarchical way. It is shown that most of conventions such as data definitions which are the major obstacles to understanding system programs can be well formalized in this framework.
