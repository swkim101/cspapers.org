The number of tests, which are necessary to prove the performance of a program, can be reduced to an executable number, if the structure of the program is investigated. The analysis starts from the memory dump. The program is first divided into those pieces, which are without labels or branchings. Then the mappings of the program and their input and output areas are identified, further those areas which influence branchings. The next step states, which ranges of values in the individual areas are distinguished by the program and which junctions of areas are relevant. From this, the kind and the number of the necessary tests can be derived. By means of observing their main variables loops are divided into simpler structures.
 The method has been applied for the verification of the user programs of the protection system of the 800 MWE boiling water reactor plant in Brunsb√ºttel.
