This paper briefly describes an artificial neural network for preattentive visual processing. The network is capable of determining image motion in a type of stimulus which defeats most popular methods of motion detection - a subset of second-order visual motion stimuli known as drift-balanced stimuli(DBS). The processing stages of the network described in this paper are integratable into a model capable of simultaneous motion extraction, edge detection, and the determination of occlusion.
