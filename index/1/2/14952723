Reactive programming is a declarative style of defining applications which deal with continuous inputs of new data and events. Being declarative in nature, reactive programming allows the programmer to state the intent of the application, instead of specifying concrete execution behavior as needed in applications using the Observer design pattern. Declarative definitions not only improve code clarity, but also leave concrete execution behavior unspecified â€“ the underlying runtime can freely change as long as the intended semantic is kept intact. We exploit this freedom to support concurrent propagation of concurrently admitted changes.
