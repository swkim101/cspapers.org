The complexities of Retail Business Systems today require a thorough understanding of how functional requirements impact desired system performance. It is no longer feasible to discretely test and evaluate individual system components without considering their inter-relationship. The techniques described in this presentation will define the method of system characterization of products prior to customer delivery. Three techniques are utilized to characterize system performance - simulation, stimulation, and performance measurement. Simulation involves writing a mathematical model which is enhanced from a product feasibility model to a system configuration tool as a result of stimulation and measurement activities. Stimulation consists of using emulators to load the system component under test as if the actual system is inter-connected. The emulators are programmed to produce a processing volume which can exceed the peak benchmark of the potential user. Performance measurement is accomplished during the stimulation activity using hardware/ software probes to monitor specific system parameters. These monitors provide vital information to determine total system capacity and the expected system performance for a given configuration. The information derived from system characterization is invaluable in providing the customer with a realistic expectation of system capability to perform its present functions and in projecting future growth potential.
