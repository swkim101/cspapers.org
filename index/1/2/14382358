The purpose of this paper is to analyze the problem of mapping between different levels of a data base.A data Base is viewed as an Abstract Object upon which it is possible to operate with a given set of operations, the result of which depends both on the "type" of the object and on its state.Following this approach and utilizing some algebraic formalism we analyze the mappings between external views of a data base and the conceptual view of the data base itself. The main result is a requirement on the consistency between the process of deriving an external view from the conceptual view and the translation of external (user) operations into conceptual operations.It is also shown that this requirement is not sufficient to characterize the "interference" arising from a shared use of a Data Base.Informal and formal examples illustrating these concepts are given.
