Charles Schwab and Co, Inc. is a major web trader generating a large proportion of its revenue from the Web. That revenue is based on both having a site with lots of useful facilities and also the speed of execution, ability to cope with peaks in demand volumes, and the reliability of the site and its underlying services. James Chong, VP Architecture and Planning at Schwab, will talk about the fundamental infrastructure that supports the Web trading, and his plans for its evolution.
