We study the problem of executing a collection of independently designed and validated task systems upon a common platform comprised of a preemptive processor and additional shared resources. We present an abstract formulation of the problem and identify the major issues that must be addressed in order to solve this problem. We present (and prove the correctness of) algorithms that address these issues, and thereby obtain a design for an open real-time environment in the presence of shared global resources.
