In this research, we have already developed a multiple omnidirectional vision system (MOVIS) with three omnidirectional cameras and its calculation method for the measurement of the object position and the self-localization in an autonomous mobile robot. Furthermore, we propose the omnidirectional behavior control method for collision avoidance and object chasing motion by using fuzzy reasoning in an autonomous mobile robot with MOVIS. In this paper, we also report some experimental results to confirm the efficiency of our proposed method by using a soccer robot in dynamic environment.
