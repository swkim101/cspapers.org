A controller, based on nested sliding modes and super-twisting algorithm, is proposed for n-link robotic manipulator tracking problem. This controller has the robustness of nested sliding modes against matched and no matched perturbations and the softness of control signals of super-twisting algorithm (STA). The Nested Super-Twisting Algorithm (NSTA) allows obtaining a control law without knowing the exact model of the robotic manipulator. The application of the proposed controller in a two-link planar robot manipulator and a comparison with the Nested Sliding Mode Control (NSMC) are presented via simulation.
