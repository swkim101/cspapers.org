This tutorial will introduce the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) method. ADD is a method for designing the software architecture of a system or collection of systems based on an explicit articulation of the quality attribute goals for the system(s). The method is appropriate for any quality attributes but has been particularly elaborated for the attributes of performance, modifiability, security, reliability/availability and usability. The method has been used for designing the software architecture of products ranging from embedded to information systems.
