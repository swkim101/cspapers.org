Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia of unprecedented breadth and popularity. However, much of the Webâ€™s factual information still lies within relational databases, each focused on a specific topic. While many database entities are described by corresponding Wikipedia pages, in general this correspondence is unknown unless it has been manually specified. As a result, Web databases cannot leverage the relevant rich descriptions and interrelationships captured in Wikipedia, and Wikipedia readers miss the extensive coverage that a database typically provides on its specific topic. In this paper, we present ETOW, a system that automatically integrates relational databases with Wikipedia. ETOW uses machine learning techniques to identify the correspondences between database entities and Wikipedia pages. In experiments with two distinct Web databases, we demonstrate that ETOW outperforms baseline techniques, reducing error overall by an average of 19%, and reducing false positive rate by 50%. In one experiment, ETOW is able to identify approximately 13,000 correct matches at a precision of 0.97. We also present evidence suggesting that ETOW can substantially improve the coverage and utility of both the relational databases and Wikipedia.
