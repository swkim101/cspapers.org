This paper describes a new workflow model and its implementation in Smalltalk. The paper also details problems with using a RDBMS as the persistent store for the workflow tool and the subsequent experiences in using an ODBMS for this purpose. The final solution was a coexistence approach, using the RDBMS for legacy corporate data and the ODBMS for the process description and workflow status data.
