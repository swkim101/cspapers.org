We consider the problem of providing surveillance to a grid area using multiple heterogeneous UAVs, named sentinels and searchers, with complementary sensing and actuation capabilities. We consider probabilistic attacks and we analyze the expected performance with respect to the team deployment. We then introduce the problem of finding minmax deployments that result in the most desirable worst case performance caused by an attack. We present an algorithm to compute deployments while trading off solution's quality and computational effort and we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze it.
