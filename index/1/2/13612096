This paper introduces a Web-based demonstration of an interactive-predictive framework for syntactic tree annotation, where the user is tightly integrated into the interactive parsing system. In contrast with the traditional postediting approach, both the user and the system cooperate to generate error-free annotated trees. User feedback is provided by means of natural mouse gestures and keyboard strokes.
