1. Summary Many SIGCSE attendees have considered or are considering faculty positions focused on education and teaching that are not traditional tenure-track positions. In addition, many Computer Science departments have added or are considering adding such faculty positions [1]. This panel seeks to explore models for teaching faculty positions currently established at several schools and the experiences of panelists in those positions. Panelists will describe their current position in terms of job responsibilities, compensation and benefits, job security, and status within the department. In addition they will relate their personal experiences in what factors led them to seek out and stay in these positions.We also will present the results of a survey of teaching positions at other schools to be conducted prior to the conference. The panel should be of interest to educators already in teaching positions, those considering these positions, or departments that are considering adding such positions to their faculty.
