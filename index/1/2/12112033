We propose a simple interaction to transfer information on smart phone to laptop/tablet PCs. We often encounter the situation that we need to send URL, which is preliminary accessed in mobile devices, from mobile devices to personal computers (PCs) to see the web page with wider screen. To support this information transfer, we utilize combination between vibrator in smart phones and accelerometer in laptop/tablet PCs. URL information is encoded to vibration patterns, and the patterns are detected and decoded by accelerometer in PCs. We demonstrate the interaction's efficiency and reasonability with actual products.
