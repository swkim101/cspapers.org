The partitioning of an array is the basic building block of many efficient sorting algorithms. Here we study three ways to implement partitioning on vector supercomputers. A data model is presented with which the performances of these algorithms are analyzed. Performance is also measured on one processor of a Cray X-MP. Speedups between four and seventeen have been obtained for large data sets for an implementation using only O(@) more storage space and comparisons than the original algorithm.
