Many medium and large companies maintain internal employee directories. Unfortunately, most directories only allow the lookup of individual profiles, one profile at a time. Team Analytics is a novel application that integrates information from disparate enterprise tools for groups of people. Besides accelerating the lookup process, Team Analytics also displays information that is only available in the group context, such as an organizational chart and time zone awareness. We present the Team Analytics application, its integration with our corporate email client, and results from a user survey that evaluates various aspects of the application.
