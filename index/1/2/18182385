A Laboratory Support System (LSS) is provided in all No. 1A Electronic Switching System (ESS) test laboratories to support the ESS software development process. The LSS tools are utilized by the developers to accomplish ESS program database management, lab load administration, lab load generation, and program testing and debugging in the laboratory environment. This document describes one of the LSS testing and debugging tools: the No. 1A ESS Laboratory Erasable Flag System. This facility is a test coverage analyzer which monitors how well an executed test procedure has exercised, or covered, specified instruction and data words resident in No. 1A ESS memory. Erasable flag output data makes it possible to enhance test procedures to achieve a more comprehensive level of software checkout during feature development and system integration of ESS code.
