The is a new layer of the Internet that enables semantic representation of the contents of existing web pages. Using common ontologies, human users sketch out the most important facts in models that act as intelligent whiteboards. Once models are broadcasted to the Internet, new and intelligent search engines, "ambient" intelligent devices and agents would be able to exploit this knowledge network. [1].The main idea of SemTalk is to empower end users to contribute to the Semantic Web by offering an easy to use -based graphical editor to create RDF-like schema and workflows. Since the modeled data is found by Microsoft's SmartTags, users can benefit from these Semantic Webs as part of their daily work with other Microsoft Office products such as Word, Excel or Outlook.SemTalk's graphically configurable meta model also extends the functionality of the Visio modeling tool because it makes it easy to configure Visio to different modeling worlds such as Business Engineering and CASE methodologies but also to these features can be applied to any other Visio drawings.Ontology Project: Department-wide information modeling at the Credit Suisse Bank. Main emphasis was on linguistic standardization of terms. Based on a common central glossary, local knowledge management teams were able to develop specialized models for their decentralized departments. As part of the knowledge management process local glossaries were continually carried over into a common shared model.Business Process Management Project: Distributed process modeling of the Bausparkasse Deutscher Ring, a German financial institution. Several groups of students from the Technical University FH Brandenburg explored how to develop and apply an industry-specific Semantic Web to Business Process Modeling.
