This paper proposes two methods for collision detection between cylindrical components when mutual blocking occurs in the view of cameras. In reconstruction approach, 3D models are built according to key features captured by cameras and constraint optimization is employed to rapidly find possible intersections. To satisfy the computational efficiency required by real time operation, we present another way, projection method, to convert two planar views to contours on a projection plane and to detect high dimension collisions by studying the projection's relationships in low dimension. Nine cases are totally categorized and eleven parameters are constructed for detection on the basis of relative postures and positions. Simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate their validity.
