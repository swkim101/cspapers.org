In order to provide alternative computer input, we designed an isometric, tongue operated device: TonguePoint. The design rationale and a preliminary experiment are presented in this technical note. Results show that, after 30 minutes practice and adjustment, the subjects could use the Tonguepoint at a performance level that was only 5-50% slower than finger isometic pointing. Further improvements are expected.
