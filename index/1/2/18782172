We propose an architecture and algorithms for maintaining end-to-end network connectivity for autonomous teams of robots. By adopting stochastic models of point-to-point wireless communication and computing robust solutions to the network routing problem, we ensure reliable connectivity during robot movement in complex environments. We fully integrate the solution to network routing with the choice of node positions through the use of randomized motion planning techniques. Experiments demonstrate that our method succeeds in navigating a complex environment while ensuring that end-to-end communication rates meet or exceed prescribed values within a target failure tolerance.
