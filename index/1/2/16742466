We consider a machine model in which load operations can be performed in parallel with arithmetic operations by two separate functional units. For this model, the evaluation of a set of expression trees is discussed. A dynamic programming algorithm to produce an approximate solution is described and analyzed. For binary trees its worse case cost is at most 9.1% worse than the optimal cost.
