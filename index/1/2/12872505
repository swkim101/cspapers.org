We address the problem of providing scalable support for subscriptions with personalized value-based notification conditions in wide-area publish/subscribe systems. Notification conditions can be fine-tuned by subscribers, allowing precise and flexible control of when events are delivered to the subscribers. For example, a user may specify that she should be notified if and only if the price of a particular stock moves outside a "radius" around her last notified value. Naive techniques for handling notification conditions are not scalable. It is challenging to share subscription processing and notification dissemination of subscriptions with personalized value-based notification conditions, because two subscriptions may see two completely different sequences of notifications even if they specify the same radius. We develop and experimentally evaluate scalable processing and dissemination techniques for these subscriptions. Our approach uses standard network substrates for notification dissemination, and avoids pushing complex application processing into the network. Compared with other alternatives, our approach generates orders of magnitude lower network traffic, and incurs lower server processing cost.
