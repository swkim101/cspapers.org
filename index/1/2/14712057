We report on two experiments performed to test the importance of Term Order in automatic summarisation. Experiment one was undertaken as part of DUC 2004 to which three systems were submitted, each with a different summarisation approach. The system that used document Term Order outperformed those that did not use Term Order in the ROUGE evaluation. Experiment two made use of human evaluations of search engine results, comparing our Query Term Order summaries with a simulation of current Google search engine result summaries in terms of summary quality. Our QTO system's summaries aided users' relevance judgements to a significantly greater extent than Google's.
