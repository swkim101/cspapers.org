A flexible method for six-degree-of-freedom combined vision/force control for interaction with a stiff uncalibrated environment is presented. An edge-based rigid-body tracker is used in an observer-based controller, and combined with a six-degree-of-freedom force- or impedance controller. The effect of error sources such as image space measurement noise and calibration errors are considered. Finally, the method is validated in simulations and a surface following experiment using an industrial robot.
