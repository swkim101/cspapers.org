In this paper, we present a framework and a system that extracts events relevant to a query from a collection C of documents, and places such events along a timeline. Each event is represented by a sentence extracted from C, based on the assumption that "important" events are widely cited in many documents for a period of time within which these events are of interest. In our experiments, we used queries that are event types ("earthquake") and person names (e.g. "George Bush"). Evaluation was performed using G8 leader names as queries: comparison made by human evaluators between manually and system generated timelines showed that although manually generated timelines are on average more preferable, system generated timelines are sometimes judged to be better than manually constructed ones.
