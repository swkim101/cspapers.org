A Bayesian-Kullback learning scheme, called Ying-Yang Machine, is proposed based on the two complement but equivalent Bayesian representations for joint density and their Kullback divergence. Not only the scheme unifies existing major supervised and unsupervised learnings, including the classical maximum likelihood or least square learning, the maximum information preservation, the EM & em algorithm and information geometry, the recent popular Helmholtz machine, as well as other learning methods with new variants and new results; but also the scheme provides a number of new learning models.
