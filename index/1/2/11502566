The paper surveys the features of an inductive learning environment named DELVAUX that learns prospector. style, Bayesian classification rules from sets of examples. A genetic algorithm approach is used for learning Bayesian rule-sets, in which a population consists of sets of rule-sets that generate offsprings through the exchange of rules, permitting fitter rule-sets to produce offsprings with a higher probability. The various genetic operators of our leazning environment, such crossover, mutation, inversion and selection operators are described. Finally, empirical results we obtained when using the DELVAUX rule learning environment for the classification of Iris flowers, for the classification of edible mushrooms, and for the classification of different kinds of glass are surveyed.
