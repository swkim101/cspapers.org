Instead of traditional content adaptation at servers or clients, we propose context-aware content adaptation at the Access Point (AP). We show that because of the special characteristics of the AP such as: being the last node at the edge of the network, no power constraint, and powerful computing capabilities, it can be the best candidate for context-aware content adaptation in high dynamic wireless mobile networks. In fact, it can adapt content more accurately and faster in a high diverse and dynamic context. Content adaptation at the application and MAC layers of the AP is introduced in this paper.
