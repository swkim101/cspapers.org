Second, is the change in manufacturing process. Today, designers are using 0.35 micron or even 0.25 micron technology. Submicron manufacturing capabilities enable millions of gates on a single chip. Sematech predicts that 0.25 micron technology will be ubiquitous by 1998 and the average chip complexity will be 20 million transistors. With most ASIC fabs running 0.5 micron processes reliably, and several delivering or scheduling a move to 0.25 micron soon, manufacturing capabilities are quickly outgrowing the capacity of current design tools.
