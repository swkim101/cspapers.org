Augmented reality is a research area that tries to embody an electronic information space within the real world through computational devices A crucial issue within thus area is the recognition of real world objects or situations In natural language processing, it is much racier to determine interpietations of utterances even if they art in formed WHEN the context or situation is fixed We therefore introduce robust natural language processing in to a system of augmented reality with situation awareness Based on this idea we have developed a portable system called the Ubiquitous Talker This consists of an LCD display that reflects the scene at which a user is looking as if it is a transparent glass a CCD camera for reognizing real world objects with color bar ID codes a microphone for recognizing a human voice and a speaker which outputs a synthesized voice The Ubiquitous Talker provides its user with some information related to a recognized object by using the display and voice It also accepts requests or questions as voice inputs The user feels as if he/she is talking with the object itself through the system.
