In the next generation wireless local area network (WLAN), the multi-user spatial multiplexing combined with packet aggregation can increase the system performance significantly. However, the space channel time may arise due to non-uniformity in the transmission times of wireless frames on the different spatial streams during MU-MIMO transmissions. In addition, for various communication services such as voice communication, the quality of service (QoS) provision is essential in the current WLANs. In this paper, our objectives are reduction of the space channel time and QoS provision for voice communications. Then, we propose a high efficient packet aggregation scheme taking into account the multi-rate and VoIP packet transmissions. The results of computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under recent WLAN environments.
