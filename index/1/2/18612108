In this paper, we describe a new teacher professional development program, New Mexico Computer Science for All (NM-CSforAll), that prepares high school science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) teachers to serve as learning coaches / teaching assistants for a dual credit Computer Science (CS) course. The dual credit course for students follows a "flipped classroom" model with the lecture portion delivered online through University of New Mexico (UNM) and the lab portion offered by participating teachers at local high schools. The course utilized a novel curriculum focusing on teaching CS concepts through computer modeling of complex adaptive systems. We reflect on what we learned while preparing STEM teachers to become CS teachers and discuss the affordances and barriers to bringing CS education to rural and under-resourced schools across the state of New Mexico.
