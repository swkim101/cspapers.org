Functional aspects of a machine called FLATS are described. FLATS aims to efficiently run both numerical and algebraic programs. Overflow free and variable precision arithmetic, table look-up computation, and associative computation based on single-hit content addressed tables are introduced for advanced numerical, algebraic and symbolic computing. Hashing hardware, tag mechanism and hardware list processing are used to realize these features.
