Over any field of any characteristic c, the coefficients of a polynomial of a degree n can be expressed via the power sums of its zeros by means of the so called key equation for decoding the BCH error-ccnwcting codes. Berlekamp’s algorithm of 1968 solves this equation by using order of nz field operations. The subsequent algorithms of 1975-1980 use O(n(log rz)z log log n) field operations, though a considerable overhead constant is hidden in the nO“ not ation. Our algorithms simplify the solution and further decrease the latter asymptotic bound, by factors ranging from order of log n, for c = O and c > n (in which case the overhead constant drops dramatically, thus implying substantial practical improvement of the known algorithms), to order of min(c, log n), for 2< c < n; we use Las Vegas randomization in the latter case. We also show some applications to computing the characteristic polynomial of a matrix.
