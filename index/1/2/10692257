This paper briefly describes research on generic object-oriented programming where we establish a set of design patterns (or idioms) which makes algorithms independent of data structures. In the framework that implements these design patterns, an algorithm is not defined directly on a data structure class, but more abstractly on a set of structural properties shared by multiple data structures.
