The tier automation is presented as a model for communication protocols. Several advantages of the model are cited, among which are universality of representation and manipulability. A scheme for using the tier automation to model specific distributed architectures and their protocols is described. The scheme is then used on a sample protocol and a transmission session with the sample protocol as exhibited.
