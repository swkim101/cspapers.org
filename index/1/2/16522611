In this paper, we present a problem where a suspended load, carried by a rotorcraft aerial robot, performs trajectory tracking. We want to accomplish this by specifying the reference trajectory for the suspended load only. The aerial robot needs to discover/learn its own trajectory which ensures that the suspended load tracks the reference trajectory. As a solution, we propose a method based on least-square policy iteration (LSPI) which is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed method is verified through simulation and experiments.
