With the popularity of pads, large touch screens, notebooks and smart mobiles, it is a reasonable requirement that modelers use such devices to models. However, there are few modeling tools that take full advantage of the devices. This paper discusses a Web based UML modeling tool with touch screens, based on our full analysis of human-machine interaction modes for software modeling. The tool provides more input means, i.e. combining gesture input and traditional keyboard and mouse input, and supports cross-platforms modeling by using HTML 5.
