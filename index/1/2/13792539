This video demonstrates the program MU, the Mathematics Understander, which learns University level Pure Mathematics. The video is both concerned with MU's performance in learning and performing mathematics, and its underlying cognitive architecture, the Contextual Memory System, (CMS). The changes in knowledge representation during proof checking and problem solving are demonstrated graphically.
