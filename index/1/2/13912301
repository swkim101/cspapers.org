In this paper, we revisit the problem of performance prediction on shared memory parallel machines, motivated by the need for selecting parallelization strategy for random write reductions. Such reductions frequently arise in data mining algorithms.In our previous work, we have developed a number of techniques for parallelizing this class of reductions. Our previous work has shown that each of the three techniques, full replication, optimized full locking, and cache-sensitive, can outperform others depending upon problem, dataset, and machine parameters. Therefore, an important question is, "Can we predict the performance of these techniques for a given problem, dataset, and machine?".This paper addresses this question by developing an analytical performance model that captures a two-level cache, coherence cache misses, TLB misses, locking overheads, and contention for memory. Analytical model is combined with results from micro-benchmarking to predict performance on real machines. We have validated our model on two different SMP machines. Our results show that our model effectively captures the impact of memory hierarchy (two-level cache and TLB) as well as the factors that limit parallelism (contention for locks, memory contention, and coherence cache misses). The difference between predicted and measured performance is within 20% in almost all cases. Moreover, the model is quite accurate in predicting the relative performance of the three parallelization techniques.
