We consider the following problem: Given a graph <i>G</i>. Decide whether or not <i>G</i> has <i>k half-integral packing of an H-minor</i> for fixed <i>k</i> and <i>H</i>. Here, <i>k half-integral packing of an H-minor</i> is that there are <i>k</i> <i>H</i>-minors such that each vertex is used at most twice. Let us observe that if <i>G</i> contains <i>H</i> as a minor, then <i>G</i> has |<i>H</i>| disjoint trees such that after contracting all the trees, we can get an <i>H</i>. So <i>k</i> half-integral packing of an <i>H</i>-minor means that there are <i>k</i>|<i>H</i>| trees <i>T</i><inf>1, 1</inf>, ..., <i>T</i>1,|<i>H</i>|, <i>T</i><inf>2, 1</inf>, ..., <i>Tk</i>,<inf>|H|</inf> such that trees <i>T</i><inf><i>i</i>, 1</inf>, ..., <i>T</i><inf>1,|<i>H</i>|</inf> are disjoint for 1 ≤ <i>i</i> ≤ <i>k</i>, and after contracting all these trees <i>Ti</i>, <inf>1</inf>, ..., <i>T<inf>i</inf>,|H|</i>, we can get an <i>H</i> for 1 ≤ <i>i</i> ≤ <i>k</i>, but each vertex is used at most twice in these trees <i>T</i><inf>1, 1</inf>, ..., <i>T</i><inf>1,|<i>H</i>|</inf>, <i>T</i><inf>2, 1</inf>, ..., <i>T<inf>k,|H|</inf></i>. This problem is motivated by the study of the half disjoint paths problem and unspilittable flow problem, e.g. Schrijver, Seymour and Winkler [45], Kleinberg [22], Srinivasan [49] and Kolliopoulos and Stein [23]. Let us observe that when <i>k</i> = 1, this case is exactly testing a given minor. So our problem includes Robertson-Seymour's result [36]. Also, it would not follow from the existence of <i>kH</i>-minors. Furthermore, the algorithm of the half disjoint paths problem by Kleinberg [22] does not give our algorithm. Hence, our setting is not directly comparable to Robertson and Seymour's result [36], and Kleinberg's result [22].
 We prove that when <i>H</i> = <i>K</i><inf>6</inf> or <i>K</i><inf>7</inf>, this problem is solvable in polynomial time. Our motivation for the <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor is that the structure of graphs with no <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minors. Unfortunately, it is not known at all, although the structure of graphs without <i>K</i><inf>5</inf>-minors is well known from 1930's [54].
 Moreover, we prove that Erdős-Pósa property holds for <i>k</i> half-integral packing of a <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor (a <i>K</i><inf>7</inf>-minor, respectively). More precisely, either <i>G</i> has <i>K</i> half-integral packing of a <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor (a <i>K</i><inf>7</inf>-minor, respectively) or <i>G</i> has a vertex set <i>T</i> of order at most <i>f(k)</i> for some function of <i>k</i> such that <i>G - T</i> does not contain any <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor (<i>K</i><inf>7</inf>-minor, respectively). This settles the conjecture of Thomas [50] for the <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor case and the <i>K</i><inf>7</inf>-minor case.
 Finally, we shall address why our approach works for the <i>K</i><inf>6</inf>-minor case and the <i>K</i><inf>7</inf>-minor case, but does not work for the <i>K</i><inf>8</inf>-minor case.
