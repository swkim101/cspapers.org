The Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely used in critical infrastructures but is vulnerable to radio frequency (RF) interference. A common source of interference are commercial drivers that use GPS jammers to circumvent vehicle tracking systems. Existing mechanisms to detect and identify such interference emitting vehicles on roadways require a large number of specialized detectors or a manual observation process. In this paper, we design a practical, automated system to facilitate enforcement actions. Our system combines information from roadside monitoring points at key locations along the roadway as well as mobile detectors (e.g., smartphones and other mobile GPS systems). Rather than attempting precise localization at a given time, the system exploits the inherent variation in driving speeds and the resulting diverging trajectories of vehicles to uniquely identify the interfering vehicle. Through our experiments on a local highway with a vehicle transmitting interference in the 900MHz ISM band, we found that the vehicle identification rate of our mechanism is 65% for a single-point setup and 100% for a two-point setup. We performed 200 hours of passive monitoring of GPS L1 band on roadways and found two episodes of real interference. We also demonstrate that our mobile detector-based crowdsourced smartphone profiles are sufficiently consistent in time and space to enable reliable interference detection.
