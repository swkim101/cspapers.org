This paper outlines our project to help beginners learn to program by showing object visualisations driven by aspect- oriented programming, and presented as part of the Eclipse development platform. The aspect-oriented programming is part of the infrastructure we use to drive the visualisations that help students learn object-oriented programming. Aspect-oriented programming explicitly supports the kind of cross-cutting concerns that allows our system to drive visualisations that emphasise principles of object interaction. Our extensions to Eclipse allow us to provide this educational scaffolding to help learners, without altering the program, the programming language or the libraries.
