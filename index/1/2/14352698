This work aims to contribute to reliability and integrity in perceptual systems of autonomous ground vehicles. Information theoretic based metrics to evaluate the quality of sensor data are proposed and applied to visual and infrared camera images. The contribution of the proposed metrics to the discrimination of challenging conditions is discussed and illustrated with the presence of airborne dust and smoke.
