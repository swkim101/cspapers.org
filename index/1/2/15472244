Description Logic (DL) based ontologies and nonmonotonic rules provide complementary features whose combination is crucial in many applications. In hybrid knowledge bases (KBs), which combine both formalisms, for large real-world applications, often integrating knowledge originating from different sources, inconsistencies can easily occur. These commonly trivialize standard reasoning and prevent us from drawing any meaningful conclusions. When restoring consistency by changing the KB is not possible, paraconsistent reasoning offers an alternative by allowing us to obtain meaningful conclusions from its consistent part. 
 
In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently obtaining meaningful conclusions from (possibly inconsistent) hybrid KBs. To this end, we define two paraconsistent semantics for hybrid KBs which, beyond their differentiating properties, are faithful to well-known paraconsistent semantics as well as the non-paraconsistent logic they extend, and tractable if reasoning in the DL component is.
