This paper describes a policy iteration algorithm for optimizing the performance of a harmonic function-based controller with respect to a user-defined index. Value functions are represented as potential distributions over the problem domain, being control policies represented as gradient fields over the same domain. All intermediate policies are intrinsically safe, i.e. collisions are not promoted during the adaptation process. The algorithm has efficient implementation in parallel SIMD architectures. One potential application - travel distance minimization - illustrates its usefulness.
