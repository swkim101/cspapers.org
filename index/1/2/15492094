A linear arrangement of an n-vertex graph is a one-tc+one mapping of its vertices to the integers (1,.. . , n}. The band-widt,h of a linear arrangement is the maximum difference between mapped values of adjacent vertices. The problem of finding a linear arrangement wit,h smallest possible band-widt,h in NP-hard. We present a randomized algorithm that runs in nearly linear time and outputs a linear arrangement whose band&dt,h is within a polylogarithmic multiplicative factor of optimal. Our algorithm is based on a new notion, called volume respecting em&tidings, which is a natural extension of small distortion embeddings of Bourgain and of Linial, London and Ra~movich.
