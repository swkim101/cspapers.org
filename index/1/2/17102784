With exponential growth of IoT devices [1], the 5G network will experience a variety of traffic patterns not prevalent in earlier applications. These, often will transmit short sporadic messages, which are not well suited to the connection-oriented modes associated with legacy 3GPP network resulting in high service latency and excessive control overhead. It is acknowledged that current 4G network could be overwhelmed by the surge in both traffic and control plane signaling load. For 5G, it is necessary to redesign the mobile network to provide a low delay, low control overhead IoT mode that will work efficiently for emerging application scenarios. The MAC layer has to be designed in such a way that IoT messages experience low access latency across both the radio access network and core network. The goal is to operate in the same band as current LTE, thus not requiring any separate bandwidth allocation and is backward compatible with the current 4G system. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer MAC and Physical layer solution for low power, low bitrate devices that require low access delay and long range for communication.
