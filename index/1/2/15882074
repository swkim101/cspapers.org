Let <i>A</i> be an <i>n</i>-uniform hypergraph. Assume that the maximum degree of <i>A</i> is <i>D</i> = <i>D</i>(<i>A</i>) (local condition), and |<i>A</i>| = <i>N</i> = <i>N</i>(<i>A</i>) (global condition). By the Lovász Local Lemma (L.L.L.), if <i>D</i> < 2<sup>n</sup>/8<i>n</i>, then <i>A</i> has a <i>proper</i> 2-coloring (<i>i.e.</i> there is no monochromatic edge) <i>independently</i> of the value of <i>N</i> (<i>N</i> can be infinite). Unfortunately L.L.L. is a pure existence argument which does not give any clue of how to <i>find</i> a proper 2-coloring. A hypergraph with the property that any two edges have at most one point in common is called <i>almost disjoint</i> (<i>e.g.</i> a family of lines). Assume that <i>A</i> is an <i>n</i>-uniform almost disjoint hypergraph. In this special case, we provide a polynomial time (in terms of <i>N</i>) algorithm to find a proper 2-coloring under the slightly weaker condition that <i>D</i> < (2 - Δ)<sup><i>n</i></sup> and <i>N</i> is less than a doubly exponential function of <i>n.</i>
