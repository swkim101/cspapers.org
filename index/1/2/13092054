The model is a "generalized switch", serving multiple traffic flows in discrete time. The switch uses MaxWeight algorithm to make a service decision (scheduling choice) at each time step, which determines the probability distribution of the amount of service that will be provided. We are primarily motivated by the following question: in the heavy traffic regime, when the switch load approaches critical level, will the service processes provided to each flow remain "smooth" (i.e., without large gaps in service)? Addressing this question reduces to the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the unscaled queue-differential process in heavy traffic. We prove that the stationary regime of this process converges to that of a positive recurrent Markov chain, whose structure we explicitly describe. This in turn implies asymptotic "smoothness" of the service processes.
