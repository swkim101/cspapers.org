Retention is an important issue for Computer Science Departments. In many cases students leave the major due to frustrations with programming in the complex languages often used in CS1 and CS2 or because they do not understand that computer science is much more than programming. We have redesigned our introductory sequence to include a rigorous, non-programming introduction to the field and a CS1 course which uses Scheme so that students can focus on the principles of programming instead of the complexities of a particular language. In the first year that we have required these courses in our major, we have had positive results. In this paper, we describe what we have learned through discussions with students and student surveys.
