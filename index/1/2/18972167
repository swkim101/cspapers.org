There are a few types of step-climbing wheelchairs in the world, but most of them are large and heavy because they are power-assisted. Therefore, they require large space to maneuver, which is not always feasible with existing house architectures. This study proposes a novel step-climbing wheelchair based on lever propulsion control using human upper limbs. The developed step-climbing wheelchair device consists of manual wheels with casters for moving around and a rotary-legs mechanism that is capable of climbing steps. The wheelchair also has a passive mechanism for posture transition to shift the center of gravity of the person between the desired positions for planar locomotion and step-climbing. The proposed design consists of passive parts, and this leads the wheelchair being compact and lightweight. In this paper, we present the design of this step-climbing wheelchair and some preliminary experiments to test its usability.
