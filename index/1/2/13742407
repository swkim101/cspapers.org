This article nqmts our tiection on softsvam amhiteetm modelling for multi-user systems (or groupware).Fi~ w introduce t.k notion of software architecture and make explieit the design steps that most sofl-wam designm in HCI tend to blend in a fizzy way. Building on general concepts and pmetiee fmm main stream soikm engineering, we then present a comparative analysis of the most signifhnt architecture models developed for singleand multi-user systems. We close with the pmentation d PAC*, a new arehitectuml fmmwodc for modelling and designing the sdsvare amhitectm of multi-user systems. PAC* is a motivated combination of existing anAiteetuml models seleeted for the complementarily of their “good properties”. These include operational heuristics such as rules for deriving agents in accordance to the task model or criteria for reasoning about replication as well as properties such as support for style heterogeneity, portability, and reusability.
