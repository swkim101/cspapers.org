• A procedure for automatically deducing temporal properties of reactive computer systems. – The temporal properties are specified in some temporal logic (CTL, LTL etc.) – A computer system is specified as a Kripke Structure. – The properties are verified by intelligent and systematic graph search algorithms. • Good: – If it works, model checking (unlike theorem proving) is a pushbutton tool. – If the system is too large, model checking cannot be applied because of state explosion. • Ugly – The system (and/or property) then needs to be suitably " abstracted " in order to use model checking.
