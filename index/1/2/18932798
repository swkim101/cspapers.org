Database Systems are often used as persistent layer for applications. This implies that database schemas are generated out of transient programming class descriptions. The basic idea of the MDA approach generalizes this principle by providing a framework to generate applications (and database schemas) for diﬀerent programming platforms. Within our GignoMDA project [3]—which is subject of this demo proposal—we have extended classic concepts for code generation. That means, our approach provides a single point of truth describing all aspects of database applications (e.g. database schema, project documentation, . . . ) with great potential for cross-layer optimization. These new cross-layer optimization hints are a novel way for the challenging global optimization issue of multi-tier database applications. The demo at VLDB comprises an in-depth explanation of our concepts and the prototypical implementation by directly demonstrating the modeling and the automatic generation of database applications.
