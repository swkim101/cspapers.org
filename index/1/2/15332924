Automatic albuming --- the automatic organization of photographs, either as an end in itself or for use in other applications -- is an application that promises to be of great assistance to photographers. Relatively sophisticated image content analysis techniques have been used for image indexing, organization and retrieval. In this paper, we describe a method of organizing photographs into events using spoken photograph captions. The results of this process can be used to improve image indexing and retrieval.
