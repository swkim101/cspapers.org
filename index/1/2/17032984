In the last decade, several approaches have been proposed for merging multiple and potentially conflicting pieces of information. Egalitarist fusion modes privilege solutions that minimize the (local) dissatisfaction of each agent (source, expert) who is involved in the fusion process. This paper proposes useful strategies for an egalitarist fusion of incommensurable ranked belief bases under constraints. We show that the fusion process can equivalently be characterized either by means of the notion of compatible ranked bases, or by means of a Pareto-like ordering on the set of possible solutions. Lastly, rational postulates for our merging operator are studied.
