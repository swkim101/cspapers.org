Stream reasoning is the task of continuously deriving conclusions on streaming data. As a research theme, it is targeted by different communities which emphasize different aspects, e.g., throughput vs. expressiveness. This thesis aims to advance the theoretical foundations underlying diverse stream reasoning approaches and to convert obtained insights into a prototypical expressive rule-based reasoning system that is lacking to date.
