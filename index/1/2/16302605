The attempt to find a single "optimal" weight vector in conventional network training can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Bayesian methods avoid this, without the need for a validation set, by averaging the outputs of many networks with weights sampled from the posterior distribution given the training data. This sample can be obtained by simulating a stochastic dynamical system that has the posterior as its stationary distribution.
