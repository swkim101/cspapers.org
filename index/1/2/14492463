We present a system designed to help blind people navigate around obstacles. Our system perceives the environment in front of the user using a depth camera (a Microsoft Kinect). The system identifies nearby structures from the depth map and uses sonification to convey obstacle information to the user. The system has undergone a formative evaluation involving eight blind-folded participants and one blind participant. We found that our system can be learned within minutes and that participants can successfully navigate through an obstacle course with few collisions.
