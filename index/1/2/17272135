The RESEDA project is concerned with the construction of AI Information Retrieval systems working on databases containing biographical data. There exist in RESEDA two fundamental ways of retrieving information requested by a user. In the first case, the information we wish to obtain is data which already exists in the base. This data can be obtained by direct match with the "search model" corresponding to the user's question. If this is not possible, we can still try to get an answer by using the inference procedures of the "transformation" type. The second method retrieves information which, in contrast, is created ex nihilo by the search procedure itself. It expresses, in fact, the possibility of a new causal relationship, within the base, between an "episode" provided explicitly by the user and one or more "episodes" that the system retrieves by applying an inference procedure of the type "hypothesis".
