In 2008, the anti-Malware engineering WorkShop (MWS) was organized in Japan. The main objective of MWS is to accelerate and expand the activities of anti-malware research. To this end, MWS aims to attract new researchers and stimulate new research by lowering the technical obstacles associated with collecting the datasets that are crucial for addressing recent cyber threats. Moreover, MWS hosts intimate research workshops where researchers can freely discuss their results obtained using MWS and other datasets. This paper presents a quantitative accounting of the effectiveness of the MWS community by tracking the number of papers and new researchers that have arisen from the use of our datasets. In addition, we share the lessons learned from our experiences over the past seven years of sharing datasets with the community.
