Clustering is a classic topic in optimization with k-means being one of the most fundamental such problems. In the absence of any restrictions on the input, the best known algorithm for k-means with a provable guarantee is a simple local search heuristic yielding an approximation guarantee of 9+&#x2265;ilon, a ratio that is known to be tight with respect to such methods.We overcome this barrier by presenting a new primal-dual approach that allows us to (1) exploit the geometric structure of k-means and (2) to satisfy the hard constraint that at most k clusters are selected without deteriorating the approximation guarantee. Our main result is a 6.357-approximation algorithm with respect to the standard LP relaxation. Our techniques are quite general and we also show improved guarantees for the general version of k-means where the underlying metric is not required to be Euclidean and for k-median in Euclidean metrics.
