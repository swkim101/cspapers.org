A representation of smooth plane curves for recognition is proposed. The basic representation is a linked list of four primitive shapes, called "codons", which are invariant under rotations, translations and uniform scaling. Psychophysical observations regarding the perception of figureground reversals arc presented to suggest that a similar representation could be used by the human visual system.
