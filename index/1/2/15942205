We show that nonserial dynamic programming is optimal among one class of algorithms for an important class of discrete optimization problems. We consider discrete, multivariate, optimization problems in which the objective function is given as a sum of terms. Each term is a function of only a subset of the variables. We first consider a class of optimization algorithms which eliminate suboptimal solutions by comparing the objective function on “comparable” partial solutions. A large, natural subclass of comparison algorithms in which the subproblems considered are either nested or nonadjacent (i.e., noninteracting) is then defined. It is shown that a variable-elimination procedure, nonserial dynamic programming, is optimal in an extremely strong sense among all algorithms in the subclass. The results' strong implications for choosing deterministic, adaptive, and nondeterministic algorithms for the optimization problem, for defining a complexity measure for a pattern of interactions, and for describing general classes of decomposition procedures are discussed. Several possible extensions and unsolved problems are mentioned.
