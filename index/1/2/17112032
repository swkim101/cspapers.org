The common challenges in the real-time control system design are the control system integration, modeling and analysis, program coding, and real-time data communication. To address the solutions to these challenges, this paper presents the design of a control system testbed for a two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) robot. The design methodology supports the designer to (1) apply the theories of robotics and feedback control systems for feasible robot's path control solutions, (2) model, simulate and analyze the path control function using Simulink software, and (3) implement the control solution as a real-time PC-based robot control system
