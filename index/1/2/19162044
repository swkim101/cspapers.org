So far query answering under the IAR semantics (IAR-answering) is known to be tractable only for arguably weak DLs like DL-Lite and the quite restricted EL⊥nr fragment of EL⊥. Towards providing a systematic study of IAR-answering, in the current paper we first present a general framework/algorithm for IAR-answering which applies to arbitrary DLs but need not terminate. Nevertheless, this framework allows us to develop a sufficient condition for tractability of IAR-answering and hence of termination of our algorithm. We then show that this condition is always satisfied by the arguably expressive DL DL-Litebool, providing the first positive result for IAR-answering over a non-Horn-DL. In addition, recent results show that this condition usually holds for real-world ontologies and techniques and algorithms for checking it in practice have also been studied recently; thus, overall our results are highly relevant in practice. Finally, we have provided a prototype implementation and a preliminary evaluation obtaining encouraging results.
