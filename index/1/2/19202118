The impact of batting order on scoring runs is widely known and managers are often judged based on their perceived weakness or strength in setting the batting order. In practice, a combination of expertsâ€™ intuitions plus a few descriptive and sometimes conflicting performance statistics are used to assign an order to the batters in a team line-up before the games and in player replacement due to injuries during the games. In this paper, we propose the use of learning methods in automatic line-up order assignment based on several measures of performance and historical data. We discuss the importance of this problem in designing a winning strategy for cricket teams and the challenges this application introduces to the community and the currently existing approaches in AI.
