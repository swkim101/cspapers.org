ForcePhone is a mobile synchronous haptic communication system. During phone calls, users can squeeze the side of the device and the pressure level is mapped to vibrations on the recipient's device. The pressure/vibrotactile messages supported by ForcePhone are called pressages. Using a lab-based study and a small field study, this paper addresses the following questions: how can haptic interpersonal communication be integrated into a standard mobile device? What is the most appropriate feedback design for pressages? What types of non-verbal cues can be represented by pressages? Do users make use of pressages during their conversations? The results of this research indicate that such a system has value as a communication channel in real-world settings with users expressing greetings, presence and emotions through pressages.
