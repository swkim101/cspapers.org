In this paper we present the FormulaBuilder, a flexible tool for graph-based modelling and generation of formulae. The FormulaBuilder allows easy and intuitive creation of formulae by using basic components called Formula Building Blocks (FBBs) and arranging them as graphs according to the syntactic structure of a formula. Such a graph can then be validated and used to generate the corresponding formula on the basis of a specific syntax which is chosen from a list of syntaxes supported by the FormulaBuilder.An important application of the FormulaBuilder is the formal specification of properties that describe the requirements of a system. Such property specifications are usually needed by verification tools like model checkers, that help software engineers to detect errors in a specified system. The FormulaBuilder allows users to model property specifications as formula graphs by using commonly-occurring specification patterns.
