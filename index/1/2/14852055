This paper proposes Pwrake, a parallel and distributed flexible workflow management tool based on Rake, a domain specific language for building applications in the Ruby programming language. Rake is a similar tool to make and ant. It uses a Rakefile that is equivalent to a Makefile in make, but written in Ruby. Due to a flexible and extensible language feature, Rake would be a powerful workflow management language. The Pwrake extends Rake to manage distributed and parallel workflow executions that include remote job submission and management of parallel executions. This paper discusses the design and implementation of the Pwrake, and demonstrates its power of language and extensibility of the system using a practical e-Science data-intensive workflow in astronomical data analysis on the Gfarm file system as a case study. Extending a scheduling algorithm to be aware of file locations, 20% of speed up is observed using 8 nodes (32 cores) in a PC cluster. Using two PC clusters located in different institutions, the file location aware scheduling shows scalable speedup. The extensible Pwrake is a promising workflow management tool even for wide-area data analysis.
