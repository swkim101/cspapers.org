An extension of regular expressions is introduced to represent the activities of synchronizing concurrent processes. A communication link is defined as an automaton (infinite) with one-to-one partial transformations, and communication protocol as an assignment of events to actions of a communication link. A synchronization problem is defined as a problem of concurrent decomposition of a process into a deadlock-free family of processes sharing a communication protocol.
 It is shown that it is decidable whether a finite family of sequential processes, communicating through a finite link, is deadlock-free or not.
