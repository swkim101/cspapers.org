The part-nesting problem is the problem of arranging a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes, the parts on a plane irregularly shaped surface, such that no shapes overlap and as much of the surface is covered as possible. This problem occurs in several applications in the textile business. One of the most challenging applications appear in the leather industry. This application is characterized by a high degree of inhomogeneity of the surface as well as the shapes and by severe restrictions on run time. We present an algorithmic method for computeraided nesting in this context. The algorithm is characterized by selective data reduction, sequential part placement, a topological part fitting process, and a carefully tuned evaluation function for partial placements. Experiments show that the method is competitive with nestings done by man, for relatively nicely behaved part sets and surfaces. Our nesting algorithm has been in industrial use since June 1992.
