It has been a constant aim of computer scientists, programming language designers and practitioners to raise the level of programming abstractions and bring them as close to the user's natural context as possible. The efforts started right from our transition from machine code programming to assembly language programming, from there to high level procedural languages, followed by object oriented programming. Nowadays, service oriented software development and composition are the norm.
 There have also been notable efforts such as Alice system from CMU to simplify the programming experience through the use of 3D virtual worlds. The holy grail has been to enable non-technical users such as kids or non-technical people to be able to understand and pick up programming and software development easily. We present a novel approach to software development that lets people use their voice to program or create new software through composition. We demonstrate some basic programming tasks achieved by simply talking to a system over an ordinary phone. Such programs constructed by talking can be created in user's local language and do not require IT literacy or even literacy as a prerequisite.
 We believe this approach will have a deep impact on software development, especially development of web based software in the very near future.
