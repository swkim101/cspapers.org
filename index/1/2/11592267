Described is an algorithm used in PC board test programs to direct and control the probing sequence once the board has failed the functional test. Applicable to all static logic, the algorithm is used to test boards with TTL Series 54/74 dual-inline-packages (DIPS), probing with 16-pin and 24-pin IC probes (DIP-CLIPS) capable of simultaneous contact with all pins of a package.
 Since test data and circuit interconnection information are imbedded in the program, minimal documentation is required by the operator at the test stand during production testing. Program-generated failure data can be filed with each failed board for subsequent repair.
