It becomes a well-known technology that a low-level map of complex environment containing 3D laser points can be generated using a robot with laser scanners. Given a cloud of 3D laser points of an urban scene, this paper proposes a method for locating the objects of interest, e.g. traffic signs or road lamps, by computing object-based saliency. Our major contributions are: 1) a method for extracting simple geometric features from laser data is developed, where both range images and 3D laser points are analyzed; 2) an object is modeled as a graph used to describe the composition of geometric features; 3) a graph matching based method is developed to locate the objects of interest on laser data. Experimental results on real laser data depicting urban scenes are presented; efficiency as well as limitations of the method are discussed.
