This paper presents a new approach to solving the DSP address assignment problem. A minimum cost circulation approach is used to efficiently generate high performance addressing code in polynomial time. Addressing code size improvements of up to 7 times are obtained, accounting for up to 1.6 times improvement in code size and performance of compiler-generated DSP code. Results also show that memory layout has a small effect on code size and performance when optimal addressing is used. This research is important for industry since this value-added technique can improve code size, power dissipation and performance, without increasing cost.
