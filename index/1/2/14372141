This paper describes a natural language processing system implemented at Hewlett-Packard's Computer Research Center. The system's main components are: a Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG); a top-down parser; a logic transducer that outputs a first-order logical representation; and a "disambiguator" that uses sortal information to convert "normal-form" first-order logical expressions into the query language for HIRE, a relational database hosted in the SPHERE system. We argue that theoretical developments in GPSG syntax and in Montague semantics have specific advantages to bring to this domain of computational linguistics. The syntax and semantics of the system are totally domain-independent, and thus, in principle, highly portable. We discuss the prospects for extending domain-independence to the lexical semantics as well, and thus to the logical semantic representations.
