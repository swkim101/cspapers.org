Quality of requirements written in natural language has always been a critical concern in software engineering. Poorly written requirements lead to ambiguity and false interpretation in different phases of a software delivery project. Further, incomplete requirements lead to partial implementation of the desired system behavior. In this paper, we present a model for harvesting domain (functional or business) knowledge. Subsequently we present natural language processing and ontology based techniques for leveraging the model to analyze requirements quality and for requirements comprehension. The prototype also provides an advisory to business analysts so that the requirements can be aligned to the expected domain standard. The prototype developed is currently being used in practice, and the initial results are very encouraging.
