Abstractâ€”In business processes, buyers and suppliers define a contract between the two parties such as quality of service(QOS) and quality of products. Organizations operating in modern markets require an excellent service management.When services or products are created or managed using workflow processes, the workflow management system should predict, monitor and control the QOS rendered to customers according to specifications of the contract. To achieve these objectives, an appropriate QOS model for workflow processes and methods to compute QOS are proposed.
