An approach for designing countermeasures to cure conflict in aircraft pilots' activities is presented, both based on Artificial Intelligence and Human Factors concepts. The first step is to track the pilot's activity, i.e. to reconstruct what he has actually done thanks to the flight parameters and reference models describing the mission and procedures. The second step is to detect conflict in the pilot's activity, and this is linked to what really matters to the achievement of the mission. The third step is to design accu­ rate countermeasures which are likely to do bet­ ter than the existing onboard devices. The three steps are presented and supported by experimental results obtained from private and professional pi­ lots.
