We present a risk minimization formulation for learning from both text and graph structures which is motivated by the problem of collective inference for hypertext document categorization. The method is based on graph regularization formulated as a well-formed convex optimization problem. We present numerical algorithms for our formulation, and show that such combination of local text features and link information can lead to improved predictive accuracy.
