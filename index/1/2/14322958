Collision safety between humans and robots has drawn much attention since service robots are increasingly being used in human environments. A safe robot arm based on passive compliance can usually provide faster and more reliable responses for dynamic collision than an active one involving sensors and actuators. Since both positioning accuracy and collision safety of the robot arm are equally important, a robot arm should have very low stiffness when subjected to a collision force greater than the injury tolerance, but should otherwise maintain very high stiffness. To implement these requirements, a novel safe joint mechanism (SJM-II) which has much smaller size and lighter weight than the previous model, is proposed in this research. The SJM-II has the advantage of nonlinear spring which is achieved using only passive mechanical elements such as linear springs and a double-slider mechanism. Various analyses and experiments on static and dynamic collisions show that stiffness of the SJM-II is kept very high against an external torque less than the predetermined threshold torque, but abruptly drops when the input torque exceeds this threshold, thereby guaranteeing positioning accuracy and collision safety. Furthermore, a robot arm with two SJM-IIs is verified to achieve collision safety in 2D space.
