The 1998 Nagano Olympic games had more intensive demands on data management than any previous Olympics in history. This talk will take you behind the scenes to talk about the technical challenges and the architectures that made it possible to handle 4.5 Terabytes of data and sustain a total of almost 650 million web requests, reaching a peak of over 103K per minute. We will discuss the overall structure of the most comprehensive and heavily used Internet technology application in history. Many products were involved, both hardware and software, but this talk will focus in on the database and web challenges, the technology that made it possible to support this tremendous workload. High availability, data integrity, high performance, support of both SMPs and clustered architectures were among the features and functions that were critical. We will cover the Olympic Results System, the Commentator Information System, Info '98, Games Management, and the Olympic web site that made this information available to the Internet community. The speaker will be Ed Lassettre, IBM Fellow, and a key member of IBM's Olympic team.
