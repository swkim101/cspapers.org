A basic tenet of "Ubiquitous computing" (Weiser, 1993 [13]) is that technology should be distributed in the environment (ubiquitous), yet invisible, or transparent. In practice, resolving the seeming paradox arising from the joint demands of ubiquity and transparency is less than simple. This paper documents a case study of attempting to do just tha t. We describe our experience in developing a working conference room which is equipped to support a broad class of meetings and media. After laying the groundwork and establishing the context in the Introduction, we describe the evolution of the room. Throughout, we attempt to document the rationale and motivation. While derived from a limited domain, we believe that the issues that ari se are of general importance, and have strong implications on future research.
