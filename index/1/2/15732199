In this paper, we conducted an experiment on the latency and its compensation methods in a virtual reality application using an HMD and a 3D head tracker. Our purpose is to make a comparison both in the simulation and in the real task among four tracker prediction methods: the Grey system theory based prediction proposed in 1994. the Kalman filtering which is well-known and widespreading since 1991, a simple linear extrapolation. and the basic method without prediction. In our 3D target tracing task that involved eight subjects, who used their head motion to trace a flying target in random motion, we have found that when the system latency is 120ms. two prediction methods, Kalman filtering (not inertial-based) and Grey system prediction, are significantly better than the one without prediction, and the former two methods are equally well in performance. Typical motion trajectories of four methods in simulation are plotted, and jittering effects are examined. In terms of jittering at 120ms prediction length, Kalman filtering was evaluated to have the largest.
