In this paper, we propose an optimization scheme for deriving task-specific force closure grasps for underactuated robot hands. Motivated by recent neuroscientific studies on the human grasping behavior, a novel grasp strategy is built upon past analysis regarding the task-specificity of human grasps, that also complies with the recent soft synergy model of underactuated hands. Our scheme determines an efficient force closure grasp (i.e., configuration and contact points/forces) with a posture compatible with the desired task, taking into consideration the mechanical and geometric limitations imposed by the design of the hand and the object shape. The efficiency of the algorithm is verified through simulated paradigms on a hypothetical underactuated hand with the kinematic model of the DLR/HIT II five fingered robot hand.
