We present a component for incremental speech synthesis (iSS) and a set of applications that demonstrate its capabilities. This component can be used to increase the responsivity and naturalness of spoken interactive systems. While iSS can show its full strength in systems that generate output incrementally, we also discuss how even otherwise unchanged systems may profit from its capabilities.
