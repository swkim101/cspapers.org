More and more people are turning to the World Wide Web for learning and sharing information about their health using search engines, forums and question answering systems. In this demonstration, we look at a new way of delivering health information to the end-users via coherent conversations. The proposed conversational system allows the end-users to vaguely express and gradually refine their information needs using only natural language questions or statements as input. We provide example scenarios in this demonstration to illustrate the inadequacies of current delivery mechanisms and highlight the innovative aspects of the proposed conversational system.
