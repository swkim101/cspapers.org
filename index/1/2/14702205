Synthetic English is a very-high-level query language based on natural English. Query specification in Synthetic English parallels the user's natural thought processes, thereby allowing him to formulate complex queries without regard to implicit or explicit language control structures. Synthetic English is designed to be used in conjunction with the Functional Data Model, which is a conceptual graph model whose nodes and arcs represent sets and total functions, respectively. Further, the Functional Model admits a transformation to the Relational Model representation. Queries written in Synthetic English are easily parsed, using semantic predication analysis and the underlying graph, into primitive templates which are in one-to-one correspondence with the high-level machine language of the Relational Associative Processor called RAP. RAP is an associative and cellular back-end processor designed to support relational data bases. RAP's proven performance superiority over conventional architectures, its high-level machine language, and its query processing philosophy, make the interface to Synthetic English extremely efficient, avoiding intermediate-level code generation.
