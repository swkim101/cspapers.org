In this paper, we present a quantitative comparison between the syntactic structures of three languages: English, Chinese and Korean. This is made possible by first extracting Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars from annotated corpora for each language and then performing the comparison on the extracted grammars. We found that the majority of the core grammar structures for these three languages are easily inter-mappable.
