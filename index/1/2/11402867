The 6th ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW 2014) is held in conjunction with the 21st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2014), on November 7 at The Scottsdale Plaza Resort, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. Cloud computing is a new paradigm for computing as a utility and refers to aggregation of virtualized computing resources managed by a service provider and dynamically allocated to tenants on demand. The "cloud" transforms the entire IT industry, enables new business applications and services at reduced costs, but at the same time raises new security and privacy issues that must be addressed before its wide adoption. The CCSW workshop series focuses on the security challenges and exciting research opportunities that are brought about by recent developments in cloud computing. The goal of the workshop is to explore the novel security and privacy challenges in cloud computing, and foster the development of new ideas and solutions that can be transitioned into practice.
