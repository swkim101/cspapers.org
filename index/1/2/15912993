One of the core components in information retrieval (IR) is the document-term-weighting scheme. In this paper, we will propose a novel learning-based term-weighting approach to improve the retrieval performance of vector space model in homogeneous collections. We first introduce a simple learning system to weighting the index terms of documents. Then, we deduce a formal computational approach according to some theories of matrix computation and statistical inference. Our experiments on 8 collections will show that our approach out-performs classic tfidf weighting, about 20%-45%.
