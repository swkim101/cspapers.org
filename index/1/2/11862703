In this paper, we present a system called CRO (Chinese Review Observer) for online product review structurization. By Structurization, we mean identifying, extracting and summarizing information from unstructured review text to a structured table. The core tasks include review collection, product feature and user opinion extraction, and polarity analysis of opinions. Existing research in this area is mainly English text oriented. To deal with Chinese effectively, we propose several novel approaches for fulfilling the core tasks. Then we integrated these approaches and implement the whole procedure of review structurization in the system CRO. Running results for reviews of real products show its performance is satisfactory.
