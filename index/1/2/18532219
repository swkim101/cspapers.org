Survival is enhanced by an ability to predict the availability of food, the likelihood of predators, and the presence of mates. We present a concrete model that uses diffuse neurotransmitter systems to implement a predictive version of a Hebb learning rule embedded in a neural architecture based on anatomical and physiological studies on bees. The model captured the strategies seen in the behavior of bees and a number of other animals when foraging in an uncertain environment. The predictive model suggests a unified way in which neuromodulatory influences can be used to bias actions and control synaptic plasticity.
