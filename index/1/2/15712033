A new flexible parts feeding system has been designed and constructed at Case Western Reserve University. To complement the feeder, an object-oriented software architecture has been designed and implemented. Design goals of the software were the ability to rapidly introduce a new part into the system without major re-programming and the creation of a software architecture that would be applicable to the general class of vision-based parts feeders (rather than just our own implementation). The system currently feeds two different types of parts and can switch on-the-fly between part types. Throughputs in excess of 60 parts per minute have been achieved during testing.
