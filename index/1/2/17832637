In 1975 a major curriculum revision which converted an introductory first course using FORTRAN and a second course using PL/1 into a two-semester PL/1 sequence was made. The initial rationale and motivation, including an analysis of the potential audience and alternatives, is discussed. An overview of the individual courses, the distribution of topics, and our experience with the two courses is given. A review of this three-year old decision and another analysis of alternatives, especially in the light of the trend towards PASCAL and increasing emphasis on program verification, is made. Our conclusion is based on language-independent factors arising from our attitude towards programming and certain larger curriculum issues and is that our PL/1 sequence should be retained.
