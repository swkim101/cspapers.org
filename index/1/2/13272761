The invention of neuromorphic computing architecture is inspired by the working mechanism of human-brain. Memristor technology revitalized neuromorphic computing system design by efficiently executing the analog Matrix-Vector multiplication on the memristor-based crossbar (MBC) structure. However, programming the MBC to the target state can be very challenging due to the difficulty to real-time monitor the memristor state during the training. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the sensitivity of the MBC programming to the process variations and input signal noise. We then proposed a noise-eliminating training method on top of a new crossbar structure to minimize the noise accumulation during the MBC training and improve the trained system performance, i.e.,the pattern recall rate. A digital-assisted initialization step for MBC training is also introduced to reduce the training failure rate as well as the training time. Experimental results show that our noise-eliminating training method can improve the pattern recall rate. For the tested patterns with 128 Ã— 128 pixels our technique can reduce the MBC training time by 12.6% ~ 14.1% for the same pattern recognition rate, or improve the pattern recall rate by 18.7% ~ 36.2% for the same training time.
