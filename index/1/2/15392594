This paper describes a system for formally representing spatial relationships between videodisc image states called <italic>settings</italic>. A number of <italic>setting relations</italic> are defined, these being based on the manipulations of the camera typically used in the production of the moving film: <italic>zooming in or out, panning</italic> etc.. An algorithm is presented which, given a limited level of initial specification by a describer, will constrain, where possible, the setting relations holding between all pairs of settings. The resulting network is called the <italic>settings structure</italic>. The paper begins by placing the <italic>settings structure</italic> into the context of its being one part of the <italic>CLORIS</italic> system.
