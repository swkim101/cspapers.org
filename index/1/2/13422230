Learning objects (LOs) have been previously used in computer science education. However, analyses in previous studies have been limited to surveys with limited numbers of LOs and students. The lack of copious quantitative data on how LOs impact student learning makes detailed analysis of LO usefulness problematic. Using an empirical approach, we have studied a suite of LOs, comprehensive in both the content covered and the range of difficulty, deployed to CS1 courses from 2007-2010. We review previous work on predictors of achievement and impact of active learning and feedback. We also provide a high-level overview of our LO deployment. Finally, based on our analysis of student interaction data, we found that (1) students using LOs have significantly higher assessment scores than the control group, (2) several student attributes are significant predictors of learning, (3) active learning has a significant effect on student assessment scores, and (4) feedback does not have a significant effect, but there are variables with significant moderating effects.
