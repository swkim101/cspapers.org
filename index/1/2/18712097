In this article, we propose a soft keyboard with interaction inspired by research on visualisation information. Our goal is to find a compromise between readability and usability on a whole character layout for an Ultra mobile PC. The proposed interactions allow to display all keys on a small screen while making pointing easier for the user by expanding any given key as a function of its distance from the stylus.
