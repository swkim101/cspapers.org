We show that the expected time of the Weighted Quickfind (QFW) disjoint set union and find algorithm to perform (n - 1) randomly chosen unions is cn + o(n/log n), where c = 2.0847 …. This implies, through an observation of Tarjan and Van Leeuwen, linear expected time bounds to perform O(n) unions and finds for a class of other union -find algorithms. We also prove that the expected time of the unweighted Quickfind (QF) algorithm is n2/8 + o(n(log n)2), and set the several related open questions of Knuth and Schönhage.
