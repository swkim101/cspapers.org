Nowadays, WWW brings overwhelming variety of choices to consumers. Recommendation systems facilitate the selection by issuing recommendations to them. Recommendations for users, or groups, are determined by considering users similar to the users in question. Scanning the whole database for locating similar users, though, is expensive. Existing approaches build cluster models by employing full-dimensional clustering to find sets of similar users. As the datasets we deal with are high-dimensional and incomplete, full-dimensional clustering is not the best option. To this end, we explore the fault-tolerant subspace clustering approach. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to density-based subspace clustering, and to speed up our algorithms, we introduce the significance threshold for considering only promising dimensions for subspace extension. Moreover, as we potentially receive a multitude of users from subspace clustering, we propose a weighted ranking approach to refine the set of like-minded users. Our experiments on real movie datasets show that the diversification of the similar users that the subspace clustering approaches offer results in better recommendations compared to traditional collaborative filtering and full-dimensional clustering approaches.
