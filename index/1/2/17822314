On behalf of the rapid urbanization, urban areas are gradually becoming a sophisticated space where we often need to know ever evolving features to take the most of the space. Therefore, keeping up with the dynamic change of urban space would be necessary, while it usually requires lots of efforts to understand newly visiting and daily changing living spaces. In order to explore and exploit the urban complexity from crowd-sourced lifelogs, we focus on location-based social network sites. In fact, due to the proliferation of location-based social networks, we can easily acquire massive crowd-sourced lifelogs interestingly indicating their experiences in the real space. In particular, we can conduct various novel urban analytics by monitoring crowd's experiences in an unprecedented way. In this paper, we particularly attempt to exploit crowd-sourced location-based lifelogs for generating a socio-cognitive map, whose purpose is to deliver much simplified and intuitive perspective of urban space. For the purpose, we measure socio-cognitive distance among urban clusters based on human mobility to represent accessibility of urban areas based on crowd's movement. Finally, we generate a socio-cognitive map reflecting the proposed socio-cognitive distances which have computed with massive geo-tagged tweets from Twitter.
