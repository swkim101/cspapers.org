An overview is given of the development and operation of a large computer-aided design (CAD) system for the physical realization and documentation of Electronic Switching Systems. The No. 4 ESS physical characteristics contain frames of equipment which include a large number of plug-in digital logic thin film circuit packs.
 An integrated computer support system with data base management control has been developed to assist in the design of such systems. Specifications for the CAD system were jointly established by user and programming teams.
 The CAD system is used in a hierarchial manner. Programs are executed to design and build data bases at the circuit pack level. These data bases then form the building blocks to progess to the next level of circuit pack electrical interconnection or frame level of design and documentation. Subsequent use of the frame level data base, together with a data base which describes the physical (geometric) relationship of circuit packs in the frame yields still another data base which contains backplane detailed wiring requirements.
 The entry of design changes and the data base management of the large number of data bases are accomplished by the formal application of data verification and check programs following each change transaction.
 The computer-aided system described herein has been a significant factor in the rapid development of No. 4 ESS. Cost and schedule effectiveness has been achieved. The benefits of computerized data generated from design inception through manufacturing and testing applications has been realized.
