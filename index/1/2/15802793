Within the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval(INEX) a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of content-oriented XML retrieval approaches were developed. Although these metrics provide a solution towards addressing the problem of overlapping result elements, they do not consider the problem of overlapping reference components within the recall-base, thus leading to skewed effectiveness scores. We propose alternative metrics that aim to provide a solution to both overlap issues.
