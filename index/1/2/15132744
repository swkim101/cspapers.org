the blocks that the reordered matrix Parallel algorithms which combine high efficiency with good stability on vector and parallel computers are developed. These algorithms gene&se cyclic reduction in several ways: They use Householder-based QR factorisation as basic elimination procedure, they use multiple wrap-around partitioning permutations instead of the odd-even permutations of cyclic reduction and they handle problems of any size. A simple timing model is used to develop optimal permutations. The models (and initial tests) suggest that methods combining tricyclic reduction-like steps with cyclic reductionlike steps lead to good performance. The algorithm is memory efficient. A11
