In this paper we present a methodology for discriminating between different objects using only a single force closure grasp with an underactuated robot hand equipped with force sensors. The technique leverages the benefits of simple, adaptive robot grippers (which can grasp successfully without prior knowledge of the hand or the object model), with an advanced machine learning technique (Random Forests). Unlike prior work in literature, the proposed methodology does not require object exploration, release or re-grasping and works for arbitrary object positions and orientations within the reach of a grasp. A two-fingered compliant, underactuated robot hand is controlled in an open-loop fashion to grasp objects with various shapes, sizes and stiffness. The Random Forests classification technique is used in order to discriminate between different object classes. The feature space used consists only of the actuator positions and the force sensor measurements at two specific time instances of the grasping process. A feature variables importance calculation procedure facilitates the identification of the most crucial features, concluding to the minimum number of sensors required. The efficiency of the proposed method is validated with two experimental paradigms involving two sets of fabricated model objects with different shapes, sizes and stiffness and a set of everyday life objects.
