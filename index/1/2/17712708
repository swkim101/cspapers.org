An extended relational database and its application to VLSI data management are described. The following shortcomings mainly arise when we try to apply conventional DBMSs to management of engineering data : lack of facilities to support various data types, a design hierarchy, version control and efficient access to design data. We have extended the relational data model by supporting (1) a set of graphics functions that bridge relational data structures to graphics representations, (2) a special data type that allows a designer of the database to model the design hierarchy ( including versions ) explicitly. Ordinary relational databases appear to be too slow to be used on-line in a design process. Our hypothesis is that it does not come from the nature of the relational model, but rather internal access mechanisms. We have developed our system in such a way that data on a design object are stored as interrelated collections of records and are manipulated as a logical group. As a result, our system offers sufficient facilities and performance for interactive use of design data at design system level.
