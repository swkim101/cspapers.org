The goal of the MosquitoNet project is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to mobile hosts. Mobile hosts must be able to take advantage of the best network connectivity available in any location, whether wired or wireless. We have implemented a mobile IP system that supports seamless switching between different networks and communication devices. In contrast to previous approaches to mobile IP, we believe mobile hosts should not assume any explicit mobility support from the networks they visit, aside from basic Internet connectivity. This decision places extra responsibilities on the mobile hosts themselves. In this paper, we describe the design and implications of such a system. Measurements of our implementation show that the inherent overhead to switch networks (below 10ms) is insignificant compared to the time required to bring up a new communication device.
