Many kinds of real world data can be modeled by a heterogeneous information network (HIN) which consists of multiple types of objects. Clustering plays an important role in mining knowledge from HIN. Several HIN clustering algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, these algorithms suffer from one or moreof the following problems: (1) inability to model general HINs, (2) inability to simultaneously generate clusters for all types of objects, (3) inability to use similarity information of the objects with the same type. In this paper, we propose a powerful HIN clustering algorithm which can handle general HINs, simultaneously generate clusters for all types of objects, and use the similarity information of the same type of objects. First, we transform a general HIN into a meta-path-encoded relationship set. Second, we propose a nonnegative matrix tri-factorization multi-type co-clustering method, HMFClus, to cluster all types of objects in HIN simultaneously. Third, we integrate the information between the objects with the same type into HMFClus by using a similarity regularization. Extensive experiments on real world datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
