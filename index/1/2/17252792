Because views on relational database systems mathematically define arbitrary sets of stored and derived data, they have been proposed as a way of handling context- and contenbdependent classification, dynamic classification, inference, aggregation, and sanitization in multilevel database systems. This paper describes basic view concepts for a multilevelsecure relational database model that addresses the above issues. The model treats stored and derived data uniformly within the database schema. All data in the database is classified according to views called classification constraints, which specify security levels for related data. In addition, views called aggregation constraints specifies classifications for aggregates that are classified higher than the constituent elements. All data accesses are confined to a third set of views called access views, which higher than their declared filter out all data classified view level.
