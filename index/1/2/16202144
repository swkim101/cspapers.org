Office wall calendars often contain only entries considered public, which reduces their utility for scheduling meetings or gaining an overview of one's schedule. PriCal is a collaborative calendar display that dynamically adapts to present persons and their privacy preferences. We outline our current prototype, consisting of a calendar agent for display adaptation, a mobile app for managing individual calendars and privacy settings, and a system for detecting present persons and identifying registered users.
