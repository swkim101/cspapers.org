We present a fully automatic approach to detect and segment fence-like occluders from a video clip. Unlike previous approaches that usually assume either static scenes or cameras, our method is capable of handling both dynamic scenes and moving cameras. Under a bottom-up framework, it first clusters pixels into coherent groups using color and motion features. These pixel groups are then analyzed in a fully connected graph, and labeled as either fence or non-fence using graph-cut optimization. Finally, we solve a dense Conditional Random Filed (CRF) constructed from multiple frames to enhance both spatial accuracy and temporal coherence of the segmentation. Once segmented, one can use existing hole-filling methods to generate a fencefree output. Extensive evaluation suggests that our method outperforms previous automatic and interactive approaches on complex examples captured by mobile devices.
