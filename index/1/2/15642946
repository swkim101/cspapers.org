This paper presents patterns of cooperative interaction derived from ethnographic studies of cooperative work as devices for generalisation, re-use and design. These patterns consist of examples of similar social and interactional phenomena found in different studies that serve as resources for defining and envisaging design concepts, and potential work process and technical solutions. We outline new pattern examples and demonstrate their use in application to a complex setting: e-government in local government planning
