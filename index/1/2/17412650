Information retrieval in search advertising, as in other ad-hoc retrieval tasks, aims to find the most appropriate ranking of the ad documents of a corpus for a given query. In addition to ranking the ad documents, we also need to filter or threshold irrelevant ads from participating in the auction to be displayed alongside search results. In this work, we describe our experience in implementing a successful ad retrieval system for a commercial search engine based on the Language Modeling (LM) framework for retrieval. The LM demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baseline vector space model (TF-IDF) system that was in production at the time. From a modeling perspective, we propose a novel approach to incorporate query segmentation and phrases in the LM framework, discuss impact of score normalization for relevance filtering, and present preliminary results of incorporating query expansions using query rewriting techniques. From an implementation perspective, we also discuss real-time latency constraints of a production search engine and how we overcome them by adapting the WAND algorithm to work with language models. In sum, our LM formulation is considerably better in terms of accuracy metrics such as Precision-Recall (10% improvement in AUC) and nDCG (8% improvement in nDCG@5) on editorial data and also demonstrates significant improvements in clicks in live user tests (0.787% improvement in Click Yield, with 8% coverage increase). Finally, we hope that this paper provides the reader with adequate insights into the challenges of building a system that serves millions of users every day.
