Our project demonstrates the capabilities of a symbiotic phone-robot hybrid device, wherein the robot provides gross motor control and the phone provides fine course corrections and sensing capability. The crude robot generates movement subject to mechanical wheel asymmetries and non-linear motor effects; the inexpensive phone provides a variety of on-board sensors and a reasonably powerful CPU/memory. We demonstrate the utility of the combined device to provide a reasonably accurate autonomous signal mapping on an untrained floor plan in our building.
