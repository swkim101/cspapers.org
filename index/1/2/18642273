This paper investigates the use of the FAB-MAP appearance-only SLAM algorithm as a method for performing visual data association for RatSLAM, a semi-metric full SLAM system. While both systems have shown the ability to map large (60-70km) outdoor locations of approximately the same scale, for either larger areas or across longer time periods both algorithms encounter difficulties with false positive matches. By combining these algorithms using a mapping between appearance and pose space, both false positives and false negatives generated by FAB-MAP are significantly reduced during outdoor mapping using a forward-facing camera. The hybrid FAB-MAP-RatSLAM system developed demonstrates the potential for successful SLAM over large periods of time.
