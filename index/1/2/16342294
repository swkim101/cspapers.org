This paper discusses the programming language course and presents an approach to some of the pedagogical challenges presented. We aim to expose students to all the concepts central to a traditional programming language course but also give experience with the implementation of various languages. To this end, we are developing a software environment, MULE, which supports this teaching goal. This paper gives an overview of MULE and discusses our recent experiences using MULE as a teaching tool.
