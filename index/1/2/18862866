It is difficult to visualize the behaviour of an embedded system in its operational environment from a specification of the system alone. However, it is unacceptable to wait for system completion before validating its behaviour. Discrete event simulation is an effective technique for making quantitative predictions about system behaviour, provided that the model is derived carefully from the system specification. We summarize the steps involved in deriving an Ada** simulation program from a JSD function step specification, using a lift system as an illustration. Having used this technique, we conclude that while it is time-consuming and not amenable to automation in the near future, it is cost-effective because it helps to elucidate counter-intuitive interactions between system functions and environmental parameters.
