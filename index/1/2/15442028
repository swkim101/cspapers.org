In this paper we describe a novel approach to autonomous dirt road following. The algorithm is able to recognize highly curved roads in cluttered color images quite often appearing in offroad scenarios. To cope with large curvatures we apply gaze control and model the road using two different clothoid segments. A Particle Filter incorporating edge and color intensity information is used to simultaneously detect and track the road farther away from the ego vehicle. In addition the particles are used to generate static road segment estimations in a given look ahead distance. These estimations are predicted with respect to ego motion and fused utilizing Kalman filter techniques to generate a smooth local clothoid segment for lateral control of the vehicle.
