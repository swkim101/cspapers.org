In this study, a technique of performing multiple attribute clustering in dynamic databases has been investigated. We have transformed the problem of performing multiple attribute clustering into a problem of dynamically partitioning the attribute space. The optimal number of partitioning of the attribute space in a dynamic database environment has been analyzed, the partitioning direction is controlled by a discriminator sequence. The design of the discriminator sequence to obtain the optimal partitioning is presented. The selection of the directory attributes has also been discussed. Using the extended K-d tree to direct the partitioning, we have presented the extended K-d tree method. Empirical results have justified the improvement of the performance using the extended K-d tree method, when compared with that using the single attribute clustering or using inverted file method without any clustering index.
