and citation, whereas records describing office documents mainly comprise descriptors of their contents. A 'query' usually comprises a set of search terms, often called a 'profile', which is designed to retrieve relevant records from the data file. Search terms specify key values for comparison with the key words or descriptors of the stored records. Multi-key profiles allow queries to be expressed in combinational logic. Depending on the sophistication of the retrieval facility, search keys may comprise complete words, word-stems or word fragments (viz. leftand/or right-truncated words) or text fragments (viz. character substrings crossing word boundaries). Fragments offer maximum flexibility by supporting unrestricted search keys in 'free-text' retrieval systems. Further sophistications include the use of 'character masking' and allow 'weights' to be ascribed to search keys so that only those records scoring above a defined 'threshold' are retrieved. It is clear that information retrieval is a form of set processing in which a
