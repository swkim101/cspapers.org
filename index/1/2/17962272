The use of algebraic techniques in defining a neighborhood of functions is particularly suited to testing for computation errors. Two possible approaches are Howden's algebraic testing method and perturbation testing, which in this paper is generalized to permit analysis of individual test points rather than entire paths. These approaches are shown to be mathematically equivalent when applied to a program's black-box output. Perturbation testing, however, offers more flexibility in the choice of potential errors to be investigated. A significant alternative offered by perturbation testing is the ability to work in the static domain, choosing test data to eliminate possible error terms in specific assignment and output statements.
