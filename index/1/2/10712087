Aging of transistors has become a major reliability concern especially when the VLSI circuits are in the nanometer regime. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to address circuit aging in the field. On-chip aging sensor is designed to monitor transitions on functional paths capturing functional mode workload. Path delay is then accurately measured and converted to a digital value. Diagnosis and calibration are performed in the field, thereby achieving power-performance optimization throughout the entire lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed structure.
