We develop a general dynamic programming technique for the tabulation of transition-based dependency parsers, and apply it to obtain novel, polynomial-time algorithms for parsing with the arc-standard and arc-eager models. We also show how to reverse our technique to obtain new transition-based dependency parsers from existing tabular methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of the conditions under which the feature models commonly used in transition-based parsing can be integrated into our algorithms.
