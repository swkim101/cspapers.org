We propose implicit interfaces that use passive physiological input as additional communication channels between wearable devices and wearers. A defining characteristic of physiological input is that it is implicit and continuous, distinguishing it from conventional event-driven action on a keyboard, for example, which is explicit and discrete. By considering the fundamental differences between the two types of inputs, we introduce a core framework to support building implicit interface, such that the framework follows the three key principles: Subscription, Accumulation, and Interpretation of implicit inputs. Unlike a conventional event driven system, our framework subscribes to continuous streams of input data, accumulates the data in a buffer, and subsequently attempts to recognize patterns in the accumulated data -- upon request from the application, rather than directly in response to the input events. Finally, in order to embody the impacts of implicit interfaces in the real world, we introduce two prototype applications for Google Glass, Zero Shutter Camera triggering a camera snapshot and Phylter filtering notifications the both leverage the wearer's physiological state information.
