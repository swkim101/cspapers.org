COMES, a system for computer aided instruction oriented to programming languages, is described here. The system allows a full integration of theory learning and practical applications since it offers two different teaching strategies, one corresponding to a purely tutorial environment and one to a programming and problem-solving environment that has to be specialized for a given programming language. Thus, the learning process can be based on a tight alternation of theory and practice and relies more on personal experience than on memorization of abstract information. The main design choices are discussed in the paper and two examples of dialogues are supplied.
