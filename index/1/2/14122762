The wavefront expansion is commonly used for path planning tasks and appreciated for its efficiency. However, the existing extensions able to handle currents are subject to incorrectness and incompleteness issues when these currents become strong. That is, they may return physically infeasible paths or no path at all, even if a feasible path exists. This behavior endangers the robot, especially in a dynamic replanning context. That is why we propose a new extension called sliding wavefront expansion. This algorithm, combining an appropriate cost function and continuous optimization techniques, guarantees the existence of a path with an arbitrary precision.
