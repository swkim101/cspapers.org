Post-retrieval clustering is the task of clustering Web search results. Within this context, we propose a new methodology that adapts the classical K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure initially developed for NLP tasks. Results obtained with the definition of a new stopping criterion over the ODP-239 and the MORESQUE golden standard datasets evidence that our proposal outperforms all reported text-based approaches.
