A simple algorithm is presented for increasing the efficiency of information retrieval searches which are implemented using inverted files. This optimization algorithm employs knowledge about the methods used for weighting document and query terms in order to examine as few inverted lists as possible. An extension to the basic algorithm allows greatly increased performance optimization at a modest cost in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental runs are made examining several different term weighting models and showing the optimization possible with each.
