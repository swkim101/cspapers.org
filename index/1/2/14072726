Nowadays, more and more electronic displays are integrated into modern supermarkets in order to display advertisement or to act as price tags referred to as electronic shelf labels (ESL). Due to the low power consumption, wireless accessibility and appropriate resolution, these displays represent an alternative to state-of-the-art paper printed price labels. Nevertheless, there are several types of displays regarding size, resolution and communication channel. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically generate display content for different display types. Besides the connection to the displays, the framework also includes the possibility to generate the content to be displayed based on application plugins. The plugin approach facilitates both the integration of new display types and the creation of new applications. We explain the prototypical implementation of several plugins as well as the application at an instrumented shopping environment.
