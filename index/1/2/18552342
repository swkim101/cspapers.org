Nonlinear magnetic devices present complexities in circuit analysis that are not readily solved by conventional techniques. Two algorithms are developed that provide computer-aided techniques for the classical problems of saturation, hystersis and the multicircuit device. Hystersis, long recognized as a difficult analytical problem, is managed by dual numerical integration for each nonlinear magnetic device.
