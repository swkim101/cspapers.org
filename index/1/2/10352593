A basic feature of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) is their ability to represent domain knowledge that can be attributed to the student at each stage of the learning process. In this paper we present a general (first order logic) framework for the representation of this kind of knowledge acquired by the system through the analysis of the student answers. This represantation makes it possible to describe the behaviour of well known ITSs and to provide a direct implementation in a logic programming language. Moreover, we point out several improvements that can be easily achieved by exploiting the features of a declarative approach. In particular, we address the representation and use of the knowledge that the system knows not to be possessed by the student.
