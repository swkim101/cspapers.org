It is well known that the problem of generating tests for logic circuits is a very difficult one to solve in a cost-effective way. In the work described in this paper it is shown that the combination of a good test generation algorithm and a suitable set of heuristics may be a way to obtain a test generator of larger capacity and higher speed than is possible with the algorithmic program alone.
