The self-driving car become a completely novel application to fulfill highly safe driving era, in which the Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communications and cloud computing act as the key technologies. In such new-trend applications, for shortening the emergency messages transmitting or sharing among the self-driving cars and human-driving cars, the message broadcasting is adopted, but suffers from the broadcasting storm and message flooding. Clearly, for the mobile society via V2X, the message broadcasting protocol leads to an unpredictable long forwarding delay and degrades the QoS of real-time transmission and the synchronization interval of the adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper thus proposes an efficient emergency message forwarding approach to guarantee the broadcasting delay and to prevent the broadcasting storm for V2X communications in 5G mobile society. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the compared approaches in transmission range, connectivity probability, total number of forwarding messages, number of hop-counts, and end-to-end delay.
