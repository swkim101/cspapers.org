A new learning model based on autoassociative neural networks is developped and applied to face detection. To extend the detection ability in orientation and to decrease the number of false alarms, different combinations of networks are tested: ensemble, conditional ensemble and conditional mixture of networks. The use of a conditional mixture of networks allows to obtain state of the art results on different benchmark face databases.
