This paper proposes a novel approach to improving precision and reliability of odometry of skid-steer mobile robots by means inspired by robotic terrain classification (RTC). In contrary to standard RTC approaches we do not provide human labeled discrete terrain categories but we classify the terrain directly by the values of coefficients correcting the robot's odometry. Hence these coefficients make the odometry model adaptable to the terrain type due to inherent slip compensation. Estimation of these correction coefficients is based on feature extraction from the vibration data measured by an inertial measurement unit and regression function trained offline. Statistical features from the time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet features were explored and the best were automatically selected. To provide ground truth trajectory for the purpose of offline training a portable overhead camera tracking system was developed. Experimental evaluation on rough outdoor terrain proved 67.9Â±7.5% improvement in RMSE in position with respect to a state of the art odometry model. Moreover, our proposed approach is straightforward, easy for online implementation, and low on computational demands.
