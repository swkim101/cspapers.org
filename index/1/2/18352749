This paper describes a new concept for locomotion of mobile robots based on single actuated tensegrity structures. To discuss the working principle, two vibration-driven locomotion systems are considered. Due to the complex dynamics of the applied tensegrity structures with pronounced mechanical compliance, the movement performance of both systems is highly dependent on the driving frequency. By using single-actuation, the system design and also their control can be kept simple. The movement of the robots is depending on their configuration uniaxial bidirectional or planar. The working principle of both systems is discussed with the help of transient dynamic analyses and verified with experimental tests for a selected prototype.
