The thesis presented in this paper tackles selected issues in unstructured peer-to-peer information retrieval (P2PIR) systems, using world knowledge for solving P2PIR problems. A first part uses so-called reference corpora for estimating global term weights such as IDF instead of sampling them from the distributed collection. A second part of the work will be dedicated to the question of query routing in unstructured P2PIR systems using peer resource descriptions and world knowledge for query expansion.
