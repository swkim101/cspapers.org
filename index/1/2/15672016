With the widespread use of Internet especially search engine, people nowadays can easily browse the Web through network of URL. In this study, features of webpages on Internet have been analyzed carefully and a search-based text steganography model has been proposed. The model is based on a hypothesis that features of huge amount data on Internet can make secret message sender find a webpage that contains all the information to describe a secret message. So that the sender no longer needs to modify the webpage as cover data. But is the hypothesis reasonable? Therefore, this paper proofs mainly that such an ideal webpage will exist under some assumptions from the perspective of information theory and practice respectively. Meanwhile, the steganography framework based on searching a webpage containing the sent secret message is designed. Experi-mental results show that the proposed method provides a high embedding capacity and has good imperceptibility.
