In this paper, we propose a new approach to multi-objective optimization problems: the User-Preference-Oriented Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm (UPOMOA). In UPOMOA, we use the preference-oriented elite selection scheme (POESS) to select parents. The experimental results show thta our method can find solutions very close to those derived by using NSGAII and near the user's preference.
