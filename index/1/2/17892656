A CACM by Park and Miller [6] advocated a standard for random number generators based on the Lehmer generator [5] and criticised a number of computer science textbooks for presenting bad random number generators. This paper advocates the proposed standard and presents a set of generators based on theoretically sound principles that are also useful for microcomputer implementation and classroom presentations at the introductory level.
