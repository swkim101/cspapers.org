The following paper contains a description of a computer program that constructs hierarchical semantic networks from natural language texts in simulating completely and precisely the meaning of the input text. The program works with a formal grammar describing sentences syntactically and a formal semantic stransducing texts to networks dependent on their syntactic description. The networks' nodes have concepts or again networks, as their values. The networks' edges are many-place relations among the concepts respectively networks. They are realized as reference structures. The program in its fietual state works on domains which art to comprehend sematically rather well: A network has been constructured automatically for the area of general topology from a compendi urn's definitions (N. Bourbaki. E lenient s of Mathcmatics. General topology). Another one is being constructed for the area of computer science.
