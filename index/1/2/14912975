Object handover is a basic task in many human-robot interactive scenarios and therefore, it is important for assistive robots to be able to perform proper handovers. We previously designed a human-inspired grip-force-varying handover controller for a robot giver and showed on a Willow Garage PR2 robot that the controller yields human-like and human-preferred handovers. The PR2 robot had a non-compliant fully-actuated gripper. However, recently, compliant underactuated grippers have been gaining more popularity. Although compliant underactuated grippers can provide more flexibility in manipulation, it is generally difficult to accurately measure and control the amount of applied grip force. In this paper, we present an implementation of the human-inspired handover controller on a Kawada Industries HRP4R robot, which has compliant underactuated hands, using joint position error measurement for estimating the amount of applied grip force. Through an experiment, we show that we are able to achieve safe, smooth, and intuitive robot-human handovers despite the lack of accurate grip force control on our robot.
