This case study explores the evolution of the Franklin Content Management System, developed by IBM's Internet Technology Group. Franklin began as a technology-driven process to provide a web content management solution with the following goals: content reusability, simplified management of content and design that enforces integrity and consistency, the customization of content to individual users, and the delivery of content to a variety of display devices.These goals were met in part by the decomposition of information into reusable fragments represented in XML. This approach provides unique opportunities in a content management system. However, it also raises some interesting challenges in the deployment of such a tool and the education of its users.The development of Franklin evolved over a two year period and has culminated in the deployment of 62 country portals within the ibm.com domain. Furthermore, concepts from the Franklin project are influencing the strategy and design of IBM offerings.
