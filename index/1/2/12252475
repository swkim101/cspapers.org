WebRogue is an application for virtual presence over the Web. It provides the Web Browser with a chat subwindow that allows users connected to the same Web site to meet, share opinions and cooperate in a totally free, non moderated and uncensored environment. Each time the user loads a Web page in the Web Browser, WebRogue opens a discussion channel in a centralized server application, that is completely decoupled from the Web server, using the URL of the Web site as a key. Thus whenever a new page is loaded the user can see who is connected, as if entering a physical site. Interactivity is supported by means of two type of commands: comunication commands allow synchronous interaction as with chat or instant messaging software; Social commands allow cooperation: group surfing, exchange of visit-cards and wait in line.
