Automatically generated databases of English paraphrases have the drawback that they return a single list of paraphrases for an input word or phrase. This means that all senses of polysemous words are grouped together, unlike WordNet which partitions different senses into separate synsets. We present a new method for clustering paraphrases by word sense, and apply it to the Paraphrase Database (PPDB). We investigate the performance of hierarchical and spectral clustering algorithms, and systematically explore different ways of deÔ¨Åning the similarity matrix that they use as input. Our method produces sense clusters that are qualitatively and quantitatively good, and that represent a substantial improvement to the PPDB resource.
