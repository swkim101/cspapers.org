Top-K query processing is one of the most important problems in large-scale Information Retrieval systems. Since query processing time varies for different queries, an accurate run-time performance prediction is critical for online query scheduling and load balancing, which could eventually reduce the query waiting time and improve the throughput. Previous studies estimated the query processing time based on the combination of term-level features. Unfortunately, these features were often selected arbitrarily, and the linear combination of these features might not be able to accurately capture the complexity in the query processing. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical performance modeling framework for top-K query processing. Our goal is to provide a systematic way of identifying important features for the efficiency prediction and then develop a general framework for estimating the query processing time. Specifically, we divide the query processing into three stages, identify useful features and discuss how to use them to model the query processing time for each stage. After that, we propose to fit the model using a step-by-step strategy and compute the approximated feature values based on easily obtained statistics. Experimental results on TREC collections show that the developed performance model can predict the query processing time more accurately than the state of the art efficiency predictor, in particular for the dynamic pruning methods.
