The aim of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) is to create a Cranfield-like evaluation framework in the spirit of TREC, CLEF and NTCIR, for Indian Language Information Retrieval. For the first year, six Indian languages have been selected: Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu. This poster describes the tasks as well as the document and topic collections that are to be used at the FIRE workshop.
