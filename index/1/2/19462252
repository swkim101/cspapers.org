A step-by-step presentation for the introductory computer science course which introduces the student to structured problem solving has been developed. By emphasizing the importance of “finding the pattern” and developing sequential algorithms from a top-down point of view, the students seem to have a better grasp on how to solve a problem, how to use a language, and how to apply what they have learned to later courses which use the computer.
