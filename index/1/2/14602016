Engineering models of human performance permit some aspects of usability of interface designs to be predicted from an analysis of the task, and thus can replace to some extent expensive user testing data. 5/22/13 4:56 PM Predictive Engineering Models Using the EPIC Architecture for a High-Performance Task Page 2 of 10 http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/papers/dek_bdy.htm Human performance in telephone operator tasks was successfully predicted using engineering models constructed in the EPIC (Executive Process-Interactive Control) architecture for human informationprocessing, which is especially suited for modeling multimodal, complex tasks. Several models were constructed on an a priori basis to represent different hypotheses about how users coordinate their activities to produce rapid task performance. All of the models predicted the total task time with useful accuracy, and clarified some important properties of the task.
