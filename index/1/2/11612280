It is shown that both changes in viewing position and illumination conditions can be compensated for, prior to recognition, using combinations of images taken from different viewing positions and different illumination conditions. It is also shown that, in agreement with psychophysical findings, the computation requires at least a sign-bit image as input -- contours alone are not sufficient.
