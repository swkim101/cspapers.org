Vehicular ad hoc networks are highly dynamic and their topology changes frequently due to high speed of vehicles. This result in disconnected networks, therefore, designing a routing protocol for such network is challenging task. The two most important factors which effect routing in vehicular ad hoc networks are Speed and direction. In this work, we propose a novel routing protocol (E-GyTAR) motivated from GyTAR, which was specifically designed for city environments. This paper presents the effect of speed and direction on routing protocol in city environment. City environment consists of junctions and these junctions are selected dynamically on the basis of vehicular speed and directional density. Simulation results show that E-GyTAR incurs less packet loss, and end-to-end delay.
