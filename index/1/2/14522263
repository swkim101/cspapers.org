This paper presents a deep learning architecture for detecting the palm and fingertip positions of stable grasps directly from partial object views. The architecture is trained using RGBD image patches of fingertip and palm positions from grasps computed on complete object models using a grasping simulator. At runtime, the architecture is able to estimate grasp quality metrics without the need to explicitly calculate the given metric. This ability is useful as the exact calculation of these quality functions is impossible from an incomplete view of a novel object without any tactile feedback. This architecture for grasp quality prediction provides a framework for generalizing grasp experience from known to novel objects.
