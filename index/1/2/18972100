We present work in progress in the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to the analysis of textual transcriptions of psychotherapy sessions in the Spanish Language. We are developing a set of NLP tools as well as adapting an existing dictionary for the analysis of interviews framed on a psychoanalytic theory. We investigate the application of NLP techniques, including dictionary-based interpretation, and speech act identification and classification for the (semi) automatic identification in text of a set of psychoanalytical variables. The objective of the work is to provide a set of tools and resources to assist therapist during discourse analysis.
