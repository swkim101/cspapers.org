This paper considers pick-and-place tasks using aerial vehicles equipped with manipulators. The main focus is on the development and experimental validation of a nonlinear model-predictive control methodology to exploit the multi-body system dynamics and achieve optimized performance. At the core of the approach lies a sequential Newton method for unconstrained optimal control and a high-frequency low-level controller tracking the generated optimal reference trajectories. A low cost quadrotor prototype with a simple manipulator extending more than twice the radius of the vehicle is designed and integrated with an on-board vision system for object tracking. Experimental results show the effectiveness of model-predictive control to motivate the future use of real-time optimal control in place of standard ad-hoc gain scheduling techniques.
