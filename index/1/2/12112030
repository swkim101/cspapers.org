I argue from studies of human performance including slips of action and skilled typing that human processing structures are of a special sort, with weak binding between functions and arguments, with strong excitatory and inhibitory interactions among simultaneous processes and with the parts of action sequences neither stongly ordered nor tightly coupled I argue that analyses of human performance imply a class of processing stuctures quite different than is commonly envisioned within Artificial Intelligence.
