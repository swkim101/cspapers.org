It is becoming a global trend for company employees equipped with mobile devices to access companyâ€™s assets. Besides enterprise apps, lots of personal apps from various untrusted app stores may also be installed on those devices. To secure the business environment, policy enforcement on what, how, and when certain apps can access system resources is required by enterprise IT. However, Android, the largest mobile platform with a market share of 81.9%, provides very restricted interfaces for enterprise policy enforcement. In this paper, we present DeepDroid, a dynamic enterprise security policy enforcement scheme on Android devices. Different from existing approaches, DeepDroid is implemented by dynamic memory instrumentation of a small number of critical system processes without any firmware modification. DeepDroid can be easily deployed on various smartphone platforms with a wide range of Android versions. Moreover, based on the context information extracted from Binder interception, a fine-grained policy can be enforced. We develop a prototype of DeepDroid and test it on various smartphones and Android versions. The experimental results show that DeepDroid can effectively enforce enterprise resource access policies with negligible performance overhead.
