When deciding what to do agents must choose among alternative actions and different agents may make different choices according to what they wish to achieve in the light of their preferences and values. It cannot be assumed, however, that agents have a conscious understanding of their value preferences independent of the reasoning situations in which they engage. In this paper we consider an extension to a generic framework for reasoning about arguments justifying actions in terms of values in which the preferences amongst values emerge from the reasoning process.
