We describe a simple approach to "point-in-time" file sharing based on time expiring web links and personal webservers. This approach to file sharing is useful in environments where instant messaging clients are varied and don't necessarily support (compatible) file transfer protocols. We discuss the features of such an approach along with a successfully deployed implementation now in wide use throughout the IBM corporation.
