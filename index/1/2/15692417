Incorporation of language techniques in various web search engines has shown both positive and negative effects on retrieval performance. This paper describes an experiment conducted to determine the impact document and query normalization has on retrieval performance of a Greek web search engine. Experiments especially focus on the measurement of Recall and Precision of the obtained results and show whether information retrieval can benefit from normalization techniques. Results show that normalization yields significant improvement concerning recall of the retrieved data, whereas precision strongly depends on the queries issued to the engine.
