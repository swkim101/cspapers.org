Uncovering the "nature" of the connections between a set of entities e.g. passengers on a flight and organizations on a watchlist can be viewed as a Multi-Source Multi-Destination (MSMD) Path Query problem on labeled graph data models such as RDF. Using existing graph-navigational path finding techniques to solve MSMD problems will require queries to be decomposed into multiple single-source or destination path subqueries, each of which is solved independently. Navigational techniques on disk-resident graphs typically generate very poor I/O access patterns for large, disk-resident graphs and for MSMD path queries, such poor access patterns may be repeated if common graph exploration steps exist across subqueries. In this paper, we propose an optimization technique for general MSMD path queries that generalizes an efficient algebraic approach for solving a variety of single-source path problems. The generalization enables holistic evaluation of MSMD path queries without the need for query decomposition. We present a conceptual framework for sharing computation in the algebraic framework that is based on "suffix equivalence". Suffix equivalence amongst subqueries captures the fact that multiple subqueries with different prefixes can share a suffix and as such share the computation of shared suffixes, which allows prefix path computations to share common suffix path computations. This approach offers orders of magnitude better performance than current existing techniques as demonstrated by a comprehensive experimental evaluation over real and synthetic datasets.
