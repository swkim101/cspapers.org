Cameras may have non-ideal radiometric aspects, including spatial non-uniformity, e.g., due to vignetting; a nonlinear radiometric response of the sensor; and temporal variations due to automatic gain control (AGC). Often, these characteristics exist simultaneously, and are typically unknown. They thus hinder consistent photometric measurements. In particular, they create annoying seams in image mosaics. Prior studies approached part of these problems while excluding others. We handle all these problems in a unified framework. We suggest an approach for simultaneously estimating the radiometric response, the spatial non-uniformity and the temporally varying gain. The approach does not rely on dedicated processes that intentionally vary exposure settings. Rather, it is based on an ordinary frame sequence acquired during camera motion. The estimated non-ideal characteristics are then compensated for. We state fundamental ambiguities associated with this recovery problem, while exposing a novel image invariance. The method is demonstrated in several experiments, where different frames are brought into mutual radiometric consistency. The accuracy achieved is sufficient for seamless mosaicing, with no need to resort to dedicated seam-feathering methods.
