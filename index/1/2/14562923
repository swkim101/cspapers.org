The CRISP Microprocessor contains a number of new architectural features to achieve high performance and support the C programming language, t The instruction set was designed to be independent of architectural tradeoffs used in any single implementation. This paper describes the particular tradeoffs used in the implementation of a 172,163 transistor 32-bit single chip microprocessor. 2 Many tradeoffs were used in the design of CRISP, this paper tries to focus on those particular to C.
