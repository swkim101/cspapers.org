This paper presents the iMPAcT tool that tests recurring behaviour, i.e., UI Patterns, on mobile applications. This tool is implemented in Java and makes use of Android's APIs UI Automator and UiAutomation. The tool automatically explores a mobile application in order to automatically identify and test UI Patterns. Each UI Pattern has a test strategy, Test Patterns, associated, which is applied when an UI Pattern is found. The approach works on top of a catalogue of UI Patterns, which determines which UI Patterns are to be tested, and what should their correct behaviour be, and may be used for any application.
