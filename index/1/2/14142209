This paper describes a robot in the form of a self-folding sheet that is capable of origami-style autonomous folding. We describe the hardware device we designed and fabricated. The device is a sheet with a box-pleated pattern and an integrated electronic substrate and actuators. The sheet is programmed and controlled to achieve different shapes using an idea called sticker programming. We describe the sticker controller and its instantiation. We also describe the algorithms for programming and controlling a given sheet to self-fold into a desired shape. Finally we present experiments with a 4×4 hardware device and an 8×8 hardware device.
