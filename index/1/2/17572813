A new LSI artwork analysis and processing system, called EMAP, is described with algorithms, a database schema and applications. EMAP provides the designer with the artwork verification and processing tools which include mask artwork processing, geometrical design rule checking, connectivity analysis and electrical circuit parameter calculation. The circuit connectivity data derived from the mask artwork data is used for input to a logic simulator, a timing simulator, a circuit simulator and a circuit schematic generator.
