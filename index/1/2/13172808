We have constructed a system that uses an array of 9,600 spiking silicon neurons, a fast microcontroller, and digital memory, to implement a reconfigurable network of integrate-and-fire neurons. The system is designed for rapid prototyping of spiking neural networks that require high-throughput communication with external address-event hardware. Arbitrary network topologies can be implemented by selectively routing address-events to specific internal or external targets according to a memory-based projective field mapping. The utility and versatility of the system is demonstrated by configuring it as a three-stage network that accepts input from an address-event imager, detects salient regions of the image, and performs spatial acuity modulation around a high-resolution fovea that is centered on the location of highest salience.
