This paper discusses the recent innovation of the use of large quantities of addressable (but not executable) fast random access memory in order to heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system. The general design of the hardware arrangement and the software components and functions of such a system are based on Brookhaven's future configuration of dual CDC 6600's sharing one million words of Extended Core Storage. In the generalization of such a design, special emphasis is placed on estimating expected gains compared to the traditional configuration of separate and independent computers without ECS. An observation is made on the use of conventional slower speed random access storage devices in place of the faster memory.
