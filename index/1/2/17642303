The Present Manchester Dataflow Machine is constructed using standard TTL technology and is not designed with raw processing power in mind. This paper discusses the issues raised in the redesign of the machine using supercomputer technology. The resulting machine structure is presented in some detail, together with the initial results of simulation which indicate that a performance of hundreds of megaflops appears readily achievable.
