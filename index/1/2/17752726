Temporal dependencies between multiple sensor data sources link two types of events if the occurrence of one is repeatedly followed by the appearance of the other in a certain time interval. TEDDY algorithm aims at discovering such dependencies, identifying the statically significant time intervals with a chi2 test. We present how these dependencies can be used within the GrizzLY project to tackle an environmental and technical issue: the deicing of the roads. This project aims to wisely organize the deicing operations of an urban area, based on several sensor network measures of local atmospheric phenomena. A spatial and temporal dependency-based model is built from these data to predict freezing alerts.
