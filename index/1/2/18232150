We develop a data structure for answering link distance queries between two arbitrary points in a simple polygon. The data structure requires <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt>) time and space for its construction and answers link distance queries in <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>) time. Our result extends to link distance queries between pairs of segments or polygons. We also propose a simpler data structure for computing a link distance approximately, where the error is bounded by a small additive constant. Finally, we also present a scheme for approximating the link and the shortest path distance simultaneously.
