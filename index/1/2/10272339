Two experiments on learning recursion and iteration were carried out. The first studied learning of the mathematical concept of recursion by having subjects compute mathematical functions by analogy to worked out examples. The results suggest that subjects are quite able to induce a computational procedure for both iterative and recursive functions from examples. Furthermore, prior practice with iterative examples does not seem to facilitate subsequent performance on similar recursive problems, nor does prior practice with recursive examples facilitate performance on iterative problems. The second experiment studied novice subjects' comprehension of iterative and recursive Pascal programs. Comprehension of the iterative program was not improved by prior exposure to the recursive version of the program. Comprehension of the recursive version was improved moderately by prior work with the iterative version.
