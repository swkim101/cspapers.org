In this paper, we propose a car positioning approach that does not rely on GPS. We propose to use car wheel speeds and road maps in order to achieve robust positioning of the vehicle. The vehicle positioning is achieved by applying particle filtering on a graph-based representation of a road map. We show that the vehicle positioning is feasible and robust with these two inputs at a really low computational cost. We achieve car positioning with an averaged 5 m accuracy within a 100 km drivable road map on a 12 km sequence.
