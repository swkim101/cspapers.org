The content of programs in computer science is an issue of substantial concern to both academicians and practitioners. Studies have been conducted to determine what background graduates should have and which sets of courses and training experiences should be pursued. Emphasis has been on ensuring that students acquire the necessary skills to be successful in a computer science positions [1,2,7]. In virtually all studies, the focus has been exclusively on topics within the areas of computer architecture, data structures, software systems, and processing methodology.
 In the discussion that follows, the need for another dimension in computer science programs, namely the behavioral and interpersonal dynamics dimension, is explored. Analysis of the importance of behavioral considerations in computer science is presented. Suggestions are also included for dealing with this aspect of training within current educational programs. The intent of this article is to raise issues for discussion and study within individual institutions and departments.
