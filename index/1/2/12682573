Introductory curricula, courses, and programming assignments seem to get most of the attention at Computer Science education conferences. This bird-of-a-feather focuses, instead, on upper-level systems courses (databases, networks, compilers, operating systems, etc.) and, more specifically, on courses with a significant hands-on implementation component, from small-scale programming assignments like implementing a memory allocator or a network protocol, to larger projects like implementing an operating system or compiler from scratch. Designing assignments and projects for these kinds of courses can be challenging: they must be "practical" in the sense of providing a realistic systems programming experience, but also "practical" in the sense of being small and self-contained enough to be feasible in a single quarter/semester. While there are a number of established frameworks (such as Minix, Pintos, or xv6 for operating systems) there is not, to the best of our knowledge, a dedicated forum for educators focused on these types of courses. Such a forum would allow us to more easily share existing coursework, collaboratively develop and refine coursework, and to have seasoned instructors provide support to those just starting out. This birds-of-a-feather is a first step in that direction. It will provide an opportunity for instructors of upper-level systems courses to get to know each other as well as exchange ideas and experiences. Discussion will revolve primarily around programming assignments and projects, but will also look to foster networking and communication beyond the birds-of-a-feather session.
