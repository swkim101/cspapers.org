In this paper, we introduce OctaRing, an octagon-shaped finger ring device that facilitates pressure-sensitive multi- touch gestures. To explore the feasibility of its prototype, we conducted an experiment and investigated users' sensorimotor skills in exerting different levels of pressure on the ring with more than one finger. The results of the experiment indicate that users are comfortable with the two-finger touch configuration with two levels of pressure. Based on this result, future work will explore novel gestures involving a finger ring device.
