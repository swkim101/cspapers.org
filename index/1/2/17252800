We consider subset feedback edge and vertex set problems in undirected graphs. The input to these problems is an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a set S = {s1, S2, . . ., sk} ⊂ V of k terminals. A cycle in G is interesting if it contains a terminal. In the Subset Feedback Edge Set problem (S ubset -FES) the input graph is edge-weighted and the goal is to remove a minimum weight set of edges such that no interesting cycle remains. In the Subset Feedback Vertex Set problem (S ubset -FVS) the input graph is node-weighted and the goal is to remove a minimum weight set of nodes such that no interesting cycle remains. A 2-approximation is known for S ubset -FES [12] and a 8-approximation is known for S ubset -FVS [13]. The algorithm and analysis for S ubset -FVS is complicated. One reason for the difficulty in addressing feedback set problems in undirected graphs has been the lack of LP relaxations with constant factor integrality gaps; the natural LP has an integrality gap of Θ(log n). In this paper, we introduce new LP relaxations for S ubset -FES and S ubset -FVS and show that their integrality gap is at most 13. Our LP formulation and rounding are simple although the analysis is non-obvious.
