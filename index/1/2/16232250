We present a new unsupervised mechanism, which ranks word n-grams according to their multiwordness. It heavily relies on a new uniqueness measure that computes, based on a distributional thesaurus, how often an n-gram could be replaced in context by a single-worded term. In addition with a downweighting mechanism for incomplete terms this forms a new measure called DRUID. Results show large improvements on two small test sets over competitive baselines. We demonstrate the scalability of the method to large corpora, and the independence of the measure of shallow syntactic filtering.
