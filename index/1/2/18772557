A team at Sun Microsystems East Coast Division has been engaged in developing and supporting a PC implementation of Sun's Network File System (NFS#8482;) protocols. In the course of this work we were faced with the problem of implementing Internet protocol software within the PC environment. Our experiences revealed that there are some unique obstacles to be overcome in this kind of system, and indicate that further work is needed in the development of protocols to manage networks of low-end machines.
