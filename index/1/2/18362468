Designing efficient interconnection networks with powerful connecting capability remains a key issue to parallel and distributed computing systems. Many progresses have been made in <italic>nonblocking broadcast networks</italic> which can realize all one-to-many connections between any network input port and a set of output ports without any disturbance (that is, <italic>rearrangement</italic>) of other existing connections. However, all results obtained so far for broadcast networks are for the <italic>circuit switching</italic> or <italic>single rate</italic> communication model. Meanwhile, there have been growing interests in large networks operated in a <italic>packet switching</italic> manner. This type of network can be modeled as a <italic>multirate network</italic> wherein a  single link can be shared by multiple connections with arbitrary data rate. Previous work has been done on the blocking behavior of multirate one-to-one connection or permutation networks. However, yet very little is known about the behavior of multirate <italic>one-to-many</italic> connection or broadcast networks. In this paper, we will determine nonblocking conditions for v(m,n<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>,r<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>,n<subscrpt>2</subscrpt>,r<subscrpt>2</subscrpt>) networks under which any multirate broadcast connection request from a network input port to a set of network output ports can be satisfied without any disturbance of the existing connection in the network. Our results show that more general multirate broadcast networks can be constructed in the same order of hardware  complexity as the best available single rate nonblocking broadcast networks. Our proofs for the theorems also imply an efficient routing algorithm for such networks. Multirate broadcast networks can provide strong support for parallel and distributed computing systems which require to broadcast multirate data in a random-access environment.
