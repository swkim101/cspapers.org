This paper deals with the problem of harmonizing melodies based on a multimodal reasoning approach where general knowledge about harmonization, represented by rules, supports concrete knowledge represented by cases. Rules are applied when the cases cannot provide a solution. The combination of these two reasoning methods has proven to be useful and in general can be useful in domains where it is difficult to find enough cases and is not suitable to work only with general rules.
