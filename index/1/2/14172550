The reduced access conditions present in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) affect the feel of interaction forces between the instruments and the tissue being treated. This loss of haptic information compromises the safety of the procedure and must be overcome through training. Determining the skill level of trainees is critical for ensuring patient safety. The objective of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of force information for skills assessment during MIS. Experiments were performed using a set of sensorized instruments capable of measuring instrument position and tissue interaction forces. The results show that experience level has a strong correlation with force-based metrics. The proposed metrics can be automatically computed, are completely objective, and measure important aspects of performance.
