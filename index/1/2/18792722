This paper describes a stability and graspability analysis in grasping task, taking fingertip dynamics into consideration. First, a soft-fingered grasping task is modeled and formulated. A stability analysis is presented using formulated equations. We also show that grasping force converges to a constant value that is independent of fingertip dynamics. Using a soft-fingered hand mechanism that we built, we confirm that grasping force can easily be regulated by controlling saturated P. Second, through simulation, we verify the effect of fingertip dynamics on sampling time. We investigate the dependency of fingertip dynamics and sampling time on graspability. In addition, we build a variable dynamics fingertip (VDF) to confirm the simulation results.
