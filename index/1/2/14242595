We study graph properties which are testable for bounded degree graphs in time independent of the input size. Our goal is to distinguish between graphs having a predetermined graph property and graphs that are far from every graph having that property. It is believed that almost all, even very simple graph properties require a large complexity to be tested for arbitrary (bounded degree) graphs. Therefore in this paper we focus our attention on testing graph properties for special classes of graphs. We call a graph family non-expanding if every graph in this family is not a weak expander (its expansion is O(1/log2 n), where n is the graph size). A graph family is hereditary if it is closed under vertex removal. Similarly, a graph property is hereditary if it is closed under vertex removal. Next, we call a graph property Π to be testable for a graph family F if for every graph G ε F, in time independent of the size of G we can distinguish between the case when G satisfies property Π and when it is far from every graph satisfying property Π. In this paper we prove that
 In the bounded degree graph model, any hereditary property is testable if the input graph belongs to a hereditary and non-expanding family of graphs.
 As an application, our result implies that, for example, any hereditary property (e.g., k-colorability, H-freeness, etc.) is testable in the bounded degree graph model for planar graphs, graphs with bounded genus, interval graphs, etc. No such results have been known before and prior to our work, in the bounded degree graph model very few graph properties have been known to be testable for any graph classes.
