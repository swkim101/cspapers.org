Writing is a vital issue for education as well as a fundamental skill in teaching and learning. With the development of information technologies, more and more professional writing tools emerge. As each of them mostly concentrates on addressing a specific issue, people need a one-stop platform, which could integrate multiply functions. In addition, with the supported concept of e-learning ecosystem for future education, a comprehensive platform will be more promising. Therefore, we introduce VeriGuide Platform, which provides a professional writing toolbox to promote the enhancement of teaching and learning in writing. It contains six vertical components, which could be split into two groups. The first group, Editing Assistance, facilitates students write papers and point out grammar and spelling errors. While the second group, Text Analysis, offers document analysis results, which enables students to achieve further writing improvement with explanatory feedbacks. Furthermore, we could do education data analytics to enhance the efficiency of teaching and learning. Specifically, the Editing Assistance contains well-organized writing and formatting, and grammar and spelling checking, while readability assessment, similarity detection, citation analysis, and sentiment analysis are included in the Text Analysis.
