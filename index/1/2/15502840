Online pose estimation and mapping in unknown environments is essential for most mobile robots. Especially autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles require good pose estimates at comparably high frequencies. In this paper, we propose an effective system for online pose and simultaneous map estimation designed for light-weight UAVs. Our system consists of two components: (1) real-time pose estimation combining RTK-GPS and IMU at 100 Hz and (2) an effective SLAM solution running at 10 Hz using image data from an omnidirectional multi-fisheye-camera system. The SLAM procedure combines spatial resection computed based on the map that is incrementally refined through bundle adjustment and combines the image data with raw GPS observations and IMU data on keyframes. The overall system yields a real-time, georeferenced pose at 100 Hz in GPS-friendly situations. Additionally, we obtain a precise pose and feature map at 10 Hz even in cases where the GPS is not observable or underconstrained. Our system has been implemented and thoroughly tested on a 5 kg copter and yields accurate and reliable pose estimation at high frequencies. We compare the point cloud obtained by our method with a model generated from georeferenced terrestrial laser scanner.
