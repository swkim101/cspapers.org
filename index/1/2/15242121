Object-Oriented programming is a powerful means of developing large complex systems. In this paper we address the need to understand the behavior of objects in order to facilitate code sharing and reusability. We describe GraphTrace, a tool we have developed that has allowed us to experiment with new ways of visualizing the dynamic behavior of object-oriented programs. Based on our experience with the GraphTrace tool we suggest that being able to present many different views of an object-oriented system and then animating these views concurrently represents a powerful means for understanding such systems.
