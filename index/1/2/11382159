The Tri-Wheel is a novel wheel-leg locomotion concept inspired by work with first responders. Through its two modes of operation-Driving Mode and Tumbling Mode- this mechanism is able to both drive quickly on smooth surfaces at roughly 1.7 times desired speed and climb objects as tall as 67% of the diameter of the mechanism. The unique gearing configuration that facilitates these dual capabilities is described, and testing quantifies that this nonprecision gearing system is roughly 81% efficient in a worst-case scenario of loading. This work introduces the Tri-Wheel concept and provides preliminary testing to validate its predicted operating characteristics.
