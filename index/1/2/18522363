Computer games are widely used in programming assignments to motivate students. Traditionally, these have been text-based games such as hangman, but as Java has become widespread, the use of graphics and graphical games has increased correspondingly. We report on a framework used as scaffolding to help students understand how to design and implement a variety of interactive games. We share our experiences using this framework for assignments over a number of years.
