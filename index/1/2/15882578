Alternative approaches to the interconnection problem on multilayer boards are studied and evaluated with respect to their desirability and feasability. A brief review of the current methodology is included to highlight those aspects of the current approach that might be improved upon. The conclusion is that a more integrated approach to interconnection on multilayer boards is essential to deriving the maximum benefit from the additional degrees of freedom afforded by a multilayer board. Various such integrated approaches are proposed.
