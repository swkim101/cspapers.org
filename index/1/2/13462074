In this paper we first try to characterize one meaning of automatic programming. We consider it to be one part of the Programming environment related to Artificial Intelligence techniques. We then illustrate an automatic programning process, on a simple example, using an Abstract Data Type theory to which we add the not ion of schemes which are particularly useful in program derivation from Abstract Type decomposition. We conclude that all the concepts treated in this paper must be contained in one way or another in any automatic programming system. However this necessitates further study in such theoretical fields as Abstract Data Type Theory, Specification languages, Theorem provers or proof cheekers and rule rewriting systems.
