We prove an exponential lower bound for the majority function on constant depth monotone circuits, solving an open problem of A. Yao's.. In particular, we prove that computing majority on depth <italic>d</italic> monotone circuits requires expÎ©(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>1/(d-1)</supscrpt>) size. Using this result we also get exponential lower bounds for other problems, such as connectivity and cliques.
