This paper discusses an integration issue of multi-level postural balancing on humanoid robot. We give a unified viewpoint of postural balancing, which covers Ankle Strategy to Hip Strategy. Two kinds of distributor of desired ground reaction force to whole-body joint torque are presented. The one distributor leads to a dynamic balancer which covers Hip strategy, with the under-actuated situation. A simple angular momentum regulator is also proposed to stabilize the internal motions due to the joint redundancy. The other distributor leads to a static balancer which lies between Ankle and Hip strategy. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that replacement of the center of mass feedback with the local joint stiffness makes the robot much stabler for some fast motions. Motivated by the practicability of the static balancer and the strong push-recovery performance of the dynamic balancer, this paper presents a simple integration by superposition of the both balancers on a compliant human-sized biped robot. The simulation and experimental videos are supplemented.
