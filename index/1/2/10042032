On social network sites, spammers often disguise themselves by creating fake accounts and hijacking normal users' accounts for personal gains. Different from the spammers in traditional systems such as SMS and email, spammers in social media behave like normal users and they continue to change their spamming strategies to fool anti spamming systems. However, due to the privacy and resource concerns, many social media websites cannot fully monitor all the contents of users, making many of the previous approaches, such as topology-based and content-classification-based methods, infeasible to use. In this paper, we propose a novel method for spammer detection in social networks that exploits both social activities as well as users' social relations in an innovative and highly scalable manner. The proposed method detects spammers following collective activities based on users' social actions and relations. We have empirically tested our method on data from Renren.com, which is the largest social network in China, and demonstrated that our new method can improve the detection performance significantly.
