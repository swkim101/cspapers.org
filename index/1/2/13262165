The BASIC Instructional Program (BIP) was developed to investigate tutorial modes of interaction in computer-assisted instruction (CAI). BIP is a problem-solving laboratory that helps students while they are solving introductory programming problems in the BASIC language. The problems are presented in an individualized sequence based on a representation of the structure of the curriculum and a model of the student's state of knowledge. This paper describes the BIP system, with emphasis on recently developed features. The goal of the tutorial laboratory is informative interaction with the student, which is provided by an instructional BASIC interpreter, information on BASIC syntax cross-referenced with the BIP student manual, and debugging aids. The system also has access through the curriculum representation to features that the student may use to help her solve her current problem. These features include hints, easier “subtasks,” a stored solution that can itself be executed, and an interactive flow chart representation of the solution. The nature of the student-BIP interaction is captured in an annotated student dialogue of a typical session.
