In this paper we construct two new fuzzy identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes in the random oracle model. Not only do our schemes provide public parameters whose size is independent of the number of attributes in each identity (used as public key) but they also have useful structures which result in more efficient key extraction and/or encryption than the random oracle version of Sahai and Water's fuzzy IBE scheme, considered recently by Pirretti et al. We prove that the confidentiality of the proposed schemes is relative to the Bilinear Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem.
