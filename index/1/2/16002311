The Ode object-oriented database provides facilities for associating conslraims and [riggers with ohjecls. Conslrainls and triggers are associated with class (ohjea type) definitions which makes hem easy 10 read, LO implerncnl, and IO blend with object inheritance. In this paper, we stale our declgn goals in providing trigger and conslraint facilities for an object-oriented dalahase. describe Ihe conslraim and trigger facilities in Ode, their implementation, and illuslrale their use. Although triggers and constraints can be implemented by similar mechanisms, we poinl OUI Ihe significant conceptual differences. We also discuss related issues such as inlraobject versus inter-object constraints and Lriggers. coupling modes, order and environment of invocalion.
