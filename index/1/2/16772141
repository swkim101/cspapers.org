Modular hybrid timed Petri Nets are used to model and analyze behavior of random topology multi-operational production systems. Each such system is decomposed into 3 fundamental modules, followed by derivation of their corresponding modular HPN models. The overall system model is obtained via synthesis of the individual modules, satisfying system constraints (routes, production rates, machine expected up- down- or idle- time and priorities). For any topology multi-operational production system, overall HTPN model nodes are calculated, followed by derivation of model invariants. Results show applicability of the proposed methodology and justify its modeling power and generality.
