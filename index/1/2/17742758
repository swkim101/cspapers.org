An interface for software that creates a natural environment for engineering graphics students to improve their spatial reasoning and 3D visualization skills is described. The skills of interest involve spatial transformations and rotations, specifically those skills that engineers use to reason about 3D objects based on 2D representations. The software uses an intuitive and interactive interface allowing direct manipulation of objects. Animation capability is provided to demonstrate the relationship between arbitrary positions of an object and standard orthographic views. A second skill of interest requires visualization of a cutting-plane intersection of an object. An interface is developed which allows intuitive positioning of the cutting-plane utilizing the metaphor of a “pool of water” in which the object is partially submerged. The surface of the water represents the cutting plane. Adjustment of the pool depth combined with direct manipulation of the object provides for arbitrary positioning of the cutting-plane. Subjective evaluation of the software thus far indicates that students enjoy using it and find it helpful. A formal testing plan to objectively evaluate the software and interface design is underway.
