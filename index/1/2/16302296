This paper concerns the stage of acoustic analysis in speech recognition of Speech Understanding System SUSY; subsystem AKORD, Acoustic analysis in this system is based on dynamic spectral analysis of the speech wave. It corresponds with the function of the hearing organ expressed by an analog nodel of human ear. Acoustic analysis in the AKORD system uses an FFT algorithm but is not strictly based on accepting consta­ nt intervals of 10-20 ms; analysis does not cause inaccuracy at the level of para-met rizat ion because of a considerable dis­ persion of parameters of particular seg­ ments. A conclusion was made in the AKORD system that a properly conducted process of segmentation will help in solving some problems of speech wave analysis, particu­ larly recognition and time compression. This paper attempts to choose the primary segment (microphonem) in the most optimum way and to Indicate the algorithm of auto­ matic segmentation based on microphonemes as the dynamic segments.
