This paper describes an effective implementation of a rectangle probe interconnection routing algorithm. The router successfully handles multilayer boards with foil conducting paths of various widths. Connections defined by the router may utilize one or more conducting layers. Objectives to be achieved by the router are discussed, and implementation features related to these requirements are presented; data and control structures are briefly described. Routing performance and experiments indicating sensitivity to variations in algorithm or problem definition are presented. The subject router is in production use as part of the DASLL [1] design automation system at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
