In this paper, we present a deductive object-oriented knowledge base system, called R-DEVICE, which imports RDF data into the CLIPS production rule system as objects and uses a deductive rule language for querying and reasoning about them. In our model properties of resources are not scattered across several triples as in most other RDF storage and querying systems, resulting in increased query per-formance due to less joins. R-DEVICE features a powerful deductive rule language which is able to express arbitrary queries both on the RDF schema and data, including generalized path expressions, strati-fied negation, aggregate, grouping, and sorting, functions, mainly due to the second-order syntax of the rule language which is efficiently translated into sets of first-order logic rules using metadata.
