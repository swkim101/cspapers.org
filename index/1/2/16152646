This paper describes the development and experimental results of a silkworm handling robot. Silkworm handling robot was developed for the purpose of automated breeding of silkworm larvae. The silkworm larvae are soft and amorphous. Therefore, gripping them is extremely difficult, and requires a specialized handling system. The authors succeeded in handling of a silkworm larva.
