Bloom filters are frequently used to perform set queries that test the existence of some items. However, Bloom filters face a dilemma: the transmission bandwidth and the accuracy cannot be optimized simultaneously. This dilemma is particularly severe for transmitting Bloom filters to remote nodes when the network bandwidth is limited. We propose a novel Bloom filter BloomTree that consists of a tree-structured organization of smaller Bloom filters, each one using a set of independent hash functions. BloomTree spreads items across levels that are compressed to reduce the transmission bandwidth need. We investigate in detail under which conditions BloomTree performs better than the compressed Bloom filter and the standard Bloom filter.
