The thesis of this paper is that perception requires reasoning mechanisms beyond those typically employed in deductive systems. We briefly present some arguments to support this contention, and then offer a framework for a system capable of perceptual reasoning, using sensor-derived information, to survive in a hostile environment. Some of these ideas have been incorporated in a computer program and tested in a simulated environment; a summary of this work and current results are included.
