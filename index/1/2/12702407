Speech is becoming a more important user interface with the advent of multimedia capable video game systems, personal computers and workstations. Speech can be synthetically generated or natural speech can be digitized for storage and replay. Several studies have shown that synthetic speech is not understood as well as natural speech [2]. Synthetic speech lacks prosodic (timing) and acoustical cues to phonetic segments in comparison to natural speech. Luce et. al. [2] attributed the difficulty with synthetic speech to increased processing time requirements to encode the degraded sound. Waterworth and Thomas [3] replicated Luce et. al. serial position effect experiment and reported additional support for the encoding hypothesis by having subjects repeat words. When they adjusted for correct word encoding, the synthetic speech was similar to natural speech.
