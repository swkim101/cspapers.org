We describe a simple and efficient algorithm to disambiguate non-functional weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs), i.e. to generate a new WFST that contains a unique, best-scoring path for each hypothesis in the input labels along with the best output labels. The algorithm uses topological features combined with a tropical sparse tuple vector semiring. We empirically show that our algorithm is more efficient than previous work in a PoStagging disambiguation task. We use our method to rescore very large translation lattices with a bilingual neural network language model, obtaining gains in line with the literature.
