Modeling interactions between two sentences is crucial for a number of natu-ral language processing tasks including Answer Selection, Dialogue Act Analysis, etc. While deep learning methods like Recurrent Neural Network or Convolutional Neural Network have been proved to be powerful for sentence modeling, prior studies paid less attention on interactions between sentences. In this work, we propose a Sentence Interaction Network (SIN) for modeling the complex interactions between two sentences. By introducing “interaction states” for word and phrase pairs, SIN is powerful and ﬂexi-ble in capturing sentence interactions for different tasks. We obtain signiﬁcant improvements on Answer Selection and Dialogue Act Analysis without any feature engineering.
