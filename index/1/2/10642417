We use X2 to investigate the context dependency of student affect in our computer tutoring dialogues, targeting uncertainty in student answers in 3 automatically monitorable contexts. Our results show significant dependencies between uncertain answers and specific contexts. Identification and analysis of these dependencies is our first step in developing an adaptive version of our dialogue system.
