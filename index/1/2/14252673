In this paper we address a robot motion control scheme for a human-robot cooperative task. From the viewpoint of improving the operative efficiency of the cooperative task, we designed a novel robot control system, in which inherent dynamics of the target task and the object is conserved. The proposed control scheme differs widely from an ordinary impedance control scheme in that the inherent dynamics of the target task and the object is substituted by impedance characteristics. Under the proposed control scheme, the dynamics of the target task and that of the robot motion are uncoupled and independent. The proposed control system enables the human operator to carry out the cooperative task intuitively by only considering the inherent dynamics of the target task and the object. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control system, an experiment base on a peg insertion task involving human-robot cooperation is carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed control scheme is effective for cooperative tasks requiring precision.
