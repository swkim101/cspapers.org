Recently, manipulation and observation of the cells are actively conducted in order to analyze the biological phenomena. Since the micro hand is usually fixed to the work environment, grasping target point of the cell on the opposite side of the micro hand by using a micro hand is limited by narrow workspace. If we move the micro hand in vertical direction to grasp the target point of the cell on the opposite side of the micro hand, we cannot focus the micro hand and the object in the microscopic field of view at the same time. In order to overcome the limitations of the limited workspace of micro hand, we assist the target point of the cell grasped by translation and rotation of the automatic stage. In this paper, we propose an automatic stage system for support the operation of the micro hand. Our automatic stage system can detect the object in the microscopic field of view by the template matching using Hu moment invariant and determine the grasping convex part of the object. by convex hull. Additionally this system can do 2d path planning considering convex part of the object to want to grasp and obstacles, and lead the micro hand to the object.
