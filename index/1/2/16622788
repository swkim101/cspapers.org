Creating and debugging knowledge-based systems, such as expert systems, requires easy access to rules and facts in a vast, loosely-connected system. Three graphic representations were devised for a system development tool that integrates forward chaining, backward chaining, and full truth maintenance. In one representation, possible interactions among rules, determined by syntactically parsing the rules, are displayed as a directed graph. In a second representation, actual interactions among facts and rules are displayed dynamically. The third representation is a fish-eye view of the knowledge base that explains why a fact was asserted. In addition, the text of rules and facts is displayed in editing windows.
