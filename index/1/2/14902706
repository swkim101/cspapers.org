We present a new formulation for autonomous (i.e. time-independent) Dynamical Systems (DS) to perform discrete robot motions with em non-zero velocity at a given target. The proposed model ensures the convergence of all trajectories to the target, and is inherently robust to perturbations. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method to control right-handed swings in mini-golf.
