This paper describes a special type of drone called "Flying User Interface", comprised of a robotic projector-camera system, an onboard digital computer connected with the Internet, sensors, and a hardware interface capable of sticking to any surface such as wall, ceilings, etc. Computer further consists of other subsystems, devices, and sensors such as accelerometer, compass, gyroscope, flashlight, etc. Drone flies from one place to another, detects a surface, and attaches itself to it. After a successful attachment, the device stops all its rotators; it then projects or augments images, information, and user interfaces on nearby surfaces and walls. User interface may contain applications, information about object being augmented and information from Internet. User can interact with user-interface using commands and gestures such as hand, body, feet, voice, etc.
