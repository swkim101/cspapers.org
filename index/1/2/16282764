HANDEXOS is an exoskeleton device for supporting the human hand and performing teleoperation activities. It could be used to operate both in remote-manipulation mode and directly in microgravity environments. In manipulation mode, crew or operators within the space ship could tele-control the endeffector of a robot in the space during the execution of extravehicular activities (EVA) by means of an advanced upper limb exoskeleton. The choice of an appropriate man-machine interface (MMI) is important to allow a correct and dexterous grasp of objects of regular and irregular shapes in the space. Many different technologies have been proposed, from conventional joysticks to exoskeletons, but the arising number of more and more dexterous space manipulators such as Robonaut [1] or Eurobot [2] leads researchers to design novel MMIs with the aim to be more capable to exploit all functional advantages offered by new space robots. From this point of view exoskeletons better suite for execution of remote control-task than conventional joysticks, facilitating commanding of three dimensional trajectories and saving time in crew’s operation and training [3]. Moreover, it’s important to point out that in microgravity environments the astronauts spend most time doing motor exercises, so HANDEXOS can be useful in supporting such motor practice, assisting human operators in overcoming physical limitations deriving from the fatigue in performing EVA. It is the goal of this paper to provide a detailed description of HANDEXOS mechanical design and to present the results of the preliminary simulations derived from the implementation of the exoskeleton/human finger dynamic model for different actuation solutions.
