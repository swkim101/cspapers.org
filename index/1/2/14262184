Passive stereo vision is widely used as a range sensing technology in robots, but suffers from dropouts: areas of low texture where stereo matching fails. By supplementing a stereo system with a strong texture projector, dropouts can be eliminated or reduced. This paper develops a practical stereo projector system, first by finding good patterns to project in the ideal case, then by analyzing the effects of system blur and phase noise on these patterns, and finally by designing a compact projector that is capable of good performance out to 3m in indoor scenes. The system has been implemented and has excellent depth precision and resolution, especially in the range out to 1.5m.
