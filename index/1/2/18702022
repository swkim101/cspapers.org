This paper describes an implementation of a real-time, packetized voice communication system over a personal computer (PC) based token-passing ring local area network. System configuration and operation are presented. The system implements real-time, conversational transmission of voice packets between two stations on the network. An analysis is shown to calculate the maximum number of two way conversations that can be handled by the system without any reconstitution delay.
