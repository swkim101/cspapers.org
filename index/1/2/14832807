In this paper, a potential-field-based real-time path planning algorithm for a multi-segment continuum manipulator is proposed. This planner is employed to enable a continuum-style manipulator to move autonomously in dynamic environments in real-time. The classic potential field method is modified to make it applicable for a kinematics model based on the constant-curvature assumption. The contribution of this paper lies in the design of a novel potential field in the actuator space satisfying the mechanical constraints of the manipulator. The planning algorithm is tested and validated in real-time simulation for a 3 segments continuum manipulator. Preliminary tests for a tendon-driven single-segment continuum manipulator prototype confirm the performance of the proposed planner.
