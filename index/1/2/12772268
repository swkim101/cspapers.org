According to the biplanar imaging principle, this paper proposes a novel fluoroscopy-guided robot navigating system for distal locking of intramedullary nails which only needs two X-ray projection images from lateral and AP views of the nail respectively. Error distributions are analyzed based on the mathematical model and the structural model. The system performance is also tested and evaluated through preliminary experiments with plastic bones and cadaver limbs. It is shown that this system has enough positioning accuracy and stability with a compact robot structure, and it can dramatically decrease the operating time. The modular design makes it applicable for most kinds of intramedullary nails existed nowadays.
