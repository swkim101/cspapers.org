The method of discrete optimal control is applied to control thrashing in a virtual memory. Certain difficulties with several previous approaches are discussed. The mechanism of optimal control is presented as an effective, inexpensive alternative. A simple, ideal policy is devised to illustrate the method. A new feedback parameter, the thrashing level, is found to be a positive and robust indicator of thrashing. When applied to a real system, the idealized policy effectively controlled the virtual memory.
