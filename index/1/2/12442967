Recently, techniques for supporting efficient similarity search over huge transaction datasets have emerged as an important research area. Several indexing schemes have been proposed towards this direction. Typically, these schemes provide a tradeoff between searching efficiency and indexing overhead in terms of space.
 In this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme for similarity search on transaction data. Based on well-studied clustering techniques, we develop a construction algorithm for the proposed index and a branch-and-bound searching strategy for answering similarity search. Unlike previous techniques, our indexing scheme exhibits high search efficiency and low space requirements by trading-off the pre-computation time. This behavior is ideal for applications with low update but high read volume <i>e.g.</i>, data warehousing, collaborative filtering, <i>etc.</i>). Moreover, our experimental results illustrate that our method is robust to the varying characteristics of the datasets.
