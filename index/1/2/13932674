This paper discusses an algorithmic procedure for the detection of static and dynamic hazards in a digital simulation environment. The procedure uses a signal representation scheme that decomposes multilevel signals to a binary form which are used along with a binary description of the network to realize hazard detection. Moreover this procedure can also be used to realize multi level simulation and provides the user with various options about the accuracy that can be obtained at varying costs
