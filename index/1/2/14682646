This work combines hardware, software, and curricula in order to create robots capable enough to advance the field of Al yet inexpensive enough to be widely accessible. Costs are kept low by pairing iRobot's roombas with existing laptop or palmtop computers and their accessories. The result is a sub-$200 untethered physical platform capable of running and testing state-of-the-art AI algorithms.
