This paper proposes a robot balanced on a ball. In contrast to an inverted pendulum with two wheels, such as the Segway Human Transporter, an inverted pendulum using a ball can traverse in any direction without changing its orientation, thereby enabling stable motion. Such robots can be used in place of the two-wheeled robots. The robot proposed in this paper is equipped with three omnidirectional wheels with stepping motors that drive the ball and two sets of rate gyroscopes and accelerometers as attitude sensors. The robot has a simple design; it is controlled with a 16-bit microcontroller and runs on Ni-MH batteries. It can not only stand still but also traverse on floor and pivot around its vertical axis. Inverted pendulum control is applied in two axes for attitude control, and commanded motions are converted into velocity commands for the three wheels. The mechanism, control method, and experimental results including application to transport are described in this paper.
