Manual timelines have greatly helped us to keep pace with the big world. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution which generates image-text timelines for news events based on Evolutionary Image-Text Summarization, which is an important and challenging problem. We first extract image's semantic information under translation model, and then fuse the high quality images with text timeline under an image assignment algorithm which can optimize the global coordination of the final timeline. The experimental results show that news readers can receive more satisfaction from the image-text timelines we generate.
