In this paper, we describe an ongoing multidisciplinary undergraduate seminar that we have developed, in which student teams build non-human systems that conduct our college orchestra. Students and faculty in the course come from four disciplines: computer science, interactive multimedia, music, and mechanical engineering. This paper describes the course structure, computer science components, final projects, team dynamics, and assessments. We evaluate the results to-date and discuss ongoing revisions and expectations for the future.
