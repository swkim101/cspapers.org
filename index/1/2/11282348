The abundance and growing usage of social media has resulted in a large repository of users' social posts, which provides a stethoscope for inferring individuals' lifestyle and wellness. As users' social accounts implicitly reflect their habits, preferences, and feelings, it is feasible for us to monitor and understand the wellness of users by harvesting social media data towards a healthier lifestyle. As a first step towards accomplishing this goal, we propose to automatically extract wellness events from users' published social contents. Existing approaches for event extraction are not applicable to personal wellness events due to its domain nature characterized by plenty of noise and variety in data, insufficient samples, and inter-relation among events.To tackle these problems, we propose an optimization learning framework that utilizes the content information of microblogging messages as well as the relations between event categories. By imposing a sparse constraint on the learning model, we also tackle the problems arising from noise and variation in microblogging texts. Experimental results on a real-world dataset from Twitter have demonstrated the superior performance of our framework.
