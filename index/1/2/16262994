Moving cast shadows are a major concern for foreground detection algorithms. Processing of foreground images in surveillance applications typically requires that such shadows have been identified and removed from the detected foreground. This paper presents a novel pixel-based statistical approach to model moving cast shadows of non-uniform and varying intensity. This approach uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) learning ability to build statistical models describing moving cast shadows on surfaces. This statistical modeling can deal with scenes with complex and time-varying illumination, and prevent false detection in regions where shadows cannot be detected. Gaussian mixture shadow models (GMSM) are automatically constructed and updated over time, are easily added to GMM architecture for foreground detection, and require only a small number of parameters. Results obtained with different scene types show the robustness of the approach.
