We describe a computing facility created, supported, maintained, and used entirely by undergraduate students. This facility exists outside of the instructional support system, so the usual constraints of reliability are relaxed, allowing relatively unrestricted installation of software and hardware. An active community has developed around this facility, providing broad technical experiences and enabling mentoring relationships.
