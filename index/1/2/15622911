CLUSTR is a computer program which assists the designer in finding the structure inherent in his design problem. The designer supplies the list of elements which define the design problem, and then decides which of these elements are related. The computer decomposes the problem into subsets in which each element is related to every other element. In theory each of these subsets represents the smallest “structural” component of the problem: a coherent functional or behavioral sub-system. The most closely related subsets are then combined into larger clusters. This process continues until all clusters have been recombined. The computer then draws a diagram to show how these subsets are combined to form the final problem structure. The computer also identifies the dominant elements at each node in the structure to assist the designer in finding the solutions to each sub-problem.
