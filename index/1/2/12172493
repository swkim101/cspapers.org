We present a two-stage multilingual dependency parsing system submitted to the Multilingual Track of CoNLL-2007. The parser first identifies dependencies using a deterministic parsing method and then labels those dependencies as a sequence labeling problem. We describe the features used in each stage. For four languages with different values of ROOT, we design some special features for the ROOT labeler. Then we present evaluation results and error analyses focusing on Chinese.
