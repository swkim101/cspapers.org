This paper introduces an empirical study to investigate the use of multimodal metaphors in e-learning application in particular within the area of note-taking. The aim of the study is to measure and compare the level of usability of these metaphors. In order to carry out this comparative investigation, two experimental interfaces were built and performed by forty users. In the first interface (textual interface), text, graphic and image were used to deliver information. The second version interface of the experimental tool (multimodal interface) offered a combination of multimodal metaphors (speech, video and avatar) to deliver the same information. The scope of this paper is to discuss the results that related to satisfaction only in terms of different aspects (ease of use, confusion, nervousness and overall satisfaction). The results obtained from this investigation have shown that the multimodal elearning interface was found to be significantly more satisfactory than the textual interface.
