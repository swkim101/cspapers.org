The growing demands of large capacity flash-based storages have facilitated the down-scaling process of NAND flash memory. Among NAND flash technologies, 3D charge trap flash is regarded as one of the most promising candidates. Owing to the cylindrical geometry of vertical channels, the access performance of each page in one block is distinctive, and this situation is exaggerated in the 3D charge trap flash with the fast-growing number of layers. In this study, a progressive performance boosting strategy is proposed to boost the performance of 3D charge trap flash by utilizing its asymmetric page access speed feature. A series of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategy on improving access performance of 3D charge trap flash.
