Since the publication of the first paper on Magic Lenses, various methods have been proposed for implementing lenses which filter the objects seen through them However, all the methods proposed stier from various flaws. In particular, none of these methods solve the problem of composing lenses in a general way. A method which solves all these problems is described here. By substituting delegation for the more conventional ci?z.ss inheritance, a simple and elegant solution emerges. We have implemented delegationbased h!iagic Lenses in the T&da Rasa zooming user interface (ZUI) system, using an object system related to CLOS.
