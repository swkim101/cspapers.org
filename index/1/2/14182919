In an IT service delivery environment, the speedy dispatch of a ticket to the correct resolution group is the crucial first step in the problem resolution process. The size and complexity of such environments make the dispatch decision challenging, and incorrect routing by a human dispatcher can lead to significant delays that degrade customer satisfaction, and also have adverse financial implications for both the customer and the IT vendor. In this paper, we present SmartDispatch, a learning-based tool that seeks to automate the process of ticket dispatch while maintaining high accuracy levels. SmartDispatch comes with two classification approaches - the well-known SVM method, and a discriminative term-based approach that we designed to address some of the issues in SVM classification that were empirically observed. Using a combination of these approaches, SmartDispatch is able to automate the dispatch of a ticket to the correct resolution group for a large share of the tickets, while for the rest, it is able to suggest a short list of 3-5 groups that contain the correct resolution group with a high probability. Empirical evaluation of SmartDispatch on data from 3 large service engagement projects in IBM demonstrate the efficacy and practical utility of the approach.
