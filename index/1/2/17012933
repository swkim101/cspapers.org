This paper presents a model based approach to autonomous dexterous manipulation, developed as part of the DARPA Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) program. The developed autonomy system uses robot, object, and environment models to identify and localize objects, and well as plan and execute required manipulation tasks. Deliberate interaction with objects and the environment increases system knowledge about the combined robot and environmental state, enabling high precision tasks such as key insertion to be performed in a consistent framework. This approach has been demonstrated across a wide range of manipulation tasks, and in independent DARPA testing archived the most successfully completed tasks with the fastest average task execution of any evaluated team.
