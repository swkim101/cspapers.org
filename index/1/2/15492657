We describe a RUntime MOnitoring and Recovery framework (RuMoR) for BPEL applications. Our tool checks for behavioral conformance with respect to a set of user-specified properties. When runtime violations are discovered, RuMoR automatically proposes and ranks recovery plans which users can then select for execution. These plans are generated using an adaptation of a SAT-based planning technique.
