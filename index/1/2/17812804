Let P be an iterative program on domain D, with state S. A close look at the structure of the loop invariant of P reveals that P has a desirable self stabilizing property: If during the computation, an error causes the state to take a contaminated value S', then, under some conditions, it is possible to recover from this contamination without knowing any previous correct state. This feature contrasts with the classical error recovery mechanisms which equate error recovery with the retrieval of a previously saved correct state, and the backtracking of the computation.
