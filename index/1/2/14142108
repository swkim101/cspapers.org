A Combinatorial Algorithm for the Determinant V Vinay + Meena Mahajan* We show the first efficient combinatorial algorithm for the computation of the determinant Hitherto, all (known) algorithms for determinant have been based on linear algebra. In contrast, our algorithm and its proof of correctness are totally combinatorial in nature. The algorithm requires no division and works on arbitrary commutative rings. It also lends itself to efficient sequential and parallel implementa-
