Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death after lung cancer among women. The value of advanced imaging platforms such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for early breast cancer detection remains unclear. The paper applies a time reversal beamforming imager [15] for detecting and locating early stage breast cancer tumours from MRI data. In our simulations based on the finite difference, time domain (FDTD) electromagnetic model, the proposed detector estimates the locations of breast cancer tumours with a higher accuracy than some of the current state of art signal processing estimation algorithms tested by us.
