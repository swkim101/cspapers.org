Online CS Ed Week and Hour of Code activities attempt to motivate hundreds of millions of student participants across the world in computer science each year. A key goal of these endeavors is long-term student engagement. However, if the activity experience is bad, it could have effects adverse to the stated goal. Thus, it is imperative upon designers to actively improve the online activity ensuring the maximum numbers of students are retained throughout the exercise. We present a simple proof of concept method outlining a means for Computer Science Education Week and Hour of Code online activities to identify and improve hazardous points wherein students tend to drop out. This is achieved by finding so called flow stoppers in activity retention that diverge from an ideal theoretical Markov chain model, and scaffolding the activity at that point to better support participants. Initial data presented indicates that even minor changes can have a significant effect on keeping a greater number of students engaged.
