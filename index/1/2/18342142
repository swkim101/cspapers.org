Writing skills need to be integrated into the Computer Science (CS) curriculum, and there is little empirical evidence on how best to do so. This paper first describes a technical writing class for CS undergraduates. Then it presents the results of a statistical study that investigated student perceptions of their learning experience in three areas: skill mastery, self-efficacy, and motivation. Positive results support this approach to teaching writing to CS students. Some unexpected findings in all three areas highlight why monitoring student perceptions is important for CS educators.
