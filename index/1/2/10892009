Recognizing that specification testing of analog circuits involves a high cost and lacks any quantitative measure of the testing process, we adopt a fault-based technique. With the help of hierarchical fault models for parametric and catastrophic faults, and a very efficient fault simulator, our simulation-assisted technique automatically determines the test frequencies to detect AC faults in linear analog circuits. By a suitable choice of parameters in the test generator, we can either determine the best test (maximize the error between the good and the faulty responses) for every fault (resulting in a large test set), or generate the smallest test set for all the faults. Finally, fault coverage values provide a quantitative evaluation of the final test set.
