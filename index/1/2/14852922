Time synchronization is a fundamental service for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This paper proposes a novel WSN time synchronization approach by exploiting the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. Our approach leverages the fact that ZigBee sensors and Wi-Fi nodes often occupy the same or overlapping radio frequency bands in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum. As a result, a ZigBee node can detect and synchronize to the periodic beacons broadcasted by Wi-Fi access points (APs). We experimentally characterize the spatial and temporal characteristics of Wi-Fi beacons in an enterprise Wi-Fi network consisting of over 50 APs deployed in a 300,000 square foot office building. Motivated by our measurement results, we design a novel synchronization protocol called WizSync. WizSync employs advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques to detect periodic Wi-Fi beacons and use them to calibrate the frequency of native clocks. WizSync can intelligently predict the clock skew and adaptively schedules nodes to sleep to conserve energy. We implement WizSync in TinyOS 2.1x and conduct extensive evaluation on a testbed consisting of 19 TelosB motes. Our results show that WizSync can achieve an average synchronization error of 0.12 milliseconds over a period of 10 days with radio power consumption of 50.9 microwatts/node.
