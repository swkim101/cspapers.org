A new location update strategy and its implementation using a genetic algorithm are proposed. Most of the practical cellular mobile systems partition a geographical region into location areas (LA) and users are made to update on entering a new LA. The main drawback of this scheme is that it does not consider the individual user mobility and call arrival patterns. Combining per-user mobility and call arrival patterns with the LAbased approach, an optimal update strategy is proposed for each user which determines whether or not to update in each LA. The update strategy minimizes the average location management cost derived from a user-specific mobility model and call generation pattern. The location management cost optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm. The results clearly demonstrate that for low user residing probability in LA’s, low call arrival rate and high update cost, skipping updation in several LA’s leads to minimization of the overall location management cost.
