We present a multi-attributed dictionary learning algorithm for sparse coding. Considering training samples with multiple attributes, a new distance matrix is proposed by jointly incorporating data and attribute similarities. Then, an objective function is presented to learn category-dependent dictionaries that are compact (closeness of dictionary atoms based on data distance and attribute similarity), reconstructive (low reconstruction error with correct dictionary) and label-consistent (encouraging the labels of dictionary atoms to be similar). We have demonstrated our algorithm on action classification and face recognition tasks on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results with improved performance over previous dictionary learning methods are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
