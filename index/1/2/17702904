The input in the Group-Steiner Problem consists of an undirected connected graph with a cost function <i>p</i>(<i>e</i>) over the edges and a collection of subsets of vertices {<i>g<inf>i</inf></i>}. Each subset <i>g<inf>i</inf></i> is called a <i>group</i> and the vertices in ∪ <i>g<inf>i</inf></i> are called <i>terminals.</i> The goal is to find a minimum cost tree that contains at least one terminal from every group.We give the first combinatorial polylogarithmic ratio approximation for the problem on trees. Let <i>m</i> denote the number of groups and <i>S</i> denote the number of terminals. The approximation ratio of our algorithm is <i>O</i>(log <i>S</i> · log <i>m</i>/log log <i>S</i>) = <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>/log log <i>n</i>). This is an improvement by a Θ(log log <i>n</i>) factor over the previously best known approximation ratio for the Group Steiner Problem on trees [GKR98].Our result carries over to the Group Steiner Problem on general graphs and to the Covering Steiner Problem. Garg <i>et al.</i> [GKR98] presented a reduction of the Group Steiner Problem on general graphs to trees. Their reduction employs Bartal's [B98] approximation of graph metrics by tree metrics. Our algorithm on trees implies an approximation algorithm of ratio <i>O</i>(log <i>S</i> · log <i>m</i> · log <i>n</i> · log log <i>n</i>/log log <i>S</i>) = <i>O</i>(log<sup>3</sup><i>n</i>) for the Group Steiner Problem on general graphs. The previously best known approximation ratio for this problem on general graphs, as a function of <i>n,</i> is <i>O</i>(log<sup>3</sup><i>n</i> · log log <i>n</i>) [GKR98]. Our algorithm in conjunction with ideas of [EKS01] gives an <i>O</i>(log <i>S</i> · log <i>m</i> · log <i>n</i> · log log <i>n</i>/log log <i>S</i>) = <i>O</i>(log<sup>3</sup><i>n</i>)-approximation ratio for the more general Covering Steiner Problem, improving the best known approximation ratio (as a function of <i>n</i>) for the Covering Steiner Problem by a Θ(log log <i>n</i>) factor.
