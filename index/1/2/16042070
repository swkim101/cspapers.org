In this work, control strategies for combining two potentially powerful buffer management techniques in object bases were devised and evaluated: (1) buffer pool segmentation with segment-specific replacement criteria, and (2) dual buffering consisting of copying objects from pages into object buffers. Two diiensions exist for exerting control on the buffer pool: (1) the copying time which determines at what time objects are copied from their memory-resident home page, and (2) the relocation time which determines when a (copied) object is to be transferred back to its home page. Along both dimensions, it is possible to differentiate between an eager and a lazy strategy. The extensive experimental results indicate that lazy object copying combined with an eager relocation strategy is almost always superior and significantly outperforms page-based buffering in most applications.
