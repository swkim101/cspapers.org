This paper examines the problems of learning queries and dissemination thresholds from relevance feedback in a dynamic information filtering environment. It revisits the EG algorithm for learning queries, identifying several problems in using it reliably for information filtering, and providing solutions. It also presents a new algorithm for learning dissemination thresholds automatically, from the same relevance feedback information used to learn queries.
