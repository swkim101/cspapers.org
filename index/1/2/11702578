The advent of advanced computer architectures for parallel and symbolic processing has evolved to the point where the technology currently exists for the development of prototype autonomous vehicles. Control of such devices will require communication between knowledge-based subsystems in charge of the vision, planning, and conflict resolution aspects necessary to make autonomous vehicles functional In a real world environment. This paper describes a heuristic route planning system capable of forming the planning foundation of an autonomous ground vehicle.
