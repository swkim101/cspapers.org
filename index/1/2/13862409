The computers in education field is making rapid progress. We can see this progress in the quality and number of data processing programs at the associates degree and data processing school levels, and in the bachelor's, master's, and doctorate programs at colleges and universities. We can also see large numbers of secondary schools beginning to acquire computing facilities. But we have a long way to go! To put our current progress in perspective we need merely ask: “What percentage of students in the United States made direct instructional use of computers during the past week, how extensive was this usage, and how effectively did it contribute to the student's education?”
