The major technical difficulty behind the observation-based causal discovery is to effectively and efficiently identify causes and effects from correlated variables given the existence of significant noises. Previous studies mostly employ two very different methodologies under Bayesian network framework, namely global likelihood maximization and locally complexity analysis over marginal distributions. While these approaches are effective in their respective problem domains, in this paper, we show that they can be combined to formulate a new global optimization model with local statistical significance, called structural equational likelihood framework (or SELF in short). We provide thorough analysis on the soundness of the model under mild conditions and present efficient heuristic-based algorithms for scalable model training. Empirical evaluations using XGBoost validate the superiority of our proposal over state-of-the-art solutions, on both synthetic and real world causal structures.
