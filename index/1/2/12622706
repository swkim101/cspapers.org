In this paper, we present an extensible visualization tool that is being used in a web-based closed laboratory system. The goal of this project is to provide a tool for both students and teachers that can help trace deficiencies in a student's understanding back to individual concepts. This visualization tool has been developed by using the tree abstract data type (ADT) which is built from the concepts to be covered in a lab, lecture, or course. Once the tree ADT is built, each node can be associated with different entities such as student performance, class performance, or lab development. Using this tool, a teacher can help students by discovering concepts that need additional lecture coverage, and students may discover concepts for which they need to spend additional time working on reinforcement exercises.
