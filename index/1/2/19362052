This paper deals with handling the unknown factors, such as the external disturbance and the unknown dynamics, for a mobile robot control. We propose a RBF network based controller for compensate for them. The stability of the proposed controller is proven by using Lyapunov function. To show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, several simulation results are presented. Through the simulations, we show that the proposed controller can overcome the modelling uncertainty and the disturbances. Also the proposed RBF controller outperforms the previous works from the viewpoint of computation time, which is a crucial fact for a real-applications.
