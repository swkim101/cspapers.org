This paper proposes ipq, a novel search engine that proactively transforms query forms of Deep Web sources into phrase queries, constructs query evaluation plans, and caches results for popular queries offline. Then at query time, keyword queries are simply matched with phrase queries to retrieve results. ipq embodies a novel dual-ranking framework for query answering and novel solutions for discovering frequent attributes and queries. Preliminary experiments show the great potentials of ipq.
