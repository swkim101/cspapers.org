The object-oriented design process is investigated within the classic software development classi cation of Analysis, Design, and Implementation. When all development is performed using object oriented methods, OOD is best characterized as a transformational process, mapping declarative descriptions of objects and classes to implementation plans. Subphases of class design, system design, and program design accommodate and rationalize OO practices including abstraction, prototyping, re nement, bottom-up composition, delegation, interoperablity, clustering objects into processes, resource management design, tuning and optimization.
