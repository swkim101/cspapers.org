Upper-division courses contain some of the most attractive topics in computer science, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, layers of prerequisites restrict AI to advanced computer science students and a separate course for non-majors is not always curricularly feasible. Instead, upper-division AI can be taught in a way that has no prerequisites while retaining the rigor of an upper-division course. This paper includes the syllabus for such an "open AI" course and discusses experiences, positive and negative, with it.
