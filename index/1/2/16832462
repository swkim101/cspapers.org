The set maxima problem is defined as follows: given a totally ordered universe X and S s 2x, find maxS for all S E S. The set maxima problem is essentially the problem of verifying the optimality of a basis of weighed matroids. As such, it arises in sensitivity analysis and in Karger’s optimization algorithm [9]. Koml6s has conjectured that the minimum spanning tree verification procedure provides a paradigm for solving the set maxima problem with an optimal number of comparisons [13]. In this paper, we generalize Komk’ algorithm to the verification of the optimum basis of a matroid with the max-flow min-cut property. Our result is the first generalization of Koml6s’ approach to a natural and more general
