Many studies have provided qualitative arguments for the premise that the ability to compute is fundamental and therefore should be treated at all levels of education. This work presents a quantitative indication of the validity of this premise for primary school students. In order to precisely define what ability a student should have to use a model of computation to compute, this work reports an experimental study that shows a significant correlation between the student's ability to compute and his/her academic performance in a primary school.
