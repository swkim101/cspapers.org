We consider a special type of multi-label learning where class assignments of training examples are incomplete. As an example, an instance whose true class assignment is (c1, c2, c3) is only assigned to class c1 when it is used as a training sample. We refer to this problem as multi-label learning with incomplete class assignment. Incompletely labeled data is frequently encountered when the number of classes is very large (hundreds as in MIR Flickr dataset) or when there is a large ambiguity between classes (e.g., jet vs plane). In both cases, it is difficult for users to provide complete class assignments for objects. We propose a ranking based multi-label learning framework that explicitly addresses the challenge of learning from incompletely labeled data by exploiting the group lasso technique to combine the ranking errors. We present a learning algorithm that is empirically shown to be efficient for solving the related optimization problem. Our empirical study shows that the proposed framework is more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label learning in dealing with incompletely labeled data.
