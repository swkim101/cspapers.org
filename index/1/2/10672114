A new object identification and storage scheme for object databases is here suggested, supporting fast access of both singular objects and clusters. An object identifier consists of a cluster code prefixed by a unique number within cluster. The page allocation technique of linear hashing is used, but identifiers themselves are used as pseudokeys. Clustering can be based on any rule that determines an existing object, close to which a new object should be positioned. The new identifier is derived from that of the existing ob ject by hashing, maybe repeatedly. Two approaches of repeated hashing are suggested: the l-way scheme performs a linear chain of rehashes, while the 2-way scheme probes a path in art implicit, randomized, tree-structured hierarchy of rehashes. The latter has at most logarithmic insert time, but clustering is somewhat less effective than for the l-way scheme. The suggested approach shares the advantages of plain surrogates and structured addresses: In addition to clustering, objects can be retrieved with one access, as a rule, in spite of page splitting. This is accomplished without any additional stored data to support the technique.
