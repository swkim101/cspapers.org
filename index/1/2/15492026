Large scale, widely used programs such as operating systems are never complete. They undergo a continuing evolutionary cycle of maintenance, augmentation and restructuring to keep pace with evolving usage and implementation technologies. The paper provides quantitative evidence, from widely different environments, of the existence and nature of this evolutionary process. Interpretations and possible significance of some of the observed phenomena are discussed. Some implications for software engineering and for project planners and managers are noted.
