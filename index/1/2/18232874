While several algorithms for query evaluation have been proposed, there exists no notion of completeness for results of so-evaluated queries. In this paper, we motivate the need for clearly-defined completeness classes and present several notions of completeness for queries over Linked Data, based on the idea of authoritativeness of sources, and show the relation between the different completeness classes.
