This paper summarizes recent analytical Investigations of the mathematical properties of heuristics and their Influence on the performance of common search techniques. The results are reported without proofs, together with discussions of motivations and Interpretations. 
 
Highlights include the following: relations between the precision of the heuristic estimates and the average complexity of the search, comparisons of the average complexities of A* and BACKTRACKING, procedures for comparing and combining non-admissible heuristic functions, the influence of the weight u> (l-u>)g â™¦ h] on the complexity of A*, determination of the branching factors of alpha-beta and SSS*, and the effects of successor ordering on the complexity of alpha-beta and of search depth on the quality of decisions.
