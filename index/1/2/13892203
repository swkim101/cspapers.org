The FACS Advisor for System Tuning (FAST) is an cxpert system for tuning the performance of application and system software associated with the Facility Assignment and Control System (FACS). The FACS application consists of close to one million lines of C source code, making it one of the largest software systems in the world. FACS requires a dedicated mainframe configured with two or three 7 MIP processors, 50 Megabytes of main memory, and up to 75 disk packs on seven dual controllers. FACS is operational in many Bell Operating Companies, and site requests for tuning FACS have grown dramatically over the last two years I. The FAST expert system encodes large amounts of application and system tuning expertise to assist production FACS sites in analyzing and improving the performance of their systems.
