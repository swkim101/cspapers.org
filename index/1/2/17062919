Multi-beam optical tweezers is important technique to manipulate multiple small objects. Computer Generated Hologram (CGH) is one of the techniques and it can trap more than 200 objects in three dimension. For dexterous micromanipulation, it is useful to apply robotics into optical tweezers. In this research, we designed the optical system and control system of Holographic Optical Tweezers (HOT). For optical design, we considered working space and positioning resolution. For control design, we applied teleoperation. For online generation of hologram, we developed GCH generator applied General-purpose GPU (GPGPU) acceleration. This system achieved high-speed generation of hologram (250 Hz). For full automatic control, we applied stability control theory to the multi-beam control system. With the built system, the positioning precision and response were revealed with trajectory control and teleoperation experiments. As the result, we checked the effectiveness of HOT enhanced by robotics.
