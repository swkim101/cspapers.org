A spherical pendulum-type model is constructed to represent liquid sloshing in a cylindrical container, caused by the motions of a wheeled mobile robot. The model is used to design a path and an acceleration pattern for the wheeled mobile robot in consideration of the damping of sloshing in the container. The curvature radius of the path and the acceleration pattern of the wheeled mobile robot are determined using an input shaping method. The effectiveness of the present method is clarified through simulation and experimental results.
