Although senior computer scientists at major universities deplore the continued widespread use of Fortran in beginning computing courses, the fact remains that half a million college students each year are enrolled in courses that include Fortran proficiency as a major objective. If these students are to learn about program structure, ways must be found to teach this concept in Fortran courses. We propose the use of a structured mini-language, rather than a preprocessor, at the beginning of such a course.
 The B4Tran language has been designed as a subset of an extended Fortran dialect. It introduces alternative structures and iterative structures by using labelled statements to delimit the ends of blocks, in a manner analogous to the indexed DO block of Fortran. Controlled alternatives to GO TO are also provided.
 Some features of Fortran that cause difficulty for beginning students are omitted. All variables are of a single (“real”) type. Input and output are format-free. B4Tran runs as an interpreter; thus it can furnish improved feedback to the programmer during execution.
