Advances in the state-of-the-art of technology are not always matched by parallel advances in software. The discrepancy can often be traced to defficiencies in the determination of user requirements for computer information systems. This paper describes a course in requirement methods which has as its primary objective the sound integration of software engineering principles and information theory. The purpose is to prepare students to handle the complex issues associated with requirement specificiations.
