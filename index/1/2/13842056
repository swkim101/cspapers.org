We present Etymo (https://etymo.io), a discovery engine to facilitate artificial intelligence (AI) research and development. It aims to help readers navigate a large number of AI-related papers published every week by using a novel form of search that finds relevant papers and displays related papers in a graphical interface. Etymo constructs and maintains an adaptive similarity-based network of research papers as an all-purpose knowledge graph for ranking, recommendation, and visualisation. The network is constantly evolving and can learn from user feedback to adjust itself. A screencast is available at: https://youtu.be/T4FDPk_TmN0
