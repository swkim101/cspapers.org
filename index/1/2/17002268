In this paper we describe an algorithm to generate energy efficient trajectories for NIMS3D, a three-dimensional cabled robotic platform. Optimized parabolic paths are used to exploit the relatively low I2R loss associated with operation in lower regions of the workspace. Trajectory optimization is sufficiently fast to enable real time operation. Experimental results on a physical system for a three cable deployment show substantial reductions in energy consumption as compared to linear trajectories.
