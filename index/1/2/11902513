This paper describes the components used to build a sensor/actuator network to control a model railroad layout. Control of the model railroad is accomplished using a network of Digi International XBee modules. Information generated by sensors and actions sent to the layout are coordinated using the open source JMRI software package on a general purpose computer connected to the XBee network.
