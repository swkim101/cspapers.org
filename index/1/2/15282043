The issue is whether human visual imagery can be represented by symbolic structures and processes. Protocols of the task of imagining a path in space were analyzed using a production system interpreter. A detailed simulation of the subject's behavior within the confines of a symbolic short-term memory (STM) demonstrates that symbol structures are sufficient to explain imaging behavior. The experience of programming with productions and a homogeneous STM has brought out the importance of a control language when using an unstructured rule system.
