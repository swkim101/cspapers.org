We study a novel algorithm that addresses both problems. This algorithm dynamically modifies the simulation model during diagnosis by pruning parametrized components that cause discontinuity in the model. We provide a theoretical framework for predicting the speedups, which depends on the topology of the model. We empirically validate the theoretical predictions through extensive experimentation on a benchmark of circuits.
