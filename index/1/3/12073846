The purpose of this demo is to introduce a new low-power wireless device for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) operating in the ISM 2.4Ghz band: the MagoNode. Thanks to a highly efficient RF front-end, that extends the radio range and increases link reliability, the MagoNode features out-standing RF performance, still containing energy consumption. The platform has been designed at the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering Antonio Ruberti of the University of Rome La Sapienza in collaboration with the spin-off WSense [1].
