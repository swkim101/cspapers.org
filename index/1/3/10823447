In this paper, a new algorithm to find convex hull is presented which keeps the points into a form of nested binary tree. There are number of methods available for finding the convex hull but all of them are time consuming because they are based on comparing distances between the points and rotation of angles, whereas the proposed technique is based on binary tree which is efficient and more accurate than the existing algorithms as it decreases the computational cost and finds precise boundary of the object. Another main advantage of the proposed technique is the efficient memory usage because of binary tree structure.
