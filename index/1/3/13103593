Visual codes are used to embed digital data in physical objects, or they are shown in video sequences to transfer data over screen/camera links. Existing codes either carry limited data to make them robust against a range of channel conditions (e.g., low camera quality or long distances), or they support a high data capacity but only work over a narrow range of channel conditions. We present FOCUS, a new code design that does not require this explicit trade-off between code capacity and the reader's channel quality. Instead, FOCUS builds on concepts from OFDM to encode data at different levels of spatial detail. This enables each reader to decode as much data from a code as its channel quality allows. We build a prototype of FOCUS devices and evaluate it experimentally. Our results show that FOCUS gracefully adapts to the reader's channel, and that it provides a significant performance improvement over recently proposed designs, including Strata and PixNet.
