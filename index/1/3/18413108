The design and implementation of adaptive systems as opposed to non-adaptive systems creates new demands on user interface designers. This paper discusses a few of these demands as encountered by the authors while utilising a formal notation for the design of an adaptive user interface to an electronic mail system. Recommendations for the extension of this formal notation are proposed and discussed.
