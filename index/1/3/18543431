This paper describes the logic simulation system and the design verification method for logic design, timing analysis, and testing for VLSI. The integrity of test and network data on a logic design stage must be kept in LSI testing in the final verification stage. In dealing with consistency, emphasis is placed on the discrepancy between the real time domain on a simulator and a testing time domain on an LSI tester. The logic simulation system (Block INtegrator and AnaLYzer: BINALY) handles a hierarchical structure, a detailed timing model, and a timing alignment method for a testing time domain.
