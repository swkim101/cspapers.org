In this article, we discuss the challenges of document summarization for the blind and visually impaired people and then propose a new system called BrailleSUM to produce better summaries for the blind and visually impaired people. Our system considers the factor of braille length of each sentence in news articles into the ILPbased summarization method. Evaluation results on a DUC dataset show that BrailleSUM can produce shorter braille summaries than existing methods, meanwhile, it does not sacrifice the content quality of the summaries.
