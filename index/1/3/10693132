Regardless of the frequent patterns to discover, either the full frequent patterns or the condensed ones, either closed or maximal, the strategy always includes the traversal of the lattice of candidate patterns. We study the existing depth versus breadth traversal approaches for generating candidate patterns and propose in this paper a new traversal approach that jumps in the search space among only promising nodes. Our leaping approach avoids nodes that would not participate in the answer set and reduce drastically the number of candidate patterns. We use this approach to efficiently pinpoint maximal patterns at the border of the frequent patterns in the lattice and collect enough information in the process to generate all subsequent patterns.
