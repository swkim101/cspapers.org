The GCD and Banerjee-Wolfe tests are the standard data dependence tests used to determine whether a loop maybe parallelized/veetorized. In [14] we presented a new data dependence test, the I-test, which extends both the applicability and the accuracy of the GCD and the BanerjeeWolfe tests. In the original presentation, only the case of general dependence was considered, i.e., the case of dependence with a direction vector of the form (*,*, .. . . *). In the present work we generalize the I-test to check for data dependence subject to an arbitrary direction vector.
