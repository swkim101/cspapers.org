The backpropagation algorithm can be used for both recognition and generation of time trajectories. When used as a recognizer, it has been shown that the performance of a network can be greatly improved by adding structure to the architecture. The same is true in trajectory generation. In particular a new architecture corresponding to a "reversed" TDNN is proposed. Results show dramatic improvement of performance in the generation of hand-written characters. A combination of TDNN and reversed TDNN for compact encoding is also suggested.
