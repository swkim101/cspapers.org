Urban information abound today in open Web sources as well as in enterprise datasets. However, the maintenance and update of this wealth of information about cities comes at different costs: some datasets are automatically produced, while other sources require expensive workflows including human intervention. Regression techniques can be employed to predict a costly dataset from a set of cheaper information sources. In this paper we present our early experiments in predicting land use and demographics from heterogeneous open and enterprise datasets referring to the city of Milano. The results are encouraging, thus demonstrating that a data science approach leveraging diverse data can be actually worth for a smarter urban planning support.
