An operation f : A<sup>n</sup> → A on the domain A of an algebra A is definable if there exists a first order logic formula ϕ ( x̄ , y ) with parameters from A such that for all ā ∈ A<sup>n</sup> and b ∈ A we have f(ā)=b iff 𝒜 | = ϕ(ā,b). The goal of this paper is to study definability of operations by quantifier-free formulas on countable infinite algebras from computability and model-theoretic definability points of view.
