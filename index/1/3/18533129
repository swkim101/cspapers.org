We consider a concept of the rank of a tensor which is related to the contact rank introduced by Razborov [15]. We prove some upper and lower bounds for the tensor of multiplication of polynomials mod (z” — 1) and derive some corollaries for contact rank, for the size of depth 2 algebraic and boolean circuits and for a multiparty communication complexity problem. In particular we give answers to a conjecture of A. A. Razborov and a problem of M.Saks and A. Wigderson.
