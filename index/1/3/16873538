To sUIvive in a real world environment, a reason足 ing agent has to be equipped with several capa足 bilities ;.n order tc deal with incomplete informa足 tion about its target domain. One aspect of the incomplete information is the uncertainty about the effects of actions and events . Although the concrete outcome of an action or event cannot be predicted, often their relative likelihood can be quantified. In this paper we will discuss planning under uncertainty exploiting the available proba足 bilistic information in dynamic worlds, especially considering delayed effects of actions modeled as causally invoked events.
