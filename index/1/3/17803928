This paper presents a bearing-only SLAM algorithm that generates accurate and consistent maps of large environments by joining a series of small local maps. The local maps are built by least squares optimization with a proper landmark initialization technique. The local maps are then combined to build global map using Iterated Sparse Local Submap Joining Filter (ISLSJF). The accuracy and consistency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulation data sets. The algorithm is also tested using the DLR-Spatial-Cognition data set and the preprocessed Victoria Park data where the range information is ignored. The global map results are very similar to the result of full least squares optimization starting with very accurate initial values. As I-SLSJF is able to join a given set of local maps and associated uncertainties efficiently without any information loss, these results demonstrate that focusing on generating accurate local maps is a promising direction for solving large-scale bearing-only SLAM problems.
