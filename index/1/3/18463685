Electric vehicles operate inefficiently with a naive battery management system that charges or discharges battery cells in a pack based solely on application load demands. The battery pack's operation-time and lifetime can be extended significantly by effectively scheduling (the cyber part) battery charge, discharge, and rest activities, based on the battery characteristics (the physical part). We propose a set of policies for scheduling battery-cell activities, called the weighted-k round-robin (kRR) scheduling framework. This framework dynamically adapts battery-cell activities to load demands and the condition of individual cells, thereby extending the battery pack's operation-time and making them robust to anomalous voltage-imbalances. The framework comprises two key components. First, an adaptive filter estimates the upcoming load demand. Then, based on the estimated load demand, the kRR scheduler determines the number of parallel-connected cells to be discharged simultaneously. The scheduler also effectively partitions the cells in the pack, allowing the cells to be simultaneously charged and discharged in coordination with the battery reconfiguration system we developed earlier [17]. Besides the kRR scheduling framework, we characterize the discharge and recovery efficiency of a Lithium-ion battery cell. The kRR scheduling framework is shown to outperform three alternative scheduling mechanisms with respect to the operation-time by 7-56%, and improve the tolerance of voltage-imbalance by up to 50%.
