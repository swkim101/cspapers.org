It has been demonstrated that an undergraduate women's computer science support group can provide significant benefits to female CS students. It can be difficult for students to establish such a group without institutional support. We successfully established a thriving, self-sustaining support group with a modest initial outlay of time and money. This program serves as a model and template to help other small to mid-sized undergraduate departments accomplish the same.
