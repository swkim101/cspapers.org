In this paper, we provide the comparison indicator of the AGV transportation systems. For this purpose, we propose an optimal design methodology for the AGV transportation system by using the queuing network theory. In this methodology, the queuing network theory and a simulation-based optimization method are integrated to obtain the optimal design parameters (i.e., these are the design solutions of this design problem). In this study, two different types of the AGV transportation systems are designed. Then the performance of transportation is compared. Finally, the characteristic of each transportation system that depends on the design parameters is provided.
