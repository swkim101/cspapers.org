This paper presents our SpecDiff tool that exploits the model differencing technique for debugging and understanding evolving behaviors of formal specifications. SpecDiff has been integrated in the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT), a framework for formal specification, verification and simulation. SpecDiff is able to assist in diagnosing system faults, understanding the impacts of specification optimization techniques, and revealing the system change patterns.
