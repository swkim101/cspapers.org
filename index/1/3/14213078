In this paper we study market share rules, rules that have a certain market share statistic associated with them. Such rules are particularly relevant for decision making from a business perspective. Motivated by market share rules, in this paper we consider statistical quantitative rules (SQ rules) that are quantitative rules in which the RHS can be any statistic that is computed for the segment satisfying the LHS of the rule. Building on prior work, we present a statistical approach for learning all significant SQ rules, i.e., SQ rules for which a desired statistic lies outside a confidence interval computed for this rule. In particular we show how resampling techniques can be effectively used to learn significant rules. Since our method considers the significance of a large number of rules in parallel, it is susceptible to learning a certain number of "false" rules. To address this, we present a technique that can determine the number of significant SQ rules that can be expected by chance alone, and suggest that this number can be used to determine a "false discovery rate" for the learning procedure. We apply our methods to online consumer purchase data and report the results.
