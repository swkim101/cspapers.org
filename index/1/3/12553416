We establish a lower bound of (1:12 (cid:0) o(1))nlogn on the size of any n-input sorting network; this is the (cid:12)rst lower bound that improves upon the trivial information-theoretic bound by more than a lower order term. We then extend the lower bound to comparator networks that approximately sort a certain fraction of all input permutations. We also prove a lower bound of (c(cid:0)o(1))logn, where c (cid:25) 3:27, on the depth of any sorting network; the best previous result of approximately (2:41 (cid:0) o(1))logn was established by Yao in 1980. Our result for size is based on a new technique that lower bounds the number of \0{1 collisions" in the network; we provide strong evidence that the technique will lead to even better lower bounds.
