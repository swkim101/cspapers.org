In this paper we discuss an in-service course designed to give secondary school teachers the background needed to teach an Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science. In order to do this effectively, we argue that additional computer literacy and computer system concepts must be developed as well (PLUS). We present the (AP) course outline and objectives as well as the outline and objectives for some additional computing skills.
