Reverse engineering of mechanical systems often begins with large datasets produced from laser scanning of physical artifacts. Commonly it is necessary to remove noise and filter them; however, selecting noisy regions and preserving sharp edges on desired features is difficult using standard GUI interfaces. We demonstrate a haptic interface for marking and preserving features in noisy data and for performing local smoothing operations. The force-feedback provides a natural interface for these operations.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
