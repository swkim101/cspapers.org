xMapper is an Eclipse-based tool that implements a new architecture-implementation mapping approach called 1.x-way mapping. xMapper is able to record various architecture changes during software development, and automatically map specific kinds of architecture changes to code in specific ways. In addition, xMapper supports the mapping of behavioral architecture specifications modeled as UML-like sequence diagrams and state diagrams.
