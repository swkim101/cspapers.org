Tame is a new event-based system for managing concurrency in network applications. Code written with Tame abstractions does not suffer from the "stack-ripping" problem associated with other event libraries. Like threaded code, tamed code uses standard control flow, automatically-managed local variables, and modular interfaces between callers and callees. Tame's implementation consists of C++ libraries and a source-to-source translator; no platform-specific support or compiler modifications are required, and Tame induces little runtime overhead. Experience with Tame in real-world systems, including a popular commercial Web site, suggests it is easy to adopt and deploy.
