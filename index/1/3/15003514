This paper proposes an intelligent room that is free of operator's position based on gesture recognition technologies. Intention and position of an operator are recognized by detecting hand waving, and pan-tilt cameras are zoomed and focused on the operator. The hand region is extracted using color information, and direction or number of fingers and motion of the hand region are detected. Home appliances such as a television set are controlled by using the direction or number of fingers and hand motions.
