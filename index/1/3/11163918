We present a new algorithm for detecting both combinationally and sequentially false timing paths, one in which the constraints on a timing path are captured by justifying symbolic functions across latch boundaries. We have implemented the algorithm and we present, here, the results of using it to detect false timing paths on a recent PowerPC microprocessor design. We believe these are the first published results showing the extent of the false path problem in industry. Our results suggest that the reporting of false paths may be compromising the effectiveness of static timing analysis.
