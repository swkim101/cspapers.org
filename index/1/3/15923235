The so-called Chomsky hierarchy [5], consisting of regular, context-free, context-sensitive, and recursively enumerable languages, does not account for many “real world” classes of languages, e.g., programming languages and natural languages [4]. This is one of the reasons why many attempts have been made to “refine” the original Chomsky classification. The main goal has been to describe languages which, for instance, are not context-free but are still context-sensitive, without using the powerful and complex concept of context-sensitive grammars.
