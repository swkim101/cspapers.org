In this paper, the tracking problem is considered for robot manipulators in the presence of static friction, bounded disturbance, and modeling uncertainties. A composite tracking control strategy is proposed in which an adaptive friction estimation is used to estimate the extent of friction and a robust controller is then designed to enhance the overall stability and robustness. Performance issues of robust adaptive friction control are illustrated in simulation made for a two degree of freedom planar robot manipulator.
