As mobile and embedded devices become widespread, the management and configuration of the software in the devices is increasingly turning into a critical issue. OSGi is a business standard for the life cycle management of Java software components. It is based on a service oriented architecture where functional units are decoupled and components can be managed independently of each other. However, the focus continuously shifts from the originally intended area of small and embedded devices towards large-scaled enterprise systems. As a result, implementations of the OSGi framework are increasingly becoming more heavyweight and less suitable for smaller computing devices. In this paper, we describe the experience gathered during the design of Concierge, an implementation of the OSGi specification tailored to resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive benchmarks show that Concierge performs better than existing implementations and consumes less resources.
