The problem of positioning and manipulating three dimensional articulated figures is often handled by ad hoc techniques which are cumbersome to use. In this paper, we describe a system which provides a consistent and flexible user interface to a complex representation for articulated figures in a 3D environment. Jack is a toolkit of routines for displaying and manipulating complex geometric figures, and it provides a method of interactively manipulating arbitrary homogeneous transformations with a mouse. These transformations may specify the position and orientation of figures within a scene or the joint transformations within the figures themselves. Jack combines this method of 3D input with a flexible and informative screen management facility to provide a user-friendly interface for manipulating three dimensional objects.
