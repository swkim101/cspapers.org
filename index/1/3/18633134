Building upon prior work, the development of a scalable high frequency flapping wing robotic test platform is presented. Weighing 4.0 grams and operating at frequencies in excess of 90Hz, the platform is capable of generating a lift-to-weight ratio of approximately 1.3 and demonstrated lift-off tethered to an external power supply. From a previous electromagnetic actuator design, the coil cross-section profile was reshaped and “virtual spring” magnets were relocated to reduce mass and improve overall efficiency. Conducting experiments on a set of reconfigured actuators paired back-to-back, a magnetic interaction torque was discovered coupling the response of the combine system. Investigations into this interaction revealed a wing-to-wing synchronization effect accounting for asymmetries in the individual actuators and resulted in a system equilibria bifurcation with decreases to their separation distance. The coupling of the combined system bears a striking resemblance to the biomechanical linkage system in Dipteran flies which has also been shown to result in the synchronization of asymmetric wings. With the current embodiment of the robotic platform serving as a proof-of-concept for later iterations, a scaling of the system to the order of insects is predicted to have lift-to-weight ratios near two and will be the target for future work.
