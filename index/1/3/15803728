We present a new fault simulation algorithm for realistic break faults in the p-networks and n-networks of static CMOS cells. We show that Miller effects can invalidate a test just as charge sharing can, and we present a new charge-based approach that efficiently and accurately predicts the worst case effects of Miller capacitances and charge sharing together. Results on running our fault simulator on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits are provided.
