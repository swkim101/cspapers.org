We present our work towards the development of a MR image-guided SMA-actuated neurosurgical robot. We used two antagonistic SMA wires as actuators for each joint in the robot, so that each joint can be actuated independently. We also modeled and tested the force behaviour of SMA wires in the bent configuration, which can be used as a guideline for SMA actuator selection. Due to the size scale of the robot, it is impossible to have individual position sensors at each joint and hence we rely primarily on vision feedback to control the joint motion of the robot. The images used to control the robot in this paper were obtained from a camera with the goal of eventually using MR images to control the end-effector motion. We then developed a control strategy and a switching circuit to control multiple links simultaneously and independently using only one power supply. Experimental results from our current prototype of a 3-DOF robot showed that we can actuate the robot and hence observe joint motion in a gelatin slab. We also did a series of experiments inside the MRI to show that the robot is fully MRI-compatible and creates no significant image distortion in the MR images.
