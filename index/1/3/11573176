In this paper, we introduce polygene-based evolution, a novel framework for evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that features distinctive operations in the evolution process. In traditional EAs, the primitive evolution unit is gene, where genes are independent components during evolution. In polygene-based evolutionary algorithms (PGEAs), the evolution unit is polygene, i.e., a set of co-regulated genes. Discovering and maintaining quality polygenes can play an effective role in evolving quality individuals. Polygenes generalize genes, and PGEAs generalize EAs. Implementing the PGEA framework involves three phases: polygene discovery, polygene planting, and polygene-compatible evolution. Extensive experiments on function optimization benchmarks in comparison with the conventional and state-of-the-art EAs demonstrate the potential of the approach in accuracy and efficiency improvement.
