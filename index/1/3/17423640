We describe the role of mentors in an experimental course on human-computer interaction (HCI) taught in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University for the past two years. Students practice design within the course by collaborating in small groups on 12-week projects, in which they analyze a work environment, design and implement a prototype user interface, and evaluate the prototype with project clients. As part of our experiment in providing contact with the world of practical design, we invited people from local industry to serve as mentors for the student groups. These unpaid volunteers have been important adjuncts in guiding students as they developed their HCI projects. We discuss: the background for the projects; the role of mentors in the learning process; what is required of mentors and what benefits they get; how to support the mentoring process; and what we have learned from the experience so far. We consider mentors to be a critical part of the design project within the course, and we welcome a sharing of experience with other people who may have developed similar courses where mentors played an important role.
