Robotic assistance can bring significant improvements to orthopedic fracture surgery: facilitate more accurate fracture fragment repositioning without open access and obviate problems related to the current minimally invasive fracture surgery techniques by providing a better clinical outcome, reduced recovery time, and health-related costs. This paper presents a new design of the robot-assisted fracture surgery (RAFS) system developed at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, featuring a new robotic architecture, and real-time 3D imaging of the fractured anatomy. The technology presented in this paper focuses on distal femur fractures, but can be adapted to the larger domain of fracture surgeries, improving the state-of-the-art in robot assistance in orthopedics. To demonstrate the enhanced performance of the RAFS system, 10 reductions of a distal femur fracture are performed using the system on a bone model. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and safety of the new RAFS system. The system allows the surgeon to precisely reduce the fractures with a reduction accuracy of 1.15 mm and 1.3Â°, meeting the clinical requirements for this procedure.
