We present an efficient family of quantum circuits for a fundamental primitive in quantum information theory, the Schur transform. The Schur transform on n d-dimensional quantum systems is a transform between a standard computational basis to a labelling related to the representation theory of the symmetric and unitary groups. If we desire to implement the Schur transform to an accuracy of ε-1, then our circuit construction uses a number of gates which is polynomial in n, d and log(ε-1). The key tool in our construction is a poly(d, log n, log(ε-1)) algorithm for the ud Clebsch-Gordan transform. Our efficient circuit construction renders numerous protocols in quantum information theory computationally tractable and yields a new possible approach to quantum algorithms which is distinct from the standard paradigm of the quantum Fourier transform.
