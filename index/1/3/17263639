With a growing demand for complex, safety-critical features in automotive vehicles, functional safety is a key issues of automotive software development. Consequently, standards like ISO26262 propose methods and techniques for the systematic development of automotive software. Furthermore, the growing amount of functionality - including active safety systems or automated driver assistance functions - on the control of the vehicle dynamics and the correspondingly used more powerful electronic platforms requires methods supporting the development of systems in an increasingly complex design space. In this contribution, an approach is presented that supports the allocation of software functions to hardware elements in an automated fashion, respecting the separation constraints concerning assurances levels.
