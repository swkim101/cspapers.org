The nested relational model provides a better way to represent complex objects than the (flat) relational model, by allowing relations to have relation-valued attributes. A recursive algebra for nested relations that allows tuples at all levels of nesting in a nested relation to be accessed and modified without any special navigational operators and without having to flatten the nested relation has been developed. In this algebra, the operators of the nested relational algebra are extended with recursive definitions so that they can be applied not only to relations but also to subrelations of a relation. In this paper, we show that queries are more efficient and succinct when expressed in the recursive algebra than in languages that require restructuring in order to access subrelations of relations. We also show that most of the query optimization techniques that have been developed for the relational algebra can be easily extended for the recursive algebra and that queries are more easily optimizable when expressed in the recursive algebra than when they are expressed in languages like the non-recursive algebra.
