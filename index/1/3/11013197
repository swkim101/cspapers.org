Model-based vision systems must be capable of dealing with large quantities of hypothetical interpretations. Hypothesise-and-test methods often lead to combinatorial explosions of possible interpretations. Discrimination graphs prevent such explosions by imposing a hierarchical organisation on the domain of interpretation. Such an organisation effectively reduces the number of interpretations that the system has to deal with. This paper presents an algorithm which automatically constructs discrimination graphs.
