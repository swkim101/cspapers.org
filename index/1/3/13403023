A classical paper of Myerson [18] shows how to construct an optimal (revenue-maximizing) auction in a model where bidders' values are drawn from known continuous distributions. In this paper we show how to adapt this approach to finite support distributions that may be partially unknown. We demonstrate that a Myerson-style auction can be constructed in time polynomial in the number of bidders and the size of the support sets. Next, we consider the scenario where the mechanism designer knows the support sets, but not the probability of each value. In this situation, we show that the optimal auction may be learned in polynomial time using a weak oracle that, given two candidate auctions, returns one with a higher expected revenue. To study this problem, we introduce a new class of truthful mechanisms which we call order-based auctions. We show that the optimal mechanism is an order-based auction and use the internal structure of this class to prove the correctness of our learning algorithm as well as to bound its running time.
