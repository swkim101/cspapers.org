Following up the success of the past events at WWW2015, WWW2016 and WWW2017, the 4th AW4City 2018 aims to keep on attracting a significant international attention with regard to web applications for smart cities. More specifically, the aim of this workshop is to focus on the applications smart city component and more specifically on the design and implementation of web-based applications and Apps that deliver smart services or address smart city challenges. This year, the proposed workshop will emphasize on the contribution of web applications and Apps to citizen centricity. In the era of cities, municipal leaders, service and utility providers are making an important shift regarding thinking of people as customers and of customer experience. This shift is not a simple task since it demands a continuous service monitoring, assessment and improvement [1;2;3], which normally is based on accurate data analysis and appears as a thinking that makes government and providers more personal and responsive.
