This paper explores the provision of adaptive hints based on attainment levels in the context of supporting the development of young adults' ICT information processing skills. We describe the design of the LIBE VLE, particularly its personalisation and adaptation features, and a User Study undertaken with young adults at a vocational education centre. Using data collected through the LIBE VLE, we analyse the relationships between learners' accessing of hints, motivation, and performance. Results point to a positive effect of accessing of hints on students' perception of the LIBE VLE and their likelihood of using it again for further learning; and also a positive effect of students' interest in the course subject on their engagement and performance in course activities. These findings have important implications for supporting young adults in developing key competences necessary for integration into the workforce and for fostering self-regulated lifelong learning.
