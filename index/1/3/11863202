In this paper, we look at several issues concerning the design of a disk system for a multiprocessor such as a hypercube. We propose a methodology for connecting the I/O processors to such a system for efficient I/O access. An analysis is presented to see the effect of I/O communication on the network of the multiprocessor. We evaluate different disk organizations that can be employed within such a system to see which organization has a better performance. Then we consider the problem of mapping specific data structures such as matrices onto the disks such that the data can be accessed efficiently.
