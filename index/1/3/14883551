Computer-aided space allocation or space planning techniques have been an active research area in the development of automated design assistance techniques. Miller (1971), in his thorough survey of and bibliography for this area, suggested that while the future of geometric space planning would undoubtedly lie in the direction of highly sophisticated, interactive graphic systems for use by the designer, there is an interim need for immediately applicable techniques for use by the design professions. The interim application of simple and comprehensible approaches to design automation may even be a necessary prerequisite to the acceptance by designers of the more sophisticated techniques that will emerge in the future.
