Using a combination of techniques from visual tracking, image-based rendering, distributed programming, and robot motion control, we present a predictive display system to improve local operator's performance in tele-manipulations. More precisely, we construct a networked distributed system allowing the robot motion control and predictive display function to be implemented in a single PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) program running on both the operator and remote scene computer. We also integrate our system with real-time pose tracking of the operator to allow 3D rendering in HMD.
