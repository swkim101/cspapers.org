The Web has developed into a global information space consisting not just of linked documents, but also of Linked Data. In 2010, we have seen significant growth in the size of the Web of Data, as well as in the number of communities contributing to its creation. In addition to publishing and interlinking datasets, there is intensive work on developing Linked Data browsers, Linked Data crawlers, Web of Data search engines and other applications that consume Linked Data from the Web. The goal of the 4th Linked Data on the Web workshop (LDOW2011) is to provide a forum for exposing high quality research on Linked Data as well as to showcase innovative Linked Data applications. In addition, by bringing together researchers in this field, we expect the event to further shape the Linked Data research agenda.
