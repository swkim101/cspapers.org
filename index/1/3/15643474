Abstract : In this report, we present an approach to improving the usability of software systems by means of software architectural decisions. We identify specific connections between aspects of usability, such as the ability to "undo," and software architecture. We also formulate each aspect of usability as a scenario with a characteristic stimulus and response. For every scenario, we provide an architecture pattern that implements its aspect of usability. We then organize the usability scenarios by category. One category presents the benefits of these aspects of usability to users or their organizations. A second category presents the architecture mechanisms that directly relate to the aspects of usability. Finally, we present a matrix that correlates these two categories with the general scenarios that apply to them.
