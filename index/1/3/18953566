The architecture of a proto-type functional level simulator element of a massively parallel machine (MAN-YO) designed for logic design automation is presented. At functional level, hardware systems are described in a hardware description language, FDL. The FDL description is compiled into stack oriented intermediate language instructions. Communicating with other gate level/block level/ functional level processors, each functional simulator interprets the compiled instructions and simulates various circuits using 4-value logic. In order to realize high speed processing of 4-value logic/arithmetic operations, the functional simulator utilizes low-level parallelism realized by 3 ALUs which are controlled by the different fields of a long horizontal type microinstruction.
By utilizing low-level parallelism at processor level, as well as processor level parallelism, high speed execution of mixed level simulation becomes possible. The system also provides further performance enhancement by compiling often used FDL macros into microcode.
This paper describes an outline of the MAN-YO (Japanese for ten thousand leaf-nodes in the processor tree), a brief description of FDL, and the architecture of the functional level simulator element (called FDLPE). A rough performance based on the current design is also described.
