This work deals with interactive motion planning processes intended to assist a human operator when simulating industrial tasks such as assembly, maintenance or disassembly in Virtual Reality. Such applications need motion planning on surfaces. We propose an original interactive path planning algorithm with contact, I-RRT-C, based on a RRT-Connect approach. This algorithm is based on a real-time interactive approach allowing both an automatic motion planner and a human operator to jointly explore the workspace. A parameter balances the authority between the computer and the operator to reduce processing times. We improve the guidance by allowing to sample on the surfaces of obstacles. Our method allows to find a path in cluttered environments or to solve contact operations such as insertion or sliding tasks. Last, we present experimental results showing that our interactive path planner with contact brings a significant improvement over state of the art methods in both free and contact space.
