This paper describes a new qualitative-quantitative simulator to help buyers learn how to make decisions when they purchase goods. In this paper, we propose an e-learning support system (LSDM) for assisting user decision making by applying artificial intelligence technology. When buyers purchase expensive items, they must carefully select these items from many alternatives. The learning support system provides useful information that assists consumers in purchasing goods. We employ qualitative simulations because the output simulation results are useful. Our system consists of a qualitative processing system and a quantitative calculation system. When users use the system, they first input information on the goods they want to purchase. The information input by users is used in the qualitative simulation. Next, they supply the details of their budgets, the rate of loans, and several other factors, on a form. The system then integrates the results of simulation and the user's input data and proposes plans to aid in their decision process. The system has several advantages: it can be used by simple input, the process of simulation is easy to understand, users can learn how to make decisions by trial and error, and the users can base their decision making on synthetic results.
