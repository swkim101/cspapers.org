One key to cross-language information retrieval is how to efficiently resolve the translation ambiguity of queries given their short length. This problem is even more challenging when only bilingual dictionaries are available, which is the focus of this paper. In the previous research of cross-language information retrieval using bilingual dictionaries, the word co-occurrence statistics is used to determine the most likely translations of queries. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical model, named ``maximum coherence model'', which estimates the translation probabilities of query words that are consistent with the word co-occurrence statistics. Unlike the previous work, where a binary decision is made for the selection of translations, the new model maintains the uncertainty in translating query words when their sense ambiguity is difficult to resolve. Furthermore, this new model is able to estimate translations of multiple query words simultaneously. This is in contrast to many previous approaches where translations of individual query words are determined independently. Empirical studies with TREC datasets have shown that the maximum coherence model achieves a relative 10% - 40% improvement in cross-language information retrieval, comparing to other approaches that also use word co-occurrence statistics for sense disambiguation.
