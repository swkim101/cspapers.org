This poster shows the viability of precise indoor localization using physical layer information in WiFi systems. We find that channel frequency responses across multiple OFDM subcarriers can be suitably aggregated into a location signature. While these signatures vary over time and environmental mobility, we notice that their core structure preserves certain properties that are amenable to localization. We demonstrate these ideas through a functional system, implemented on off-the-shelf Intel 5300 cards (that are designed to export per-subcarrier information to the driver). We evaluate the system in a busy engineering building, a cafeteria, and the university museum, and demonstrate localization accuracies in the granularity of 1m x 1m boxes, called spots. Results show that our system, PinLoc, is able to localize users to a spot with 90% mean accuracy, while incurring less than 6% false positives. We believe this is an important step forward, compared to the best indoor localization schemes of today.
