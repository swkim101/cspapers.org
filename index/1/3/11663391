In the 3G mobile networks, utilization of multimedia appli-cations on mobile/wireless devices allows users to be present and communicate with other users, anywhere and anytime. Novel service provisioning models are taking into account user’ s behaviour, terminal equipment capabilities and the content providers. Thus, service charging schemes must be adapted to prevent the burdening of users with calculation of revenue for all the parties involved in the service provisioning process. We are proposing a system for automated business-driven service provisioning. Proof-of-concept implementation is deployed into 3G mobile network. Based on the operator’ s business strategies, availability of new software/content components, user’ s location, equipment capabilities and the amount of money on the user’ s account, operators can automatically create a list of potential users for the new service.
