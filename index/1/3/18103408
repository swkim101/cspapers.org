We propose a unified approach to plan execution and schedule dispatching that converts a plan, which has been augmented with temporal constraints, into a policy for dispatching. Our approach generalizes the original plan and temporal constraints so that the executor need only consider the subset of state that is relevant to successful execution of valid plan fragments. We can accommodate a variety of calamitous and serendipitous changes to the state of the world by supporting the seamless re-execution or omission of plan fragments, without the need for costly replanning. Our methodology for plan generalization and online dispatching is a novel combination of plan execution and schedule dispatching techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a prototype implementation and a series of experiments.
