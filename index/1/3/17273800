We present Match the News, a browser extension for real time news recommendation. Our extension works on the client side to recommend in real time recently published articles that are relevant to the web page the user is currently visiting. Match the News is fed from Google News RSS and applies syntactic matching to find the relevant articles. We implement an innovative weighting function to perform the keyword extraction task, BM25H. With BM25H we extract keywords not only relevant to currently browsed web page, but also novel with respect to the user's recent browsing history. The novelty feature in keyword extraction task results in meaningful news recommendations with regards to the web page the users currently visits. Moreover the extension offers a salient visualization of the terms corresponding to the users recent browsing history making thus the extension a comprehensive tool for real time news recommendation and self assessment.
