This paper presents approaches to semi-supervised learning when the labeled training data and test data are differently distributed. Specifically, the samples selected for labeling are a biased subset of some general distribution and the test set consists of samples drawn from either that general distribution or the distribution of the unlabeled samples. An example of the former appears in loan application approval, where samples with repay/default labels exist only for approved applicants and the goal is to model the repay/default behavior of all applicants. An example of the latter appears in spam filtering, in which the labeled samples can be out-dated due to the cost of labeling email by hand, but an unlabeled set of up-to-date emails exists and the goal is to build a filter to sort new incoming email.Most approaches to overcoming such bias in the literature rely on the assumption that samples are selected for labeling depending only on the features, not the labels, a case in which provably correct methods exist. The missing labels are said to be "missing at random" (MAR). In real applications, however, the selection bias can be more severe. When the MAR conditional independence assumption is not satisfied and missing labels are said to be "missing not at random" (MNAR), and no learning method is provably always correct.We present a generative classifier, the shifted mixture model (SMM), with separate representations of the distributions of the labeled samples and the unlabeled samples. The SMM makes no conditional independence assumptions and can model distributions of semi-labeled data sets with arbitrary bias in the labeling. We present a learning method based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that, while not always able to overcome arbitrary labeling bias, learns SMMs with higher test-set accuracy in real-world data sets (with MNAR bias) than existing learning methods that are proven to overcome MAR bias.
