The Rubber Hand Illusion is a well known multisensory illusion in which the participant feels their own unseen hand become a rubber hand that is placed at the position where their hand is supposedly placed, triggered by synchronized haptic stimuli on their hand and the rubber hand. Our previous study showed that a robotized 1-degree-of-freedom rubber hand in the form of a master-slave system significantly enhanced the illusion compared with the classic rubber hand illusion. The illusion gives the sense that the part of body becomes part of the robot - it is thus assumed that this multisensory illusion is a potentially effective way to increase intuitiveness, and therefore increase the operability of a multi-degrees-of-freedom master-slave system. To further investigate the concept, we built a multisensory illusion inducible microsurgical robotic system based on the findings of the previous study and conducted a series of psychophysical experiments. The experimental results reveal that the multisensory illusion and operability is significantly correlated.
