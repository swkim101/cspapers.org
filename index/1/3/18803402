This paper proposes using servo hydraulics for high speed robotic manipulation. It details the development of a novel double vane rotary type actuator custom designed for use in a Selective Compliant Assembly Robotic Arm (SCARA). The system, which is mathematically modeled and simulated, consists of an electro-hydraulic servo valve, double vane rotary actuator, manipulator and a controller. Based on the simulation results, hydraulic actuators were sized for optimal performance. A prototype of the proposed manipulator was built and tested. The test results show that the proposed actuator is capable of reaching torques of up to 860 Nm. The end effector of the manipulator is capable of reaching average velocities in excess of 2.7 msâˆ’1 with a payload capability of 5.3 kg. Comparable performance is not feasible with contemporary SCARA type robots with electric motors.
