More and more students are interested in developing their own mobile applications. Incorporating mobile technology into classrooms can greatly capture student attention, better student engagement, and improve student achievement. In this paper, we present our experience, findings, and lessons learned from conducting a one-week App Inventor for Android summer computing workshop for K-12 teachers. Our workshop focuses on using App Inventor, a drag-and-drop Android development environment, introduce computing concepts to K-12 teachers in all subjects. During the workshop the teachers developed curriculum applications for the subjects they will teach in the following semesters with the help of our workshop tutors. Workshop assessment results show a 29.5% increase in confidence level in teaching computer science and a 109% computing knowledge level increase.
