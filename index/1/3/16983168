This paper investigates subjects' stopping behaviors and estimates of recall in an interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiment. Subjects completed four recall-oriented search tasks and were asked to estimate how many of the relevant documents they believed they had found after each task. Subjects also responded to an interview question probing their reasons for stopping a search. Results show that most subjects believed they found about 51-60% of the relevant documents and that this estimate was correlated positively with number of documents saved and actual recall, even though subjects' recall estimates were inaccurate. Reasons given for stopping search are also explored.
