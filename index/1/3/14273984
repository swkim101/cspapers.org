We devise optimum parallel algorithms for solving a banded linear system of equations and for computing the determinant of a banded matrix, substantially improving the previous record computational complexity estimates of [El. Our algorithms are in NC or RNC and support the optimum bounds on the potential vrork (the product of time and processor bounds). Moreover, these algorithms are in NC’ or RNC’ if the bandwidth is a constant.
