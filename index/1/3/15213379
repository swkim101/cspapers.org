However, in many navigation tasks including trajectory planning, surveillance, and coverage, accurate maps are essential for the effective behavior of the robot.  In this paper we present a probabilistic grid-based approach for modeling changing environments. Our method represents both, the occupancy and its changes in the corresponding area where the dynamics are characterized by the state transition probabilities of a Hidden Markov Model. We apply an offline and an online technique to learn the parameters from observed data. The advantage of the online approach is that it can dynamically adapt the parameters and at the same time does not require storing the complete observation sequences.  Experimental results obtained with data acquired by real robots demonstrate that our model is well-suited for representing changing environments. Further results show that our technique can be used to substantially improve the effectiveness of path planning procedures.
