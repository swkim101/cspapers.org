We study the event detection problem using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that overcome the two fundamental limitations of the traditional feature-based approaches to this task: complicated feature engineering for rich feature sets and error propagation from the preceding stages which generate these features. The experimental results show that the CNNs outperform the best reported feature-based systems in the general setting as well as the domain adaptation setting without resorting to extensive external resources.
