This paper describes a gait generation and control approach of a bipedal climbing robot with under-actuated mechanism. The special mechanical structure enables the robot to perform exploration tasks using "crawling", "pivoting" or "climbing" gaits. Multiple sensors are synthesized to generate successful gaits using a finite state machine. Experiments are conducted which demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.
