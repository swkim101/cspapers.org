In the context of abstract interpretation we study the number of times a functional need to be unfolded in order to give the least fixed point. For the cases of the total or monotone functions we obtain an exponential bound and in the case of strict and additive (or distributive) functions we obtain a quadratic bound. These bounds are shown to be tight. Specialising the case of strict and additive functions to functionals of a form that would correspond to iterative programs we show that a linear bound is tight. We demonstrate the relation to several analyses studied in the literature (including strictness analysis).
