A model of paged multiprogramming computer systems using variable storage partitioning is considered. A variable storage partitioning policy is one which allocates storage among the active tasks according to a sequence of fixed partitions of main storage. The basic result obtained is, mean processing efficiency is increased and mean fault-rate decreased under a variable partition, provided that the curves of efficiency and fault-rate as a function of allocated space are concave up.
