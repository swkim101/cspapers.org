The development of very powerful intelligent information systems requires the use of many techniques best derived by studying human understanding methods. RESEARCHER is a system that reads, remembers, generalizes from, and answers questions about complex technical texts, patent abstracts in particular. In this paper we discuss three current areas of research involving RESEARCHER - the generalization of hierarchically structured representations; the use of long-term memory in text processing, specifically in resolving ambiguity; and the tailoring of answers to questions to the level of expertise of different users.
