The DARPA Internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS), a distributed database, to map host names to network addresses, and vice-versa. Using a vulnerability first noticed by P.V. Mockapetris, we demonstrate how the DNS can be abused to subvert system security. We also show what tools are useful to the attacker. Possible defenses against this attack, including one implemented by Berkeley in response to our reports of this problem, are discussed, and the limitations on their applicability are demonstrated. 
 
This paper was written in 1990, and was withheld from publication by the author. The body of the paper is unchanged, even to the extreme of giving the size of the Internet as 200,000 hosts. An epilogue has been added that discusses why it was held back, and why it is now being released.
