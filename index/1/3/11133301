Joint attention between a human user and a robot is essential for effective human-robot interaction. In this work, we propose an approach to person awareness and to the perception of showing and pointing gestures for a domestic service robot. In contrast to previous work, we do not require the person to be at a predefined position, but instead actively approach and orient towards the communication partner. For perceiving showing and pointing gestures and for estimating the pointing direction a Time-of-Flight camera is used. Estimated pointing directions and shown objects are matched to objects in the robot's environment. Both the perception of showing and pointing gestures as well as the accurary of estimated pointing directions have been evaluated in a set of different experiments. The results show that both gestures are adequatly perceived by the robot. Furthermore, our system achieves a higher accuracy in estimating the pointing direction than is reported in the literature for a stereo-based system. In addition, the overall system has been successfully tested in two international RoboCup@Home competitions and the 2010 ICRA Mobile Manipulation Challenge
