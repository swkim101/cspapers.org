In this paper we present a high-density earthquake monitoring system using wireless sensor networks. For high-precision monitoring, we developed Pavenet OS, which is a hard-realtime operating system for sensor nodes, and acceleration sensor board. Sensor nodes of the system sample acceleration with less than 0.3 us jitter with Pavenet OS. The system provides earthquake engineering researchers the ability to measure vibrations of structures during earthquakes at less cost and higher node density than previous systems.
