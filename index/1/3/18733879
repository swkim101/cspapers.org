We present a technology mapper for full-custom ECL gates. These gates are characterized by high fanins and a regular structure. Full-custom gates differ from ECL library gates in that a full range of structures is available as a single form, rather than a large number of individual gates that sparsely cover the possible design space. This paper presents a complete Boolean matching algorithm and gives a proof of its correctness. We show that it can efficiently map logic into the general ECL gate form. We also show two variants of the algorithm, and show that they given poorer results with no savings in runtime. The mapper described in the paper is a necessary component of a CAD system for designing ECL microprocessors. Manual design of full-custom ECL gates would not be acceptable for control logic since it is a tedious, error prone, and lengthy activity. Nor would a gate-array style mapper and library with a limited number of gates be acceptable, because this makes less effective use of the inherent speed of the technology.
