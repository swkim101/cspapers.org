However, this method requires that shape surfaceis not elastic. In other words, it is sensitive totopological transformations such as stretching and compressing.To tackle this problem, we propose a new approachthat constructs a high-dimensional space to embedthe manifolds of shapes based on sparse representation,which is able to completely withstand rigid transformationsand considerably tolerate topological transformations.Experiments on TOSCA shapes validate theproposed approach.
