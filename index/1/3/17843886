We present a technique to reduce image blur caused by out-of-focus regions in projected imagery. Unlike traditional restoration algorithms that operate on a blurred image to recover the original, the nature of our problem requires that the correction be applied to the original image before blurring. To accomplish this, a camera is used to estimate a series of spatially varying point-spread-functions (PSF) across the projectorâ€™s image. These discrete PSFs are then used to guide a pre-processing algorithm based on Wiener filtering to condition the image before projection. Results show that using this technique can help ameliorate the visual effects from out-of-focus projector blur.
