A sliver is a tetrahedron whose four vertices lie close to a plane and whose perpendicular projection to that plane is a convex quadrilateral with no short edge. Slivers axe both undesirable and ubiquitous in 3-dimensional Delaunay triangulations. Even when the point-set is well-spaced, slivers may result. This paper shows that such a point set permits a small perturbation whose Delaunay triangulation contains no slivers. It also gives deterministic algorithms that compute the perturbation of n points in time O(n logn) with one processor and in time O(log n) with O(n) processors.
