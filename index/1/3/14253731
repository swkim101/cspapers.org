This paper presents an approach to the development of a practical deductive objectoriented database (DOOD) system baaed upon the integration of a logic query language with an imperative programming language in the context of an object-oriented data model. The approach is novel, in that a formally defined data model has been used as the starting point for the development of the two languages. This has enabled a seamless integration of the two languages, which is the central theme of this paper. It is shown how the two languages have been developed from the underlying data model, and several alterna, tive approaches to their integration are presented, one of which has been chosen for implementation. The approach is compared with other examples of language integration in a database context, and it is argued that the resulting system overcomes a number of important challenges associated with the development of practical deductive object-oriented database systems.
