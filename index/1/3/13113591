The development of Internet advertising is phenomenal. In merely five years, its market size has grown from the 1999’s $3.5 billion to 2005’s $12.9 billion. Among the different types of online advertising, keyword auctions, where positions in a search engine’s result pages are sold to advertisers through auctions, has grown most rapidly and is widely credited for the revitalization of the search engine business. These keyword auctions offer one way for us to study dynamic price competition. In reality, firms react to each other continually. Some firms check the prices of their competitors and make adjustments. Some others even offer price-match guarantees that whenever a competitor offers a lower price, they will match the difference. With the advent of the Internet, these types of price reactions become even more prevalent. In this paper, we propose to use a Markovian framework to study dynamic price competition in the keyword auctions market.
