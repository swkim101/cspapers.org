This paper presents the ongoing work towards enabling robots to achieve highly dynamic behavior through full-body teleoperation. Human operator and robot slave have independent balance controllers that interact with each other during the experiments. First we present a compliant balancing controller that regulates the feet contact forces in order to mitigate external disturbances and maintain balance. Next, by estimating the forces that the operator exerts over its own Center of Mass to generate movement, the Dynamic Synchronization Force Scaling controller allows the robot to anticipate human motion during posture tracking. This strategy requires reduced control gains for state tracking when compared to purely reactive controllers, resulting in an inherently more stable system. Results show a considerable reduction of the position tracking overshoot along with substantial reduction of required error-based control forces.
