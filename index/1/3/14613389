The performance of a high-level language machine will depend upon the characteristics of its workload. Equally, the design for such a machine should be guided by some understanding of the work which it will be called upon to perform. We present here some behavioral properties of a large Algol-60 program in terms of the requests they represent for the various processing resources of an Algol-60 machine. The data provide insight into the behavior of such machines, particularly with respect to dynamic memory requirements and the procedure activation rates associated with direct Algol-60 execution. The data can thus be of value to designers of high-level language machines in view of their implications for the performance of such systems.
