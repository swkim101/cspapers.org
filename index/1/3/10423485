COTS peripherals are heavily used in the embedded market, but their unpredictability is a threat for high-criticality real-time systems: it is hard or impossible to formally verify COTS components. Instead, we propose to monitor the runtime behavior of COTS peripherals against their assumed specifications. If violations are detected, then an appropriate recovery measure can be taken. Our monitoring solution is decentralized: a monitoring device is plugged in on a peripheral bus and monitors the peripheral behavior by examining read and write transactions on the bus. Provably correct (w.r.t. given specifications) hardware monitors are synthesized from high level specifications, and executed on FPGAs, resulting in zero runtime overhead on the system CPU. The proposed technique, called BusMOP, has been implemented as an instance of a generic runtime verification framework, called MOP, which until now has only been used for software monitoring. We experimented with our technique using a COTS data acquisition board.
