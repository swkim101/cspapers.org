This paper is about representation in RL.We discuss some of the concepts in representation and generalization in reinforcement learning and argue for higher-order representations, instead of the commonly used propositional representations. The paper contains a small review of current reinforcement learning systems using higher-order representations, followed by a brief discussion. The paper ends with research directions and open problems.
