Resident applications, which autonomously awaken mobile devices, can gradually and imperceptibly drain device batteries. This paper introduces the concept of alarm similarity into wakeup management for mobile systems in connected standby. First, we define hardware similarity to reflect the degree of energy savings and time similarity to reflect the impact on user experience. We then propose a policy that aligns alarms based on their similarity to save standby energy while maintaining the quality of the user experience. Finally, we integrate our design into Android and conduct extensive experiments on a commercial smartphone running popular mobile apps. The results demonstrate that our design can further extend the standby time achieved with Android's native policy by up to one-third.
