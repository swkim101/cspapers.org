In this paper program visualization is defined as a mapping from programs to graphical representations. Simple forms of program visualization are frequently encountered in software engineering. For this reason current advances in program visualization are likely to influence future developments concerning software engineering tools and environments. This paper provides a new taxonomy of program visualization research. The proposed taxonomy becomes the vehicle through which we carry out a systernatic review of current systems, techniques, trends, and ideas in program visualization.
