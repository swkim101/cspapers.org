A rotation in a binary tree is a local restructuring that changes the tree into another tree. Rotations are useful in the design of tree-based data structures. The rotation distance between a pair of trees is the minimum number of rotations needed to convert one tree into the other. In this paper we establish a tight bound of In 6 on the maximum rotation distance between two A2-node trees for all large n, using volumetric arguments in hyperbolic 3-space. Our proof also gives a tight bound on the minimum number of tetrahedra needed to dissect a polyhedron in the worst case, and reveals connections 1 This is a revised and expanded version of a paper that appeared in the 18th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, [9]. 2 Partial support provided by DARPA, ARPA order 4976, amendment 19, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory under contract F33615-87-C-1499, and by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-8658139. 3 Partial support provided by the National Science Foundation under grant DCR-8605962. 4 Partial support provided by the National Science Foundation under grants DMR-8504984 and DCR8505517.
