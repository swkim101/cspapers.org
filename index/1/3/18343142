IMAGE is a system of computer programs which generates three dimensional spatial arrangements to satisfy spatial requirements specified by a designer. A problem specification is composed of two elements: geometric descriptions of the spaces to be configured; and relationships between those spaces which the designer wishes to achieve. Given a problem description, IMAGE generates arrangements until a configuration is achieved which satisfies all specified relationships. If no such configuration is possible, IMAGE produces arrangements which minimize dissatification of the specified relationships.
 IMAGE, the computer design aid system described in this paper, has been developed to go beyond the single parameter approach, to operate on a more flexible set of form explicit criteria and to facilitate its interaction with the designer's own process.
