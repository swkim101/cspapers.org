Numerous CS faculty have demonstrated the benefits of using version control in courses other than software engineering. However, they maintained their own servers, and to the best of our knowledge, none published experiences with version control in CS1 courses for non-CS engineering majors. As a result, even faculty experienced with version control may hesitate to adopt it in some classes, fearing that it is too difficult, time consuming or distracting. In this paper, we describe how we adopted version control in a CS1 course for non-CS engineering majors, and how software hosting services facilitated its use. Our experience indicates that undergraduate engineering majors in CS courses can gain competence in version control, and software hosting services simplify class administration.
