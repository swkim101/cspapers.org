Systems composed of many identical processes can sometimes be verified inductively using a network invariant, but systems whose component processes vary in some systematic way are not amenable to direct application of that method. We describe how variations in behavior can be "factored out" into additional processes, thus enabling induction over the number of processes. The process is semi-automatic: The designer must choose from among a set of idiomatic transformations, but each transformation is applied and checked automatically.
