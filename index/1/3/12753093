Users of mobile computers will soon have online access to a large number of databases via wireless networks. Because of limited bandwidth, wireless communication is more expensive than wire communication. In this paper we present and analyze various static and dynamic data allocation methods. The objective is to optimize the communication cost between a mobile computer and the stationary computer that stores the online database. Analysis is performed in two cost models. One is connection (or time) based, as in cellular telephones, where the user is charged per minute of connection. The other is message based, as in packet radio networks, where the user is charged per message. Our analysis addresses both, the average case and the worst case for determining the best allocation method.
