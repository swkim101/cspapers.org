In this paper we describe the evolution of a whole-hand interface to our virtual-environment graphical system. We present a set of abstractions that can be used to implement device-independent interfaces for hand measurement devices. Some of these abstractions correspond to known logical device abstractions, while others take further advantage of the richness of expression in the human hand. We describe these abstractions in the context of their use in our development of virtual environments.
