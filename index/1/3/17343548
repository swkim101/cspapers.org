The complex sentences of news wire reports contain floating content units that appear to be opportunistically placed where the form of the surrounding text allows. We present a corpus analysis that identified precise semantic and syntactic constraints on where and how such information is realized. The result is a set of revision tools that form the rule base for a report generation system, allowing incremental generation of complex sentences.
