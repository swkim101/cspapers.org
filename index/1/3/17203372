In this paper, we employ augmented reality to create digital artworks to present interactive poem. This work is established where the digital poem is generated via the interaction between a video film and a text-based poem. We use triangulation evaluation method that includes questionnaires, observation and interviews. The research result proves that the evaluation has positive usability and audiences enjoy the interaction with artworks and audiences accepted this kind of artworks. From the process of evaluation, the audience can interact with AR digital poem and therefore we can receive ideas of them. Moreover, they give the feedback to the future development of the research.
