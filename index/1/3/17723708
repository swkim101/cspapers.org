This paper describes an attempt to integrate the collection and the efficient utilisation of measurements in the development and the use of programs. The work presented consists in three parts:
 - the design of both static and dynamic measurement tools,
 - examples of data processing on measurements collected on a sample of Pascal programs,
 - the design of a quantitative documentation of a program, which is automatically built as measurements are collected.
 The first and third steps have been developed inside an existing programming environment, Mentor, and we shall discuss the advantages we found in integrating the tools in such an environment.
