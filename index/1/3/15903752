We address the problem of data auditing that asks for an audit trail of all users and queries that potentially breached information about sensitive data. A lot of the previous work in data auditing has focused on providing strong privacy guarantees and studied the class of queries that can be audited efficiently while retaining the guarantees. In this paper, we approach data auditing from a different perspective. Our goal is to design an auditing system for arbitrary SQL queries containing constructs such as grouping, aggregation and correlated subqueries. Pivoted on the ability to feasibly address arbitrary queries, we study (1)~what privacy guarantees we can expect, and (2)~how we can efficiently perform auditing.
