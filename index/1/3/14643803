Data clustering has attracted a lot of research attention in the field of computational statistics and data mining. In most related studies, the dissimilarity between two clusters is defined as the distance between their centroids, or the distance between two closest (or farthest) data points. However, all of these measurements are vulnerable to outliers, and removing the outliers precisely is yet another difficult task. In view of this, we propose a new similarity measurement referred to as cohesion, to measure the inter-cluster distances. By using this new measurement of cohesion, we design a two-phase clustering algorithm, called cohesion-based self-merging (abbreviated as CSM), which runs in linear time to the size of input data set. Combining the features of partitional and hierarchical clustering methods, algorithm CSM partitions the input data set into several small subclusters in the first phase, and then continuously merges the subclusters based on cohesion in a hierarchical manner in the second phase. As shown by our performance studies, the cohesion-based clustering is very robust and possesses the excellent tolerance to outliers in various workloads. More importantly, algorithm CSM is shown to be able to cluster the data sets of arbitrary shapes very efficiently, and provide better clustering results than those by prior methods.Index Terms: Data mining, data clustering, hierarchical clustering, partitional clustering
