With the rapid development of wireless communication technologies and mobile devices, the mobile peer to peer (MP2P) network has been emerged. Since the existing MP2P architectures have high management cost, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical MP2P architecture using clustering mobile peers. The proposed method clusters the mobile peers by considering three aspects like the maximum connection time, the minimum hop count and the number of the connected peers. The connection times between the connected peers can be determined by the location, velocity vector and communication range of the mobile peers. Since the maximum connection time of the connected peers are considered, the network topology is relatively stable. Therefore, the management cost of the network is decreased and the success rate of contents search is increased. Experiments have shown that our proposed method outperforms the existing schemes.
