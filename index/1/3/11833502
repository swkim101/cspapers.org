This paper presents a new programming method, called the data transform programming method. In particular, we present a specialization of data transform programming to deal with file processing applications. Direct comparison is made with Jackson's approach1 by the presentation of uniform solutions to problems that cannot be solved through his basic method. The new method consists of the application of data transformations to the abstract problem statement, following the formal notions of problem reduction and problem decomposition. Data transformations are expressed in programming terms through a basic set of data type constructors.
