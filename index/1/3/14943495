One of the tasks of MULTIBASE, a system for integrated access to heterogeneous distributed databases, is to present a high-level query interface to navigational systems such as CODASYL. The interface compiles queries into efficient programs that implement the queries. The principal problem in constructing such an interface is access path optimization, i.e., the selection of an optimal sequence of access paths that must be traversed to process a given query. This paper identifies a class of queries for which efficient programs can be synthesized. It characterizes the strategies for processing a given query, and shows how to synthesize a program for implementing each strategy. It develops a model for estimating the cost of executing a program, and uses this model to find the optimal strategy for processing a given query.
