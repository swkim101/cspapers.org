The following paper presents a local heterogeneous network, the HMINET. The adopted software architecture identifies a data access and transfer level. The higher level applications afford a mechanism for data access and transfer to alleviate the effects of the incompatibilities and the differences between the data management systems. The paper describes the major problems and design decisions we adopted for the Data Access and Transfer System (DATS).
