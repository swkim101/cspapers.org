Â© 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics. Wizard-of-Oz experimental setup in a dialogue system is commonly used to gather data for informing an automated version of that system. Previous work has exposed dependencies between user behavior towards systems and user belief about whether the system is automated or human-controlled. This work examines whether user behavior changes when user belief is held constant and the system's operator is varied. We perform a posthoc experiment using generalizable prosodic and lexical features of user responses to a dialogue system backed with and without a human wizard. Our results suggest that user responses are different when communicating with a wizarded and an automated system, indicating that wizard data may be less reliable for informing automated systems than generally assumed.
