Analysis of difficulties in transferring expert systems technology into the financial industry applications suggests that speed-up of the prototyping phase can significantly reduce the cost and length of the entire development process. We suggest a prototype concept that is generic for certain types of financial applications and can serve as both a catalyst for the knowledge engineering process and a laboratory for knowledge gathering, validation and maintenance. We developed software tools to provide a framework for rapid prototyping by financial professionals with basic computer training.
