Document-centric XML is a mixture of text and structure. With the increased availability of document-centric XML content comes a need for query facilities in which both structural constraints and constraints on the content of the documents can be expressed. How does the expressiveness of languages for querying XML documents help users to express their information needs? We address this question from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. Our experimental analysis compares a structure-ignorant with a structure-aware retrieval approach using the test-suite of the 2004 edition of the INEX XML retrieval evaluation initiative. Theoretically, we create mathematical models of users' knowledge of a set of documents and define query languages which exactly fit these models. One of these languages corresponds to an XML version of fielded search, the other to the INEX query language. Our main findings are: First, while structure is used in varying degrees of complexity, over half of the queries can be expressed in a fielded-search like format which does not use the hierarchical structure of the documents. Second, structure is used as a search hint, and not a strict requirement, when judged against the underlying information need. Third, the use of structure in queries functions as a precision enhancing device.
