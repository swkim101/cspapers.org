Although many cooking recipes have been shared in the world, there are still many homemade meals that are never written down as recipes. The difficulty to create recipes of such homemade meals lies on (1) experienced cookers might not have accurate information of ingredients (e.g., weight and timing) since they often decide the amount of ingredients just by intuition, (2) they often have trouble to record such accurate information while cooking. To solve these problems, we propose a smart cutting board, CookTab, which allows a user to easily record his/her cooking activities (e.g., the names and quantities of ingredients) while provides real-time feedback to motivate him/her.
