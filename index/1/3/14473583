To solve a problem of how to evaluate computer-produced summaries, a number of automatic and manual methods have been proposed. Manual methods evaluate summaries correctly, because humans evaluate them, but are costly. On the other hand, automatic methods, which use evaluation tools or programs, are low cost, although these methods cannot evaluate summaries as accurately as manual methods. In this paper, we investigate an automatic evaluation method that can reduce the errors of traditional automatic methods by using several evaluation results obtained manually. We conducted some experiments using the data of the Text Summarization Challenge 2 (TSC-2). A comparison with conventional automatic methods shows that our method outperforms other methods usually used.
