We present Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) as a context for computing education. GEOINT is a rich source of ideas for programming projects, algorithm design and use of databases. Students are interested in GEOINT due to its inherently visual subject matter and its strong ties with crime, espionage and social changes and upheavals. In short we are motivating computation as a subject that can provide solutions and insights into crime mysteries and complex events that unfold over time and space. In addition to keeping Computer Science majors interested, we also seek to attract students of other disciplines into computing. GEOINT and computing knowledge can provide initial preparation for certain jobs that are in demand and also for graduate school. Our assignments and programming projects that are inspired by GEOINT can be used in an introductory programming course or a more advanced course. These materials derive from well known case studies and also fundamentals concepts in computing. Some programming projects are based on exploration of chronologies and timelines as tools that enable the geographical display of information as an order sequence of events. In general these geospatial displays can correlate information to help correct for possible gaps and inconsistencies in knowledge. These materials use multiple layered techniques of presenting information that use time, geographical location, weather conditions and static features of the earth's surface.
