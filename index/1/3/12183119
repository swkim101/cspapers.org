In this paper, we describe a scaffolding technique - pre-programming-analysis guided programming (PAGP) - developed to help students grasp basic programming concepts. Two different ways to implement the PAGP process in a classroom were developed and then compared: one for students to fill out an analysis form, and the other for students to interact with online cognitive tutors. Our results show that the PAGP process helps students learn better and faster, especially with the assistance of the online tutors.
