The use of flexible cable-driven systems is common in medicine (endoscope, catheter...). Their flexiblity allows surgeons to reach internal organs through sinuous and constrained ways. Unfortunately these systems are subject to backlash due to their internal mechanism. These non linearities raise many difficulties when robotizing and controlling such systems. In this article we propose an approach to improve the cartesian control of a four ways flexible endoscopic system with strong and unknown backlash-like non linearities. The method is based on an automatic off-line hystereses learning. We show that, despite coupling between degrees of freedom, it is possible to extract information from the hystereses which allow to improve cartesian control. Experiments on a real endoscopic system show the validity and the interest of the approach.
