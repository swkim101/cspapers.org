Information Retrieval in technical domains like physics is characterised by long and precise queries, whose meaning is strongly influenced by term context and domain. We treat this as a disambiguation problem, and present initial findings of a retrieval model that posits a higher probability of relevance for documents matching disambiguated query terms. Preliminary evaluation on a real-life physics test collection shows promising performance improvement.
