In this paper we describe how high quality transaction data comprising of online searching, product viewing, and product buying activity of a large online community can be used to infer semantic relationships between queries. We work with a large scale query log consisting of around 115 million queries from eBay. We discuss various techniques to infer semantic relationships among queries and show how the results from these methods can be combined to measure the strength and depict the kinds of relationships. Further, we show how this extraction of relations can be used to improve search relevance, related query recommendations, and recovery from null results in an eCommerce context.
