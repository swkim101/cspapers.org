We present an algorithm, analysis, and implementation of a six-channel range and bearing system for swarm robot systems with sizes in the order of centimeters. The proposed approach relies on a custom sensor and receiver model, and collection of intensity signals from all possible sensor/emitter pairs. This allows us to improve range calculation by accounting for orientation-dependent variations in the transmitted intensity, as well as to determine the orientation of the emitting robot. We show how the algorithm and analysis generalize to other range and bearing systems, and evaluate its performance experimentally using two ping-pong ball-sized “Droplets” mounted on a precise gantry system.
