The best teacher is experience. It is one thing to lecture in front of a group of students about the design process. l%is, at best, results in a passive experience for the student. By providing a laboratory format where a student must actively participate, a greater insight and understanding of the design process can be achieved. In the Computer Science and Engineering program at The University of Toledo, students encounter a balanced exposure to both computer science and computer engineering. As part of their curricuhun, students take courses that cover the various software concepts stressedin a Computer Science program end the hardware cancepts emphasized in a Computer Engineering program. Whh the addition of other courses characteristic of an engineering degree program, graduates of this program acquire a strong knowledge of the enghmring design process, and are adept in both the hardware and software aspects of computing. The culmination of the studentâ€™s hardware and soflxwue experiences is treated by the Microcomputer Systems I course [1], which is requid of all students in the program. This capstone course brings together the computer science and computer engineering elements of the program and applies them to the design and development of a small-scale microcomputer system. This system, based on the Intel 80186 microprocessor, is constructed by the students through a series of laboratory experiments that take them through the major steps of the design and development process. Along the way, students are exposed to tools such as emulators, test instruments, and cross-assemblers. The one place where this course is lacking is in the aspect of creativity. The students are given the problem and are led to the solution. In the real world the problem must be &tied and a solution must be derived in accordance with feasibility and system specification constraints. To tidy
