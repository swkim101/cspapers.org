The increasing availability of cloud computing allows more and more mobile devices to outsource expensive computations. Among these computations, bilinear pairing is very fundamental and frequently-used by many modern cryptographic protocols. Currently, the most efficient outsourcing algorithm of bilinear pairings requires about 5 point additions in G1 and G2 and 4 multiplications in GT under the one-malicious version of a two-untrusted-program assumption. And the result of the algorithm is checkable with a probability about 1/2. In this paper, we improve the state-of-the-art by proposing two new outsourcing algorithms for bilinear pairings. One is a more efficient outsourcing algorithm under the same assumption with the same checkability. The other is more flexible under a two-untrusted-program assumption with improved checkability. Both algorithms are better suited to various applications where on-line computations are strictly limited due to the lack of available computing resources.
