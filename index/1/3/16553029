Focused crawling is a critical technique for topical resource discovery on the Web. We propose a new frontier prioritizing algorithm, namely, the OTIE (On-line Topical Importance Estimation) algorithm, which efficiently and effectively combines link-based and content-based analysis to evaluate the priority of an uncrawled URL in the frontier. We then demonstrate OTIE's advantages over traditional prioritizing algorithms by real crawling experiments.
