Real-time tracking of human body motion has applications in tele-operation, synthetic reality and others. A motion tracking system based on use of the MARG sensors has been under development at Naval Postgraduate School and Miami University. The magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensor modules use a combination of three orthogonal magnetometers, three orthogonal angular rate sensors, and three orthogonal accelerometers to measure 3-D orientation of individual limb segments in order to determine posture. This paper presents the latest results of the MARG human body motion tracking system. The design and implementation of a control interface unit (CIU), a real-time 3-D human avatar called "Andy", and a concurrent client-server program are discussed. Experimental testing and evaluation of the overall MARG system is also presented. The system is able to track multiple human limbs in real time. The captured human motion data can be visualized over the Internet by multiple clients using the 3-D avatar.
