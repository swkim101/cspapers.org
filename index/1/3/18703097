Unmanned rescue, observation and/or research vehicles with high terrain adaptability, fast velocity and high reliability to reach difficult rough terrain locations are still demanded, but most vehicles increase rough terrain adapt ability at the expense of low velocity and/or complex mechanisms. We propose a novel vehicle consisting of a very simple blade-type crawler and active antennas with rollers, resembling a wharf roach. This configuration assures stable travelling over uneven terrain at high-speeds, with a very simple and reliable mechanism. This article presents the basic concept, mechanical design of the crawler and the antennas, and the basic motion control strategies. Moreover, we built and tested the first small mechanical prototype named KEIOS-I, and got successful results from experiments on uneven terrain at a high-speed traveling, and also lateral travelling and jumping motions. Future work will also implement roller skating mode using the active antennas equipped with rollers.
