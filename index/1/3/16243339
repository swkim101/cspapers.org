The design of the Molecule-Atom Data model, aimed at the effective support of engineering applications, is justified and described with its essential properties and features. MAD offers direct and symmetric management of network structures and recursiveness, dynamic object definition and object handling allowing for both vertical and horizontal access. Its prototype implementation PRIMA is discussed using a multi-level model for the DBMS architecture. Our DBMS kernel provides a variety of access path structures, tuning mechanisms, and performance enhancements transparent at the data model interface. PRIMA is assumed to be used in different run-time environments including workstation coupling and multi-processor systems. In particular, it serves as a research vehicle to investigate the exploitation of ‘semantic parallelism’ in single user operations.
