In addition to our structured Tower workshops around the world, the system has been used successfully to meet specific technical challenges that have arisen in various contexts related to ongoing work at the MIT Media Lab. Recently, as part of the Media Lab Asia / Center for Bits and Atoms outreach initiative, Professor Isaac Chuang accompanied by Amy Sun of Lockheed Martin travelled to Vigyan Ashram, a small educational setting just outside the village of Pabal, in Maharashtra, India. There were two primary goals to the trip: to teach an introductory electronics workshop to local villagers, and also to show them how they can use technology such as the Tower system to solve engineering challenges that arise in the context of their lives.
