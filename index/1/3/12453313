With the advent of overlay and peer-to-peer networks, Grid computing, and CDNs, network performance prediction becomes an essential task. Such predictions are used in path selection schemes for overlay and multihomed networks, dynamic server selection, and peer-to-peer parallel downloads. In this work, we focus on the throughput prediction of a bulk TCP transfer (”target flow”) in a particular network path, prior to starting that flow. We first classify the existing prediction techniques into two categories: Formula-Based (FB) and History-Based (HB). Within each class, we develop representative prediction algorithms that we evaluate empirically over the RON testbed. Our goal is to examine the key issues with each prediction category, evaluate their accuracy under different conditions, and provide insight regarding the factors that affect the predictability of TCP throughput.
