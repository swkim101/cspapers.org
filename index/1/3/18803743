The Department of Defense is engaged in a number of management initiatives to improve the cost and quality of Defense software systems. A new DoD Directive 5000.29 provides guidelines for management and technology to promote software engineering in the DoD. A major Defense-wide initiative is a thrust toward common programming languages. An HOL Working Group has set unified requirements for DoD languages and in evaluating existing languages against these requirements. Interim common languages are being set. The eventual goal is a minimal number of common high order programming languages for Defense systems. These will be provided with rigorous control and extensive support facilities.
