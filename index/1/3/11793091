An approach is described whereby one may, with the help of a computer, perform micro-analyses of programs by constructing their time-formulas. Time-formulas are symbolic formulas which express execution times as functions of variables representing the time needed to perform common, elementary operations (e.g., addition, assignment, subscripting, loop overhead). By binding the variables to numeric values corresponding to a specific machine, one can estimate program execution times without resorting to empirical tests. Some programs which have been analyzed using the suggested approach are reviewed in this paper. These include Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm, deterministic parsers and a certain class of straight-line programs. The software tools which are desirable for performing the suggested type of analysis are also discussed. Finally, the paper outlines some of the related research problems which are worth investigating.
