Abstract
Wireless link losses result in poor TCP throughput since losses are perceived as congestion by TCP, resulting in source throttling. In order to mitigate this effect, 3G wireless link designers have augmented their system with extensive local retransmission mechanisms. In addition, in order to increase throughput, intelligent channel state based scheduling have also been introduced. While these mechanisms have reduced the impact of losses on TCP throughput and improved the channel utilization, these gains have come at the expense of increased delay and rate variability. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the impact of variable rate and variable delay on long-lived TCP performance. We propose a model to explain and predict TCPâ€™s throughput over a link with variable rate and/or delay. We also propose a network-based solution called Ack Regulator that mitigates the effect of variable rate and/or delay without significantly increasing the round trip time, while improving TCP performance by up to 100%.
