Evaluating SPARQL queries with the DISTINCT clause may become memory intensive due to the requirement of additional auxiliary data structures, like hash-maps, to discard the duplicates. DISTINCT queries make up to 16% of all the queries (e.g., DBPedia), and thus are non-negligible. In this poster we propose a novel method for such queries, by just manipulating the compressed bit-vector indexes called BitMats, for acyclic basic graph pattern (BGP) queries.
