Tree Unification Grammar is a declarative unification-based linguistic framework. The basic grammar structures of this framework are partial descriptions of trees, and the framework requires only a single grammar rule to combine these partial descriptions. Using this framework, constraints associated with various linguistic phenomena (reflexivisation in particular) can be stated succinctly in the lexicon.
