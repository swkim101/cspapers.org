Frequent sequential pattern mining is a central task in many fields such as biology and finance. However, release of these patterns is raising increasing concerns on individual privacy. In this paper, we study the sequential pattern mining problem under the differential privacy framework which provides formal and provable guarantees of privacy. Due to the nature of the differential privacy mechanism which perturbs the frequency results with noise, and the high dimensionality of the pattern space, this mining problem is particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a novel two-phase algorithm for mining both prefixes and substring patterns. In the first phase, our approach takes advantage of the statistical properties of the data to construct a model-based prefix tree which is used to mine prefixes and a candidate set of substring patterns. The frequency of the substring patterns is further refined in the successive phase where we employ a novel transformation of the original data to reduce the perturbation noise. Extensive experiment results using real datasets showed that our approach is effective for mining both substring and prefix patterns in comparison to the state-of-the-art solutions.
