Selective families, a weaker variant of superimposed codes [KS64, F92, 197, CR96], have been recently used to design Deterministic Distributed Broadcast (DDB) protocols for unknown radio networks (a radio network is said to be unknown when the nodes know nothing about the network but their own label) [CGGPR00, CGOR00].
We first provide a general almost tight lower bound on the size of selective families. Then, by reverting the selective families - DDB protocols connection, we exploit our lower bound to construct a family of “hard” radio networks (i.e. directed graphs). These networks yield an &OHgr;(n log D) lower bound on the completion time of DDB protocols that is superlinear (in the size n of the network) even for very small maximum eccentricity D of the network, while all the previous lower bounds (e.g. &OHgr;(D log n) [CGGPR00]) are superlinear only when D is almost linear.
On the other hand, the previous upper bounds are all superlinear in n independently of the eccentricity D and the maximum in-degree d of the network. We introduce a broadcast technique that exploits selective families in a new way. Then, by combining selective families of almost optimal size with our new broadcast technique, we obtain an &Ogr;(Dd log3 n) upper bound that we prove to be almost optimal when d = &Ogr;(n/D). This exponentially improves over the best known upper bound [CGR00) when D, d = &Ogr;(polylogn). Furthermore, by comparing our deterministic upper bound with the best known randomized one [BGI87] we obtain a new, rather surprising insight into the real gap between deterministic and randomized protocols. It turns out that this gap is exponential (as discovered in [BGI87]), but only when the network has large maximum in-degree (i.e. d = &OHgr;(na), for some constant a > O).
We then look at the multibroadcast problem on unknown radio networks. A similar connection to that between selective families and (single) broadcast also holds between superimposed codes and multibroadcast. We in fact combine a variant of our (single) broadcast technique with superimposed codes of almost optimal size available in literature [EFF85, HS87, I97, CHI99]. This yields a multibroadcast protocol having completion time &Ogr;(Dd2 log3 n). Finally, in order to determine the limits of our multibroadcast technique, we generalize (and improve) the best known lower bound [CR96] on the size of superimposed codes.
