In this paper, we address the problem of finding organized thin structures in three-dimensional (3-D) data. Linear and planar structures segmentation received much attention but thin structures organized in complex patterns remain a challenge for segmentation algorithms. We are interested especially in the problems posed by repetitive and symmetric structures acquired with a laser range finder. The method relies on 3-D data projections along specific directions and 2-D histograms comparison. The sensitivity of the classification algorithm to the parameter settings is evaluated and a segmentation method proposed. We illustrate our approach with data from a concertina wire in terrain with vegetation.
