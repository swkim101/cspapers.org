In this paper we consider representations for use in models of the processing that occurs between the eardrum and our conscious experience of sound. We first list “good” properties for such mid-level representations, then present a framework within which to discuss some examples. We compare in detail two popular schemes — sinusoid tracks and correlograms — and propose a new representation, wefts, which seeks to combine their advantages.
