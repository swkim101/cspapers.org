Although fall is a rare event in the life of a humanoid robot, we must be prepared for it because its consequences are serious. In this paper we present a fall strategy which rapidly modifies the robot's fall direction in order to avoid hitting a person or an object in the vicinity. Our approach is based on the key observation that during “toppling” the rotational motion of a robot necessarily occurs at the leading edge or the leading corner of its support base polygon. To modify the fall direction the robot needs to change the position and orientation of this edge or corner vis-a-vis the prohibited direction. We achieve it through intelligent stepping as soon as a fall is detected. We compute the optimal stepping location which results in the safest fall. Additional improvement to the fall controller is achieved through inertia shaping techniques aimed at controlling the centroidal inertia of the robot. We demonstrate our results through the simulation of an Asimo-like humanoid robot. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a controller that attempts to change the fall direction of a humanoid robot.
