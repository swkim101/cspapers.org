Combinatorial approaches to testing are used in several fields, and have recently gained momentum in the field of software testing through software interaction testing. One-test-at-a-time greedy algorithms are used to automatically construct such test suites. This paper discusses basic criteria of why greedy algorithms have been appropriate for this test generation problem in the past and then expands upon how greedy algorithms can be utilized to address test suite prioritization.
