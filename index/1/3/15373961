This paper presents the manipulator with the new joint which can passively switch free state to drive state and vice versa. The manipulator with the free-state joint is categorized as a system subjected to a nonholonomic constraint; hence, its smooth feedback control cannot be implemented. In this paper, the issues on its control are clarified through the test with the experimental setup of the manipulator with a free joint. The manipulator with the switching joint is also developed and its effectiveness is verified through the experiment. Consequently, the trivial actuation using the proposed joint accomplishes more precise positioning in the experiment.
