The goal of this work is to study the application of switchable magnets (SM) for climbing robots. A switchable magnet is a device which uses moving permanent magnets to change the magnetic flux path and switch on or off the magnetic attraction force. In our work we used Comsol Multiphysics, a physics simulation software in order to simulate the flow of the magnetic flux on switchable magnets on its different states and study the effect of different design and material parameters on the attraction force of the unit. Bearing in mind the lessons learned from this study, we developed a novel device in a smaller scale with the best holding force/mass ratio, for using in climbing robot applications. As a case study, three of these optimized SM units are then equipped with an actuator that can rotate the moving magnets, turning the device on and off. This new device is employed in a novel adaptive adhesion unit for the OmniClimber robot, replacing its previous system which was relying on electromagnets magnets. We demonstrate this novel device application on a climbing robot and the advantages relative to electromagnet or permanent magnet based devices.
