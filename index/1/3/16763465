Our work builds upon previous research on software product lines and formal analysis of feature diagrams carried out since several years at the University of Namur. This PhD thesis aims at evaluating and improving existing feature-based configuration techniques to ease their uptake by practitioners and their integration into the software product line engineering process. The affordability and scalability of the delivered languages, methods and tools are major concerns. Evaluation will take place in the context of an open source development project.
