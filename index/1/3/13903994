This paper presents a novel approach to achieving aerial pitch righting in a mobile robot, inspired by the draglines used by jumping spiders. We developed and simulated a mathematical model of the spider during the aerial phase of its jump to gain further insight into the factors affecting the pitch response. The results demonstrate that the dragline could also potentially function as a brake, slowing the spider down before landing. Subsequently, we developed a small robotic platform to demonstrate dragline-based aerial pitch righting on a robot experimentally. Lastly, the possible size and weight advantages over other pitch righting methods are discussed.
