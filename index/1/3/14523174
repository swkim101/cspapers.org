Most existing knowledge base (KB) embedding methods solely learn from time-unknown fact triples but neglect the temporal information in the knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a novel time-aware KB embedding approach taking advantage of the happening time of facts. Speciﬁcally, we use temporal order constraints to model transformation between time-sensitive relations and enforce the embeddings to be temporally consistent and more accurate. We empirically evaluate our approach in two tasks of link prediction and triple classiﬁcation. Experimental re-sults show that our method outperforms other baselines on the two tasks consistently.
