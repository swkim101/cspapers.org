Bluetooth information can efficiently capture characteristics of user-centric surrounding contexts, such as formal meeting or chatting with friends, shopping with friends or alone, etc. In this paper, we extract novel features from Bluetooth traces and use these features for recognizing contextual behavior as well as inferring continuous episode transition. Evaluation results show that extracted novel features are very effective, which enable the model to achieve an average of 87% accuracy for specific context classification and the ability of episode inference from real-life Bluetooth traces.
