The maturation of Computer System Performance Courses is briefly described giving excerpts from the two major ACM curriculum documents and providing a list of possible texts for such a course. It is then proposed that a course in performance evaluation contain a component on the role of performance work in the product life cycle. A prototype model for this is described in detail. The description includes the need for such work, who accomplishes it, what sort of interactions are necessary and appropriate, and what steps comprise integrating performance work into a product life cycle.
