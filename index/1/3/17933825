the principle and control method of torso orientation in dynamic biped walking is addressed. First, the role of torso motion in walking performance, especially at the landing moment, is investigated by using a simplified model. Second, a control strategy of torso orientation is proposed, including the algorithms in the push-off and the single support phases (SSP). Furthermore, the module of torso control is integrated into the control method of dynamic biped walking, which was proposed in our previous research. The paper ends with the simulation of a humanoid robot with 21 internal degrees of freedom (DOF), and shows the feasibility of the proposed method.
