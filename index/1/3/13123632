We consider problems such as selecting the <italic>k</italic>-th smallest of <italic>n</italic> numbers in as few comparisons as possible on average. <italic>n</italic> + <italic>k</italic> - 0(1) comparisons are proved to be necessary for this particular problem when <italic>k</italic> ≤ <italic>n</italic>/2. This shows a technique of Floyd and Rivest is essentially optimal. 7<italic>n</italic>/4 &equil; <italic>o(n)</italic> comparisons, on average, are shown to be necessary and sufficient to find the maximum and median of a set. An upper bound of 9<italic>n</italic>/4 + <italic>o(n)</italic> and a lower bound of 2<italic>n</italic> − <italic>o(n)</italic> are shown for the max-min-median problem.
