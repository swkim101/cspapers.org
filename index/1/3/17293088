The problem of inferring human behaviour is naturally complex: people interact with the environment and each other in many different ways, and dealing with the often incomplete and uncertain sensed data by which the actions are perceived only compounds the difficulty of the problem. In this paper, we propose a framework whereby these elaborate behaviours can be naturally simplified by decomposing them into smaller activities, whose temporal dependencies can be more efficiently represented via probabilistic hierarchical learning models. In this regard, patterns of a number of activities typically carried out by users of an ambulatory aid device have been identified with the aid of a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) framework. By decomposing the complex behaviours into multiple layers of abstraction the approach is shown capable of modelling and learning these tightly coupled human-machine interactions. The inference accuracy of the proposed model is proven to compare favourably against more traditional discriminative models, as well as other compatible generative strategies to provide a complete picture that highlights the benefits of the proposed approach, and opens the door to more intelligent assistance with a robotic mobility aid.
