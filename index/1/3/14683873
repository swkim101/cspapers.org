ARCADE is a research project in computer architecture. We first discuss its motivations and goals, wich are primarily the design of a dynamically adaptive system, and the use of performance evaluation methods as a design tool. The resulting system is intended to serve as a support for education in computer architecture and operating systems. Then, we present the overall structure of the system, and finally, we consider in more detail hardware tools that will be provided for the dynamic adaptation to varying load conditions.
