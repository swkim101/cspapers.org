This paper aims to provide a document analysis algorithm for the Iranian bank checks. The main idea is based on the connected component concept. The proposed algorithm uses the connected component properties to segment unconstrained Iranian bank checks and prepares those for OCR application. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, it has been tested on a set of 500 Iranian bank checks which collected from 8 types of Iranian bank checks. The algorithm has a good success on document restoration and segmentation. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm has 94.04% accuracy on segmentation of 5 fields of the Iranian bank checks.
