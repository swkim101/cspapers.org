Performance of modern computers is tied closely to the effective use of cache because of the continually increasing speed discrepancy between processors and main memory. Optimum system performance is achieved when software and hardware work symbiotically to increase performance. This work focuses on identifying locality in object-oriented systems and developing techniques for approaching optimum performance with respect to the memory hierarchy.
