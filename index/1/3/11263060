In this paper we adressed the problem of finding exciting trajectories for the identification of manipulator link inertia parameters. This can be formulated as a constraint nonlinear optimization problem. The new approach in the presented method is the parameterization of the trajectories with optimized B-splines. Experiments are carried out on a 7 joint Light-Weight robot with torque sensoring in each joint. Thus, unmodeled joint friction and noisy motor current measurements must not be taken into account. The estimated dynamic model is verified on a different validation trajectory. The results show a clear improvement of the estimated dynamic model compared to a CAD-valued model.
