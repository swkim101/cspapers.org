This contribution introduces a generic framework for sensor-based robot motion control. The key contribution is the introduction of an adaptive selection matrix for sensor-based hybrid switched-system control. The overall control system consists of multiple sensors and open- and closed-loop controllers, in-between which the adaptive selection matrix can switch discretely in order to supply command variables for low-level controllers of robotic manipulators. How control signals are chosen, is specified by Manipulation Primitives, which constitute the interface to higher-level programming. This programming paradigm is briefly specified in order to be able to define and execute sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motion commands simultaneously. The resulting control system is freely adaptable depending on the sensor and control requirements of the desired system and/or application.
