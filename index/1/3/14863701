This study examined ways to improve students' chances of success learning design concepts through the use of Object-Oriented Programming and Design (OOP&D) patterns by examining potentially effective ways to teach such patterns to novice programmers. Using hierarchical tree, complete-linkage analysis to survey a group of design experts, the study developed an order in which those experts believed thirty fundamental OOP&D patterns should be taught to optimize effective student learning. Once that basic order was identified, it became possible to divide the patterns into six sequential phases of patterns instruction to allow both maximal teaching and learning. Although the study did not present a conclusively effective approach for OOP&D teaching, it did provide information essential for future sequential phase patterns research.
