The article focuses on predicting trustworthiness from textual content of webpages. The recent work Olteanu et al. proposes a number of features (linguistic and social) to apply machine learning methods to recognize trust levels. We demonstrate that this approach can be substantially improved in two ways: by applying machine learning methods to vectors computed, using psychosocial and psycholinguistic features and in a high-dimensional bag-of-words paradigm of word occurrences. Following Olteanu et al., we test the methods in two classification settings, as a 2-class and 3-class scenario, and in a regression setting. In the 3-class scenario, the features compiled by Olteanu et al. achieve weighted precision of 0.63, while the methods proposed in our paper raise it to 0.66 and 0.70. We also examine coefficients of the models in order to discover words associated with low and high trust.
