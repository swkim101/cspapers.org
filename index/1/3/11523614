Currently object-oriented technology (OOT) plays only a minor role in the computer science curriculum at most universities. This is because the curriculum is already crowded and OOT is just one of many new topics competing for a place. This paper describes reasons for including OOT in the curriculum and strategies for doing so. The experiences of two universities which teach OOT are described. The first university emphasizes OOT, while the second offers only a single course on the subject.
