This paper analyzes measurements of paging activity from several different versions of UNIX. We set out to characterize paging activity by first taking measurements of it, and then writing programs to analyze it. In doing so, we were interested in answering several questions:1. What is the magnitude of paging traffic and how much of I/O system activity is paging related?2. What are the characteristics of paging activity, and how can paging system implementations be tuned to match them?3. How does paging activity vary across different machines, operating systems, and job mixes?4. How well does paging activity correlate with system load average and number of users?
