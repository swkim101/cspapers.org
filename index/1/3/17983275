Managing inconsistency in DL-Lite knowledge bases where the assertional base is prioritized is a crucial problem in many applications. This is especially true when the assertions are provided by multiple sources having different reliability levels. This paper first reviews existing approaches for selecting preferred repairs. It then focuses on suitable strategies for handling inconsistency in DL-Lite knowledge bases. It proposes new approaches based on the selection of only one preferred repair. These strategies have as a starting point the so-called nondefeated repair and add one of the following principles: deductive closure, consistency, cardinality and priorities. Lastly, we provide a comparative analysis followed by an experimental evaluation of the studied approaches.
