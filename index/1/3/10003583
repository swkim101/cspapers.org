Complex object types are defined as relation domains encapsulated within methods written in LISP or C. User-defined domains may be &scribed using a “IS-A” hierarchy, which makes possible the inheritance of methoak among domains. The domain methods are directly used in the external data manipulation language, which is an extended version of SQL with object orientedfeatures (i.e., structured complex objects, methods and inheritance). When executing a query, the system selects the correct methods to apply on complex objects according to all parameter types given in method calls. With the specific LISP interpreter embedded in the DBMS, errors in functions on complex objects are detected at run time. Thus, the DBMS is protected from errors arising in user programs. Methods can also be programmed in C code and dynamically loaded when C programs are referenced in queries. Relations can be clustered according to the result of user-defined methods applied to basic or user-defined domains. Graphical interface procedures are available to input and display non-standard data. A fully running version of the system is commercially available for SUN UNIX workstations.
