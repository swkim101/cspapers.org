When the schema of an object-oriented database system is modified, the database needs to be changed in such a way that the schema and the database remain consistent with each other. This paper describes the algorithm implemented in the new forthcoming release of the 02 object database for automatically bringing the database to a consistent state after a schema update has been performed. The algorithm, which uses a deferred strategy to update the database, is a revised and extended version of the screening algorithm first sketched in [7].
