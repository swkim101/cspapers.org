We present a novel bio-inspired dynamic climbing robot, with a recursive name: ROCR is an Oscillating Climbing Robot. ROCR is a pendular two-link, serial chain robot that utilizes alternating hand-holds and an actuated tail to propel itself upward in a climbing style based on observation of human climbers and brachiating gibbons. ROCR's bio-inspired oscillating climbing strategy is simple and efficient. This robot is intended for autonomous surveillance and inspection on sheer vertical surfaces. Potential locomotion gait strategies were investigated in simulation using Working Model 2D. Strategy comparisons were drawn on a basis of climbing rate and energy efficiency. Simulation results show the feasibility and relative merits of these climbing gait strategies and compare them to the potential energy gained while climbing. A first generation ROCR design, having physical parameters based on simulation analysis, that utilizes actuated permanent magnet grippers and a geared-motor actuated tail was fabricated. Magnetic grippers are used for this initial prototype to facilitate investigating the robots climbing efficiency. Several climbing gaits which showed promise in simulation were implemented in the prototype. ROCR is a lightweight, flexible, self-contained robot with onboard microcontroller, tilt and acceleration sensing, power supply and wireless communication. We conclude with plans to evolve the simulation and design of the robot and plans for testing the prototype.
