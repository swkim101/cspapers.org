Welcome to Onward! 2010. This year, we are delighted to bring you another environmentally focused Panel called " Software for a Sustainable World. " Last year at Onward we heard a panel discuss " Why is Software not yet Green? " This year, the Onward Green Panel will focus on Software Systems that support sustainability â€“ e.g. Systems that helps us reduce energy consumption, or manages energy output, or gives us better data on consumption. We will explore how Smart Grids can impact us, how we can make saving energy easier and less intrusive, and other tools for large enterprise business or the home consumer. Perhaps, " software is not yet green " , but we can create software to produce a more sustainable future. We look forward to seeing you at the Panel for this very important and timely discussion.
