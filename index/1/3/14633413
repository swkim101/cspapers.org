A method based on differential geometric control theory is presented with the intention to provide insight into how the nodes of a power network can affect each other. We consider a simple model of a power system derived from singular perturbation of the power flow equations. The accessibility properties of the model are investigated, and it is shown that for a simple model with chain topology the network is actually feedback linearizable. The results are illustrated using input/output linearization in a standard IEEE test system with 118 busses.
