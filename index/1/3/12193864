The kinematics of a robotic manipulator defines the geometric relationships between its elements. The synthesis of the kinematical model for this type of robots is presented in this work using the Conformal Geometric Algebra approach. Moreover, two error feedback controllers, one for the position tracking problem and another for the orientation tracking problem, are developed using the same framework. The stability analysis is obtained for both controllers, and their application to a robotic system, composed of a serial manipulator of 5 DOF and a robotic head of 2 DOF, is presented via simulation.
