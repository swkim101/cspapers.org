We present a new approach to designing data structures for the important problem of externalmemory range searching in two and three dimensions. We construct data structures for answering range queries in O ( (log log log~ N) logB N + K/B) 1/0 operations, where N is the number of points in the data structure, B is the 1/0 block size, and K is the number of points in the answer to the query. We base our data structures on the novel concept of B-approximate boundaries, which are manifolds that partition space into regions based on the output size of queries at points within the space. Our data structures answer a longstanding open problem by providing three dimensional results comparable to those provided by [8, 10] for the two dimensional case, though completely new techniques are used. Ours is the first 3-D range search data structure that simultaneously achieves both a base-B logarithmic search overhead (namely, (log log log~ N) logB N) and a fully blocked output component (namely, K/B).
