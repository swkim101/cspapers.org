Abstract We consider Las Vegas randomized dynamic algorithms for on-line connectivity problems with deletions only. In particular, we show that starting from a graph with m edges and n nodes, we can maintain a spanning forest during m deletions in O ( m  log( n 2 / m ) + n(log  n ) 3 (log log  n ) 2 ) expected time, which is O ( m ) if m  = Θ( n 2 ) and O ( m  log  n ) if m  = Ω( n (log  n  log log  n ) 2 ). The deletions may be interspersed with connectivity queries, each of which is answered in constant time. The previous best bound was O ( m  log 2 n ) by Henzinger and Thorup which covered both insertions and deletions. The result is based on a general randomized reduction for edge connectivity problems of many deletions-only queries to a few deletions and insertions queries. For 2-edge connectivity, the complexity is improved from O ( m (log  n ) 5 ) to O ( m  log( n 2 / m ) +  n (log  n ) 6 (log log  n ) 2 ). For the general decremental k -edge-connectivity problem, we get a total running time of O ( k 2 n 2  polylog  n ). Here the previous best bound was O ( kmn  polylog  n ). Improved running times are also achieved for the static consensus tree problem, with applications to computational biology and relational data bases.
