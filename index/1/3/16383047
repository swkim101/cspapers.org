In this paper, we describe an automatic real-time quality assurance system QART (pronounced cart) for contact center chats. QART performs multi-faceted analysis on dialogue utterances, as they happen, using sophisticated statistical and rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It covers various aspects inspired by today's Quality Assurance and Customer Satisfaction Scoring(C-Sat) practices as well as introduces novel components such as incremental dialogue summarization capability. QART front-end is an interactive dashboard providing views of ongoing dialogues at different granularity, enabling contact center supervisors to monitor and take corrective actions as needed. It is developed on state of the art stream computing platform Apache Spark Streaming with HBase datastore and Python Flask front end.
