User-oriented clustering schemes enable the classification of documents based upon the user perception of the similarity between documents, rather than on some similarity function presumed by the designer to represent the user criteria. In this paper, an enhancement of such a clustering scheme is presented. This is accomplished by the formulation of the user-oriented clustering as a function-optimization problem. The problem formulated is termed the Boundary Selection Problem (BSP). Heuristic approaches to solve the BSP are proposed and a preliminary for evaluation of these approaches is provided.
