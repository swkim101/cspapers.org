Sensitive (private) information can escape from one app to another using one of the multiple communication methods provided by Android for inter-app communication. This leakage can be malicious. In such a scenario, individual benign app, in collusion with other conspiring apps, if present, can leak the private information. In this work in progress, we present, a new model-checking based approach for inter-app collusion detection. The proposed technique takes into account simultaneous analysis of multiple apps. We are able to identify any set of conspiring apps involved in the collusion. To evaluate the efficacy of our tool, we developed Android apps that exhibit collusion through inter-app communication. Eight demonstrative sets of apps have been contributed to widely used test dataset named DroidBench. Our experiments show that proposed technique can accurately detect the presence/absence of collusion among apps. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal has improved detection capability than other techniques.
