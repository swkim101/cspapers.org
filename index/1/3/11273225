We describe the IBM Power 775, a supercomputing system that was designed to provide high performance at very large scales. The system recently attained world record performance numbers for three important, communication-heavy supercomputing benchmarks: RandomAccess, PTRANS, and Global FFT (while the Power 775 currently holds the number two spot in Global FFT, its efficiency when computing the FFT exceeds that of the number one system's by over 3.5 times). At the heart of the Power 775's performance is the "hub module", which is a high-radix router containing forty-seven copper and optical links with a switching capacity of over 1.1 Tbyte/second. This level of bandwidth is unprecedented for typical systems of the scale we discuss in this paper. As a result, we were forced to develop a complete software stack to fully leverage the communication capabilities of the system. In this paper we evaluate the Power 775 server at scales up to 2 Petaflops (63,360 POWER7 cores), discuss hardware and software tradeoffs considered during the design process, and finally present some lessons learned.
