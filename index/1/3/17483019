This paper proposes twisted data layout as a novel and efficient data layout technique for distributed memory parallel processors (DMPP). Data layout is an important aspect in efficiently executing a parallel program on DMPPs. The optimal data layout pattern for an array may differ throughout the program. Twisted data layout can be used to resolve the conflicts among the optimal array distributions in a special case. Experimental results on the AP1000 multicomputer measure the performance of the twisted data layout scheme.
