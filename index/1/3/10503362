Since innovation plays an important role in the context of food, as evident in how successful chefs, restaurants or cuisines in general evolve over time, we were interested in exploring this dimension from a more virtual perspective. In particular, the paper presents results of a study that was conducted in the context of a large-scale German online food community forum to explore another important dimension of online food recipe production, namely known as online food innovation. The study shows interesting findings and temporal patterns in terms of how online food recipe innovation takes place.
