Robotic handling inside the SEM is well known, but mostly a teleoperated task, but automation of in-situ handling would be highly advantageous and could enable serious production and assembly in the SEM. However, reliable techniques who facilitate an automation are still lacking. Especially the positioning along the optical axis of the SEM remains as a major challenge. In this paper, an universal approach addressing this particular issue is proposed, allowing to assist and improve handling and assembly task. The approach exploits typical charging effects in the SEM and derives information about the positions of objects and end-effectors as well as about assembly statuses. Assembly accuracies better than 100nm are achieved and controlled approaching speeds of 10 Î¼m/s.
