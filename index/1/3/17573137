IoT browser is a useful tool for the Internet of Things (IoT), which provides a novel way for people to interact with daily life objects through the Internet. Comparing with traditional web browsing environment, IoT browsing environment has some distinctive features such as the way of interacting with the physical objects, the importance of spatial-temporal information of objects, and the necessity of resource reuse. In this demonstration, we present a prototype of a proposed IoT browsing system architecture with a semantic-based learning-capable middleware for IoT browser and demonstrate the applicability of the system in a browsing scenario. The learning scheme is able to suggest users the next possible events when the users design their own service flows through web interface. The prototype shows that with the help of the IoT browsing system, heterogeneous devices can cooperate with each other to provide IoT services.
