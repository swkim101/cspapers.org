Given a set of m coins out of a collection of coins of k unknown distinct weights, we wish to decide if all the m given coins have the same weight or not using the minimum possible number of weighings in a regular balance beam. Let m(n; k) denote the maximum possible number of coins for which the above problem can be solved in n weighings. We show that m(n; 2) = n (1 2 +o(1))n , whereas for all 3 k n + 1, m(n; k) is much smaller than m(n; 2) and satisses m(n; k) = (n log n= logk). The proofs have an interesting geometric avour, and combine Linear Algebra techniques with geometric, probabilistic and combinatorial arguments.
