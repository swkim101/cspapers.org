Modern system-on-chips (SoC) integrate CPU and GPU for immersive 3D gaming experience. These games require both the CPU and GPU to work in tandem, resulting in high power consumption. In the past, Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) has been exploited for embedded CPU to save power during game play; but it is only recently that embedded GPUs have attained DVFS capabilities that provide additional opportunities. In this paper, we propose a power management approach that takes a unified view of the CPU-GPU DVFS, resulting in reduced power consumption for latest 3D mobile games compared to an independent CPU-GPU power management approach.
