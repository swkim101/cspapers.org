Recognizing the user motion intention plays an important role in the study of power-assist robots. An intention-guided control strategy is proposed for the upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton. A force sensor system comprised of force sensing resistors (FSRs) is designed to online estimate the motion intention of user upper limb. A new concept called “intentional reaching direction (IRD)” is proposed to quantitatively describe this intention. Both the state model and the observation model of IRD are obtained by enumerating the upper limb behavior modes and analyzing the relationship between the measured force signals and the motion intention. Based on these two models, the IRD can be online inferred by applying filtering technology. Guided by the estimated IRD, an admittance control strategy is assumed to control the motions of three DC motors in the joints of the robotic arm. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is finally confirmed by the experiments on a 3-DOF robotic exoskeleton.
