Over the last few years, Twitter is increasingly becoming an important source of up-to-date topics about what is happening in the world. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topic association detection model to discover relations between Twitter topics, by which users can gain insights into richer information about topics of interest. The proposed model utilizes a time constrained method to extract event-based spatio-temporal topic association, and constructs a dynamic temporal map to represent the obtained result. Experimental results show the improvement of the proposed model compared to static spatio-temporal method and co-occurrence method.
