This paper looks at an artificial intelligence control program required for a system which accepts queries to a data base which consists of both data and program modules. Using a problem solving approach, the data base structure and the program modules specify the initial world model. The operators consist of functions which look through sets in the data base and the actual program modules themselves. The goal is the query which requests data and/or processes. The control program determines the path which maps through the data base and the program modules in a manner which satisfies the predicate calculus constraints and the goal. Real examples of how this system is being used for a large scale data base is included.
