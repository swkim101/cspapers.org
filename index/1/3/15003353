Traditional compilers are usually sequential programs that serially process source programs through lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis and code generation. The availability of multiprocessor computers has made it feasible to consider alternatives to this serial compilation process. The authors are currently engaged in a project to devise ways of structuring compilers so that they can take advantage of modern multiprocessor hardware. This paper is about the most difficult aspect of concurrent compilation: concurrent semantic analysis.
