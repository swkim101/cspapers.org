In walking of quadruped robots, a better performance is obtained by changing the order of swing leg at a gait. In this paper, we study a walking with obstacles avoidance of a quadruped robot using neural network (NN) for determining the moving distance of the robot and for determining the order of a swing leg. The training data is considered with initial positions of each leg. The effectiveness of the present method is demonstrated with some experiments using TITAN-Vin.
