In this paper we identify and address the challenges unique to providing a secure ATM network. We analyse the network environment and consider the correct placement for a security mechanism, with particular to data transfer protection, in such an environment. We then introduce and describe a key-agile cryptographic device for ATM networks. We present the technique to provide synchronisation, dynamic key change, dynamic initialisation vector change and Message Authentication Code protection on ATM data transfer. Finally, we discuss the corresponding control functions for setting up of such a secure channel. A number of key exchange protocols are given as possible candidates for the establishment of the secure session and we describe the impact of these key exchange protocols on the design of an ATM signalling protocol. An outline of our secure signalling and signalling security effort has also been presented.
