A number of institutions and organisations provide online or face-to-face professional learning as part of outreach initiatives to increase skill levels and support for teachers in K-12 Computing education. With a number of countries introducing new K-12 Computer Science curricula around the globe, this provides a prime opportunity for the Computer Science education community to transform and develop models of teacher professional learning that address teachers' needs at-scale. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of a community-based professional learning MOOC for Australian teachers for K-6 Computer Science. This paper reflects on data collected from three offerings of the MOOC, presented in light of the theory and design considerations. This paper provides valuable insights of the design of community-centric MOOCs, and acts as a guide for the construction of online professional learning opportunities for Computer Science educators.
