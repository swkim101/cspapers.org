Dual-arm manipulation is an increasingly important skill for robots operating in home, retail and industrial environments. Dual-arm manipulation is especially essential for tasks involving large objects which are harder to grasp and manipulate using a single arm. In this work, we address dual-arm manipulation of objects in indoor environments. We are particularly focused on tasks that involve an upright orientation constraint on the grasped object. Such constraints are often present in human environments, e.g. when manipulating a tray of food or a container with fluids. In this paper, we present a search-based approach that is capable of planning dual-arm motions, often within one second, in cluttered environments while adhering to the orientation constraints. Our approach systematically constructs a graph in task space and generates motions that are consistent across runs with similar start/goal configurations and are low-cost. These motions come with guarantees on completeness and bounds on the suboptimality with respect to the graph that encodes the planning problem. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human interacting with the robot.
