The Ada Language System (ALS) is a complete programming environment for the development of Ada programs. This paper discusses the design objectives of those portions of the ALS which support translation and execution of Ada programs, particularly the compiler, linker, and program library. The ALS capabilities for maintenance of software configuration control are highlighted. Tradeoffs in the design of the compiler phase structure and intermediate languages are presented.
