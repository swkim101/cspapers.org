In this paper, we propose a ubiquitous augmented reality system that expands projected augmentations in wide area by using visible light communication and wireless tag. The system consists of wireless tags and a high-speed projector (DMD Discovery 3000), operating in 8kHz, attached on mobility platform. The projector transmits structured light patterns that contain different information in each pixel. Wireless tags can recognize their own locations in projected area by receiving structured light patterns projected from the projector. Since 3D coordinates of individual tag is stored in the system, projection point is estimated with 3D coordinates and pixel coordinates of each tag in projected area. According to the estimated position and orientation, augmented reality content is superimposed. The set of structured light patterns are projected in sufficient speed that human eye can only perceive the superimposed content. We have also evaluated the accuracy of superimposing augmented reality content on real world from moving projection points.
