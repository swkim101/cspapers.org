 
 The Angry Birds AI Competition (aibirds.org) has been held in conjunction with the AI 2012, IJCAI 2013 and ECAI 2014 conferences and will be held again at the IJCAI 2015 conference. The declared goal of the competition is to build an AI agent that can play Angry Birds as good or better than the best human players. In this paper we describe why this is a very difficult problem, why it is a challenge for AI, and why it is an important step towards building AI that can successfully interact with the real world. We also summarise some highlights of past competitions, describe which methods were successful, and give an outlook to proposed variants of the competition.Â
