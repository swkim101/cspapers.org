To integrate existing CAD programs, as well as to provide a nucleus for future growth, a unified CAD data base has been implemented for storing the design data needed by many different types of CAD programs. This paper describes an IC-oriented design system that uses this data base structure a new design language to integrate logic simulation, test generation, IC mask layout, and design verification programs.
