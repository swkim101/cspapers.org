This paper provides a model theoretic semantics to feature terms augmented with set descriptions. We provide constraints to specify HPSG style set descriptions, fixed cardinality set descriptions, set-membership constraints, restricted universal role quantifications, set union, intersection, subset and disjointness. A sound, complete and terminating consistency checking procedure is provided to determine the consistency of any given term in the logic. It is shown that determining consistency of terms is a NP-complete problem.
