We investigate a method of crowdsourced task routing based on matrix factorization. From a preliminary analysis of a real crowdsourced data, we begin an exploration of how to route crowdsourcing task via Matrix factorization (MF) which efficiently estimate missing values in a worker-task matrix. Our preliminary results show the benefits of task routing over random assignment, the strength of probabilistic MF over baseline methods.
