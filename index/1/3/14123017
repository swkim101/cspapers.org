1 P r [ m i n { ~ r ( S ) } = 7r (x) ] = IS-~ when ~is chosen at random from F. The rigorous study of such families was initiated by Broder, Charikax, Frieze, and Mitzenmacher (STOC98), motivated by practical applications such as detecting near duplicate web documents by the AltaVista search engine. For these practical uses, it is required that the family be easily sampleable, and that the permutations be efficiently computable. To achieve this one often uses relaxed notions of rain-wise independence, such as P r [ m i n { l r ( S ) } = ~r(x) ] > IS--~for some small 0 < e < 1. We present a new family of nearly min-wise independent permutations, and argue that the balance it achieves between ease of use and provable statistical properties makes it a favorable candidate for practical applications.
