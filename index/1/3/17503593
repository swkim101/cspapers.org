An improved Fish-Search algorithm was proposed for airplane route planning of a class of Plane-Missile cooperation. The mathematical description of this class of cooperation was introduced. Comprehensively considered such key factors of the cooperation as inter-visibility, threat, maximum distance and relative orientation, the constraint conditions and evaluation index were constructed. According to the characteristics of the problem, the Fish-Search algorithm was used to solve the problem, and was improved by introducing a ta-boo bulletin board and the survival mechanism. As is shown in the comparison of the simulation results of the original and the improved algorithm, the convergence rate was improved.
