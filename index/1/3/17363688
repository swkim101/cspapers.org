The concept of a “precedental data base” is introduced. It is a linguistic data base consisting of a dictionary of lexical patterns (clishes) and a dictionary of discourses. Some algorithms for textual information processing using precedental data bases are discussed in detail.
These systems are installed on mainframe and minicomputers for test runs.
