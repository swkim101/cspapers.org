Back of device interaction is gaining popularity as an alternative input modality in mobile devices, however it is still unclear how the back of device is related to other interactions. My research explores the relationship between hand grip from the back of the device and other interactions. In order to investigate this relationship, I will use touch target application to study hand grip patterns, then analyse the correlation that exists between touch target and hand grip. Finally I will explore the possibilities offered when the relationship between the touch target and hand grip is established in a quantifiable way.
