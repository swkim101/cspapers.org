In this paper we propose a new word-order based graph representation for text. In our graph representation vertices represent words or phrases and edges represent relations between contiguous words or phrases. The graph representation also includes dependency information. Our text representation is suitable for applications involving the identification of relevance or paraphrases across texts, where word-order information would be useful. We show that this word-order based graph representation performs better than a dependency tree representation while identifying the relevance of one piece of text to another.
