The choice of a color space is of great importance for many computer vision algorithms (e.g. edge detection and object recognition). It induces the equivalence classes to the actual algorithms. However, the problem is how to automatically select the color space that produces the best result for a particular task. The subsequent difficulty then is how to obtain a proper weighting scheme for the algorithms so that the results are combined in an optimal setting. To achieve proper color space selection and fusion of feature detectors, in this paper, we propose a method that exploits non-perfect correlation between the color models derived from the principles of diversification. As a consequence, the weighting scheme yields maximal color discrimination. The method is verified experimentally for two different feature detectors. The experimental results show that the model provides feature detection results having a discriminative power of 30 percent higher than the standard weighting scheme.
