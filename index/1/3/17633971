In the paper, a concept of novel self-reconfigurable robotic system made of the autonomous robotic modules has been reviewed. Each robotic module is made of simple structure and few degrees of freedom; however, a group of the modules is able to change its connective configuration by changing their local connections and has functionality of robotic system which is capable of generating complicated motions and accomplishing a large variety of tasks, such as: transportation, exploration, inspection, construction and in-situ resource utilization. Multimode locomotion and self-reconfiguration are the basic and essential abilities for the self-reconfigurable robotic system. Based on this concept, a new self-reconfiguration system, UBot robotic system that combines the advantages from the chain-based and lattice-based robots has been proposed. Each UBot module which is cubic structure based on universal joint has two rotational DOF and four connecting surfaces that can connect to or disconnect from adjacent modules. The smart structure and the reliable connecting mechanism of the modules make the robot flexible enough to complete multimode locomotion and self-reconfiguration. This paper demonstrates the design philosophy of the UBot module and a solution for multimode motions and self-reconfiguration using the UBot system. The system can complete motion in the modes of quadruped, chain and loop configuration. Besides, the system can deform from one mode to the other though self-reconfiguration. All the proposed methods have been verified though simulations and real hardware experiments.
