An always-on video communication system can increase the opportunity for casual communication between remotely connected users, but privacy concerns prohibit the wide usage of such a system. To address this problem, we propose a new system for remote communication, which has wide-angle lens that faces the ceiling, and which allows an always-on connection while protecting the privacy of unintended users and keeping the background scenery naturally out of the line of sight. Furthermore, a circular mirror metaphor allows both local and remote users to participate in the conversation as if they were at the same roundtable.
