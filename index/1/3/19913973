Time series classification has attracted much attention due to the ubiquity of time series. With the advance of technologies, the volume of available time series data becomes huge and the content is changing rapidly. This requires time series data mining methods to have low computational complexities. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free time series classification method that has a linear time complexity. The approach is evaluated on all the 85 datasets in the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results show that the new method achieves better overall classification accuracy performance than the widely used benchmark, i.e. 1-nearest neighbor with dynamic time warping, while consuming orders of magnitude less running time. The proposed method is also applied on a large real-world bird sounds dataset to verify its effectiveness.
