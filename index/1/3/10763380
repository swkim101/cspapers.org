Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as a promising technology to build large-scale main memory systems in a cost-effective manner. A characteristic of PCM is that it has write latency much higher than read latency. A higher write latency can typically be tolerated using buffers. However, once a write request is scheduled for service to a bank, it can still cause increased latency for later arriving read requests to the same bank. We show that for the baseline PCM system with read-priority scheduling, the write requests increase the effective read latency to 2.3x (on average), causing significant performance degradation. To reduce the read latency of PCM devices under such scenarios, we propose adaptive Write Cancellation policies. Such policies can abort the processing of a scheduled write requests if a read request arrives to the same bank within a predetermined period. We also propose Write Pausing, which exploits the iterative write algorithms used in PCM to pause at the end of each write iteration to service any pending reads. For the baseline system, the proposed technique removes 75% of the latency increase incurred by read requests and improves overall system performance by 46% (on average), while requiring negligible hardware and simple extensions to PCM controller.
