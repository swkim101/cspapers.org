Our slogan for the proposed Clairvoyant system is "with several clicks, the future is in your hand, the plan comes into your mind". Clairvoyant is to predict the future of new videos with only few data. The core function in the system is the novel shifted shape match prediction algorithm, based on a K-Nearest Neighbor model. Tons of experiments have been conducted on the open data sets. The experimental results confirms that the proposed SSMP algorithm is promising and outperforms the baselines with significant improvements on various evaluation methods.
