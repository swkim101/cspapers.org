Although many temporal models have been proposed in the literature, there is still need for a conceptual model capturing the essential semantics of time-varying information that is free of implementation concerns. This paper first discusses important criteria to be considered when assessing the OconceptualO quality of a temporal model. Then, it presents the main temporal features of MADS, a spatio-temporal conceptual model. The focus is on identifying issues that are either open or controversial, and discussing alternatives, if any. Finally, it is shown how the model may be implemented on top of either TSQL2 or a traditional, non-temporal data model.
