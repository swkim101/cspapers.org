Wireless multi-hop networks meet the requirements of disaster area scenarios by their definition. Recently, different mesh and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) testbeds were deployed. However, these deployments do not meet the specific characteristics of disaster area scenarios. Developing algorithms and protocols for public safety scenarios and deploying public safety networks is a huge challenge.
 We have developed BonnSens a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based prototype of a mesh-based command and control sensing system for public safety scenarios. In this poster, we present experiences as well as first measurement results from an on-site deployment in a disaster area maneuver. Overall, our goal is to see which approaches are applicable for public safety networks and where further specific challenges are.
