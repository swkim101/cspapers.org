We investigate the difficult problem of matching semi-structured resumes and jobs in a large scale real-world collection. We compare standard approaches to Structured Relevance Models (SRM), an extensionof relevance-based language model for modeling and retrieving semi-structured documents. Preliminary experiments show that the SRM approach achieved promising performance and performed better than typical unstructured relevance models.
