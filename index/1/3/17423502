Based on our field studies and consultations with field experts, we identified three main problems that are of key importance to online web personalization and customer relationship management: 1) detecting changes in individual behaviour, 2) reporting on user actions that may need special care, and 3) detecting changes in visitation frequency.
 We propose solutions to these problems and experiment on real-world data from an investment bank collected over 1.5 years of web traffic. These solutions can be applied on any domains where individuals tend to revisit the website and can be identified accurately.
