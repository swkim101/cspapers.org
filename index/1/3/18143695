One of the most robust findings of experimental psycholinguistics is that the context in which a word is presented influences the effort involved in processing that word. We present a computational model of contextual facilitation based on word co-occurrence vectors, and empirically validate the model through simulation of three representative types of context manipulation: single word priming, multiple-priming and contextual constraint. The aim of our study is to find out whether special-purpose mechanisms are necessary in order to capture the pattern of the experimental results.
