This paper describes a minimal topology driven parsing algorithm for topological grammars that synchronizes a rewriting grammar and a dependency grammar, obtaining two linguistically motivated syntactic structures. The use of non-local slash and visitor features can be restricted to obtain a CKY type analysis in polynomial time. German long distance phenomena illustrate the algorithm, bringing to the fore the procedural needs of the analyses of syntax-topology mismatches in constraint based approaches like for example HPSG.
