Advanced robotic applications often require a robot to work as a part of an integrated system. Supervisory control of the robot in such cases readily permits incorporation of external sensing systems such as vision. To handle communication between a host and robot controller more effectively, we have developed multilevel commands within the host programming environment. An example application is presented which is a visually guided robot food handling task. The work cell comprises a robot manipulator, a vision system, and a host controller whereby the supervisory control of the robot is achieved.<<ETX>>
