In 1990 Poggio and Edelman proposed a view-based model of object recognition that accounts for several psychophysical properties of certain recognition tasks. The model predicted the existence of view-tuned and view-invariant units, that were later found by Logothetis et al. (Logothetis et al., 1995) in IT cortex of monkeys trained with views of specific paperclip objects. The model, however, does not specify the inputs to the view-tuned units and their internal organization. In this paper we propose a model of these view-tuned units that is consistent with physiological data from single cell responses.
