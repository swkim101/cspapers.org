Phrase table pruning is the act of removing phrase pairs from a phrase table to make it smaller, ideally removing the least useful phrases first. We propose a phrase table pruning method that formulates the task as a submodular function maximization problem, and solves it by using a greedy heuristic algorithm. The proposed method can scale with input size and long phrases, and experiments show that it achieves higher BLEU scores than state-of-the-art pruning methods.
