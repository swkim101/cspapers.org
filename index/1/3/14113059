This paper gives a characterisation of dialogue properties which are argued to be related to the usability of dialogue systems: effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and a number of properties that have to do with coherence. Such properties can be used as guidelines in dialogue design, but also as aspects to test for in verification and validation.
