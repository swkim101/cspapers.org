This paper reports the results of some measurements taken on the effects two new solid state paging devices, the STC 4305 and the Intel 3805, have on paging performance in the Michigan Terminal System at the University of Michigan. The measurements were taken with a software monitor using various configurations of the two solid state devices and the fixed head disk, which they replace. Measurements were taken both during regular production and using an artificial load created to exercise the paging subsystem. The results confirmed the expectation that the solid state paging devices provide shorter page-in waiting times than the fixed-head disk, and also pointed up some of the effects which their differing architectures have on the system.
