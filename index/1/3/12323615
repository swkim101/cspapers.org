We present a method for adapting garbage collectors designed to run sequentially with the client, so that they may run concurrently with it. We rely on virtual memory hardware to provide information about pages that have been updated or “dirtied” during a given period of time. This method has been used to construct a mostly parallel trace-and-sweep collector that exhibits very short pause times. Performance measurements are given.
