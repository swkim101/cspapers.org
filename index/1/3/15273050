The labeling scheme is designed to label the XML nodes so that both ordered and un-ordered queries can be processed without accessing the original XML file. When XML data become dynamic, it is important to design a labeling scheme that can facilitate updates and support query processing efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel containment labeling scheme called DXCL (Dynamic XML Containment Labeling) to effectively process updating in dynamic XML data. Compared with the existing dynamic labeling schemes, a distinguishing feature of DXCL is that DXCL is compact and efficient regardless of whether the documents are updated or not. DXCL uses fixed length integer numbers to label initial XML documents and hence yields compact label size and high query performance. When updates take place, DXCL also has high performance on both label updates and query processing especially in the case of skewed insertions. Experimental results conform the benefits of our approach over the previous dynamic schemes.
