We propose a method to create a physical interface that allows touch input to be transferred from an external surface attached to a touch panel. Our technique prints a grid having multiple conductive points using an FDM-based 3D printer. When the user touches the conductive points, touch input is generated. This allows the user to control the touch input at arbitrary locations on an XY plane. By arranging the structure of the conductive wiring inside a physical object, a variety of interfaces can be realized.
