Indiana University's Department of Computer Science teaches digital hardware organization and design as a two-semester course sequence at the senior/graduate level. The courses are four credit hours each and have classroom and laboratory components. Our goals have been to provide a firm foundation of theoretical and practical knowledge of digital hardware so that our graduates can understand electronic devices, design digital hardware, and work effectively on large projects with engineers, scientists, and managers.
In the laboratory our students confront a small number of large and complex problems, with few or no small-scale isolated experiments. This philosophy is consistent with the approach usually taken in the software areas of our curriculumâ€”to try as best we can to teach the student to cope with the complex issues found in real-world problem-solving. Achieving this goal in the digital hardware instructional laboratory requires a substantial commitment of funds and faculty and staff effort.
