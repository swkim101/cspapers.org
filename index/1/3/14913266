In this paper we present a technique for automatically generating constraints on parameter derivatives that reduce ambiguity in the behaviour prediction. Starting with a behaviour prediction using an initial library containing general domain knowledge the technique employs feedback about valid and spurious states of behaviour and knowledge about the causal dependencies between the parameters in the model in order to determine the constraints that remove the undesired states of behaviour that result from spurious ambiguity. In addition, the technique points out the assembly of physical objects to which the generated constraints apply.
