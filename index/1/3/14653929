This paper presents \bic (Border/Interior pixel Classification), a compact and efficient CBIR approach suitable for broad image domains. It has three main components: (1) a simple and powerful image analysis algorithm that classifies image pixels as either border or interior, (2) a new logarithmic distance (dLog) for comparing histograms, and (3) a compact representation for the visual features extracted from images. Experimental results show that the BIC approach is consistently more compact, more efficient and more effective than state-of-the-art CBIR approaches based on sophisticated image analysis algorithms and complex distance functions. It was also observed that the dLog distance function has two main advantages over vectorial distances (e.g., L1): (1) it is able to increase substantially the effectiveness of (several) histogram-based CBIR approaches and, at the same time, (2) it reduces by 50% the space requirement to represent a histogram.
