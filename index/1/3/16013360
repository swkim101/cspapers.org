With multiprocessor computers becoming more readily available on college campuses and with the recent development of software tools to aid in the implementation of parallel algorithms, it is time for parallel processing to enter the undergraduate curriculum. In this paper we show how widely available tools combined with concepts learned in an operating systems course could be used to develop an upper level undergraduate course in parallel processing. A typical artificial intelligence search problem (N-queens) is implemented in C and exhibits almost linear speedups.
