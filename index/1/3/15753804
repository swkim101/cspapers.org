This paper describes the experimental approach to achieve the higher productivity, reliability, maintainability and the performance in the database application programming or of the programs.
 We have practiced the structured programming on the database processings in order to write the reliable database application programs. Then we introduce the simulated forms of the basic control structures in COBOL which is the host language, the structured representations of the DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements to be precompiled to the COBOL statements, and the programming standards firstly, and the program structuring guidelines to the highly efficient database processings nextly, based on the fact that the database processing performance is affected by the data reference behavior which is called as a data locality of the database application program. The way to structure the database application program which has a good data locality and the tool which is useful to examine the program structure are described.
 Finally, we describe the results got through the experiments.
