Introduction of electronic switching system in important sectors like telecommunication where service breakdown is not tolerable because of the consequential dangers, bring out the problem of operational continuity of the system itself. It is well known that the ability to identify and localise faults easily is one of the major factors that contribute to the operational continuity of telephonic system and to rapidly execute services. It becomes therefore important to possess a library of diagnostic programs of quick execution and a high degree of reliability so that the system may be subjected to rapid tests in order to assess its soundness and to spot potential faults. Keeping therefore in mind that our primary object is to develop such programs, it is necessary:
 to be able to analyse the behaviour of the system both in the presence or absence of faults and to process the resulting information in order to compile a dictionary of faults.
 to be able to evaluate the fault resolving power of the diagnostic programs. This evaluation points to those faults not yet diagnosable, thus giving a figure of merit indicating not only the ability of the program to cover all possible failures but also offering a valuable indication of the degree of development of the diagnostic programs.
 A suitable software structure should therefore be devised not only to facilitate the development and evaluation of diagnostic programs, but also to be an instrument which can provide design guidance in case of an alternative choice anticipating during the design phase, these improvements which could otherwise be only verified when the prototype has already been developed.
