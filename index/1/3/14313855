The method of Structural Risk Minimization refers to tuning the capacity of the classifier to the available amount of training data. This capacity is influenced by several factors, including: (1) properties of the input space, (2) nature and structure of the classifier, and (3) learning algorithm. Actions based on these three factors are combined here to control the capacity of linear classifiers and improve generalization on the problem of handwritten digit recognition.
