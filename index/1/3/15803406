We present a progress report on our research on nominal compounds (NC's). Recent approaches to this problem in linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) are reviewed and criticized. We argue that the notion of "role nominal", which is at the interface of linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge, is crucial for characterizing NC's as well as other linguistic phenomena. We examine a number of constraints on the semantic interpretation rules for NC's. Proposals are made that should improve the capability of NLP systems to deal with NC's.
