This paper investigates the control algorithm of an exoskeleton for hand rehabilitation, which can realize the active, passive, and assisted rehabilitation motion. The active mode is accomplished with the force control algorithm during which the resistance is compensated in free space and the virtual interactive force is rendered to the finger in constraint space. The passive mode is realized by the position controller given the desired motion trajectory. The assisted mode is implemented in the customized positions by switching between the active and passive modes according to the predefined action procedure. The experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method, and the results show that the different rehabilitation motion are successfully accomplished and the maximum joint position error is less than 1.2 degree, which satisfies the requirement in hand rehabilitation application. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.
