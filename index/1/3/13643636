Digital signals in high-speed computers and communications systems require that even short interconnections be treated as transmission lines, and existing circuit analysts programs (ECAP-II, ASTAP, SCEPTRE, I/TRAC-II) have been used effectively to model lossless and non-dispersive lines.
 Now, simple networks have been developed which can model accurately the effects of dispersion due to resistance and skin effect, of homogeneous, linear, transmission lines and cables.
 They can be used with any presently available circuit analysis program, to obtain efficient and accurate simulations.
 Theoretical responses of lines having large resistance and/or skin effect losses can be approximated to an accuracy of Â±2% over a range of 0.1 to 500 time constants, and a single network configuration can be used to model any type of losses, simply by changing the component values.
