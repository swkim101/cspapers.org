Online social networks, such as Twitter, have soared in popularity and in turn have become attractive targets of spam. In fact, spammers have evolved their strategies to stay ahead of Twitter's anti-spam measures in this short period of time. In this paper, we investigate the strategies Twitter spammers employ to reach relevant target audiences. Due to their targeted approaches to send spam, we see evidence of a large number of the spam accounts forming relationships with other Twitter users, thereby becoming deeply embedded in the social network.
 We analyze nearly 20 million tweets from about 7 million Twitter accounts over a period of five days. We identify a set of 14,230 spam accounts that manage to live longer than the other 73% of other spam accounts in our data set. We characterize their behavior, types of tweets they use, and how they target their audience. We find that though spam campaigns changed little from a recent work by Thomas et al., spammer strategies evolved much in the same short time span, causing us to sometimes find contradictory spammer behavior from what was noted in Thomas et al.'s work. Specifically, we identify four major strategies used by 2/3rd of the spammers in our data. The most popular of these was one where spammers targeted their own followers. The availability of various kinds of services that help garner followers only increases the popularity of this strategy. The evolution in spammer strategies we observed in our work suggests that studies like ours should be undertaken frequently to keep up with spammer evolution.
