A significant rethinking of the computer science curriculum at a regional comprehensive university has led to a much tighter integration of discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithm analysis in a two-course Data Structures and Algorithms sequence. The courses are 4 semester hours each with two hour weekly labs. The new approach provides good support for a substantially increased emphasis on the reinforcement of theoretical constructs with empirical studies. The nature of the programming assignments has been particularly impacted by these efforts to reinforce the theoretical with the empirical. This article has a focus on the second course content and conduct, and how these modifications support a different approach to the course projects. This article also contains a report of favorable trends in completion percentages of the course under the new regime.
