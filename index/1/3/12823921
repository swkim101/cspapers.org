One challenge for developing spoken dialogue systems in multiple domains is facilitating system component communication using a shared domain ontology. Since each domain comes with its own set of concepts and actions relevant to the application, adapting a system to a new domain requires customizing components to use the ontological representations required for that domain. Our research in multiple domain development has highlighted differences in the ontological needs of a generalpurpose language interface and a task-specific reasoning application. Although different domain applications have their own ontologies, many aspects of spoken dialogue interaction are common across domains. In this paper, we present a new method of customizing a broad-coverage parser to different domains by maintaining two ontologies, one that is generalized for language representation, and another that is customized to the domain, and defining mappings between them. In this way we preserve the broad-coverage language components across domains as well as produce semantic representations that are optimally suited to the domain reasoners.
