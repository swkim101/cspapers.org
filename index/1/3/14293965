This paper discusses the development of a high speed pipelined arithmetic system suitable for recursive numeric computations. The core of the arithmetic system is an online pipeline network. The details of the architectural design of this arithmetic system are first presented. Then the organization of such a system to support a broad range of recursive computations, which have not been amenable to pipelining by other techniques, will be described. The LU factorization of a tridiagonal matrix is used as an example to provide timing comparisons between the online pipeline network, the CRAY-1, and the systolic array as presented by Kung and Leiserson, 1978.
