Research in Computer Science (CS) evolves rapidly in a dynamic fashion. New research area may emerge and attract researchers, while older areas may have lesser interest from researchers. Studying how trends evolve in CS can be interesting from several dimensions. Furthermore, it can be used to craft research agendas. In this paper, we present trend analysis on research area in CS. We also look at citation trend analysis. Our analysis is performed using the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset. We propose the FoS score to measure the level of interest in any particular research area or topic. We apply the FoS score to investigate general publication trends, citation trends, evolution of research areas, and relation between research areas in CS.
