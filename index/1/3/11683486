The fingerprint images compression based on geometric transformed presents important research topic, these last year’s many transforms have been proposed to give the best representation to a particular type of image “fingerprint image”, like classics wavelets and wave atoms. In this paper we shall present a comparative study between this transforms, in order to use them in compression. The results show that for fingerprint images, the wave atom offers better performance than the current transform based compression standard. The wave atoms transformation brings a considerable contribution on the compression of fingerprints images by achieving high values of ratios compression and PSNR, with a reduced number of coefficients. In addition, the proposed method is verified with objective and subjective testing.
