Most conventional robotic arms depend on sensory feedback to perform their tasks. When feedback is inaccurate, slow or otherwise unreliable, robots should behave more like humans: rely on feedforward instead. This paper presents an approach to perform repetitive tasks with robotic arms, without the need for feedback (i.e. the control is open loop). The cyclic motions of the repetitive tasks are analyzed using an approach similar to limit cycle theory. We optimize open loop control signals that result in open loop stable motions. This approach to manipulator control was implemented on a two DOF arm in the horizontal plane with a spring on the first DOF, of which we show simulation and hardware results. The results show that both in simulation and in hardware experiments, it is possible to create open loop stable cycles. However, the two resulting cycles are different due to model inaccuracies. We also show simulation and hardware results for an inverted pendulum, of which we have a more accurate model. These results show stable cycles that are the same in simulation and hardware experiments.
