Access control to shared files in a distributed computing environment requires an efficient method of allocating file resources with local and remote user processes. While software controlled access methods are convenient from the user's point of view, they give rise to serious operational problems such as job interferences (deadlock situations) and critical race conditions. Two software controlled access schemes, one centralized and one distributed are described in this paper. A basic set of protocols is derived to illustrate the implementation aspects of each scheme in a given network environment. The two approaches are then evaluated in the light of several performance criteria.
