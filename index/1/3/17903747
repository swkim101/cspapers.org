A study was conducted in 1976 by GTE Automatic Electric Laboratories to determine what is required to more effectively support product (e.g., Electronic Switching System) development and product manufacturing by GTE Automatic Electric. The results of the study was a project proposal (PIRAMED).
 The PIRAMED System is being developed from the basic perspective that Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing must not be separate, disjoint functions but, instead, integrated functions. Key design concepts upon which the system structure will rest are: an integrated database system, an interactive user access to the system, and a flexible system structure.
 The above discussion about the system only addresses the technical aspects of the total project. What is equally important is an environmental plan to deal with the present organization, such that the likelihood of a successive implementation is greatly enhanced. An analysis of GTE Automatic Electric environment was performed within the study and formed the basis for the environmental plan.
