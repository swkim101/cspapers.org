Monitoring a diffuse event with a wireless sensor network differs from well studied applications such as target tracking and habitat monitoring and therefore we suggest that new approaches are needed. In this paper we propose a novel low power technique based on a multiple agent framework. We show how a set of simple rules can produce complex behavior that encompasses event characterization and data routing. We demonstrate the approach and examine its accuracy and scalability using a simulated gaseous plume monitoring scenario.
