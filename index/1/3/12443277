A gradient descent algorithm for parameter estimation which is similar to those used for continuous-time recurrent neural networks was derived for Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models. Using membrane potential trajectories as targets, the parameters (maximal conductances, thresholds and slopes of activation curves, time constants) were successfully estimated. The algorithm was applied to modeling slow non-spike oscillation of an identified neuron in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. A model with three ionic currents was trained with experimental data. It revealed a novel role of A-current for slow oscillation below -50 mV.
