Shortest path querying is a fundamental graph problem which is computationally quite challenging when operating over massive scale graphs. Recent results have addressed the problem of computing either exact or good approximate shortest path distances efficiently. Some of these techniques also return the path corresponding to the estimated shortest path distance fast. However, none of these techniques work very well when we have additional constraints on the labels associated with edges that constitute the path. In this paper, we develop SkIt index structure, which supports a wide range of label constraints on paths, and returns an accurate estimation of the shortest path that satisfies the constraints. We conduct experiments over graphs such as social networks, and knowledge graphs that contain millions of nodes/edges, and show that SkIt index is fast, accurate in the estimated distance and has a high recall for paths that satisfy the constraints.
