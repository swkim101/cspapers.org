We investigate the change in performance of automatic subcategorization acquisition when a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system is employed to guide the acquisition process. As a subgoal, this involves creating a probabilistic WSD system, which we evaluate on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task data. We carry out an evaluation of the enriched subcategorization acquisition system using 29 'difficult' English verbs which shows that WSD helps to improve the acquisition performance.
