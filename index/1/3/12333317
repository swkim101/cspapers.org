when the Caltech Cosmic Cube [l] was implemented in 1981, it triggered a new wave on parallel processing and refreshed interest in hypercube topology. The research community has studied various direct network architectures, especially the k-ary n-cube, and their topological properties. Based on the underlying graph-theoretical model, many new theories and properties, such as routing paths and graph embedding, were discovered for various network topologies.
