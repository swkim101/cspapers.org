Existing source location and recovery algorithms used in magnetoen-cephalographic imaging generally assume that the source activity at different brain locations is independent or that the correlation structure is known. However, electrophysiological recordings of local field potentials show strong correlations in aggregate activity over significant distances. Indeed, it seems very likely that stimulus-evoked activity would follow strongly correlated time-courses in different brain areas. Here, we present, and validate through simulations, a new approach to source reconstruction in which the correlation between sources is modelled and estimated explicitly by variational Bayesian methods, facilitating accurate recovery of source locations and the time-courses of their activation.
