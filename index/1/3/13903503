Non-gridded input processing is a new technique for rapid entry and processing of schematic type graphic data. Traditional computer based graphic design systems have a significant problem in original graphic data entry. The engineer's rough drawing has to be laid out on a grid before it is digitized or constructed on a CRT terminal. With non-gridded input processing as implemented in Drafting System I, the layout step is completely unnecessary. The engineers extremely rough, non-gridded sketch is digitized off-line. Processing routines standardize symbol sizes and lettering, straighten lines, and move symbols and lines to produce a finished drawing. Connecting lines are stretched or shrunk as required and made either horizontal or vertical. No reference whatever is made to a grid or to absolute location. Symbol input locations indicate only their “relative” location to one another and do not specify their locations on the output drawing.
