The initial version of linear fractional representation toolbox was mostly devoted to modelling with a special emphasis to LFT order reduction. An LFT representation can be viewed as the realization of a symbolic expression, therefore, scheduled gains are LFTs. This paper presents an extension of this toolbox to scheduled feedback design in LFT form. The well-posedness problem of such feedback gains is addressed. In addition, some classical analysis techniques (Nyquist, Bode, step responses...) are adapted to LFT objects via parameter gridding
