 
 We collect public opinions on museum artworks using online crowdsourcing techniques. We ask two research questions. First, do crowd opinions on artworks differ from expert interpretations? Second, how can museum manage large amount of crowd opinions, such that users can efficiently retrieve useful information? We address these questions through opinion modeling via semantic embedding and dimension reduction.
