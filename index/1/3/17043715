In order to improve the performance of KDD greatly, the paper researched KDD model process based on double bases cooperating mechanism and focused on one of its part that is heuristic coordinator, which simulated the creating intent of cognitive psychology feature. And an improved heuristic coordinator algorithm was proposed. The method used FCM representing knowledge and being effective inference to get non-association state of knowledge base for directional mining knowledge in massive database automatically. Furthermore, the method greatly reduced the searching space and the complexity of the algorithm and enhanced the self-cognition ability.
