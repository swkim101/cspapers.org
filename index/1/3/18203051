In teaching Pascal in our basic programming course since 1975, we have developed a teaching order using a sequence of language subsets, similar in concept to the SP/k, SF/k, and PS/k systems of Holt and Hume. Our scheme introduces each programming idea in as general a context as possible, and presents the elements of the Pascal-S subset (Wirth) before the rest of the language. It is designed for a concentrated presentation together with elements of discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and concepts of program design, for students with a basic course in Fortran as background.
