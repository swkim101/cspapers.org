Modeling the behavior of 802.15.4 links is a non-trivial problem because of the widespread heterogeneity in the quality of any given link over short and long time scales. We propose a novel multilevel approach involving Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Mixtures of Multivariate Bernoullis (MMBs) for modeling the long and short time scale behavior of wireless links using experimental data traces collected from multiple 802.15.4 testbeds. We characterize the synthetic traces generated from the proposed model in terms of statistical characteristics as compared to an empirical trace with similar PRR characteristics.
