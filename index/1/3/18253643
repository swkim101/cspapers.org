This research investigates the use of multimodal metaphors to communicate information in the interface of e-learning application in order to reduce the visual communication by incorporating auditory stimuli. Three experimental studies conducted to investigate the effect of using multimodal metaphors in e-learning applications. The first experiment introduced an empirical study to investigate the effect of including multimodal metaphors such as text, graphic and recorded speech in e-learning applications. The second study was dedicated to evaluate usability and learning performance of three different modalities including avatars, earcons, and speech to present the same information about e-note taking and reducing the load on the users' visual channel. The third experimental study was conducted to investigate the combination of multimodal metaphors including earcon with colour, human-like avatars, and video in the interface of e-learning. These investigations were evaluated by 40 users and comprised two different interface versions in each experimental e-learning tool. The results derived showed that the use of multimodal metaphors in an e-learning system could significantly contribute to enhancing the usability and learning performance. These results provide a set of empirical guidelines for the use of multimodal metaphors in e-learning interfaces.
