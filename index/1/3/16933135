The explosion of Web 2.0 platforms including social networking sites such as Twitter, blogs and wikis affects all web users: scholars included. As a result, there is a need for a comprehensive approach to gain a broader understanding and timely signals of scientific communication as well as how researchers interact on the social web. Most current work in this area deals with either a low number of researchers and heavily relies on manual annotation or large-scale analysis without deep understanding of the underlying researcher population. In this proposal, we present a holistic approach to solve these problems. This research proposes novel methods to collect, filter, analyze and make sense of scholars and scholarly communication by integrating heterogeneous data sources from fast social media streams as well as the academic web. Applying reproducible research, contributing applications and data sets, the thesis proposal strives to add value by mining the social web for social good.
