In an effort to address the need for skilled software engineers, Texas Christian University, in the Fall of 1978, instituted an advanced degree in Software Design and Development, the first of its kind in the country. This degree program has recently been updated and revised. The current status of software engineering education at Texas Christian University is assessed and the new curriculum is discussed.
