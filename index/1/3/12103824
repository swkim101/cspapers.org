In this paper, we consider the problems and benefits of developing an integrated platform that handles the timing requirements of a real-time industrial control application and the processing of multimedia streams. In particular, this paper explores various application scenarios which can benefit from an integrated real-time control system. We propose an architecture based on open systems and identify key research issues at different levels of the control hierarchy that need to be overcome in order to incorporate multimedia capabilities into a distributed industrial control application. A real-time Multimedia database is a key component in this platform and it can aid in the decision making processat the managementlevel, potentially resulting in reduced costs and improved operation of an industrial plant.
