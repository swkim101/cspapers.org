We present a polynomial time algorithm that finds the maximum weighted independent set of a transitive graph. The studied problem finds applications in a variety of VLSI contexts, including path delay fault testing, scheduling in high level synthesis and channel routing in physical design automation. The algorithm has been implemented and incorporated in a CAD tool for path delay fault testing. We experimentally verify its impact in the latter context.
