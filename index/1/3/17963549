This paper surveys the state of the art in the development of problem solving mechanisms for PLANNER-like formalisms. A major design goal for such formalisms is that "for any given piece of knowledge there arc natural places in the formalisms to procedurally embed the knowledge MO that it will He used when it is appropriate and not used when it inappropriate." Although this goal is still very far from being achieved, considerable progress is being made. This paper contains no major conceptual innovations although it does describe and give the rationale for many of the design decisions that have been made In PLASMA (for PLANNER-like System Modeled on Actors) which is currently being implemented at MIT. as part of a Programming Apprentice project and for other applications. The paper tries to delineate major unsolved problems and make suggestions for how some of them may be attacked. Arguments are presented against the competing predicate logic paradigm for the implementation of knowledge-based systems.
