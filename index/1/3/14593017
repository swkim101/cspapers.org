Power management units (PMU) have come into the spotlight with energy efficiency becoming a first order constraint in MPSoC designs. To cater to the exponential rise in power events, and to meet the demands of tight power and energy budgets, PMUs are evolving to more complex and intelligent designs. In an era defined by energy efficient computing, a malicious circuit embedded in a third party PMU can adversely affect the operation of the entire MPSoC. This work presents and evaluates two covert security threats, P-VIRUS and DROWSY, designed using a malicious third party PMU. Further, we propose a non-invasive IP risk assessment module to monitor the trustworthiness of the deployed PMU. Our techniques help flag malicious activities in the PMU with less than 1% area and power overheads.
