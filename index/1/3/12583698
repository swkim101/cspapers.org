This BOF is intended to allow faculty interested in global service learning, Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD) research, and other cross-cultural experiences an opportunity for information sharing. It takes a lot to get students out into the field. Challenges include developing partnerships, negotiating agreements, vetting the safety of destinations, identifying sources of funding, navigating the logistics of immunizations, visas, accommodations and flights to less-traveled places, reassuring parents as to the wisdom of their child's participation, managing development partner expectations, advising students' activities, and many more. And how can these experiences be evaluated? This BOF will provide a venue for sharing experiences, information, and identifying potential new collaborations. We will discuss means for sharing best practices, news, materials, and project artifacts. We will also explore opportunities for collaborating on projects and joint proposals.
