Micro and nanorobots can change many aspects of medicine by enabling targeted diagnosis and therapy, and minimal invasive surgery. A helical nanobelt with a magnetic head was proposed as a microrobot driven by rotating magnetic field in prior works. Magnetically coated tails were already shown in some works. However the control of such surface magnetic tails is not clearly realized yet. This paper aims to obtain control parameters for the modeling and simulation of the influence of surface magnets onto the swimming performances. For this, we created scaled-up helical nanobelts and the experimental testbed to get the control parameters and to prepare future closed-loop control.
