Modern educational Web sites often feature a rich assortment of linked media content. In this paper, we present a workload study of such an educational Web site hosted at the University of Calgary. Three main insights emerge from our study. First, educational Web sites can generate large volumes of Internet traffic, even when the number of users is limited. Second, network usage is highly influenced by course-related events, such as midterms and finals. Third, the approach used by the site for displaying videos can have adverse impacts on user experience and network traffic. We demonstrate these effects with active measurement of different Web browser and video player implementations.
