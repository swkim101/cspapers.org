We present a novel method for prioritizing both linear equality and inequality systems and provide one algorithm for its resolution. This algorithm can be summarized as a sequence of optimal resolutions for each linear system following their priority order. We propose an optimality criterion that is adapted to linear inequality systems and characterize the resulting optimal sets at every priority level. We have successfully applied our method to plan local motions for the humanoid robot HPR-2. We will demonstrate the validity of the method using an original scenario where linear inequality constraints are solved at lower priority than equality constraints.
