Women in the first systems course in Stanford's CS core find themselves in a divided culture in which they are a minority. For these women, establishing an identity of competence becomes critical to defining a place in the CS culture and establishing legitimacy. Social factors such as gendered self-presentation and communication, rather than objective measures of ability, plays a large role in developing confidence. Only by understanding the role of such social factors can we develop strategies for creating a more inclusive CS culture in which women may thrive. Findings are drawn from surveys, interviews, and five years of enrollment data.
