We study the effect of noise and regularization in an on-line gradient-descent learning scenario for a general two-layer student network with an arbitrary number of hidden units. Training examples are randomly drawn input vectors labeled by a two-layer teacher network with an arbitrary number of hidden units; the examples are corrupted by Gaussian noise affecting either the output or the model itself. We examine the effect of both types of noise and that of weight-decay regularization on the dynamical evolution of the order parameters and the generalization error in various phases of the learning process.
