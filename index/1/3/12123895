Multicast transmissions allow huge savings of network traffic compared to unicast transmissions when the same data is sent to a lot of users. These savings are achieved by the fact that users may “share” links, since each node in a multicast network can send an incoming transmission to an arbitrary number of neighbours. If there are costs incurred when using an edge, then this sharing is an obstacle for pricing. Formally, the (binary) multicast pricing problem is defined as follows: Let G = (V, E) be an edge weighted undirected graph. The graph G models the underlying network, edge weight ce represents the costs for using edge e. There is a distinguished set N ⊆ V of users. Furthermore, there is a node r / ∈ N , the service provider. A cost-sharing mechanism determines which users receive the transmission and assigns a price to each of these users. Each user i ∈ N has a (secret) utility ui. He derives utility ui from getting the transmission. If i gets the transmission at price xi, his individual welfare is ui−xi. If i does not get the transmission, his welfare is −xi. However, the cost-sharing mechanism does not a priori know the values ui. It has to rely on the users to report these ∗A full version of this work is available as SIIM-TR-A-03-02 from www.tcs.uni-luebeck.de/pages/blaeser/. †Supported by DFG research grant BL 511/5-1.
