In this paper we examine the probl of how to give hands-on assignments in a database syst internals course. We argue that current approaches are inadequate, either because they are not sufficiently comprehensive or because they require using software that has a steep learning curve. We then describe SimpleDB, which is software written expressly for such a course. SimpleDB is a database syst in the spirit of Minibase. Unlike Minibase, however, it supports multiple users and transactions via JDBC, and its code is easy to read and modify. We then describe a course that we teach using SimpleDB, and discuss the educational benefits resulting from it.
