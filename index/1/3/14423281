The use of randomness is now an accepted tool in Theoretical Computer Science but not everyone is aware of the underpinnings of this methodology in Combinatorics - particularly, in what is now called the probabilistic Method as developed primarily by Paul Erdoős over the past half century. Here I will explore a particular set of problems - all dealing with “good” colorings of an underlying set of points relative to a given family of sets. A central point will be the evolution of these problems from the purely existential proofs of Erdős to the algorithmic aspects of much interest to this audience.
