The use of high performance composite materials provides a substantial performance improvement for microrobotics. Such materials have great benefits over common MEMs materials such as better fracture toughness and fatigue properties than semiconductors, and higher stiffness to weight ratios than most metals. Composite structures yield remarkable improvements in microrobotic links and joints, as well as greater performance actuators while allowing complicated microrobotic mechanisms to be easily rapid prototyped. The use of such materials in the construction of the 4DOF, 26 joint Micromechanical Flying Insect has reduced the thorax inertia by a factor of 3 and given a 20% increase in resonant frequency over previous designs while cutting construction time from weeks to days.
