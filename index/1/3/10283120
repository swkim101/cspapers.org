For a number of common configurations of points (lines) in the plane, we develop datastructures in which insertions and deletions of points (or lines, respectively) can be processed rapidly without sacrificing much of the efficiency of query answering of known static structures for these configurations. As a main result we establish a fully dynamic maintenance algorithm for convex hulls that can process insertions and deletions of single points in only O(log3n) steps or less per transaction, where n is the number of points currently in the set. The algorithm has several intriguing applications, including that one can “peel” a set of n points in only O(log3n) steps and that one can maintain two sets at a costs of only O(log3n) or less per insertion and deletion such that it never takes more than O(log2n) steps to determine whether the two sets are separable by a straight line. Also efficient algorithms are obtained for dynamically maintaining the common intersection of a set of half-spaces and for dynamically maintaining the maximal elements of a set of plane points. The results are all derived by means of one master technique, which is applied repeatedly and which seems to capture an appropriate notion of “decomposability” for configurations.
