This paper proposes the application of an hp-adaptive pseudospectral for trajectory generation in scenarios with multiple aerial vehicles in order to avoid collisions. This method computes an optimal solution numerically. The method assigns a speed profile to each aerial vehicle in real time such that the separation between them is greater than a minimum safety value and the total deviation from the initial trajectories is minimized. The Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of each aerial vehicle is also taken into account to solve the conflicts. Its computational load and scalability depending on the main parameters of the method are studied. Many simulations have been performed to analyze the best parameters of the method. Experiments have been also carried out in the multivehicle aerial testbed of the Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies (CATEC).
