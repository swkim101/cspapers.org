Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most promising materials for nanoelectronic applications. Before bringing CNTs into large-scale production, a reliable nanorobotic system for automated handling and characterization as well as prototyping of CNT-based components is essential. This paper presents the NanoLab setup, a nanorobotic system that combines specially developed key components such as electrothermal microgrippers and mobile microrobots inside a scanning electron microscope. The working principle and fabrication of mobile microrobots and electrothermal microgripper as well as their interaction and integration is described. Furthermore, the NanoLab is used to explore novel key strategies such as automated locating of CNTs for pick-and-place handling and methods for electrical characterization of CNTs. The results have been achieved within the framework of a European research project where the scientific knowledge will be transfered into an industrial system that will be commercially available for potential customers.
