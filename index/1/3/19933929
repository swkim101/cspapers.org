It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2018 Reasoning on Data Workshop. This workshop will gather people on a timely issue at the crossroad on knowledge representation and reasoning, data management, and the Semantic Web: How to use knowledge to make better use of data The workshop will more precisely focus on reasoning techniques that allow us to exploit domain knowledge in data access. An emblematic task is query answering, but knowledge can be exploited within the whole data lifecycle.
