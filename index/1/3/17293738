In this paper we present data distribution methods for parallel processing environment. The primary objective is to process partial match retrieval type queries for parallel devices.
The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new approach called FX (Fieldwise eXclusive) distribution for maximizing data access concurrency. An algebraic property of exclusive-or operation, and field transformation techniques are fundamental to this data distribution techniques. We have shown through theorems and corollaries that this FX distribution approach performs better than other methods proposed earlier. We have also shown, by computing probability of optimal distribution and query response time, that FX distribution gives better performance than others over a large class of partial match queries. This approach presents a new basis in which optimal data distribution for more general type of queries can be formulated.
