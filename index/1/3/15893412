We leverage the use of air pressure to expand the interaction space within fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). We present three example applications that are not previously possible in conventional fMRI interaction devices: 1) pedal interface that can record continuous pressure value pressed by users, 2) wrist tactile interface that can provide various tactile patterns or stimuli, 3) adjustable resistance joystick that can provide feedback through different resistance levels. Our work shows that the use of air pressure can enable new research opportunities for fMRI researchers.
