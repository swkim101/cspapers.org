Document-level sentiment classiﬁcation aims to predict user’s overall sentiment in a document about a product. However, most of existing methods only focus on local text information and ignore the global user preference and product characteristics. Even though some works take such information into account, they usually suffer from high model complexity and only consider word-level preference rather than semantic levels. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical neural network to incorporate global user and product information into sentiment clas-siﬁcation. Our model ﬁrst builds a hierarchical LSTM model to generate sentence and document representations. Afterwards, user and product information is considered via at-tentions over different semantic levels due to its ability of capturing crucial semantic components. The experimental results show that our model achieves signiﬁcant and consistent improvements compared to all state-of-the-art methods.
