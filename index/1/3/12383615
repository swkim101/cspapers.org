Overview The essence of system-level design is the desire to predict the behavior of complex, heterogeneous systems. To properly assess system-level properties such as security, power consumption, availability, and response time, the impacts of local design decisions on global properties must be predictable. Traditionally associated with physically large systems, system-level design is now increasingly important in computer-based system design. As computer-based systems continue to grow in size, complexity, and societal impact, understanding and addressing system-level design problems has become paramount.
