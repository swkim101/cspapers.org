We assess the effectiveness of an extensive redesign of the first Computer Programming course offered to computer science and computer engineering majors. Our goals were to improve student learning while reducing costs by making use of substantial Web-based course material and course management tools, including multi-level online modules that individualize instruction and enable students to self-schedule learning each week. DFW rates and costs were significantly reduced by the redesign.
