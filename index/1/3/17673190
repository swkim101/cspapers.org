The automatic extraction of comparative information is an important text mining problem and an area of increasing interest. In this paper, we study how to build a Korean comparison mining system. Our work is composed of two consecutive tasks: 1) classifying comparative sentences into different types and 2) mining comparative entities and predicates. We perform various experiments to find relevant features and learning techniques. As a result, we achieve outstanding performance enough for practical use.
