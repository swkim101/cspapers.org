On May 15, 1984, the Oxford University Press formally announced its intention to computerize the Oxford English Dictionary. The OED and its Supplement, which comprise approximately 60 million words, will be entered into a computer; a database design will be created for this integrated version of the Dictionary; and, in addition to its printed form, the Dictionary will be available in electronic form.
