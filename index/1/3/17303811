We show that question-based sentence fusion is a better defined task than generic sentence fusion (Q-based fusions are shorter, display less variety in length, yield more identical results and have higher normalized Rouge scores). Moreover, we show that in a QA setting, participants strongly prefer Q-based fusions over generic ones, and have a preference for union over intersection fusions.
