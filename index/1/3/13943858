The focus of this paper is on software implementations of Dwtributed Shared Memory (DSM). In rweent yeara, many ptotoeola for implementing DSM have been proposed. Performance of these protocols depends on the memory access behavior of the applications. Some reseamhera have proposed DSMS that provide a family of consistency protocols or application-specific protocols, and the programmer is allowed to choose any one of them for each shared memory object (or page) or eaeh stage of an application, While such implementations have a potential for achieving optimal performance, they impose undue burden on the programmer. Therefore, some tiptive schemes that automatically choose the appropriate protocol have been proposed. This paper presenta a simple approach for implementing adaptive DSMS. The appmaeh is illustrated with the example of an adaptive DSM baaed on the invalidate and competitive update plVtoeols. The objective of the adaptive scheme is to minimize a predefine “cost” function. The cost functions considered here are number of messages and amount of data transfer. The proposed scheme allows each node to independently choose (at run-time) a diffenmt protocol for each page. The paper presents experimental evaluation of the adaptive DSM. Results show that the performance is improved by dynamically selecting the appropriate protocol.
