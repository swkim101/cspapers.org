The majority of the experiences and interactions people have on Facebook today are made possible with AI. Well over 1 billion people enjoy unique, personalized experiences on Facebook that are powered by a wealth of AI and machine learning algorithms. AI is an incredibly fast-moving field: engineers and researchers across the company are turning the latest research breakthroughs into tools, platforms, and infrastructure that make it possible for anyone at Facebook to use AI in the experiences and products they build. This talk will look at how Facebook is conducting and applying industry-leading research to help drive advancements in AI disciplines like computer vision, language understanding, speech and video. We will also talk about building an infrastructure that anyone at Facebook can use to easily reuse algorithms in different products, scale to run thousands of simultaneous custom experiments, and give concrete examples of how employees across the company are able to leverage these platforms to build new AI products and services.
