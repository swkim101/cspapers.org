Learning semantic representations and tree structures of bilingual phrases is beneficial for statistical machine translation. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model called Bilingual Correspondence Recursive Autoencoder (BCorrRAE) to model bilingual phrases in translation. We incorporate word alignments into BCorrRAE to allow it freely access bilingual constraints at different levels. BCorrRAE minimizes a joint objective on the combination of a recursive autoencoder reconstruction error, a structural alignment consistency error and a crosslingual reconstruction error so as to not only generate alignment-consistent phrase structures, but also capture different levels of semantic relations within bilingual phrases. In order to examine the effectiveness of BCorrRAE, we incorporate both semantic and structural similarity features built on bilingual phrase representations and tree structures learned by BCorrRAE into a state-of-the-art SMT system. Experiments on NIST Chinese-English test sets show that our model achieves a substantial improvement of up to 1.55 BLEU points over the baseline.
