We propose a user targeting simulator for online display advertising. Based on the response of 37 million visiting users (targeted and non-targeted) and their features, we simulate different user targeting policies. We provide evidence that the standard conversion optimization policy shows similar effectiveness to that of a random targeting, and significantly inferior to other causally optimized targeting policies.
