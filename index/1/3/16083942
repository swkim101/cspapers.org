When computer programs disambiguate words in a sentence, they often encounter non-literal or novel usages not included in their lexicon. In a recent study, Georgia Green (personal communication) estimated that 17% to 20% of the content word senses encountered in various types of normal English text are not fisted in the dictionary. While these novel word senses are generally valid, they occur in such great numbers, and with such little individual frequency that it is impractical to explic i ty include them all within the lexicon. Instead, mechanisms are needed which can derive novel senses from existing ones; thus allowing a program to recognize a significant set of potential word senses while keeping its lexicon within a reasonable size.
