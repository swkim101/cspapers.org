In this demonstration, we present our Semantic Web of Things~(SWoT) prototyping toolkit called SWoTSuite. It is a set of tools supporting an easy and fast prototyping of end-to-end SWoT applications. SWoTSuite facilitates - (i) automation of application development life-cycle, (ii) reducing the amount of time and effort required for developing WoT applications and (iii) an easy integration of semantic web technologies within WoT applications.
