The growing ubiquity of personal connected devices has created the opportunity for a range of applications which tap into their sensors. The sensing requirements of applications often dynamically evolve over time depending on contextual factors, evolving interest in different types of data, or simply to economize resource consumption. The code implementing this evolution is typically mixed with that of the application's functionality. Here we separate the two concerns by modeling the evolution of sensing requirements as transitions between modes. The paper describes ModeSens, an approach to modeling and programming multi-modal sensing requirements of applications. The approach improves programmability by enhancing modularity. Our experimental evaluation measures the performance and energy costs of using ModeSens.
