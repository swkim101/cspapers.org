FIESTA-IoT project provides a blueprint experimental infrastructure, software tools, semantic techniques, certification processes and best practices enabling IoT testbed/platforms to interconnect their facility's resources in an interoperable semantic way. FIESTA-IoT project enables the integration of IoT platform's resources, testbeds infrastructure and their associated applications. FIESTA-IoT opens up new opportunities in the development and deployment of experiments using data from IoT testbeds. The FIESTA-IoT infrastructure enables experimenters to use a single EaaS API (i.e. the FIESTA-IoT EaaS API) for executing experiments over multiple IoT federated testbeds in a testbed agnostic way i.e. like accessing a single large scale virtualized testbed. The main goal of the FIESTA-IoT project is to open new horizons in the development and deployment of IoT applications and experiments at a EU (and global) scale, based on the interconnection and interoperability of diverse IoT platforms and testbeds. FIESTA-IoT project's experimental infrastructure provides to the European experimenters in the IoT domain with the unique capability for accessing and sharing IoT semantically annotated datasets in a testbed-agnostic way. FIESTA-IoT enables execution of experiments across multiple IoT testbeds, based on a single API for submitting the experiment and a single set of credentials for the researcher and the portability of IoT experiments across different testbeds and the provision of interoperable standards-based IoT/cloud interfaces over diverse IoT experimental facilities.
