Service availability is a key non-functional requirement that system architects and integrators seek to achieve. High Availability (HA) can be attained using a dedicated distributed HA middleware that can manage clustered redundant resources to maintain the continuous service delivery even in the presence of failures. Nonetheless, employing such middleware based solutions requires deep knowledge of the domain and substantial configuration effort, which can be a tedious and error prone task. In this paper, we demonstrate an automated approach that mitigates the efforts of configuring HA systems, and allows non-domain experts to easily use specialized HA solutions to increase the reliability of the services provided by their systems.
