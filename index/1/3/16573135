We formulate a problem that arises in unstructured enterprise information management, and has high commercial impact: retrieve knowledge-rich documents in a large textual collection of technical documents. We call such documents principal documents. We exploit the properties of large sparse text collections in order to address this problem. It is known that the centroids of document clusters on such collections form so-called "concept vectors" for the collection. However, typically these centroids do not correspond to documents in the collection. How then should they be used for retrieving documents? An immediate approach is to collect documents that are closest to the centroid, which we call CTC. We also propose an algorithm called PrinDocs. The key insight behind PrinDocs is the following: replace distance functions by coverage. In other words, instead of finding the "closest" documents to a concept vector, find those that "cover" the concept vector. PrinDocs employs greedy weighted set covering and uses the concept decomposition offered by centroids, but does not use the cosine distance on documents. We compare CTC and PrinDocs for retrieving knowledge-rich documents in enterprise unstructured technical collections. We demonstrate that PrinDocs comprehensively outperforms CTC. Our work suggests that coverage based approaches might be preferable to distance based ones for similar retrieval tasks.
