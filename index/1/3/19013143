Consider the stnng matching problem, where differences between characters of the pattern and characters of the text are allowed. Each difference is due to either a mismatch between a character of the text and a character of the pattern or a superfluous character in the text or a superfluous character in the pattern. Given a text of length n, a pattern of length m and an integer k, we present parallel and serial algorithms for finding all occurrences of the pattern in the text with at most k differences. The first part of the parallel algorithm consists of analysis of the pattern and takes 0 (log m ) time using m 2 processors. The rest of the algorithm consists of handling the text. The text han1.
