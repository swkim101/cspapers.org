There is no prior work on exact kinematic modeling for a pipeline robot having three powered chains. This work presents the closed-form kinematic model of the pipeline inspection robot driven by three caterpillar wheel chains. Next, optimal kinematic parameters are analyzed by using isotropic index and force transmission ration. Lastly, the feasibility of the kinematic model is verified through motion simulation for a virtual pipeline equipped with elbows and T-branches.
