We introduce an extension of switching linear dynamic systems (SLDS) with parameterized duration modeling capabilities. The proposed model allows arbitrary duration models and overcomes the limitation of a geometric distribution induced in standard SLDSs. By incorporating a duration model which reflects the data more closely, the resulting model provides reliable inference results which are robust against observation noise. Moreover, existing inference algorithms for SLDSs can be adopted with only modest additional effort in most cases where an SLDS model can be applied. In addition, we observe the fact that the duration models would vary across data sequences in certain domains, which complicates learning and inference tasks. Such variability in duration is overcome by introducing parameterized duration models. The experimental results on honeybee dance decoding tasks demonstrate the robust inference capabilities of the proposed model.
