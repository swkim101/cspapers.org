We introduce a new construction of error-correcting codes from algebraic curves over finite fields. Modular curves of genus g\ra\infty over a field of size q_0^2 yield nonlinear codes more efficient than the linear Goppa codes obtained from the same curves. These new codes now have the highest asymptotic transmission rates known for certain ranges of alphabet size and error rate. Both the theory and possible practical use of these new record codes require the development of new tools. On the theoretical side, establishing the transmission rate depends on an error estimate for a theorem of Schanuel applied to the function field of an asymptotically optimal curve. On the computational side, actual use of the codes will hinge on the solution of new problems in the computational algebraic geometry of curves.
