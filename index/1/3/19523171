Computing, together with jewelry design and 3D printing offers an innovative introduction to the possibilities of technology and programming. This combination was presented to participants of a weeklong summer technology day camp focusing on computer-aided design (CAD) using jewelry design and modeling. The participants then saw their design creations built through 3D printing. In this paper we present the design of a weeklong day camp called "Computing and Jewelry Design". Initial findings are positive and suggest opportunities for improvement.
