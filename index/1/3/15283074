In this paper we discuss Poligon, a skeletal system for the development of concurrent blackboard based applications, its architecture and the motivation for its design. A number of experiments have been performed in order to evaluate the performance of Poligon. Some of these are detailed and the results are shown. Lessons learned in the development of Poligon are given and conclusions about the performance of similar systems are drawn.
