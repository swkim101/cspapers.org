We demonstrate TrussFab's editor for creating large-scale structures that are sturdy enough to carry human weight. TrussFab achieves the large scale by using plastic bottles as beams that form structurally sound node-link structures, also known as trusses, allowing it to handle the forces resulting from scale and load. During this hands-on demo at UIST, attendees will use the TrussFab software to design their own structures, validate their design using integrated structural analysis, and export their designs for 3D printing.
