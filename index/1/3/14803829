We present a technique for estimating the 6DOF pose of a PTZ camera by tracking a single moving target in the image with known 3D position. This is useful in situations where it is not practical to measure the camera pose directly. Our application domain is estimating the pose of a PTZ camera so that it can be used for automated GPS-based tracking and filming of UAV flight trials. We present results which show the technique is able to localize a PTZ after a short vision-tracked flight, and that the estimated pose is sufficiently accurate for the PTZ to then actively track a UAV based on GPS position data.
