Many computer systems include extra bits in each word of storage to allow detection (and possibly correction) of memory failures. These same bits can be used to implement tag-checking without sacrificing their normal error-handling properties. The tagging facility so provided can be used to detect a variety of hardware and software errors that might otherwise go undetected. Because no extra storage is required, the cost of adding such tagging can be small even though the benefit derived can be large.
