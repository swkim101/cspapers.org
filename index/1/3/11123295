In this paper, a memory-based parsing method is extended for handling compositional structures. The method is oriented for learning to parse any selected subset of target syntactic structures. It is local, yet can handle also compositional structures. Parts of speech as well as embedded instances are being used simultaneously. The output is a partial parse in which instances of the target structures are marked.
