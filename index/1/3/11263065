This will be a live demonstration of FindBugs, a static analysis bug finding tool, on the current development version of Eclipse 3.4. FindBugs reports issues such as null pointer dereferences, comparing incompatible types with equals, invalid method calls, infinite recursive loops, bad integer operations, and more. FindBugs reports more than 400 such issues in Eclipse 3.3.
 During this demonstration, we'll give a quick overview of the FindBugs GUI andwalk through 10-20 bug warnings, categorize each warning as to whether or not fixing the issue is important, and enter comments about the bug. We'll be able to browse warnings by date of introduction, so we can see if the issues introduced in the past month are more or less serious than the issues that have been in the code base since Eclipse 3.3, 3.2 or earlier. Vocal audience participation is encouraged, and participants with laptops can follow along and enter their own categorization and comments either during the demonstration or afterwards. Audience members with commit privileges to the Eclipse project will get free FindBugs T-shirts.
 We'll also briefly demonstrate how to set up FindBugs as part of a production development environment.
