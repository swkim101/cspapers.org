Understanding the process of categorization is a primary research goal in artificial intelligence. The conceptual space framework provides a flexible approach to modeling context-sensitive categorization via a geometrical representation designed for modeling and managing concepts. In this paper we show how algorithms developed in computational geometry, and the Region Connection Calculus can be used to model important aspects of categorization in conceptual spaces. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of using existing geometric algorithms to build and manage categories in conceptual spaces, and we show how the Region Connection Calculus can be used to reason about categories and other conceptual regions.
