This paper presents a new method for relative localization of a pair of robots based on the trajectories described by unidentifiable moving objects. Our approach uses a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to estimate both the relative location of the robots and the data associations between the moving objects around the robots. We describe our implementation on real robots and present experiments illustrating the robustness of our algorithm.
