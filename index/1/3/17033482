This supplement presents additional details in support of the full article. These include the application of the majorization method to maximum entropy problems. It also contains proofs of the various theorems, in particular, a guarantee that the bound majorizes the partition function. In addition, a proof is provided guaranteeing convergence on (non-latent) maximum conditional likelihood problems. The supplement also contains supporting lemmas that show the bound remains applicable in constrained optimization problems. The supplement then proves the soundness of the junction tree implementation of the bound for graphical models with large n. It also proves the soundness of the low-rank implementation of the bound for problems with large d. Finally, the supplement contains additional experiments and figures to provide further empirical support for the majorization methodology. Supplement for Section 2 Proof of Theorem 1 Rewrite the partition function as a sum over the integer index j = 1, . . . , n under the random ordering π : Ω !→ {1, . . . , n}. This defines j = π(y) and associates h and f with hj = h(π−1(j)) and fj = f(π−1(j)). Next, write Z(θ) = ∑n j=1 αj exp(λ fj) by introducing λ = θ − θ and αj = hj exp(θfj). Define the partition function over only the first i components as Zi(θ) = ∑i j=1 αj exp(λ fj). When i = 0, a trivial quadratic upper bound holds Z0(θ) ≤ z0 exp ( 1 2λ Σ0λ+ λ μ0 ) with the parameters z0 → 0,μ0 = 0, and Σ0 = z0I. Next, add one term to the current partition function Z1(θ) = Z0(θ) + α1 exp(λf1). Apply the current bound Z0(θ) to obtain Z1(θ) ≤ z0 exp( 2λ Σ0λ+ λ μ0) + α1 exp(λ f1). Consider the following change of variables u = Σ 0 λ−Σ −1/2 0 (f1 − μ0)) γ = α1 z0 exp( 1 2 (f1 − μ0) "Σ−1 0 (f1 − μ0)) and rewrite the logarithm of the bound as logZ1(θ) ≤ log z0 − 2 (f1 − μ0) "Σ−1 0 (f1 − μ0) + λf1 + log ( exp( 2‖u‖ ) + γ ) . Apply Lemma 1 (cf. [32] p. 100) to the last term to get logZ1(θ) ≤ log z0 − 2 (f1 − μ0) "Σ−1 0 (f1 − μ0) + λf1 + log ( exp ( 1 2‖v‖ 2 ) +γ ) + v"(u− v) 1+γ exp(− 2‖v‖) + 1 2 (u− v)" ( I + Γvv" ) (u− v)
