In this paper, we propose an approach where robots store shared experiences between human and the robots, and also show that the shared experiences act as an important role not only for the coexistence of the human and robots but also for the realization of the supporting ability of the robots. Enormous amount of shared experiences are effective for the understanding of users under uncertain and incomplete conditions, as well as communication among human. We propose the importance of the shared experiences for real world intelligence, and show a development research of the infrastructure for the storage of the share experiences and application method.
