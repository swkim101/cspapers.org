Radio Tomographic Imaging in Wireless Sensor Networks aims at locating people while using only a network of inexpensive nodes. This system already has enabled "see-through-walls" applications. Nevertheless, the vast majority of surveyed techniques use only the Received Signal Strength Indication as input information, while overlooking the Link Quality Indication. We performed an experimental evaluation during 13 days, that shows that the variation of the Link Quality Indication of transitional links sampled at a period of ~ms is notably sensitive to the movement of people. We expect that this finding will contribute to improving the accuracy of Radio Tomographic Imaging by enabling the use of Link Quality Indication to complement Received Signal Strength Indication information.
