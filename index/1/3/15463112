Data gathering is one of the most common applications of wireless sensor networks. Such networks are an extremely useful tool for researchers in various domains since they allow for measurements in unaccessible locations, e.g., on mountains, glaciers or in animal habitats. At the same time, the deployment and maintenance of such sites is time consuming and costly. Network reprogramming protocols allow to distribute code updates over the wireless network, which prolongs the interval between human intervention at the deployment site.
 While network reprogramming has been studied extensively in the literature, existing bulk data dissemination protocols often do not work well together with data gathering applications which operate at low duty-cycles. We present a reliable data dissemination protocol designed for energy-efficient operation at low duty-cycles. A simple remote procedure call mechanism is used to control and monitor single nodes during the update process, which provides maximal observability during network reprogramming.
