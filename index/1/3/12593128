This paper addresses the problem of rearrangement planning, i.e. to find a feasible trajectory for a robot that must interact with multiple objects in order to achieve a goal. We propose a planner to solve the rearrangement planning problem by considering two different types of actions: robot-centric and object-centric. Object-centric actions guide the planner to perform specific actions on specific objects. Robot-centric actions move the robot without object relevant intent, easily allowing simultaneous object contact and whole arm interaction. We formulate a hybrid planner that uses both action types. We evaluate the planner on tasks for a mobile robot and a household manipulator.
