Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as multi-copters are expected to be used for inspection of aged infrastructure or for searching damaged buildings in the event of a disaster. However, in a confined space in such environments, UAVs suffer a high risk of falling as a result of contact with an obstacle. To ensure an aerial inspection in the confined space, we have proposed a UAV with a passive rotating spherical shell (PRSS UAV); The UAV and the spherical shell are connected by a 3DOF gimbal mechanism to allow them to rotate in all directions independently, so that the UAV can maintain its flight stability during a collision with an obstacle because only the shell is disturbed and rotated. To apply the PRSS UAV into real-world missions, we have to carefully choose many design parameters such as weight, structure, diameter, strength of the spherical shell, axis configuration of the gimbal, and model of the UAV. In this paper, we propose a design strategy for applying the concept of the PRSS mechanism, focusing on disaster response and infrastructure inspection. We also demonstrate the validity of this approach by the successful result of quantitative experiments and practical field tests.
