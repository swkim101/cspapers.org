There has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions and emotions in text. In this paper, we present the first experimental results classifying the strength of opinions and other types of subjectivity and classifying the subjectivity of deeply nested clauses. We use a wide range of features, including new syntactic features developed for opinion recognition. In 10-fold cross-validation experiments using support vector regression, we achieve improvements in mean-squared error over baseline ranging from 57% to 64%.
