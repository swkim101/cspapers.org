We investigate automatic classification of speculative language (‘hedging’), in biomedical text using weakly supervised machine learning. Our contributions include a precise description of the task with annotation guidelines, analysis and discussion, a probabilistic weakly supervised learning model, and experimental evaluation of the methods presented. We show that hedge classification is feasible using weakly supervised ML, and point toward avenues for future research.
