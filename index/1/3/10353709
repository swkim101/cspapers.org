Finding rising stars is a challenging and interesting task which is being investigated recently in co-author networks. Rising stars are authors who have a low research profile in the start of their career but may become experts in the future. This paper introduces a new method Weighted Mutual Influence Rank (WMIRank) for finding rising stars. WMIRank exploits influence of co-authors' citations, order of appearance and publication venues. Comprehensive experiments are performed to analyze the performance of WMIRank in comparison to baseline methods, which have ignored weighted mutual influence. AMiner data for years 1995-2000 is used for experiments. List of top 30 authors as per proposed and baseline methods are compared for their average number of papers, average number of citations and achievements. Experimental results provide convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the investigated weighted mutual influence.
