Live programming is an idea espoused by programming environments from the earliest days of computing (such as Lisp machines and SmallTalk) but have since lain dormant. Recently, the prevalence of asynchronous feedback in programming languages such as Javascript and advances in visualizations and user interfaces have lead to a resurgence of live programming in online education communities (such as Khan Academy) and in experimental IDEs (such as LightTable). The LIVE 2013 workshop includes 11 papers describing visions, implementations, mashups, and new directions of live programming environments. The participants include both practitioners of live coding and researchers in programming languages and software engineering. Finally, several demos curated on the live workshop page are presented.
