The usage of data in many commercial applications has been growing at an unprecedented pace in the last decade. While successful data mining efforts lead to major business advances, there were also numerous, less publicized efforts that for one or another reason failed.

We use two significant Yahoo's applications as illustrative examples: shopping categorization and behavioral targeting; and reflect on four success factors: methodology, data, infrastructure, and people.
