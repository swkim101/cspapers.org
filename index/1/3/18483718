RST-style document-level discourse parsing remains a difﬁcult task and efﬁcient deep learning models on this task have rarely been presented. In this paper, we propose an attention-based hierarchical neural network model for discourse parsing. We also incorporate tensor-based transformation function to model complicated feature interactions. Experimental results show that our approach obtains comparable performance to the contemporary state-of-the-art systems with little manual feature engineering.
