This paper presents a closed form solution for the dynamic model of a parallel robot. This robot is utilized like a haptic interface for a surgical simulator used in the amnicentesis operation. The dynamic model is obtained by using the Lagrange formulation applied to parallel robot. It is proved that for a large class of parallel robots which has some properties, it is possible to avoid the explicit calculation of Lagrange multipliers. The aim is to simplify the calculation for a real-time application.
