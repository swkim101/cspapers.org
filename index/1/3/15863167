This paper deals with iterated revision of partially ordered information. The first part of this paper concerns the Katsuno-Mendelzon's postulates: we first point out that these postulates are not fully satisfactory since only a class of partially ordered information can be revised. We then propose a suitable definition of faithful assignment, followed by a new set of postulates and a representation theorem. The second part of this paper investigates additional postulates dedicated to iterated revision operators of partially ordered information. Three extensions of well-known iterated belief revision operations for dealing with partially ordered information are briefly presented.
