In this paper we discuss some of the tasks administrators of Usenet news servers are dealing with. Although significant progress has been made in regard to server technology (both hardware and software) most news server administration tools still are unixoid, text−based tools. Traffic visualizations are commonly used but graphical interfaces as they might be envisioned by HCI people hardly exist. We speculate about the "mental image" news administrators might have and if a high− level language / graphical programming environment like LabView were useful to the realm of Usenet servers.
