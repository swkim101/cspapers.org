The interaction between programmer and programming language affects the maintainability, reliability, and understandability of the resulting programs. Their results are important both to the educator and to the language designer, particularly when examining languages to be used when teaching beginning programmers. The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the methodology and results of a number of these research studies.
