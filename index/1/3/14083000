We present a semantic model for knowledge with the following properties: (1) Knowledge is necessarily correct, (2) agents are logically omniscient, i.e., they know all the consequences of their knowledge, and (3) agents are positively introspective, i.e., they are aware of their knowledge, but not negatively introspective, i.e., they may not be aware of their ignorance. We argue that this is the appropriate model for implicit knowledge. We investigate the properties of the model, and use it to formalize the notion of circumscribed knowledge.
