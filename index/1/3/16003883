In this paper a variational approach for the combined segmentation and registration of temporal image sequences is presented. The purpose of the proposed method is to estimate respiratory-induced organ motion in temporal CT image sequences and to segment a structure of interest simultaneously. In this model the segmentation of all images in the sequences is obtained by finding a non-linear registration to an initial segmentation in a reference image. A dense non-linear displacement field is estimated using image intensities and segmentation information in the images. Both problems (registration and segmentation) are formulated in a joint variational approach and solved simultaneously. A validation of the combined registration and segmentation approach is presented and demonstrates that the simultaneous solution of both problems improves the segmentation performance over a sequential application of the registration and segmentation steps.
