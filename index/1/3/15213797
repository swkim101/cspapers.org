To solve the problem of fast thermal and electrostatic simulation of microsystem elements two different field solver tools have been developed at TUB. The /spl mu/S-THERMANAL program is capable for the fast steady state and dynamic simulation of suspended multilayered microsystem structures, while the 2D-SUNRED program is the first version of a general field solver program, based on an original method, successive network reduction. This program offers a very fast and accurate substitute for FEM programs for the solution of the Poisson equation, e.g. solving a 32000 grid problem in about 6 minutes on a 586 PC. Application examples show the usability of the tools.
