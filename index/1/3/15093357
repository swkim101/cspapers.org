In this paper we focus on representing Web and social graphs. Our work is motivated by the need of mining information out of these graphs, thus our representations do not only aim at compressing the graphs, but also at supporting efficient navigation. This allows us to process bigger graphs in main memory, avoiding the slowdown brought by resorting on external memory. We first show how by just partitioning the graph and combining two existing techniques for Web graph compression, k2-trees [Brisaboa, Ladra and Navarro, SPIRE 2009] and RePair-Graph [Claude and Navarro, TWEB 2010], exploiting the fact that most links are intra-domain, we obtain the best time/space trade-off for direct and reverse navigation when compared to the state of the art. In social networks, splitting the graph to achieve a good decomposition is not easy. For this case, we explore a new proposal for indexing MPK linearizations [Maserrat and Pei, KDD 2010], which have proven to be an effective way of representing social networks in little space by exploiting common dense subgraphs. Our proposal offers better worst case bounds in space and time, and is also a competitive alternative in practice.
