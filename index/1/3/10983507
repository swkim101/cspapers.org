The knowledge organization of a rule-based damage assessment system of existing structures subjected to earthquake excitation is outlined in this paper. A principle of inexact inference to obtain a rational solution is presented. The fuzzy set theory and the production system with certainty factor are employed jointly in the inexact inference to deal with the continuous nature of the damage state and to attain the modularity of uncertain knowledge, respectively.
