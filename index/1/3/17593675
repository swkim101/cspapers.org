We show that phrase structures in Penn Treebank style parses are not optimal for syntaxbased machine translation. We exploit a series of binarization methods to restructure the Penn Treebank style trees such that syntactified phrases smaller than Penn Treebank constituents can be acquired and exploited in translation. We find that by employing the EM algorithm for determining the binarization of a parse tree among a set of alternative binarizations gives us the best translation result.
