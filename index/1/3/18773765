This paper extends the notion of minimum edit distance in strings to parameterized edit distance, based on operations of insertion, deletion, and parameterized match (2, 11. The parameterized match operation models global substitution, commonly available in editors. Algorithms are described for calculating minimum parameterized edit distance and reporting minimal edit scripts. Several applications are discussed, and the techniques are also extended to approximate parameterized pattern matching.
