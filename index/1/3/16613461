Tactile sensors for slip detection are essential for implementing human-like gripping in a robot hand. In previous studies, we proposed flexible, thin and lightweight slip detection sensors utilizing the characteristics of pressure-sensitive conductive rubber. This was achieved by using the high-frequency vibration component generated in the process of slipping of the gripped object in order to distinguish between slipping of the object and changes in the normal force. In this paper, we design a slip detection sensor for a multi-fingered robot hand and examine the influence of noise caused by the operation of such a hand. Finally, we describe an experiment focusing on the adjustment of the gripping force of a multi-fingered robot hand equipped with the developed sensors
