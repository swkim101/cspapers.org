Linked Open Data initiatives have fostered the publication of Linked Data sets, as well as the deployment of publicly available SPARQL endpoints as client-server querying infrastructures to access these data sets. However, recent studies reveal that SPARQL endpoints may exhibit significant limitations in supporting real-world applications, and public linked data sets can suffer of quality issues, e.g., data can be incomplete or incorrect. We tackle these problems and propose a novel hybrid architecture that relies on shipping policies to improve the performance of SPARQL endpoints, and exploits human and machine query processing computation to enhance the quality of Linked Data sets. We report on initial empirical results that suggest that the proposed techniques overcome current drawbacks, and may provide a novel solution to make these promising infrastructures available for real-world applications.
