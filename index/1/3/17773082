Television sets and video game consoles equipped with a web browser have appeared, and we are now able to browse web pages on television screens. However, existing navigation techniques are too difficult in this situation. In this paper, we propose Arrow Tag, a new link selection technique for web browsers on TV. In this technique, sequences of arrow signs called Arrow Tags are assigned to the links of the web pages, so users can select the links by pushing the four direction keys a few times, while keeping her/his gaze fixed on the television screen. User studies show that Arrow Tag significantly outperforms the conventional techniques of Focus Move and Number Tag. Moreover, most participants preferred Arrow Tag over either Focus Move or Number Tag.
