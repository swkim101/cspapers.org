We present a kinematic algorithm of multifingered manipulation. To model the motion of the hand-object system with rolling contact, two equations are necessary: the equation of contact and the one describing the relationship between the object velocity and the joint velocity. We provide a simple method in developing the second equation. By defining the orthogonal decomposition of the velocity spaces of the object and joints, the equation is obtained with much less computation than the existing approaches. Using the equation, the velocity of contact points can be expressed explicitly in terms of the self-motion of finger joints of a redundant manipulation system. This makes it easier to adjust the positions of contact points on the object to achieve the desired grasping stability. The algorithm is general in terms of the types of grasps and contact models it considers. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the algorithm.
