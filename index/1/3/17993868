A theorem of Markov precisely determines the number r of NEGATION gates necessary and sucient to compute a system of boolean functions F. For a system of boolean functions on n variables, r b(n )= dlog2(n +1 )e. We call a circuit using b(n) NEGATION gates negation-limited. We continue recent investigations into negation-limited circuit complexity, giving both upper and lower bounds. A circuit with inputs x1;:::;xn and outputs :x1;:::;:xn is called an inverter, for which r = dlog2(n +1 )e. Fischer has constructed negation-limited inverters of size O(n 2 logn) and depth O(logn). Recently, Tanaka and Nishino have reduced the circuit size to O(nlog 2 n) at the expense of increasing the depth to log 2 n. We construct negation-limited inverters of size O(nlogn), with depth only O(logn), and we conjecture that this is optimal. We also improve a technique of Valiant for constructing monotone circuits for slice functions (introduced by Berkowitz). Next, we introduce some lower bound techniques for negation-limited circuits. We provide a 5n + 3log(n +1 )i c lower bound for the size of a negation-limited inverter. In addition, we show that for two dierent restricted classes of circuit, negation-limited inverters require superlinear size.
