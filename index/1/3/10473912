We describe a framework for a micro-blogging social network implemented in an unstructured peer-to-peer network. A micro-blogging social network must provide capabilities for users to (i) publish, (ii) follow and (iii) search. Our retrieval mechanism is based on a probably approximately correct (PAC) search architecture in which a query is sent to a fixed number of nodes in the network. In PAC, the probability of attaining a particular accuracy is a function of the number of nodes queried (fixed) and the replication rate of documents (micro-blog). Publishing a micro-blog then becomes a matter of replicating the micro-blog to the required number of random nodes without any central coordination. To solve this, we use techniques from the field of rumour spreading (gossip protocols) to propagate new documents. Our document spreading algorithm is designed such that a document has a very high probability of being copied to only the required number of nodes. Results from simulations performed on networks of 10,000, 100,000 and 500,000 nodes verify our mathematical models. The framework is also applicable for indexing dynamic web pages in a distributed search engine or for a system which indexes newly created BitTorrents in a decentralized environment.
