This paper describes an underactuated robot finger whose link posture is controlled by using dynamical effect. The finger posture control method where the vibration center angles of the active joint and the passive one are controlled independently of each other, is proposed. First we introduce the analytical model of two-joint two-link system which has the active joint driven by an actuator and the passive joint with a viscoelastic element. Based on the model, we theoretically reveal Variable Vibration Center Effect (VVCE) of the viscoelastic joint with respect to the input frequency of the active joint. We then discuss how to control the finger link posture by utilizing the effect. We show the finger mechanism design for grasping an object and for expanding the working space. Finally, we experimentally confirm the proposed method and demonstrate a grasping motion by the prototype.
