We report on the design and development of a Run Time Support System (RTS) which overcomes known disadvantages of other existing systems. The RTS is independent of the configuration - if the system is reconfigured there is no need to change user's processes. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication.
A system based on the same design philosophy with this RTS is actually implemented for messages of arbitrary length in the prototype of the PADMAVATI machine, being developed within ESPRIT Project 1219 (967). Experiments were conducted in this environment and performance measurements were obtained and are reported here.
