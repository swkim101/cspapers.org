This paper furnishes the theoretical basis to perform the calibration of one or more ultra-high-precision industrial robots operating in the same workspace. We propose a new calibration procedure that keeps in account the factors that lower the robot accuracy at nanometer scale. To validate this approach, we present the practical case of the calibration of a two industrial robots system. Finally, we propose nano-indentation as an alternative method to evaluate the final accuracy reached by the system after calibration.
