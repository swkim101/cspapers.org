Business-to-business (B2B) exchanges provide opportunities for companies to streamline their supply chains in dynamic business situations, but also create new management challenges. Managers are faced with more buying and selling decisions, more available information, and even new problems such as speculation. Due to these new challenges, trading support systems will play an important role in helping companies achieve maximum profits in B2B exchanges. This paper presents an agent-based framework focusing on two core functionalities of such systems, bidding and speculating, in the context of Continuous Double Auction (CDA). The CDA is a market institution where a group of buyers and a group of sellers simultaneously and asynchronously announce bids and offers. [1, 2, 3, 5] and [6] have designed different CDA bidding agents such as Zero-Intelligence(ZI) traders, Zero-Intelligence Plus(ZIP) traders and GD traders. All of these models assume constant supply and demand. We extend these works to more dynamic and realistic B2B exchange situations where both demand and supply change from period to period. Specifically, we focus on designing algorithms that enable agents to make speculation decisions, since the action of speculation, motivated by changing demand and supply, is one fundamental aspect of exchanges in general, and is the main way to hedge against costly shortages in B2B exchanges.
