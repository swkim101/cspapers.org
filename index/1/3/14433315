Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become one of the most popular optimization methods for training machine learning models on massive datasets. However, SGD suffers from two main drawbacks: (i) The noisy gradient updates have high variance, which slows down convergence as the iterates approach the optimum, and (ii) SGD scales poorly in distributed settings, typically experiencing rapidly decreasing marginal benefits as the number of workers increases. In this paper, we propose a highly parallel method, CentralVR, that uses error corrections to reduce the variance of SGD gradient updates, and scales linearly with the number of worker nodes. CentralVR enjoys low iteration complexity, provably linear convergence rates, and exhibits linear performance gains up to hundreds of cores for massive datasets. We compare CentralVR to state-of-the-art parallel stochastic optimization methods on a variety of models and datasets, and find that our proposed methods exhibit stronger scaling than other SGD variants.
