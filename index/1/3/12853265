Under the joint influence of the presentation of search results and users' browsing and clicking habits, the click probability distribution does not merely obey a monotonic decreasing Zipf function. In this paper, we present evidence that the click behavior on the entries of search engines' result pages is influenced by Serial Position Effect, which is independent of how these entries are ordered, and introduce a new function to characterize the click probability distribution.
