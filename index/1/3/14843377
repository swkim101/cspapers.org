This paper presents a new video advertising system, called AdOn, which supports intelligent overlay video ads. Unlike most current ad-networks such as Youtube that overlay the ads at fixed positions in the videos (e.g., on the bottom fifth of videos 15 seconds in), AdOn is able to automatically detect a set of spatio-temporal nonintrusive positions and associate the contextually relevant ads with these positions. The overlay positions are obtained on the basis of video structuring, face and text detection, as well as visual saliency analysis, so that the intrusiveness to the users can be minimized. The ads are selected according to content-based multimodal relevance so that advertising relevance can be maximized. AdOn represents one of the first attempts towards intelligent overlay video advertising by leveraging video content analysis techniques.
