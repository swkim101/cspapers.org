Much attention has been directed to paging algorithms and little to the role of the user in this environment. This paper describes an experiment which is an attempt to determine the significance of efforts by the user to improve the paging characteristics of his program. The problem of throughput in a computing system is primarily one of balancing the flow of data and programs through a hierarchy of storages. The problem is considered solved when for every available processor cycle there is a matching demand for that cycle in the primary (execution) store. Since programs and their data usually originate in a location other than the execution store, there is a delay associated with the movement of data and programs to the primary store. The delay has two components, the operational speed (data transfer time) and the positioning, or access time, of the secondary storage device. Since the access time usually exceeds the data transfer time by an order of magnitude, the problem of transferring information to the primary store has been named the “access gap” problem.
