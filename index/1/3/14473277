We define the class of algebraic models of /spl mu/-calculi and study whether every such model can be embedded into a model which is a complete lattice. We show that this is false in the general case and focus then on free modal /spl mu/-algebras, i.e. Lindenbaum algebras of the propositional modal /spl mu/-calculus. We prove the following fact: the MacNeille-Dedekind completion of a free modal /spl mu/-algebra is a complete modal algebra, hence a modal /spl mu/-algebra (i.e. an algebraic model of the propositional modal /spl mu/-calculus). The canonical embedding of the free modal /spl mu/-algebra into its Dedekind-MacNeille completion preserves the interpretation of all the terms in the class Comp(/spl Sigma//sub 1//spl Pi//sub 1/) of the alternation-depth hierarchy. The proof uses algebraic techniques only and does not directly rely on previous work on the completeness of the modal /spl mu/-calculus.
