Certain general properties of man's ability to interpret the actions of other persons are discussed. Some distinguishing features of this common-sense theory include the nature of the modal operators of Can and Try, the asymmetry of implication, and the capacity to embed models within models.

This model arrives at a specific interpretation of another's actions by showing that these actions represent a possible path to a particular goal that is consistent with the axioms of the belief system's theory of human motivation and personality organization.
