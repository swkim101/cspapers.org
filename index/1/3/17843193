This paper uses periodic matrix multiplication to improve the time complexities for a number of graph problems. The time for finding a clique cutset in a graph is reduced from O(<i>nm</i>) to O(<i>n</i><sup>2.69</sup>), the time for finding an asteroidal triple is reduced to O(<i>n</i><sup>2.82</sup>), and the time for finding a star cutset, a two-pair, and a dominating pair is reduced from O(<i>nm</i>) to O(<i>n</i><sup>2.79</sup>).It is also shown that each of these problems is at least as hard as one of three basic graph problems for which the best known algorithms run in time O(<i>nm</i>) and O(<i>n</i><sup>Î±</sup>).
