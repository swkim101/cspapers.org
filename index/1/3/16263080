This paper introduces a novel hierarchical summarization approach for automatic multi-document summarization. By creating a hierarchical representation of the words in the input document set, the proposed approach is able to incorporate various objectives of multi-document summarization through an integrated framework. The evaluation is conducted on the DUC 2007 data set.
