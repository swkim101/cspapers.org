The foundation of a language for a mobile agent – robot or human – is the representation of spatial and temporal concepts. These concepts include where and when events, objects and agents are located in space and time. This paper presents an overview of the Lingodroid project, in which real and simulated robots play language games to ground concepts for effective communication about their world. A series of location language games is described, with typical lexicons presented. We present future plans to extend the abilities of the robots to ground concepts for objects attributes, actions, and time.
