The breakthrough result of Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman (2016) gives a reduction from the construction of explicit two-source extractors to the construction of explicit non-malleable extractors. However, even assuming the existence of optimal explicit non-malleable extractors only gives a two-source extractor (or a Ramsey graph) for poly(logn) entropy, rather than the optimal O(logn). In this paper we modify the construction to solve the above barrier. Using the currently best explicit non-malleable extractors we get an explicit bipartite Ramsey graphs for sets of size 2k, for k=O(logn loglogn). Any further improvement in the construction of non-malleable extractors would immediately yield a corresponding two-source extractor. Intuitively, Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman use an extractor as a sampler, and we observe that one could use a weaker object - a somewhere-random condenser with a small entropy gap and a very short seed. We also show how to explicitly construct this weaker object using the error reduction technique of Raz, Reingold and Vadhan (1999), and the constant-degree dispersers of Zuckerman (2006) that also work against extremely small tests.
