Although the relational model of data has been around since 1970, it has not been very easy for the practitioners to understand it. A part of this difficulty can be attributed to the fact that there is no easy-to-understand method for normalization of existing data which will enable users to visualize their own data relationally. Moreover, relational model serves an important function as a tool in the problems related to design or conversion of data. Practitioner's accessibility of this tool can be facilitated if an intuitive procedure to normalize existing data in a general network form is developed. This paper is an extension of the author's concept of Schema Analysis and Schema Diagrams (see [6]) in that direction. The problem is discussed in the context of database design.
