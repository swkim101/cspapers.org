Brief consideration is given to some properties of three measures of complexity based on the length of minimal descriptive programs. Although the measures explicitly deal with finite sequences, the complexity of an infinite sequence can be regarded as a function mapping each positive integer n to the complexity of the initial segment of length n. Some properties of a complexity hierarchy of infinite sequences with respect to one of the measures is considered.
