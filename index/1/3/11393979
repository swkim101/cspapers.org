In addition to their role as a summative measure, midterm tests can provide formative feedback that can be used by students to identify areas of weakness and adjust studying approaches. Unfortunately, low levels of test pickup often preclude this type of learning from tests. Even when students do collect their marked tests, it is unclear how much they reflect on or learn from the feedback. Exam wrappers have been designed and used in other sciences to promote reflection on tests and improve study practices. In this paper, we introduce exam wrappers into a CS course. We outline our adoption of exam wrappers, and illustrate how we as educators can learn from student responses on exam wrappers. We also describe an experiment comparing three styles of exam wrapper. Although it did not find significant differential impact on exam scores, we find, for all wrapper styles, improved test pickup rates and qualitative evidence that students successfully reflect on past behaviour and recognize improved study strategies.
