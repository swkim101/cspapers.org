This paper presents an improved mode shape function-based 3D dynamic model for pneumatic muscle actuated continuum arms, and validates the model and simulation results through experimental testing. The model also facilitates the direct control of pneumatic muscle actuated continuum arms through the use of input pressure. This is achieved without additional intermediary transformations and does not have singularity problems present in previous models. The proposed arm model uses a new pneumatic muscle actuator (PMA) dynamic model with hysteresis that is capable of modelling both extending and contracting PMAs. The proposed hysteric model is simple, easily adaptable, and validated experimentally. The PMA model can be applied to dynamically model any PMA based system as well as PMA actuated continuum arms utilizing different actuator configurations.
