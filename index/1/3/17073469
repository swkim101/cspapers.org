Nowadays, sound event detection (SED) is a popular study in machine listening area. Detecting overlapping sound events, in which many sound events occur simultaneously, is challenging and interesting topic. Besides, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and its derived methods are suitably used to perform SED. This paper presents a survey of recent approaches in SED based on NMF methods that provides the understanding and strategies for detecting polyphonic sound events.
