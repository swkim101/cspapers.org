This paper aims to investigate how the geographical footprints of users correlate to their social ties. While conventional wisdom told us that the more frequently two users co-locate in geography, the higher probability they are friends, we find that in real geo-social data, Gowalla and Meetup, almost all of the user pairs with friendships had never met geographically. In this sense, can we discover social ties among users purely using their geographical footprints even if they never met? To study this question, we develop a two-stage feature engineering framework. The first stage is to characterize the direct linkages between users through their spatial co-locations while the second is to capture the indirect linkages between them via a co-location graph. Experiments conducted on Gowalla check-in data and Meetup meeting events exhibit not only the superiority of our feature model, but also validate the predictability (with 70% accuracy) of detecting social ties solely from user footprints.
