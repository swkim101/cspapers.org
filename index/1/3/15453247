Time information impacts relevance in retrieval for the queries that are sensitive to trends and events. Microblog services particularly focused on recent news and events so dealing with the temporal aspects of microblogs is essential for providing effective retrieval. Recent work on time-based retrieval has shown that selecting the relevant time period for query expansion is promising. In this paper, we suggest a method for selecting the time period for query expansion based on a user behavior (i.e., retweets) that can be collected easily. We then use these time periods for query expansion in a pseudo-relevance feedback setting. More specifically, we use the difference in the temporal distribution between the top retrieved documents and retweets. The experimental results based on the TREC Microblog collection show that our method for selecting periods for query expansion improves retrieval performance compared to another approach.
