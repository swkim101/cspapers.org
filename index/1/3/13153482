Research in learning from demonstration can generally be grouped into either imitation learning or intention learning. In imitation learning, the goal is to imitate the observed behavior of an expert and is typically achieved using supervised learning techniques. In intention learning, the goal is to learn the intention that motivated the expert's behavior and to use a planning algorithm to derive behavior. Imitation learning has the advantage of learning a direct mapping from states to actions, which bears a small computational cost. Intention learning has the advantage of behaving well in novel states, but may bear a large computational cost by relying on planning algorithms in complex tasks. In this work, we introduce receding horizon inverse reinforcement learning, in which the planning horizon induces a continuum between these two learning paradigms. We present empirical results on multiple domains that demonstrate that performing IRL with a small, but non-zero, receding planning horizon greatly decreases the computational cost of planning while maintaining superior generalization performance compared to imitation learning.
