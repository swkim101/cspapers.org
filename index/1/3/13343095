This brief paper, which is itself an extended abstract for a forthcoming paper, describes a metric that can be easily computed during either bottom-up or top-down construction of a parse tree for ranking the desirability of alternative parses. In its simplest form, the metric tends to prefer trees in which constituents are pushed as far down as possible, but by appropriate modification of a constant in the formula other behavior can be obtained also. This paper includes in introduction to the EPISTLE system being developed at IBM Research and a discussion of the results of using this metric with that system.
