It is not easy to tokenize agglutinative languages like Japanese and Chinese into words. Many IR systems start with a dictionary-based morphology program like ChaSen [4]. Unfortunately, dictionaries cannot cover all possible words; unknown words such as proper nouns are important for IR. This paper proposes a statistical dictionary-free method for selecting index strings based on recent work on adaptive language modeling.
