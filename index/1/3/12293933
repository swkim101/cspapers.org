An independent observer taking a close look at either a university professor or a researcher would quickly discover that this group of people is using a language not very well understood by the rest of the society. A pertinent component of this professional “jargon” is a set of buzzwords often used. This set changes with time, and it itself, to some extent, measures time. For example, it is also quite plausible to assume that in 1948 the most popular buzzword discussed and cherished by scientists was “transistor”. It is also quite plausible to assume that the same word is not a favorite one any more. The reason is that it does not generate as much enthusiasm as it used to and, as it is known quite well, the transistor technology has become “domesticated”, i.e. commonly used. The goal of this paper is to show how the VLSI technology, so popular among scientists these days, can become another popular technological commodity. The successful VLSI experience we describe in this paper has been achieved by a small group of faculty from a medium size public university and can be used, in our view, as an example by others.
