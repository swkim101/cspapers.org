This paper presents a novel unsupervised method to transfer the style of an example image to a source image. The complex notion of image style is here considered as a local texture transfer, eventually coupled with a global color transfer. For the local texture transfer, we propose a new method based on an adaptive patch partition that captures the style of the example image and preserves the structure of the source image. More precisely, this example-based partition predicts how well a source patch matches an example patch. Results on various images show that our method outperforms the most recent techniques.
