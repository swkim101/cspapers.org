Data is a corporate asset, and being able to derive more information from data can provide database users with a competitive advantage. For example, catching on to trends quickly can reduce unwanted store inventory and lower capital outlay for the same profit. If you have store sales data by product analyzed on a daily basis, that can make a 2-3% difference in margin -- and in a business where margins might be 4%, this is a significant competitive edge. This paper will cover what technology is needed by customers to leverage their information assets. Real-time access to production point of sale information, database mining for analysis to detect trends immediately, high performance, and multi-vendor database connectivity, cooperation among heterogeneous clients and servers are among the customer needs we are seeing in the marketplace.
