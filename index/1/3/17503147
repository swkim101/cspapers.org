An iterative method for the solution of nonsymmetric linear systems of equations is described and tested. The method, block symmetric successive over-relaxation with conjugate gradient acceleration (BSSOR), is remarkably robust and when applied to block tridiagonal systems allows parallelism in the computations. BSSOR compares favorably to unpreconditioned conjugate gradient-like algorithms in efficiency, and although generally slower than preconditioned methods it is far more reliable. The concept behind BSSOR can, in general, be applied to sparse linear systems (even if they are singular), sparse nonlinear systems of equations and least squares problems.
