We address the problem of recovering a high-dimensional but structured vector from linear observations in a general setting where the vector can come from an arbitrary union of subspaces. This setup includes well-studied problems such as compressive sensing and low-rank matrix recovery. We show how to design more efficient algorithms for the union-of subspace recovery problem by using *approximate* projections. Instantiating our general framework for the low-rank matrix recovery problem gives the fastest provable running time for an algorithm with optimal sample complexity. Moreover, we give fast approximate projections for 2D histograms, another well-studied low-dimensional model of data. We complement our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating that our framework also leads to improved time and sample complexity empirically.
