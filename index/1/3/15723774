In this paper, we describe a user-centric Internet usage data processing platform. Raw usage data is collected using a software probe installed on a panel of Internet users' workstations. It is then processed by our platform. The transformation of raw usage data into qualified and usable information by Internet usage sociology researchers means setting up a series of relatively complex processes using quite a wide variety of resources. We use a combination of ad hoc rule-based systems and external resources to qualify the visited Web pages. We also implemented topological and temporal indicators in order to describe the dynamics of Web sessions.
