Atomic transactions are needed to preserve the consistency in the presence of failures and/or concurrency in distributed systems. In this paper we describe an atomic transaction framework which includes class hierarchies for several transaction semantics. The transaction framework has been carefully designed to include the common patterns of transactions. The framework addresses dynamic configurability of the different transaction semantics in order to cope with the user, system and data requirements. This transaction framework has been implemented in Smalltalk.
