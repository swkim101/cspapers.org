The deformation of the workpiece-fixture system has essential influence on the locating accuracy of the workpiece. To minimize the overall deformation of the workpiece-fixture system is an important issue in fixture design. This paper focuses on the fixture layout design with compliant model. A topology optimization approach is presented in order to reduce the complexity introduced by the high computational cost of the finite element equation solving and the exhaustive search in the point set domain. With finite element analysis, algorithms are developed for the optimization problem of locator synthesis in the point set domain. Numerical examples are also presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
