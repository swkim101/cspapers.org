Engaging students in large system development projects is an important educational objective, since it exposes design and programming challenges that come to play only with scale. Alas, large scale system projects can be monstrously complex - to the extent of being infeasible in academic settings. We describe a set of principles and a framework that enable students to develop large-scale systems, e.g. a complete hardware platform or a compiler, in several semester weeks.
