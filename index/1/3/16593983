A PDP-1 computer was donated (by the Digital Equipment Corporation) to the Electrical Engineering Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in late 1961. In May, 1963 the first time-sharing system was operational. Since 1963 this PDP-1 has undergone substantial modifications (c.f. Appendix). Presently the machine has twelve thousand words (18-bit) of five microsecond memory arranged in pages of four thousand words. One of these pages is reserved for the system code and is protected from user references.
