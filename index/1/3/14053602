Summarization and Keyword Selection are two important tasks in NLP community. Although both aim to summarize the source articles, they are usually treated separately by using sentences or words. In this paper, we propose a two-level graph based ranking algorithm to generate summarization and extract keywords at the same time. Previous works have reached a consensus that important sentence is composed by important keywords. In this paper, we further study the mutual impact between them through context analysis. We use Wikipedia to build a two-level concept-based graph, instead of traditional term-based graph, to express their homogenous relationship and heterogeneous relationship. We run PageRank and HITS rank on the graph to adjust both homogenous and heterogeneous relationships. A more reasonable relatedness value will be got for key sentence selection and keyword selection. We evaluate our algorithm on TAC 2011 data set. Traditional term-based approach achieves a score of 0.255 in ROUGE-1 and a score of 0.037 and ROUGE-2 and our approach can improve them to 0.323 and 0.048 separately.
