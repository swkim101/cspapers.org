Automatic query expansion has been known to be the most important method in overcoming the word mismatch problem in information retrieval. Thesauri have long been used by many researchers as a tool for query expansion. However only one type of thesaurus has generally been used. In this paper we analyze the characteristics of di erent thesaurus types and propose a method to combine them for query expansion. Experiments using the TREC collection proved the e ectiveness of our method over those using one type of thesaurus.
