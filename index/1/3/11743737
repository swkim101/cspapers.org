Recently-developed variable damping mechanisms have been exploited as a complement to compliant actuators. While accurate knowledge and control of generated damping is essential for achieving the desired performance, no physical sensor measuring the damping exists. This work introduces a novel non-model-based approach for the estimation of time-variant damping for variable impedance actuation systems. The approach is based only on torque and position/velocity measurements; without the knowledge of system's inputs, to ensure the estimation of both intentional and unintentional changes. Hence, a recursive least square estimator, modified for achieving a proper convergence for the estimation of time-variant parameters, is exploited. Experiments on a variable physical damping actuator are also presented to validate the performance of proposed approach.
