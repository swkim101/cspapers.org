A survey fo first and second year university students reveals the acceptance of a number of misconceptions about computers and computer applications, some on which indicate the presence of negative attitudes. A statistical analysis of the survey supports the proposition that previous computer experience is not always a corrective for unreasonable or even hostile attitudes. It is claimed that the achievement of computer literacy (in the sense of technical expertise) is possible for some populations only after attitudinal corrections, and that, in general, the strategy for achieving such corrections is dependent upon population characteristics.
