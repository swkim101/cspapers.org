We show the similarity between belief propagation and TAP, for decoding corrupted messages encoded by Sourlas's method. The latter is a special case of the Gallager error-correcting code, where the code word comprises products of K bits selected randomly from the original message. We examine the efficacy of solutions obtained by the two methods for various values of K and show that solutions for K ≥ 3 may be sensitive to the choice of initial conditions in the case of unbiased patterns. Good approximations are obtained generally for K = 2 and for biased patterns in the case of K ≥ 3, especially when Nishimori's temperature is being used.
