In spite of the increase in the availability of mobile devices in the last few years, Web information is not yet as accessible from PDAs or WAP phones as it is from the desktop. In this paper, we propose a solution for supporting one of the most popular information discovery mechanisms, namely Web directory navigation, from mobile devices. Our proposed solution consists of caching enough information on the device itself in order to conduct most of the navigation actions locally (with subsecond response time) while intermittently communicating with the server to receive updates and additional data requested by the user. The cached information is captured in a "directory capsule". The directory capsule represents only the portion of the directory that is of interest to the user in a given context and is sufficiently rich and consistent to support the information needs of the user in disconnected mode. We define a novel subscription model specifically geared for Web directories and for the special needs of PDAs. This subscription model enables users to specify the parts of the directory that are of interest to them as well as the preferred granularity. We describe a mechanism for keeping the directory capsule in sync over time with the Web directory and user subscription requests. Finally, we present the Pocket Directory Browser for Palm powered computers that we have developed. The pocket directory can be used to define, view and manipulate the capsules that are stored on the Palm. We provide several usage examples of our system on the Open Directory Project, one of the largest and most popular Web directories.
