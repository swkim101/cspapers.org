An evaluation of the compatibility of a software component is based typically only on a vendorâ€™s presentation. This means that end users select a software component only based on high-level matches of functional requirements. This can result in an underestimation of the actual cost and effort required for integration of the new software component with existing components. In this paper, we provide a suitability measure that can help determine the actual integration efforts. The measure, which is built upon typical semantic similarity measures, attempts to quantify compatibility by focusing on information exchange requirements.
