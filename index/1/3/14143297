Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have become a leading energy consumer in modern multi-core processors, with a considerable portion of this energy originating from the large number of virtual channel (FIFO) buffers. While emerging memories have been considered for many architectural components such as caches, the asymmetric access properties and relatively small size of network-FIFOs compared to the required peripheral circuitry has led to few such replacements proposed for NoCs. In this paper, we propose control schemes that leverage the “shift-register” nature of spintronic domain-wall memory (DWM) to replace conventional memory buffers for the NoC. Our results indicate that the best shift-based scheme utilizes a dual-nanowire approach to ensure that reads and writes can be more effectively aligned with access ports for simultaneous access in the same cycle. Our approach provides a 2.93X speedup over a DWM buffer using a traditional FIFO memory control scheme with a 1.16X savings in energy. Compared to a SRAM-FIFO it exhibits an 8% message latency degradation versus a 56% energy reduction. The resulting approach achieves a 53% reduction in energy delay product compared to SRAM and a 42% reduction in energy delay product versus STT-MRAM.
