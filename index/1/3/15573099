A model of purely reactive planning is proposed based on the concept of reactive action packages. A reactive action package, or RAP, can be thought of as an independent entity pursuing some goal in competition with many others at execution time. The RAP processing algorithm addresses the problems of execution monitoring and replanning in uncertain domains with a single, uniform representation and control structure. Use of the RAP model as a basis for adaptive strategic planning is also discussed.
