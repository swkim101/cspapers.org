The paper discussed the optimum uses of water resource in a city based on Social-Economic-Environmental (SEE) complex system by applying System Dynamic Model, which fully considered the interactions and interrelations amongst each element in the SEE complex system. The SD model can be used to estimate the overall development trends based on the current development status, and then relevant information of water supply-demand can also be available. Furthermore, by sensitivity analysis and running SD model on the current situations, the important parameters and variables (IPV) of could be identified, and different development modes could be designed through adjusting IPV value. Then through comparing and analyzing the simulation results of SD model, the optimal water resources utilization mode could be selected. As an example, Qinhuangdao water resource system dynamic (QinSD) model was set up to research the information of water supply and demand in different economic development mode which the paper framed, and then the sustainable water resources plan of Qinhuangdao was achieved
