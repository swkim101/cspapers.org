We examine the I/O behavior of thousands of supercomputing applications "in the wild," by analyzing the Darshan logs of over a million jobs representing a combined total of six years of I/O behavior across three leading high-performance computing platforms. We mined these logs to analyze the I/O behavior of applications across all their runs on a platform; the evolution of an application's I/O behavior across time, and across platforms; and the I/O behavior of a platform's entire workload. Our analysis techniques can help developers and platform owners improve I/O performance and I/O system utilization, by quickly identifying underperforming applications and offering early intervention to save system resources. We summarize our observations regarding how jobs perform I/O and the throughput they attain in practice.
