The Web of Things (WoT) is an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) to ease the access to data generated by things/devices using the benefits of Web technologies. Data is exploited by WoT applications to monitor healthcare or even control home automation devices. The purpose of the Knowledge Extraction for the Web of Things (KE4WoT) challenge is to automatically extract the relevant knowledge from already designed smart WoT applications in various applicative domains. Those applications design and release Knowledge Bases (e.g., datasets and/or models) on the web.
