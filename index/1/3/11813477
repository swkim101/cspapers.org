The 3rd International Process Workshop, with the theme 'Iteration in the Software Process' was held in Colorado in November 1986. Iteration, which was taken to subsume 'backtracking', 'rework', 'repetition' and so on, seems to be central to the software process; selecting it as a main topic allowed intensive consideration of many of the key problems that face software engineering. Much of the workshop discussion focused on the concept of executable representations of the process, exemplified by Osterweil's process programs. The general conclusion was that exploring the process programming paradigm and its limitations would prove a fruitful area for investigation in the near term.
