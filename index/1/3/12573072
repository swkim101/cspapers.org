A visual identification system for planar shapes based on the elliptic features is presented. The edge detection results in a list of run codes, which contain the edge information. The connectivity analysis then obtains the edge points in consecutive order. Three sets of invariants are computed from the elliptic Fourier features and used for recognition. Location and orientation are also computed from elliptic Fourier coefficients.
