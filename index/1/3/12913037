A method for designing a conceptual schema (information model) for a data base is presented. The basic notion is that a conceptual schema is designed by collecting and integrating 'local' user information requirements and analysis of information inference relationships. The procedure consists of the following phases: 1) collection and specification of information requirements, 2) entity classification, 3) specification of functional dependencies, 4) abstract object specification, integration and analysis, 5) implied information analysis, 6) derivability (precedence) analysis and 7) transformation to an 'external-named-based' model. The phases are performed iteratively in a controlled fashion. Underlying theoretical concepts are defined and arguments presented for the method's practical applicability.
