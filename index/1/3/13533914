We consider the manipulation planning problem of a Deformable Linear Object (DLO) in free or contact space. We assume the DLO is handled by a gripper at one of its extremities and during the manipulating phase, the grasped end may change. The problem is solved by coupling dynamic simulation for the DLO and kinodynamic motion planning with contacts. We show the necessity of considering contacts for this type of problem with several simulation experiments by comparing with classical collision-free approaches.
