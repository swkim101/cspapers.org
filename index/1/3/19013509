We are in the habit of considering the syntactic phaenomena, and especially those concerning pars ing, as well understood and highly computational. Quite the opposite seems to be the case with semantics. We shall argue that certain central semantic phaenomena (here termed logico-semantic) can be equally well understood and computational. So in this rather limited sense we can claim that the semantic problem has been solved (meaning that there exists a computational solution).
