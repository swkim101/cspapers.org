When searching in a document collection by keywords, good auto-completion suggestions can be derived from query logs and corpus statistics. On the other hand, when querying documents which have automatically been linked to entities and semantic categories, auto-completion has not been investigated much. We have developed a semantic auto-completion system, where suggestions for entities and categories are computed in real-time from the context of already entered entities or categories and from entity-level co-occurrence statistics for the underlying corpus. Given the huge size of the knowledge bases that underlie this setting, a challenge is to compute the best suggestions fast enough for interactive user experience. Our demonstration shows the effectiveness of our method, and its interactive usability.
