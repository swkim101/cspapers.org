This paper presents a demonstration of our recent research and development of the MAIDS system, which mines alarming incidents from data streams, with the following major analysis functions: (1) multi-resolution modeling using a tilted time window framework, (2) multi-dimensional analysis using a stream “data cube” model, (3) online stream classification, (4) online frequent pattern mining, (5) online clustering of data streams, and (6) stream mining visualization.
