WebDAV needs awareness support in order to be a full-fledged collaboration system, This paper introduces AwareDAV, a new WebDAV extension framework enabling shared awareness through event notification. By extending the WebDAV protocol with seven new request-methods and an extensible XML based event subscription scheme, AwareDAV supports fine grained event subscriptions over a range of transport mechanisms and enables a wide range of collaboration scenarios. This paper describes the design of AwareDAV, its API, experiences with its initial implementation, as well as a comparison with Microsoft Exchange and WebDAV-notify.
