The present paper describes a decision method for the placement of tactile elements for manipulation task recognition. Based on the mutual information of the manipulation tasks and tactile information, an effective placement of tactile elements on a sensing glove is determined. Although the effective placement consists of a small number of tactile elements, it has a recognition performance that is as high as that of a placement consisting of many tactile elements. The effective placement of tactile elements decided by the proposed method has been evaluated through experiments involving the recognition of grasp type from grasp taxonomy defined by Kamakura et al., (1980).
