The NSFNET Backbone Network interconnects six supercomputer sites, several regional networks and ARPANET. It supports the DARPA Internet protocol suite and DCN subnet protocols, which provide delay-based routing and very accurate time-synchronization services. This paper describes the design and implementation of this network, with special emphasis on robustness issues and congestion-control mechanisms.
