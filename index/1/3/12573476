The calculation of the keywords uses a statistical function based on frequency. However, in contrast to other systems, the weighting is not based on word frequency but on the frequency of semantic classes which are calculated from each word. For each major content bearing word (verb, adjective, noun ) the semantic features are collected. The weighting does not only take complete words into account for this statistics, but also the components of German compound nouns. Then the most frequent semantic features are calculated, and all words/phrases of the text, which have such a feature are collected, in the so-called keyword set.
