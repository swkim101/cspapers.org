People use an increasing number of consumer electronic devices to access their mobile apps. To enhance the applications' immersive user experience, these devices often expose APIs for accessing a wide array of sensors and domain-specific capabilities. Existing mobile application environments, however, only provide limited support for cross-device access of such APIs. To address this limitation, the Webinos platform was designed. Webinos is a virtualized Web-based application platform, aiming to support the collaboration of multiple devices within a single mobile application. In this paper we elaborate on the Webinos platform design. We discuss the encountered design challenges regarding portability, scalability, and privacy, and how these were mitigated.
