Pizza is a strict superset of Java that incorporates three ideas from the academic community: parametric polymorphism, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. Pizza is defined by translation into Java and compiles into the Java Virtual Machine, requirements which strongly constrain the design space. Nonetheless, Pizza fits smoothly to Java, with only a few rough edges.
