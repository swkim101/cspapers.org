Constituent parsing is typically modeled by a chart-based algorithm under probabilistic context-free grammars or by a transition-based algorithm with rich features. Previous models rely heavily on richer syntactic information through lexicalizing rules, splitting categories, or memorizing long histories. However enriched models incur numerous parameters and sparsity issues, and are insufficient for capturing various syntactic phenomena. We propose a neural network structure that explicitly models the unbounded history of actions performed on the stack and queue employed in transition-based parsing, in addition to the representations of partially parsed tree structure. Our transition-based neural constituent parsing achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art parsers, demonstrating F1 score of 90.68% for English and 84.33% for Chinese, without reranking, feature templates or additional data to train model parameters.
