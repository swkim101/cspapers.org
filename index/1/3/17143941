K is a high-level knowledge base programming language for doing general computation as well as for defining, querying, and manipulating databases in nontraditional application domains. The main features of K are: (i) knowledge abstraction facilities for supporting an extensible object-oriented semantic association knowledge model, (ii) a modularization mechanism for programming in the large, (iii) knowledge retrieval facilities for querying the knowledge base, and (iv) multi-paradigm programming constructs for speci~ing object-oriented, parallel, non-deterministic, and rule-based computations. This paper presents the linguistic facilities provided in K and the knowledge model it supports.
