Sufficient conditions are given for partial correctness assertions to determine the input-output semantics of quite general classes of programming languages. This determination cannot be unique unless states which are indistinguishable by predicates in the assertions are identified. Even when indistinguishable states are identified, partial correctness assertions may not suffice to determine program semantics.
