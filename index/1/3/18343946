During the spring semester of 1977 an experiment was undertaken to determine whether the introductory course in computer science could teach more that it has in the past. The experiment, as a whole, indicated that it is indeed possible to provide more content. Students responded well and learned more. This paper discusses an informal experiment; what motivated it; our methods; and finally its results.
