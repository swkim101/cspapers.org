Smell can be used to infer quite a bit of context about environments. Previous research primarily has shown that gas sensors can be used to discriminate accurately between odors when used in testing chambers. However, potential real-world applications require these sensors to perform an analysis in uncontrolled environments, which can be challenging. In this poster, we present our gas sensor system, called uSmell, to address these challenges. This system has the potential to improve context-aware applications, such as lifelogging and assisted living.
