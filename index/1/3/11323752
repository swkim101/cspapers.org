The idea of a capability which acts like a ticket authorizing the use of some resource was developed by Dennis and Van Horn as a generalization of addressing and protection schemes such as the code- words of the Rice computer, the descriptors of the Burroughs machines, and the segment and page tables in computers such as the GE-645 and IBM 360/67. Dennis and Van Horn generalized the earlier schemes by extending them to include not just memory, but all systems resources: memory, processes, input/output devices, and so on; and by stressing the explicit manipulation of access control by nonsystem programs. The idea is that a capability is a special kind of address for an object, that these addresses can be created only by the supervisor, and that in order to use any object, one must address it via one of these addresses. The name comes from the fact that having one of these special kinds of addresses for a resource provides one with the capability to use the resource.
 The use of capabilities as a protection mechanism has been the subject of considerable interest and is now fairly well understood. Access control schemes using capabilities and capability -like notions are, as a whole, the most flexible and general schemes available. It will in fact be assumed that the reader is familiar with the advantages of capabilities for protection put-poses; a somewhat different advantage of capabilities will be developed here.
