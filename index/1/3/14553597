Volunteers are extremely crucial to nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to sustain their continuing operations. On the other hand, many talents are looking for appropriate volunteer opportunities to realize their dreams of making an impact on the world with their expertise. This is a typical supply and demand matching issue. Fortunately, user profiling and the discovery of user volunteering tendency can benefit from users' continuous enthusiasm and active participation in diverse online social networks (OSNs) and the huge amount of publicly available user generated contents (UGCs). In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between the supply of talents with volunteering tendency and the demands of social enterprise and enhance the social welfare. This is done by incorporating volunteering tendency into user profiling across multiple OSNs. Consequently, this interdisciplinary research opens a new window for both computer science and social science. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to tackle the problem of volunteer matching for social enterprise based on publicly available UGCs. First, we explain the definitions of the main concepts with examples. Second, we propose a system architecture for addressing the problem of volunteerism matching that Includes three components: Profile Collection, Profile Enrichment and Profile Matching. Finally, we identify the major challenges encountered in our current research work. This paper discusses our design and progress in this research.
