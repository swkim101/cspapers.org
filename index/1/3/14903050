While past work has looked extensively at how to design privacy configuration UIs for sharing current location, there has not yet been work done to examine how visual representations of historical locations can influence end-user privacy. We present results for a study examining three visualization types (text-, map-, and time-based) for social sharing of past locations. Our results reveal that there are important design implications for location sharing applications, as certain visual elements led to more privacy concerns and inaccurate perceptions of privacy control.
