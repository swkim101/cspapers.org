Built-in self-test (BIST) techniques have evolved as cost-effective techniques for testing digital circuits. These techniques add test circuitry to the chip such that the chip has the capability to test itself. A prime concern in using BIST is the area overhead due to the modification of normal registers to be test registers. This paper presents data path allocation algorithms that 1) maximize the sharing of test registers resulting in a fewer number of registers being modified for BIST, and 2) minimize the number of CBILBO registers.
