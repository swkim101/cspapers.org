We present a qualitative study based on interviews with nine IKEA Hackers - people who go online to share the process of repurposing IKEA products to create personalized objects. Whether they were making a self-conscious artistic statement or simply modifying a towel rack to fit in a small bathroom, IKEA hackers illuminate an emergent practice that provides insights into contemporary changes in creativity. We discuss the motivations for IKEA hacking and explore the impact of information technology on do-it-yourself culture, design, and HCI.
