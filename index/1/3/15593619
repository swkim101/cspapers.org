A key idea in modern software engineering is that we can and should make architectural style choices separately from choices about many other system properties. There is a fundamental separation of concerns implicit in this idea: given an application model that expresses system properties independently of architectural style, we can choose a compatible architectural style and then map the application model to one or more architectural models (architectures) in this style. The problem is that we do not have a formal account of this separation of concerns, or the associated architectural maps, sufficient to enable automated synthesis of architectures from application models and architecture style specifications. The contribution of this work is such an account and a demonstration that it enables automated formal derivation of style-specific architectures.
