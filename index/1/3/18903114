Much system-oriented evaluation of information retrieval systems has used the Cranfield approach based upon queries run against test collections in a batch mode. Some researchers have questioned whether this approach can be applied to the real world, but little data exists for or against that assertion. We have studied this question in the context of the TREC Interactive Track. Previous results demonstrated that improved performance as measured by relevance-based metrics in batch studies did not correspond with the results of outcomes based on real user searching tasks. The experiments in this paper analyzed those results to determine why this occurred. Our assessment showed that while the queries entered by real users into systems yielding better results in batch studies gave comparable gains in ranking of relevant documents for those users, they did not translate into better performance on specific tasks. This was most likely due to users being able to adequately find and utilize relevant documents ranked further down the output list.
