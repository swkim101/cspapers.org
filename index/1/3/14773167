This paper presents a layered component model to support Web-based interactive and collaborative applications. It is intended to let programmers focus on the particular logic of their applications, avoiding most of the issues related to collaboration, access control and networking management. A Web-based educational application has been developed over this framework. This tele-education system, which follows the recommendations by the main institutions involved in the learning technology standardization process, is the second contribution presented by the authors.
