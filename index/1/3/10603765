Random forest has emerged as a powerful classification technique with promising results in various vision tasks including image classification, pose estimation and object detection. However, current techniques have shown little improvements in visual tracking as they mostly rely on piece wise orthogonal hyperplanes to create decision nodes and lack a robust incremental learning mechanism that is much needed for online tracking. In this paper, we propose a discriminative tracker based on a novel incremental oblique random forest. Unlike conventional orthogonal decision trees that use a single feature and heuristic measures to obtain a split at each node, we propose to use a more powerful proximal SVM to obtain oblique hyperplanes to capture the geometric structure of the data better. The resulting decision surface is not restricted to be axis aligned and hence has the ability to represent and classify the input data better. Furthermore, in order to generalize to online tracking scenarios, we derive incremental update steps that enable the hyperplanes in each node to be updated recursively, efficiently and in a closed-form fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two large scale benchmark datasets (OTB-51 and OTB-100) and show that our method gives competitive results on several challenging cases by relying on simple HOG features as well as in combination with more sophisticated deep neural network based models. The implementations of the proposed random forest are available at https://github.com/ZhangLeUestc/ Incremental-Oblique-Random-Forest.
