The problem of vehicle workspace design is solved by use of an interactive graphics package. The package consists of an optimization programme (WOLAP), a biokinematic - anthropometric model and the use of a 3-D graphics display system. It is hoped that by use of this package the designer would have a more comprehensive tool by which to design and configure both the basic dimensions of workspaces for seated operators and the required controls and displays therein.
