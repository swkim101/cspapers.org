Terrainability is mostly dependant on the suspension mechanism and the control of a space rover. For the six wheeled CRAB rover, this paper presents the composite control design with torque control and adaptive Kriging control to improve the terrainability, somewhat related to minimizing wheel slip. As CRAB is moving slowly, the torque control is processed by minimizing the variance of the required friction coefficient based on the static model. Adaptive Kriging control is used to track the commanded velocity. The system uncertainty is compensated by Kriging estimation based on the velocity dynamics. Experiment results with two different tires show the effectiveness of the control scheme.
