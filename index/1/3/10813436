In this paper, an ongoing work for verifying the behavior of a twisted string actuator in contact with a sliding surface or guided through a sheath is presented. The twisted string actuation system is particularly suitable for very compact and light-weight robotic devices, like artificial limbs and exoskeletons, since it allows the implementation of powerful tendon-based driving systems, based on small-size DC motors characterized by high speed, low torque and very limited inertia. One of the major limitations of this actuation system is by now related to the fact that the string should not be in contact with any obstacle, because this contact will alter the twisting angle propagation along the string and, eventually, completely stop the string twisting. This design constraint imposes a straight path between the motor and the linear load attached to the other string end. After the presentation of the basic properties of the twisted string actuation system, the model of the twisted string in contact with a sliding surface is discussed. The behavior of the system has been then experimentally verified and discussed. A preliminary evaluation of control strategies for compensating the side effects generated by the contact of the twisted string with the sliding surface is also presented.
