This paper reports preliminary experiments with a cooperative robot system to augment single cell manipulation tasks. The JHU "Steady-Hand" robot configuration for cell manipulation is reported. Stable force control laws for the "Steady Hand" are revisited. Preliminary experiments validating stable insertion of a micropipette in a mouse embryo are detailed along with formulation of vision based tracking and augmentation. These preliminary experiments demonstrate promise of cooperative augmentation in single cell manipulation tasks.
