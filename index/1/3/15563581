Previous research on inductive process modeling, whichconstructs models from knowledge and time-series data, has relied onhandcrafted constraints. In this paper, we report an approach todiscovering such constraints from a set of models that have beenranked according to their error on observations. Our approach adaptsinductive techniques for supervised learning to identify processcombinations that characterize accurate models. We evaluate themethod's ability to reconstruct known constraints and to generalizewell to other modeling tasks in the same domain. Experiments with synthetic data indicate that the approach can successfully reconstructknown modeling constraints. Another study using natural data suggests that transferring constraints acquired from one modeling scenario to another within the same domain considerably reduces the amount of search for candidate model structures while retaining the most accurate ones.
