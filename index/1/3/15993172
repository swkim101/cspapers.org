We present the results of an extensive computational study on dynamic algorithms for all pairs shortest path problems. We describe our implementations of the recent dynamic algorithms of King [18] and of Demetrescu and Italiano [7], and compare them to the dynamic algorithm of Ramalingam and Reps [25] and to static algorithms on random, real-world and hard instances. Our experimental data suggest that some of the dynamic algorithms and their algorithmic techniques can be really of practical value in many situations.
