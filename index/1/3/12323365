We propose a realizable RCLK-in-RCLK-out parasitic reduction technique. The method employs generalized Y-Δ transformation. In our method, admittances are kept in their original rational forms of s, and their orders are reduced by truncating high-order terms. Therefore reduced admittances match the low-order terms in exact admittances. First-order realization of admittances is guaranteed, and higher-order realization is achieved by template optimization using Geometric Programming. The algorithm uniquely uses common-factor identification and cancelation operations to make Y-Δ transformation numerically stable. The experiment shows that our method can achieve higher reduction ratio than TICER and comparable simulation results with PRIMA.
