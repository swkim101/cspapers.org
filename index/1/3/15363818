Programming languages provide a limited range of mechanisms to represent concepts. This means that the final program lacks important information that the programmer has about the domain. We propose the use of programmer-extensible program annotations as a means to represent that information about the domain. Using these program annotations we can specify join points by means of semantic properties of the programs, thereby improving the reusability and robustness of aspects.
