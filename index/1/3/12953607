The aim of this paper is to solve the portfolio problem when security returns are bifuzzy variables. Two types of portfolio selections based on chance measure are provided according to bifuzzy theory. Since the proposed optimization problems are difficult to solve by traditional methods,  A hybrid intelligent algorithm by integrating bifuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm is designed. Finally, one numerical experiment is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
