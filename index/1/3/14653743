In order to find all occurrences of a twig pattern in XML documents, a considerable amount of twig pattern matching algorithms have been proposed. At the same time, previous work mainly focuses on twig pattern query under the complete semantics. However, there is often a need to produce partial answers because XML data may have missing sub-elements. Furthermore, the existed works fall short in their ability to support twig pattern query under different semantics in fuzzy XML. In this paper, we study the problem of twig matches in fuzzy XML. We begin by introducing the extended region scheme to accurately and effectively represent nodes information in fuzzy XML. We then discuss the fuzzy query semantics and compute the membership information by using Einstein operator instead of Zadeh's min-max technique. On the basis, we propose two efficient algorithms for querying twig under complete and incomplete semantics in fuzzy XML. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms can perform on the fuzzy twig pattern matching efficiently.
