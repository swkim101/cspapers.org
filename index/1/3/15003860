Video projectors have typically been used to display images on surfaces whose geometric relationship to the projector remains constant, such as walls or pre-calibrated surfaces. In this paper, we present a technique for projecting content onto moveable surfaces that adapts to the motion and location of the surface to simulate an active display. This is accomplished using a projector based location tracking techinque. We use light sensors embedded into the moveable surface and project low-perceptibility Gray-coded patterns to first discover the sensor locations, and then incrementally track them at interactive rates. We describe how to reduce the perceptibility of tracking patterns, achieve interactive tracking rates, use motion modeling to improve tracking performance, and respond to sensor occlusions. A group of tracked sensors can define quadrangles for simulating moveable displays while single sensors can be used as control inputs. By unifying the tracking and display technology into a single mechanism, we can substantially reduce the cost and complexity of implementing applications that combine motion tracking and projected imagery.
