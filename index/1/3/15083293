Textile Graphics is a computer-aided technique for developing a textile design and textile machinery patterning mechanism information from an artist's drawing. The computer is operated by a textile designer-technician who understands the particular textile machinery for which he is adapting the original drawing. He inputs the original drawing to the computer with a combination of graphic input devices. When the artist's original design has been transmitted to the computer, he develops it into the information which controls the patterning mechanism of a specific kind of a textile machinery.
 The computer serves as a tool for the artist or designer. It enables him to make the same aesthetic judgements he would normally make; however, it executes his decisions much more rapidly than is possible when using traditional methods. The preservation of aesthetic judgement by the user, increased design capability and increased experimental capability are major characteristics of the system.
