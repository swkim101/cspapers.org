An analysis has been performed to examine the tradeoffs between cost and performance for digital data transmission via the communications satellite channel. The model relates both cost and performance to the major parameters of the spacecraft and the earth station. A combination of M-ary PSK transmission, and forward error correction (FEC) is selected to maximize communications efficiency (q in bps/Hz) for the prevailing carrier-to- noise ratio on the link. A data link control protocol using automatic repeat request (ARQ) as an error recovery technique is assumed. The overall performance measure computed herein is the annual cost per “effective” bit per second throughput over the link. Trends in cost/bps are shown for several satellite models as a function of information bit rate (Rb), and earth station figure of merit (G/T).
