Dynamic reconfiguration - the ability to hot swap a component or to introduce a new component into a system - is essential to supporting evolutionary change in long-live and highly available systems. A major issue related to this process is to ensure application consistency and performance after reconfiguration. This task is especially challenging for embedded systems which run with limited resources and have specific dependability requirements. We focus on checking resources constraints and propose for a component compliance checking to be performed during its deployment. Our main objective is preserving system integrity during and after reconfiguration by developing a resource efficient dynamic deployment mechanism that will include component validation in respect to available system resources and performance requirements.
