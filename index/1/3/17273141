The paper presents work on autonomous tracking of boundaries between distinct benthic regions using an AUV equipped of a mechanically scanning profiler sonar. By exploiting sonar scans of the region below the robot, a classical control loop is closed around the sonar data, using a feedback signal that is robust with respect to classification "noise." Results obtained in a real experiment of tracking a boundary between sand and Posidonia are presented.
