The advent of cloud computing has ushered in an era of mass data storage in remote servers. Remote data storage offers reduced data management overhead for data owners in a cost effective manner. Sensitive documents, however, need to be stored in encrypted format due to security concerns. But, encrypted storage makes it difficult to search on the stored documents. Therefore, this poses a major barrier towards selective retrieval of encrypted documents from the remote servers. Various protocols have been proposed for keyword search over encrypted data to address this issue. Most of the available protocols leak data access patterns due to efficiency reasons. Although, oblivious RAM based protocols can be used to hide data access patterns, such protocols are computationally intensive and do not scale well for real world datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack that exploits data access pattern leakage to disclose significant amount of sensitive information using a modicum of prior knowledge. Our empirical analysis with a real world dataset shows that the proposed attack is able to disclose sensitive information with a very high accuracy. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to mitigate the risk against the proposed attack at the expense of a slight increment in computational resources and communication cost. Furthermore, our proposed mitigation technique is generic enough to be used in conjunction with any searchable encryption scheme that reveals data access pattern.
