Organizers regularly want to understand the experiences of event goers and typically use survey methods, with researchers and clipboards. However, gathering opinions in such ways is difficult to do without disrupting the event goers' experience. In place of clipboard surveys, we developed a quite different form of tangible questionnaire, called VoxBox, which uses physical interactions to transform feedback giving into a playful and engaging experience that fits much more with the event itself. Here we question if such a device can successfully draw a diverse representation of event attendees to voice relevant opinions during the event. We describe an observational study of VoxBox based on two real-world deployments, and present findings on (1) the experiences VoxBox provides to facilitators and users; and (2) its capabilities as a means for opinion gathering. We conclude by discussing lessons learned, design implications, and the wide potential for tangible questionnaires in other application areas.
