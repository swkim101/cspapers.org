When translating between two languages that differ in their degree of morphological synthesis, syntactic structures in one language may be realized as morphological structures in the other, and SMT models need a mechanism to learn such translations. Prior work has used morpheme splitting with flat representations that do not encode the hierarchical structure between morphemes, but this structure is relevant for learning morphosyntactic constraints and selectional preferences. We propose to model syntactic and morphological structure jointly in a dependency translation model, allowing the system to generalize to the level of morphemes. We present a dependency representation of German compounds and particle verbs that results in improvements in translation quality of 1.4‐1.8 BLEU in the WMT English‐German translation task.
