Recent trends in the automotive industry have forced OEMs and suppliers to adopt simulation-driven development processes. To meet the demands of the rapidly changing industry, simulation technologies must innovate to provide faster and accurate simulations of increasingly complex models. In this paper we present a set of technologies that were developed to provide a no-compromise, high fidelity, scalable simulation of heterogeneous functional models. Using our new technology we were able to produce more accurate results in orders of magnitude less time than other frequently used techniques in the industry. The proposed approach to co-simulation allows us to perform functional simulation of full-vehicle without sacrificing the solution accuracy or simulation speed.
