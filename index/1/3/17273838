A new Hilbert-Huang transform associated with the linear canonical transform is introduced in this paper. Based on the defined Hilbert-Huang transform associated with the linear canonical transform, the parameter detection for multi- component linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals is discussed. The proposed method decomposes the multi- component LFM signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) firstly. Then the LFM component is detected by finding the peaks and their locations in the parameter domain. Finally, the simulation experiments are performed to verify the correctness of the proposed method.
