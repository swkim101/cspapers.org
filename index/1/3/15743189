This paper proposes a new dynamic visual localization and tracking method using RGB-D camera. The proposed method makes use of band-width matrix, combines particle filter and mean shift with a new strategy, avoids falling into local optimum, and maintains particle diversity with only a few sampled points. A fast object searching strategy is successfully used to find the missing object. Experiments show that the proposed method runs robustly in complex scenes. The object 3-D parameters relative to the camera center can be estimated with a RGB-D camera, and that makes significant sense in spatial localization.
