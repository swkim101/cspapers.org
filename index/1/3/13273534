A method of presenting software architecture has been developed which is useful for reviewing and documenting software designs. Diagrams showing all software levels as well as inputs and outputs are systematically developed to provide an understanding of the construction and operation of software systems and programs. The manner in which the software architecture is displayed provides an effective way for managers to understand and review software designs.
