To realize trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, two distributed CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras are constructed to obtain the dynamic poses of the car-like mobile robots (CLMRs) and the obstacles. Based on the control authority of these two CCD cameras, a suitable reference command including desired steering angle and translation velocity for the fuzzy decentralized variable structure control (FDVSC) in the client computer is on-line planned. Due to the delay of signal transmission through an internet network and wireless local area network (WLAN), suitable sampling time of the FDVSC is determined by the Quality of Service (QoS). The proposed control can track an on-line planning reference command without the requirement of a mathematical model of the CLMR. Only the information of the upper bound of system knowledge (including the dynamics of the CLMR, the delay feature of internet network and WLAN) is required to select the suitable scaling factors and the coefficients of switching surface so that an acceptable performance is achieved.
