These propWe introduce the path resistance method for lower bounds erties have been used in graph algorithms, particularly on the smallest nontrivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix algorithms for finding small separators [PSLSO]. of a graph. The method is based on viewing the graph The Laplacian also has an important role in repin terms of electrical circuits; it uses clique embeddings resenting physical problems. It often occurs in finite to produce lower bounds on A2 and star embeddings to difference, finite element, and control volume represenproduce lower bounds on the smallest Rayleigh quotient tations of problem involving elliptic partial differential when there is a Dirichlet boundary condition. The method equations. These problems often include a Dirichlet assigns priorities to the pat,hs in the embedding; we show boundary condition that specifies that the values at a that, for an unweighted tree T, using uniform priorities for set of vertices are zero. To represent this condition in a clique embedding produces a lower bound on A2 that is the Laplacian, the rows and columns corresponding to off by at most an O(logdiameter(T)) factor. We show that the boundary vertices are deleted from the matrix. The t,he best bounds that this method can produce for clique resulting matrix is positive definite, and it is the smallembeddings are the same as for a related method that uses est eigenvalue of the matrix that is of interest. clique embeddings and edge lengths to produce bounds. Bounds on the smallest nonzero eigenvalues of both forms of the Laplacian have other important applica
