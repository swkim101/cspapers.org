The vast majority of online services nowadays, provide both a mobile friendly website and a mobile application to their users. Both of these choices are usually released for free, with their developers, usually gaining revenue by allowing advertisements from ad networks to be embedded into their content. In order to provide more personalized and thus more effective advertisements, ad networks usually deploy pervasive user tracking, raising this way significant privacy concerns. As a consequence, the users do not have to think only their convenience before deciding which choice to use while accessing a service: web or app, but also which one harms their privacy the least. In this paper, we aim to respond to this question: which of the two options protects the users' privacy in the best way apps or browsers? To tackle this question, we study a broad range of privacy related leaks in a comparison of several popular apps and their web counterpart. These leaks may contain not only personally identifying information (PII) but also device-specific information, able to cross-application and cross-site track the user into the network, and allow third parties to link web with app sessions. Finally, we propose an anti-tracking mechanism that enable the users to access an online service through a mobile app without risking their privacy. Our evaluation shows that our approach is able to preserve the privacy of the user by reducing the leaking identifiers of apps by 27.41% on average, while it imposes a practically negligible latency of less than 1 millisecond per request.
