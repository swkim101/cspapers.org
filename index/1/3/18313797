Securing Windows is a challenge because of its large attack surface which can lead to many ways where binaries can be loaded and subsequently executed. Furthermore, the software in the system is itself dynamic as binaries need to be installed, updated and uninstalled. Binaries can also be created dynamically during software development as well as other situations. We present a new binary security model called BinInt which provides integrity for binaries and prevents the use of unauthorized binaries. We have implemented a BinInt prototype designed with usability in mind to be compatible with existing software in binary form. It has low overhead and thus can be permanently on.
