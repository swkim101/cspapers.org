ROSS [7] is an object-oriented language developed for building knowledge-based simulations [4]. SWIRL [5, 6] is a program written in ROSS that embeds knowledge about defensive and offensive air battle strategies. Given an initial configuration of military forces, SWIRL simulates the resulting air battle. We have implemented ROSS and SWIRL in several different Lisp environments. We report upon this experience by comparing the various environments in terms of cpu usage, real-time usage, and various user aids.
