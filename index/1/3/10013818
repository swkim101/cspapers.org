In case that a robot carries large and heavy objects with unknown physical parameters such as mass automatically, the autonomous decision and execution of the manipulation strategy are necessary. The method to decide the proper strategy from the various candidates depending on the object is a difficult problem and not researched widely. We consider the operation as the mapping from the physical parameter space to the object motion space. Based on the concept of mapping, we define the strategy proving operation (SPO) for determination of strategy feasibility. We introduce two examples of SPO and construct the system for deciding strategy from lifting, pushing, and pivoting. Executing the strategy in the situation that physical parameters are not known is also necessary. We construct the generator and controller for the full-body manipulation, which can be employed regardless of strategy. The controller enables the robot to exert adequate force while keeping balance. We clarify the applicable scope of the proposed method and show that a life-sized humanoid decides the strategy and carries various large and heavy objects autonomously through the experiment.
