The adoption of the latest OLED (organic light emitting diode) technology does not change the fact that screen is still one of the most energy-consuming modules in modern smartphones. In this work, we found that video streams from the same video category share many common power consumption features on OLED screens. Therefore, we are able to build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier to categorize videos based on OLED screen power characteristics. Using this HMM classifier, we propose a video classification based dynamic tone mapping (DTM) scheme, namely, DaTuM, to remap output color range and minimize the power-hungry color compositions on OLED screens for power saving. Experiment shows that DaTuM scheme averagely reduces OLED screen power by 17.8% with minimum display quality degradation. Compared to DTM scheme based on official category info provided by the video sources and one state-of-the-art scheme, DaTuM substantially enhances OLED screens' power efficiency and display quality controllability.
