ABSTRACT Web services have gained an increasing popularity, however, also shown problems like their automatic discovery or deficiencies in interoperability. Because of todayâ€™s wide variety of services of-fered to perform a specific task, it is essential that users are sup-ported in the eventual selection of appropriate services. In this paper we present an extensive study of different useful techniques towards advanced personalization of Web service selection. We propose the partitioning of the user profile to support different steps of interaction with services and present techniques to per-sonalize each subsequent step. Our main contribution is an algo-rithm featuring the expansion of service requests by user-specific demands and wishes. Services not matching a certain profile are discarded on the fly and equally useful results of alternative ser-vices can be compared with respect to user provided strategies and preferences. We also present a case study to exemplify the application of our personalization techniques.
