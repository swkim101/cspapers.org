Concurrent Prolog [28] combines the logic programming computation model with guarded-command indeterminacy and dataflow synchronization. It will form the basis of the Kernel Language [21] of the Parallel Inference Machine [36], planned by Japan's Fifth Generation Computers Project. This paper explores the feasibility of programming such a machine solely in Concurrent Prolog (in the absence of a lower-level programming language), by implementing in it a representative collection of systems programming problems.
