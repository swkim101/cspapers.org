A routing scheme that uses a neural network has been developed that can aid in establishing point-to-point communication routes through multistage interconnection networks (MINs). The neural network is a network of the type that was examined by Hopfield (Hopfield, 1984 and 1985). In this work, the problem of establishing routes through random MINs (RMINs) in a shared-memory, distributed computing system is addressed. The performance of the neural network routing scheme is compared to two more traditional approaches - exhaustive search routing and greedy routing. The results suggest that a neural network router may be competitive for certain RMINs.
