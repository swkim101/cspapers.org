In this paper we are mainly concerned with discussion of a formal model, based on the basic concept of divergence from information theory, for automatic query expansion. The basic principles and ideas on which our study is based are described. A theoretical framework is established, which allows the comparison and evaluation of different term scoring functions for identifying good terms for query expansion. The approaches proposed in this paper have been implemented and evaluated on collections from TREC. Preliminary results show that our approaches are viable and worthy of continued investigation.
