The seminal work of [GMW86] proposed the use of zero knowledge proof systems (ZKPS 's) as a means to demonstrate adherence to a specified network protocol, thereby protecting an interactive network computation against malicious sub-version. Each participant would prove – without revealing anything additional – that it indeed followed the rules. We give evidence that both the classical zero knowledge analysis [GMR89] and the particular ZKPS in [GM W86] are not sufficient to provide provable security against attacks by an adaptive malicious adversary, as follows. If the ZKPS for graph 3-colorability proposed in [GMW86] is provably secure against adversaries who can choose whom to corrupt as a protocol progresses, and if factoring is intractable, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses. In particular, any language in NP could be solved with access to an oracle for factoring. We also consider subtle requirements that classical ZKPS'S do not address, such as the privacy of the verifier, and show that some ZKPS'S may permit subtle attacks in which useful knowledge is leaked undetectable. To remedy these problems, we propose a robust model for adaptive zero-knowledge proof systems that embodies broader security aspects of transmitting confidence in the validity of a claim. Within this model, we resolve the informal conjecture behind [GMW86] by showing that the " prove-good-behavior " paradigm can be employed with provable security against adaptive adversaries.
