This paper describes a sensing function of a multi-jointed multi-fingered hand with soft fingertips. We propose a new method to detect change of contact types with an object while manipulating it: the fingertip contact with a flat surface and with a convex sharp edge. Proposed method can apply to the manipulation with rolling contact. Experimental results are demonstrated.
