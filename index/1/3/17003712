This paper reports a hybridization experi­ ment, where a baseline ML dependency pars­ er, LingPars, was allowed access to Con­ straint Grammar analyses provided by a rule­ based parser (EngGram) for the same data. Descriptive compatibility issues and their in­ fluence on performance are discussed. The hybrid system performed considerably better than its ML baseline, and proved more ro­ bust than the latter in the domain adaptation task, where it was the best­scoring system in the open class for the chemical test data, and the best overall system for the CHILDES test data.
