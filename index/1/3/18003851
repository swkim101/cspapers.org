Computers are increasingly being used in engineering systems which could utilize a multiplicity of processors. Computer aided design methods are needed to support the design of inherently complex concurrent software. UCLA's SARA (System ARchitects Apprentice) is a design environment which provides computer aid to both hardware and software design of concurrent systems. This paper focusses on an improved capability to aid software design. This capability is provided by defining a Module Interface Description (MID), which allows designers to deal with the structure of code, and effecting a mapping between SARA models and MID-models. It then becomes clear how to create a tool to accept these descriptions and perform various checks on the consistency and completeness of the modeling and implementation descriptions. The addition of this capability reduces the gap between the modeling and realization of systems by providing for automatic generation of code skeletons.
