The conventional classification of software fault detection techniques by their operational characteristics (static vs. dy- namic analysis) is inadequate as a basis for identifying useful relationships between techniques. A more useful distinction is between techniques which sample the space of possible ex- ecutions, and techniques which fold the space. The new dis- tinction provides better insight into the ways different tech- niques can interact, and is a necessary basis for considering hybrid fault detection techniques.
