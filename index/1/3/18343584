In recent years a number of colleges and universities have modified their introductory computer science curriculum. These schools have concluded that algorithm development and computer programming are sufficiently difficult to require a two semester sequence. This change even appears in the working report of the ACM Committee on Curriculum in Computer Sciences [1].
 Unlike the first course in computer science, there does not appear to be a general consensus on the aims, objectives, and course outline on this second course. The purpose of this paper is to present the author's view of the need for and purpose of this second course and some consequences of these. This view is based on five years experience developing and teaching this course at two universities.
