\\e consider the problem of asynchronous consensus in the shared memory setting nith single-reader/single-xvriter registers. This setting can also be yielved as a messagepassing setting xv-here there are no delays or failures of links. 1Ve provide a consensus procedure that completes in O(nlog nesp(2 Innln(clog nlogn))) expected total vork. for some constant c: assuming the value oblivious adversary scheduler. In particular, the total xork is less than O(n’+‘) for any E. Total Tvork is defined as the total number of operations performed by all processors collectively! including busy-lvaiting. The solution is based on a nelv algorithm for a primitive xvhich \ve call cooperative-sharing. In the cooperative-sharing primitive, initially each processor has a private value and the outcome is that there is at least one input value xvhich becomes knoxvn to all processors. We provide a ne\v algorithm for the cooperative sharing in the single-reader/single-writer setting which completes in O(n esp(2 In R ln(clog nlog’ n))) vork.
