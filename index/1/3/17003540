Haptic devices are dedicated to render virtual tactile stimulation. A limitation of these devices is the intrusiveness of their mechanical structures, i.e. the user need to hold or wear the device to interact with the environment. Here, we propose a concept of new tactile device named HAIR. The device is composed of a computer vision system, a mechatronic device and air jets that stimulate the skin. We designed a first prototype and conducted a preliminary experiment to validate our concept. The interface enables a tactile interaction without using physical contact with material devices, providing better freedom of movement and enhancing the interaction transparency.
