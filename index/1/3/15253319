This paper presents a hybrid adaptive particle filter (HAP) with online feedback to dynamically reconstruct high spatial-temporal resolution air pollution information from sparse vehicular based sensors. To deal with data sparsity, we apply both spatial and temporal correlation of air dispersion to reduce data dimension requirement. HAP adaptively predicts when the accumulated prediction error is low and then uses data compensation for correction whenever the prediction error becomes high. The preliminary results based on the city scale deployments with 10 taxis show that our system achieves up to 50% reduction on system errors.
