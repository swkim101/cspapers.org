We present an application of the usefulness performance measure in a WAN-based SDI system. Components of two basic indexing and retrieval algorithms are compared experimentally. The components we investigate include indexing token type (words versus N-grams), the amount of word reduction used in indexing, and the use of an indirect similarity component in retrieval. The theoretical basis and implement at ion of the basic algorithms and variations are discnssed. Results indicate that words perform better than N-grams, that S-stemming is better than fullstemming, and that indirect similarity provides an improvement to the cosine measure. Performance improvements are, however, small.
