In this cult, computer programming is one of the most modern needs in every academic discipline. Students majoring in various subjects are inclined spontaneously to take at least the first course of computer programming with an expectation that they will be capable of writing programs in their special fields of interest. What they mostly learn is the structure of the language and the basic rules and regulations governing its use. Possibly they write few programs, usually similar to those discussed in the classroom. The students' expectations were not fulfilled and their enthusiasm in programming fades.
