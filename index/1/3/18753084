Semidefinite programs derived from the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma are quite common in control and signal processing applications. The programs are often of high dimension making them hard or impossible to solve with general-purpose solvers. KYPD is a customized solver for KYP-SDPs that utilizes the inherent structure of the optimization problem thus improving efficiency significantly
