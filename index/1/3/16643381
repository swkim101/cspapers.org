We develop a selection of design and evaluation rules for building an adaptive schema in an object-oriented data and knowledge base system. This set of style rules include not only those which we use to preserve validity and minimality of an object-oriented schema, but also those which help us to promote extensibility, reusability and adaptiveness of an object-oriented schema against future requirement changes. We encourage to use the set of style rules proposed as a means for validating quality of a schema, and for transforming an object-oriented schema into a better style regarding to adaptiveness and robustness, rather than as a user-oriented method solely for designing the schema.
