A new methodology1 is presented for computing a minimal envelope for the reachable space of a mechanism, i.e. the space that contains a given mechanism in all its admissible configurations. The research is motivated by the packaging process in Digital Mock-Up applied in automotive industry. An important task in the concept phase, the automated determination of the space requirement for all parts, is still an unsolved problem in the case of mechanisms. The particular benefit of the method presented is its generality and robustness: It is able to deal with both openand closed-loop mechanisms. The reachable space is computed with regard to the geometric description of each part. The approximation is enclosing and always converges in a uniform way and the tolerance can be pre-defined by the user. The method combines the use of bounding object hierarchies and the application of interval analysis. It is also able to approximate the swept volume of an object following a parameterized trajectory. We describe how the efficiency can be improved by lazy evaluation and by a deeper problem analysis. The presented algorithms are implemented and tested to a large extent2.
