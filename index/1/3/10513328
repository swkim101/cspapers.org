Recently microprogramming technique has been used in many areas such as computers, peripheral devices, terminals, and so on. Control word organization varies with each control equipment. Also integrated control technique or centralized control technique requires the integration of microprograms depending on system configuration. Therefore generalized and sophisticated design support system has been desired. Microprogramming Design support System, MDS, has been developed to meet such requirements.
