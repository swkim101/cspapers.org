Distributional semantic methods to approximate word meaning with context vectors have been very successful empirically, and the last years have seen a surge of interest in their compositional extension to phrases and sentences. We present here a new model that, like those of Coecke et al. (2010) and Baroni and Zamparelli (2010), closely mimics the standard Montagovian semantic treatment of composition in distributional terms. However, our approach avoids a number of issues that have prevented the application of the earlier linguistically-motivated models to full-fledged, real-life sentences. We test the model on a variety of empirical tasks, showing that it consistently outperforms a set of competitive rivals. 1 Compositional distributional semantics The research of the last two decades has established empirically that distributional vectors for words obtained from corpus statistics can be used
