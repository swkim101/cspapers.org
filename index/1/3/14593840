Deletions occur for a variety of reasons, which can make the classification task challenging. Moreover, deletion prediction might serve different goals, the characteristics of which should be reflected in the evaluation design. This paper addresses the problem of deletion prediction by analyzing the distribution of deleted tweets, presenting a new evaluation framework, exploring tweet-based and user-based features, and reporting prediction scores.
