Cross-language Text Categorization is the task of assigning semantic classes to documents written in a target language (e.g. English) while the system is trained using labeled documents in a source language (e.g. Italian).In this work we present many solutions according to the availability of bilingual resources, and we show that it is possible to deal with the problem even when no such resources are accessible. The core technique relies on the automatic acquisition of Multilingual Domain Models from comparable corpora.Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach, providing a low cost solution for the Cross Language Text Categorization task. In particular, when bilingual dictionaries are available the performance of the categorization gets close to that of monolingual text categorization.
