The principal characteristic of the RESEDA system is being able to question an historical data-base about the causal relationships which may exist between different attested facts in the database, but which are not explicitly recorded. In order to do this the designers of RESEDA have created from scratch a methodology for the formalization and generalization of the reasoning used by historians in concrete situations. The description of the present state of this methodology is the object of this paper.
