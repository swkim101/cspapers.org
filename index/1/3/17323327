Computers which have high performances for non-numeric data processing should be developed in order to satisfy and expand new applications which will become predominant fields in information processing of the 1990s.
 Knowledge information processing forming the main part of applied artificial intelligence is expected to be one of the important fields in 1990s information processing and the dedicated computers for this have been selected as the main theme of the national project of the Fifth Generation computers.
 The key technologies for the Fifth Generation Computer System (FGCS) seem to be VLSI architecture, parallel processing such as data flow control, logic programming, knowledge base based on relational database, and applied artificial intelligence and pattern processing.
 Inference machines and relational algebra machines are typical of the core processors which constitute FGCS.
