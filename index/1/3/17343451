As an avid poker player, I enjoyed playing low stakes cash games and low buy-in tournaments on Full Tilt Poker before Black Friday.i However, as a Computer Scientist specializing in network and software security, I would never play poker online for any significant stakes, due to security concerns around malware and malicious remote access tools. Similarly, malware and remote access tools threaten online banking, online access to healthcare records and many other applications. In this article, I describe a new solution to the problem of remote access via malware that is easy to adopt, requires no new hardware or user training, and which I believe greatly reduces the threats to online applications.
