In earlier work we observed that one can reduce CPP to CP by finding a set of initial states whose probability $\geq\theta$, for whicha conformant plan exists. In previous solvers we used the underlying planner to select this set of states and to plan for them simultaneously. Here we suggest an alternative approach: start with relevance analysis to determine a promising set of initial states on which to focus. Then, call an off-the-shelf conformant planner to solve the resulting problem. This approach has a number of advantages. First, instead of depending on the heuristic function to select the set of initial states,we can introduce specific, efficient relevance reasoning techniques. Second, we can benefit from optimizations used by conformant planners that are unsound when applied to the original CPP. Finally, we are free to use any existing (or new) CP solver. Consequently, the new planner dominates previous solvers on almost all domains and scales to instances that were not solved before.
