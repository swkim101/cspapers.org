We present a novel method for integrating GPS position estimates with position and attitude estimates derived from visual odometry using a scheme similar to a classic loosely-coupled GPS/INS integration. Under such an arrangement, we derive the error dynamics of the system and develop a Kalman Filter for estimating the errors in position and attitude. Using a control-based approach to observability, we show that the errors in both position and attitude (including yaw) are fully observable when there is a component of acceleration perpendicular to the velocity vector in the navigation frame. Numerical simulations are performed to confirm the observability analysis.
