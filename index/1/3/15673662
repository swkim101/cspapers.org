Retention registers are utilized in power gating design to hold design state during power down and to allow safe and fast system reactivation. Since a retention register consumes more power and costs more area than a non-retention register, it is desirable to minimize the use of retention registers. However, relaxing retention requirement to a minimal subset of registers can be computationally challenging. In this paper, we adopt satisfiability solving for scalable selection of registers whose retention is unnecessary and exploit input sequence constraints to increase the number of non-retention registers. Empirical results on industrial benchmarks show that our proposed methods are efficient and effective in identifying non-retention registers.
