Accelerometer is the predominant sensor used for low-power context detection on smartphones. Although low-power, accelerometer is orientation and position-dependent, requires a high sampling rate, and subsequently complex processing and training to achieve good accuracy. We present an alternative approach for context detection using only the smartphone's barometer, a relatively new sensor now present in an increasing number of devices. The barometer is independent of phone position and orientation. Using a low sampling rate of 1 Hz, and simple processing based on intuitive logic, we demonstrate that it is possible to use the barometer for detecting the basic user activities of IDLE, WALKING, and VEHICLE at extremely low-power. We evaluate our approach using 47 hours of real-world transportation traces from 3 countries and 13 individuals, as well as more than 900 km of elevation data pulled from Google Maps from 5 cities, comparing power and accuracy to Google's accelerometer-based Activity Recognition algorithm, and to Future Urban Mobility Survey's (FMS) GPS-accelerometer server-based application. Our barometer-based approach uses 32 mW lower power compared to Google, and has comparable accuracy to both Google and FMS. This is the first paper that uses only the barometer for context detection.
