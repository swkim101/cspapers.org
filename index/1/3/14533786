In this study, a deformation control with spatial decoupling properties is designed and implemented. This control strategy treats the shift in position and posture attributable to an external force as the deformation of the robot. The deformation dynamics are constructed from the Maxwell and Voigt models, which describe plastic and elastic deformation, respectively. Next, a control method is proposed to passively achieve different deformation characteristics in each direction. Two physical simulations with a robotic arm are executed to validate the proposed control law.
