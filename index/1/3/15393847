Creating rich representations of environments requires integration of multiple sensing modalities with complementary characteristics such as range and imaging sensors. To precisely combine multisensory information, the rigid transformation between different sensor coordinate systems (i.e., extrinsic parameters) must be estimated. The majority of existing extrinsic calibration techniques require one or multiple planar calibration patterns (such as checkerboards) to be observed simultaneously from the range and imaging sensors. The main limitation of these approaches is that they require modifying the scene with artificial targets. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for extrinsically calibrating a range sensor with respect to an image sensor with no requirement of external artificial targets. The proposed method exploits natural linear features in the scene to precisely determine the rigid transformation between the coordinate frames. First, a set of 3D lines (plane intersection and boundary line segments) are extracted from the point cloud, and a set of 2D line segments are extracted from the image. Correspondences between the 3D and 2D line segments are used as inputs to an optimization problem which requires jointly estimating the relative translation and rotation between the coordinate frames. The proposed method is not limited to any particular types or configurations of sensors. To demonstrate robustness, efficiency and generality of the presented algorithm, we include results using various sensor configurations.
