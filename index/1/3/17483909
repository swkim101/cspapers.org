Efficient algorithms are presented for several grammar problems relevant to compiler construction. These problems include(i) testing, for a reduced context-free grammar G and an LL(k), uniquely invertible, or BRC(m,n) grammar H, if G is structurally contained by H, and(ii) testing, for a reduced context-free grammar G and a structurally unambiguous grammar H, if G is Reynolds covered by H or if there is an on to homomorphisem from G to H.Related complexity results are presented for several problems for the regular grammars, program schemes, and monadic program schemes.
