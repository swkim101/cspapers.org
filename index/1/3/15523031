Machine learning systems offer unparalled flexibility in dealing with evolving input in a variety of applications, such as intrusion detection systems and spam e-mail filtering. However, machine learning algorithms themselves can be a target of attack by a malicious adversary. This paper provides a framework for answering the question, "Can machine learning be secure?" Novel contributions of this paper include a taxonomy of different types of attacks on machine learning techniques and systems, a variety of defenses against those attacks, a discussion of ideas that are important to security for machine learning, an analytical model giving a lower bound on attacker's work function, and a list of open problems.
