Recognizing user emotional states while running entertainment applications such as playing game or watching video is very important to understand and improve user experience. In this work, we designed a practical system using wearable physiological sensors including skin electrical conductivity and photoplethysmography (PPG) to recognize popular non-negative emotions that people experience when they watch videos or play games on their mobile devices. We demonstrates how our system recognizes emotional states in two phases: (1) classifying the levels of arousal (high or low) and valence (positive or neutral) at the accuracy of 94.74% and 78.95% respectively; (2) recognizing three non-negative emotions: excitement, contentment, amusement by mapping arousal and valence levels using Russel circumplex model of affect.
