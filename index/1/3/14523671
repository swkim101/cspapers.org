FNC-2 is a new attribute grammar processing system aiming at expressive power, efficiency, ease of use and versatility. Its development at INRIA started in 1986, and a first running prototype is available since early 1989. Its most important features are: efficient exhaustive and incremental visit-sequence-based evaluation of strongly (absolutely) non-circular AGs; extensive space optimizations; a specially-designed AG-description language, with provisions for true modularity; portability and versatility of the generated evaluators; complete environment for application development. This paper briefly describes the design and implementation of FNC-2 and its peripherals. Then preliminary experience with the system is reported.
