A preprocessor for Pascal is discussed which provides for the automatic implementations of stacks and queues into student users' programs. Declarations for these abstract types are given by the user in a form that would resemble their declarations if Pascal directly supported these types, and the user's program is written using certain generic routines which represent the primitive operations on these types. The preprocessor creates the necessary declarations to support multiple occurrences of these types in a program, and makes minor modifications to the source program's statement part. The preprocessor, and the reactions of the student implementors and the initial group of student users are mentioned.
