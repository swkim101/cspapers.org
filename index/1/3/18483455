Creating programs that engage undergraduate women with the broader community and encourage them to take an active role in changing the underrepresentation of women in computer science can effectively address both retention and recruitment of women in the discipline. This paper is an experience report describing the creation and outcomes of an outreach program for K-12 girls run entirely by undergraduate women. The contributions of this paper are the description of the creation of a successful student-led outreach program and a set of active-learning modules for K-12 students that illustrate advanced topics.
