Remote control of microrobotic workstations dedicated to microassembly of hybrid MEMS is a challenging problem due to the lack of reliability and safety in microplanning procedures. It can be avoided by using virtual reality technology. Using the simulated environment in virtual reality, the operator can practice, explore and prevent the problems that occur during implementation. We proposed a concept of a physically behaved microrobotic workcell in virtual environment for microassembly teaching. In a first part, implementation of physical behaviors of virtual objects into VR for micro-task teaching is introduced. A virtual microworld is exactly reconstructed from the CAD-CAM databases of the real environment and simulates contact and elastic robotic interactions, virtual sensing of position and force, etc. Then, the virtual workcell is simulated and an example of micro-task teaching is given. The implementation includes view tracking using virtual force feedback, visual and audio rendering in virtual microenvironment.
