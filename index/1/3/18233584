Feedback-with-carry shift registers (FCSRs) are nonlinear analogues of linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). Like the LFSRs, FCSRs are easy to implement and are important primitives in stream cipher design and pseudorandom number generation. In this paper, we investigate the properties of combiner generators that use two 2-adic feedback-with-carry shift registers as primitives. The combining function is simply the XOR function. This choice is motivated by an observation of Arnault and Berger on the high nonlinearity of the FCSR and that of Siegenthaler on the trade-off between resilience and correlation immunity of boolean functions. When the two FCSRs have odd prime power connection integers with 2 as a primitive root, we determine the exact period of the output sequence. We also prove that if the prime factors of the connection integers of the two FCSRs belong to different equivalence classes modulo 4, then the output sequence is symmetrically complementary. We use this fact to derive upper bounds on the linear complexity and the 2-adic complexity of the output sequence of the FCSR-combiner.
