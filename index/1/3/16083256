Object detection in cluttered, natural scenes has a high complexity since many local observations compete for object hypotheses. Voting methods provide an efficient solution to this problem. When Hough voting is extended to location and scale, votes naturally become lines through scale space due to the local scale-location-ambiguity. In contrast to this, current voting methods stick to the location-only setting and cast point votes, which require local estimates of scale. Rather than searching for object hypotheses in the Hough accumulator, we propose a weighted, pairwise clustering of voting lines to obtain globally consistent hypotheses directly. In essence, we propose a hierarchical approach that is based on a sparse representation of object boundary shape. Clustering of voting lines (CVL) condenses the information from these edge points in few, globally consistent candidate hypotheses. A final verification stage concludes by refining the candidates. Experiments on the ETHZ shape dataset show that clustering voting lines significantly improves state-of-the-art Hough voting techniques.
