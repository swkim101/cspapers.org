Students become appreciative of dynamically allocated storage structures when they are led to see problems. Further, students become skillful manipulators of linked lists only by implementing them. A good discussion on linked lists is found in [2]. Linked lists are introduced at the beginning of CS2, which is before students have seen trees and become aware of the extreme utility of branching data structures. The pedagogical question, then, is how to kindle excitement over an information structure that is linear, like an array, but more cumbersome. Coupled to this, can a genuinely interesting application be found which requires somewhat more than the maintenance of a single solitary queue? An exercise that worked well for us was a program to give exact values for n!, where the limit to the size of n is quite large (around 500). This paper sketches the assignment, as given to the class.
