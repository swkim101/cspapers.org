The research proposes an approach of story segmentation for news video using multimodal analysis. The approach detects the topic-caption frames, and integrates them with silence clips detection, as well as shot segmentation to locate news story boundaries. On test data with 135,400 frames, the accuracy rate 87.9\% and the recall rate 98.7\% are obtained. The experimental results show the approach is valid and robust.
