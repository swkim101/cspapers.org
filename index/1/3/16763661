In the present paper we introduce an improved method to obtain the guaranteed singularity-free workspace of planar parallel kinematic machines. A geometric condition for the existence of singularities is extended to be used in interval analysis. Therefore, we eliminate the need of calculating the inconvenient interval form of the Jacobian's determinant. Hence, an appropriate description of the singularity-free workspace is obtained and the computational effort is reduced significantly. With the interval-based approach error sources, like manufacturing tolerances, can be considered. Consequently, regions that do not satisfy the proposed condition can be guaranteed not to have any type-two singularities. Several analysis examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed geometrical-based solver in comparison to existing solvers, i.e. based on the Jacobian's determinant.
