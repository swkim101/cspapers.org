The Flying Machine Arena (FMA) is an indoor research space built specifically for the study of autonomous systems and aerial robotics. In this video, we give an overview of this testbed and some of its capabilities. We show the FMA infrastructure and hardware, which includes a fleet of quadrocopters and a motion capture system for vehicle localization. The physical components of the FMA are complemented by specialized software tools and components that facilitate the use of the space and provide a unified framework for communication and control. The flexibility and modularity of the experimental platform is highlighted by various research projects and demonstrations.
