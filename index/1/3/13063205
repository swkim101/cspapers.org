The converging trends of society's desire/need for more sustainable technologies, exponentially increasing power densities within computing devices, and exponentially more computing devices, have inevitably pushed power and energy management into the forefront of computing design and management for purely economic reasons. Thus we are in the midst of a green computing revolution involving the redesign of information technology hardware and software at all levels of the information technology stack. This revolution has spawned a multitude of technological challenges, many of which are algorithmic in nature. We provide pointers into the literature on the green computing algorithmics.
