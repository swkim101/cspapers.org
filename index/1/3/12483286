In recent years, the market for portable devices has seen a large increase in the development of head mounted displays. While these displays provide many benefits to users, safety is still a concern. In particular, ensuring that content does not interfere with everyday activities and that users have adequate peripheral vision is very important for situational awareness. In this paper, I address these issues through the use of two novel display prototypes. The first is an optical see-through multi-focal plane display combined with an eye tracking interface. Through eye tracking and knowledge of the focal plane distances, I can calculate whether a user is looking at the environment or at a focal plane in the display. Any distracting text can then be quickly removed so that he or she has a clear view of the environment. The second prototype is a video see-through display which expands a user's environmental view through the use of 238Â° ultra wide field of view fisheye lenses. Based on the results of several initial evaluations, these new interfaces have the potential help users improve environmental awareness.
