The program complexity measure currently seems to be the most capable measure for both quantitative and objective control of the software project. Five program complexity measures (step count, McCabe's V(G), Halstead's E, Weighted Statement Count and Process V(G)) were assessed from such a viewpoint. This empirical study was done with the data collected through a practical software project. All of these measures have highly significant correlations with the management data. Application of complexity measures to software development management is discussed and a method for the detection of anomalous modules in a program is proposed.
