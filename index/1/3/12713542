We are interested in the belief change that occurs due to a sequence of ontic actions and epistemic actions. In order to represent such problems, we extend an existing epistemic action language to allow erroneous initial beliefs. We define a non-Markovian semantics for our action language that explicitly respects the interaction between ontic actions and epistemic actions. Further, we illustrate how to solve epistemic projection problems in our new language by translating action descriptions into extended logic programs. We conclude with some remarks about a prototype implementation of our work.
