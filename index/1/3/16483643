This paper proposes new concept of query free web search for daily living. We ordinarily benefit from additional information about our daily activities that we are currently engaged in. When washing a coffee maker, for example, we receive the benefit if we obtain such information as 'cleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes its stain well.' Our proposed method automatically searches for a web page including such information relates to an activity of daily living when the activity is performed. We assume that wireless sensor nodes are attached to daily objects to detect object use; our method makes a query from the names of objects which are used. Then, the method retrieves a web page relates to the activity of daily living by using the query.
