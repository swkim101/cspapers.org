The Department of Public Works in the Canadian Federal Government has initiated a 5 year Computer Aided Design Development program to co-ordinate computer oriented design programs and packages now existing within the Department; in particular the program is developing and will implement suitable systems for man/machine interaction, and information storage and control within the design process. These systems will direct themselves to both graphic and alphanumeric communication for both our in-house design teams and our consultants who in practice do the far larger part of the Department's design work.
