During the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of paradigms, standards and tools that can be used to realize process-oriented information systems. A major problem neglected in software engineering research so far has been the systematic determination of costs, benefits, and risks that are related to the use of these process-oriented software engineering methods and technologies. This task is quite difficult as the added value is influenced by many drivers. This paper sketches an economic-driven evaluation methodology to analyze costs, benefits, and risks of process-oriented software technologies and corresponding projects. We introduce an evaluation meta model and sketch a formalism to describe economic-driven evaluation scenarios.
