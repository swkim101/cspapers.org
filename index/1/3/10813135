Recent research suggests that children with autism exhibit certain positive social behaviors while interacting with robots that are not observed while interacting with their peers, caregivers, and therapists. This paper explores trends in robot-assisted autism therapy, as well as some of the specific therapies that have been shown to elicit desirable social interactions when working with children with autism. Considerations for the design of robots for use in robot-assisted therapies are also presented. Finally, general conclusions and recommendations are made to help further the work of robot-assisted autism therapy.
