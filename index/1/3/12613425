This paper presents a novel manipulation trajectory generating algorithm that constructs trajectories from learned motion harmonics and user defined constraints. The algorithm uses functional eigenanalysis to learn motion harmonics from demonstrated motions and then use the motion harmonics to compute the optimal trajectory that resembles the demonstrated motions and also satisfies the constraints. The algorithm has been tested on five real human motion data sets to obtain motion harmonics and then generate motions of each task for a NAO robot. The generated trajectories were compared with the trajectories generated using linear segment with parabolic blend approach and with the Open Motion Planning Library. The approach can also work with motion planners.
