Several studies have shown that the spatio-temporal mobility traces of human movements can be used to identify an individual. However, this work presents a novel framework for activity-based mobility profiling of individuals using only the temporal information. The proposed framework is conducive to model individuals' activity patterns in temporal scale, and quantifies the uniqueness measures based on certain temporal features of the activity sequence.
