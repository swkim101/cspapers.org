In this research, an intelligent system is designed between the user and the database system which accepts natural language input and then converts it into an SQL query. The research focuses on incorporating complex queries along with simple queries irrespective of the database. The system accommodates aggregate functions, multiple conditions in WHERE clause, advanced clauses like ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING. The system handles single sentence natural language inputs, which are with respect to selected database. The research currently concentrates on MySQL database system. The natural language statement goes through various stages of Natural Language Processing like morphological, lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis resulting in SQL query formation.
