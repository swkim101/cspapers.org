The iWarp'[ system 1s a new. unique multi-computer architecture that pro~icles a signrfi cant a&ance in the performance of pro-grammable signal and image pmcessmg systems. iWarp stands for Integrated Warp. This paper begins with a discussion of the irmo-vative i Warp architecture and communication moclel. The first three sections present the new conceptions embodied in the iWarp component, cell, system design and cell-interconnect. Next, the paper ex.tines the interclepencleucies between advanced hardware Ieatures and the clesign of high-level Languages. The languages plLE extensions me aimecl at granting programmer control over the cell facilities that make the high performance possible. 'Ilte i Warp instruction set poses unique opportunities to optimizing compilers; the array architecture creates speciaf challenges for software tools dev elopmeut. This paper descnbea innovative ways to access hm-dware facilities from high-level languages, explains language extensions, and introduces a special-purpose image-processmg langu~ge suitable for parallel execution on the i Warp system.
