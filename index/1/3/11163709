Nonvolatile memory technologies such as Phase Change Memory (PCM) and Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) are emerging as promising replacements to DRAM. Before deploying STT-RAM and PCM into functional systems, a number of challenges still remain. Specifically, both require relatively high write energy, STT-RAM suffers from high bit error rates and PCM suffers from low endurance. A common solution to overcome those challenges is to minimize the number of bits changed per write. In this work, we introduce Pseudo-Random Encoding Scheme (PRES) to minimize the number of bit changes during memory writes. PRES maps the write data vector into an intermediate highly random set of data vectors. Subsequently, the intermediate data vector that yields the least number of differences when compared to the currently stored data is selected. Our evaluation shows that PRES reduces bit flips by up to 25% over a baseline differential writing scheme. Further, PRES reduces bit flips by 15% over the leading bit-flip minimization scheme, while decreasing encoding and decoding complexities by more than 90%.
