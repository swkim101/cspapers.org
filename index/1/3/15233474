IP multicasting provides a mechanism for location independent addressing and packet delivery to a group of hosts that belong to a multicast group. It also provides e cient mechanisms for hosts to join and leave multicast groups. The problem of supporting macro and micro level host mobility in the Internet involves similar issues of location independent addressing, address translation, packet forwarding and location management of mobile hosts. In order to exploit the commonality of goals in the two problems, we have investigated a new approach for supporting host mobility using IP multicasting as the sole mechanism for addressing and routing packets to mobile hosts. Mobile hosts are identi ed by unique multicast IP addresses, and use the IP multicasting infrastructure to route packets destined for mobile hosts. We have implemented a mobile computing environment which uses this routing approach, and our performance analysis shows that it is very e ective in supporting seamless mobility for both hando s and interface changes within and across networks. We discuss a number of issues which need to be resolved in order to make our approach viable and practical for supporting host mobility in the Internet.
