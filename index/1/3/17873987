A common disadvantage of multi-legged robots is that they often lack the manipulation capability. To overcome this limitation, an arm can be added to the body of the multi-legged robot, to perform manipulation tasks and provide assistance for locomotion. First, we proposed an attachment configuration of the arm for a multi-legged robot that provide a uniform workspace in front, below and above the base robot trunk. Second, an integrated control framework promises to keep the mobility and the balance of the mobile platform and provides precise manipulation capability of the arm incorporating a payload estimation scheme. Finally, we verify an integrated control framework with experimental results of a static and walking mobile platform while moving the arm.
