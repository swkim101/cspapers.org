This paper describes a decentralized Bayesian approach to coordinating multiple autonomous sensor platforms searching for a single non-evading target. In this architecture, each decision maker builds an equivalent representation of the target state PDF through a Bayesian DDF network enabling him or her to coordinate their actions without exchanging any information about their plans. The advantage of the approach is that a high degree of scalability and real time adaptability can be achieved. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in different scenarios by implementing the framework for a team of airborne search vehicles looking for a stationary, and a drifting target lost at sea.
