Emails are important tools for communication and cooperation, they contain large amount of information and connections to knowledge and data sources. Because of this, it is very important to improve the efficiency of their processing. This paper describes an email search system which integrates full-text search with social search while processing also the attached and linked resources. The project described in this paper is still in progress. Due to this fact, some proposed parts of the system are not implemented and also not proven yet. The proposed equation for determining the social importance of an email has also to be tuned during the last phases of the development and the evaluation phase. The already implemented part of the system includes content extraction from the email messages, attached and linked resources and also the textual search and social relation extraction is implemented. The next phase of the development includes tuning of the social evaluation and it's integration with textual search.
