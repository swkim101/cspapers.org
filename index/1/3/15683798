A framework for the specification of security policies is proposed. It can used to formally specify confidentiality and integrity policies, the latter can be given in terms of ClarkWilson style access triples. The tiamework extends the Clark-Wilson model in that it can be used to specify dynamic segregation of duty. For application systems where security is critical, a multilevel security based approach is defined. Security policies for less critical applications can be implemented using standard Unix based systems. Both implementation strategies are based on the standard protection mechanisms that are provided by the respective systems.
