Probabilistic path planning techniques have proven to be vital for finding and validating solutions for difficult industrial assembly tasks. Nevertheless, the failure of a path planner to find a solution to a task does not suggest how to correct the error. We suggest a methodology to identify possible bottlenecks and present an algorithm to analyze the extent to which the design must be modified in order for the task to complete successfully. We validate our algorithm on two industrial problems involving design errors, and explain how to interpret the results in order to improve the design.
