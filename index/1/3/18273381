This paper presents a highly sensitive dual mode tactile and proximity sensor for robotic applications that uses Carbon Microcoils (CMCs). The sensor consists of multiple electrode layers printed on a Flexible Printed Circuit Board (FPCB) and a dielectric substrate into which the CMCs are dispersed. The dielectric layer is simply put on the top of the FPCB. Thus, the sensor provides ease of fabrication and robustness against repetitive external contacts because the dielectric layer protects the electrodes. The electrical properties of the sensor are changed when an object approaches or touches the sensor. The sensor uses a capacitive sensing mode for tactile sensing and an inductive sensing mode for proximity sensing. CMCs amplify the change of the sensor signal because of electrical impedance formed by the CMCs, and thus, the sensitivity of the sensor increases. We fabricate the prototype sensor with the dimensions of 30 × 30 × 0.6 mm3, and with 3 mm spatial-resolution. The sensor detects the applied pressure up to 330 kPa and the distance of an object as much as 150 mm away.
