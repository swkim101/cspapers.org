Rigid body dynamics with contact constraints can be solved locally using linear complementarity techniques. However, these techniques do not impose the original constraints and need stabilization. In this paper we show how constraint stabilization can also be done in a complementarity framework. Our technique effectively eliminates the drift problem for both equality and inequality constraints and requires no parameter tweaking. We describe results from an implemented system, and compare the new technique to the well known Baumgarte stabilization.
