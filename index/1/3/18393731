Semantic analysis tries to solve problems arising from polysemy and synonymy that are abundant in natural languages. Recently, Gabrilovich and Markovitch propose the Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) technique, which complements the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique. In this paper, we show that the two techniques are not as distinct as their names suggest; instead, we find that ESA is equivalent to a LSA variant, and this equivalence generalizes to all kernel methods using kernels arising from the canonical dot product. Effectively, this result guarantees that ESA would not outperform the peak efficacy of LSA for any applications using the above kernel methods. In short, this paper for the first time establishes the connections between ESA and LSA, quantifies their relative efficacy, and generalizes the result to a big category of kernel methods.
