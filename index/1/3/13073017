This paper describes the motivation, design and implementation of a Perception Validation System (PVS), a system for measuring the outdoor perception performance of an autonomous vehicle. The PVS relies on using large amounts of real world data and ground truth information to quantify performance aspects such as the rate of false positive or false negative detections of an obstacle detection system. Our system relies on a relational database infrastructure to achieve a high degree of flexibility in the type of analyses it can support.
