When a human and computer perform similar tasks in parallel, it is important that an effective line of communication exist between the two entities. Since overt communication may add to the human's workload, an implicit method of communication is suggested in which the computer has a model of human performance on which to base actions. A two-stage model of human performance is employed in an experimental situation in which both a human and a computer act as decision makers. Results indicate that the implementation of a model significantly improves the human's performance and the overall system performance, without degrading the computer's performance. Research into additional experimental and real-world situations is suggested.
