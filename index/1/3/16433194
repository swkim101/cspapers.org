A robust hybrid control method for robot manipulators is proposed which integrates an H/sup /spl infin// controller and an adaptive controller. The H/sup /spl infin// controller is used to minimize the effect of parameter uncertainties of the robot model on the tracking performance, while the adaptive controller continuously adjusts the model parameters to reduce the model error. Simulations show that disturbances generated from the model error will be quickly compensated and so small tracking errors can be achieved.<<ETX>>
