Virtual Coordinate Systems (VCS) have been proposed as an efficient and low cost service to provide network locality estimations by accurately predicting round-trip times (RTT) between arbitrary nodes in a network. Each node measures the RTT to a small number of other nodes and then can estimate the RTT between any two nodes. VCSs assign a set of coordinates to each node based on the estimated RTTs and a distance function. In a distributed and decentralized VCS, like Vivaldi [2], each node maintains and updates its own coordinate by relying on information received from other nodes. Distributed VCSs have been shown [3] to be extremely vulnerable to insider attacks, where compromised nodes delay measurement probes and lie about their coordinates with the motivation to decrease system performance. As many applications rely on a VCS to build robust services, there have been several proposals to secure them using anomaly detection. However, these schemes are vulnerable to attacks where through small changes attackers make the defense mechanisms to learn malicious behavior as being good behavior. One such attack is the well-known frog-boiling attack where attackers lie by small amounts that accumulate over time and gradually lead to large changes in system performance [1].
