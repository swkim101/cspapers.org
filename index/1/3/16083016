We study the problem facing a set of decision-makers who must select values for the variables of a linear program, when only parts of the matrix are available to each of them. The goal is to find a feasible solution that is as close to the true optimum as possible, When each decision-maker decides one variable and knows all constraints involving this variable, we show that the worst-case ratio is related tc, the maximum number of variables appearing in each constraint, and a simple " safe " heuristic is optimal. Since this problem involves constrained optimization, there is a novel criterion, besides the competitive ratio, comparing the performance of a heuristic with the best feasible distributed algorithm, perhaps specializing on the current inst ante; we show different bounds for this parameter. When the constraint structure (the zero-nonzero pattern of the matrix) is known in advance, and the variables are partitioned bet ween decision-makers, then the optimum ratio is a complicated parameter of the associated hypergraph, which we bound from above and below in terms of variants of clique and graph coloring; but several interesting special cases are characterized completely.
