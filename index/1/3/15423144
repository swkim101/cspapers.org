By generalizing the notion of location of a constituent to allow discontinuous loctaions, one can describe the discontinuous constituents of non-configurational languages. These discontinuous constituents can be described by a variant of definite clause grammars, and these grammars can be used in conjunction with a proof procedure to create a parser for non-configurational languages.
