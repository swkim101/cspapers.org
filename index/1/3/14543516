We introduce a new platform for annotating inferential phenomena in entailment data, buttressed by a formal semantic model and a proof-system that provide immediate verification of the coherency and completeness of the marked annotations. By integrating a web-based user interface, a formal lexicon, a lambda-calculus engine and an off-the-shelf theorem prover, the platform allows human annotators to mark linguistic phenomena in entailment data (pairs made up of a premise and a hypothesis) and to receive immediate feedback whether their annotations are substantiated: for positive entailment pairs, the system searches for a formal logical proof that the hypothesis follows from the premise; for negative pairs, the system verifies that a counter-model can be constructed. This novel approach facilitates the creation of textual entailment corpora with annotations that are sufficiently coherent and complete for recognizing the entailment relation or lack thereof. A corpus of several hundred annotated entailments is currently being compiled based on the platform and will be available for the research community in the foreseeable future.
