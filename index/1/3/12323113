An implementation based on the two-phase XML processing model introduced in [3] is presented in this paper. The model employs a prefilter to remove uninteresting fragments of an input XML document by approximately executing a user's queries. The refined candidate-set XML document is then returned to the user's DOM- or SAX-based applications for further processing. In this demonstration, it is shown that the technique significantly enhances the performance of existing DOM- and SAX-based XML applications and tools (e.g., XPath/XQuery processors and XML parsers), while reducing computational resource needs. Moreover, the prefilter can be easily integrated into existing applications by adding only one instruction. We also present an enhancement to the indexing scheme of the prefiltering technique to speed up the evaluation of certain axes.
