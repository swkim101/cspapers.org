Many dis overy problems, e.g., subgroup or asso iation rule dis overy, an naturally be ast as n-best hypothesis problems where the goal is to nd the n hypotheses from a given hypothesis spa e that s ore best a ording to a given utility fun tion. We present a sampling algorithm that solves this problem by issuing a small number of database queries while guaranteeing pre ise bounds on on den e and quality of solutions. Known sampling algorithms assume that the utility be the average (over the examples) of some fun tion, whi h is not the ase for many frequently used utility fun tions. We show that our algorithm works for all utilities that an be estimated with bounded error. We provide su h error bounds and resulting worstase sample bounds for some of the most frequently used utilities, and prove that there is no sampling algorithm for another popular lass of utility fun tions. The algorithm is sequential in the sense that it starts to return (or dis ard) hypotheses that already seem to be parti ularly good (or bad) after a few examples. Thus, the algorithm is often even faster than its worstase bounds.
