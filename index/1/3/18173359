This paper presents a unique summer project for a group of undergraduate students and high school computer teachers to gain research experiences in the area of cybersecurity. The students and teachers were selected from the participants in the NSF REU and RET programs at the host institution. Through the research on security testing of a real-world online banking system, the students and teachers have not only learned about the cutting-edge security testing techniques, but also made publishable contributions to the research base. The two collaborating graduate assistants served as an immediate role model for the undergraduates and an indirect role model for high school students through the teachers. With the help from the graduate assistants, the students and teachers were able to work effectively toward achieving their research objectives. The internal competition helped the participants get a better sense of achievement and satisfaction. The research experiences also prepared the teachers with the necessary knowledge for introducing cybersecurity topics (e.g., secure programming) into future classroom activity. As such, the project described in this paper provides a model summer program for undergraduate and/or K-12 teachers to gain research experiences.
