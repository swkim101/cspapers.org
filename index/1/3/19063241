This paper presents a novel multi-step closed-form walking trajectory generator based on the concept of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) that guarantees smoothness of all resulting reference trajectories. Further, we introduce an analytical method for footstep adjustment to recover from strong disturbances. The DCM trajectory is adjusted to guarantee smoothness of control outputs. Additionally, we present a momentum-based disturbance observer that improves robustness w.r.t. strong continuous perturbations. The proposed methods are verified in simulations.
