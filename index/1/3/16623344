Here we present findings of a needs validation study of 18-25 year old women and their wardrobes. Based on their feedback, we developed a prototype system that allows for borrowing and sharing of information about clothing via Facebook. The novelty of our interface lies in its combining RFID tags and social networking. In doing so we bridge the material and virtual realms and demonstrate the importance of material culture for ubiquitous computing.
