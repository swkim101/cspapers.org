We consider the <i>general network information flow problem</i>, which was introduced by Ahlswede et. al[1]. We show a <i>periodicity effect:</i> for every integer <i>m</i> ≥ 2, there exists an instance of the network information ow problem that admits a solution if and only if the alphabet size is a perfect <i>m</i><sup>th</sup> power. Building on this result, we construct an instance with <i>O</i>(<i>m</i>) messages and <i>O</i>(<i>m</i>) nodes that admits a solution if and only if the alphabet size is an enormous 2<sup>exp(Ω(<i>m</i>1/3</sup>)). In other words, if we regard each message as a length-<i>k</i> bit string, then <i>k</i> must be <i>exponential</i> in the size of the network. For this same instance, we show that if edge capacities are slightly increased, then there is a solution with a modest alphabet size of <i>O</i>(2<i><sup>m</sup></i>). In light of these results, we suggest that a more appropriate model would assume that the network operates at slightly under capacity.
