This paper introduces the SCCA Hand, a five motor robot hand developed using a minimalist design approach that focused on grasping abilities in real-world environments. Notable features include a novel bidirectional tendon underactuated finger design that biases actuator force toward finger flexion, an additive manufactured monocoque steel construction that enabled enhanced feature density and a low parts count, low grasp impedance by means of series elastic actuation, shock absorption for protection from impacts, and anthropomorphic speed, strength, and size. In addition to a description of its design, experimental characterizations of speed and force capabilities as well as demonstrated achievement of eight canonical grasps and postures are provided.
