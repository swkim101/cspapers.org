We put forward the notion of Local Zero Knowledge and provide its first implementations in a variety of settings under standard complexity assumptions.Whereas the classical notion of Zero Knowledge guarantees the secrecy only of information that is hard to compute, the new one meaningfully guarantees the secrecy of any information (in case of perfect zero-knowledge, and asymptotically in all other cases). Consequently, Local Zero Knowledge remains very meaningful even if DP = NP.
