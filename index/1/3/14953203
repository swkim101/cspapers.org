Advanced features of modern data-parallel languages, such as High Performance Fortran, require new techniques in compilers and run-time systems. We present efficient methods for generating local memory addresses in programs containing references to arrays with cyclic(k) distributions. By exploiting the repetitive pattern of memory accesses we can handle arbitrary affine subscripts, while minimizing the space and time overhead. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experimental results.
