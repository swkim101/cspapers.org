Odometry is an important element for the localization of mobile robots. For humanoid robots, it is very prone to integration errors, due to mechanical complexity, uncertainties and foot/ground contacts. Most of the time, a visual odometry is then used to encompass these problems. In this work we propose a method to compensate for odometry drifting using machine learning on a small size low-cost humanoid without vision. This method is tested on different ground conditions and exhibits a significant improvement in odometry accuracy.
