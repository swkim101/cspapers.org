This paper presents SCYMBAL, a switched-capacitor symbolic simulator. The adopted algorithm, computer implementation, and program performances in comparison with other well-known realizations are discussed. Accompanying tools and the method of insertion in the integrated CAD system are presented. A new methodology of automated generation of circuit structures using symbolic simulator and concepts of artificial intelligence is presented and compared with algorithmic approach.
