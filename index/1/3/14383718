Can the Web help people live healthier lives? This paper seeks to answer this question through an examination of sites, apps and online communities designed to help people improve their fitness, better manage their disease(s) and conditions, and to solve the often elusive connections between the symptoms they experience, diseases and treatments. These health social machines employ a combination of both simple and complex social and computational processes to provide such support. We first provide a descriptive classification of the kinds of machines currently available, and the support each class offers. We then describe the limitations exhibited by these systems and potential ways around them, towards the design of more effective machines in the future.
