Describing the color and textural information of a person image is one of the most crucial aspects of person re-identification. In this paper, we present a novel descriptor based on a hierarchical distribution of pixel features. A hierarchical covariance descriptor has been successfully applied for image classification. However, the mean information of pixel features, which is absent in covariance, tends to be major discriminative information of person images. To solve this problem, we describe a local region in an image via hierarchical Gaussian distribution in which both means and covariances are included in their parameters. More specifically, we model the region as a set of multiple Gaussian distributions in which each Gaussian represents the appearance of a local patch. The characteristics of the set of Gaussians are again described by another Gaussian distribution. In both steps, unlike the hierarchical covariance descriptor, the proposed descriptor can model both the mean and the covariance information of pixel features properly. The results of experiments conducted on five databases indicate that the proposed descriptor exhibits remarkably high performance which outperforms the state-of-the-art descriptors for person re-identification.
