We present a new affine-invariant optimization algorithm called Online Lazy Newton. The regret of Online Lazy Newton is independent of conditioning: the algorithm's performance depends on the best possible preconditioning of the problem in retrospect and on its \emph{intrinsic} dimensionality. As an application, we show how Online Lazy Newton can be used to achieve an optimal regret of order $\sqrt{rT}$ for the low-rank experts problem, improving by a $\sqrt{r}$ factor over the previously best known bound and resolving an open problem posed by Hazan et al (2016).
