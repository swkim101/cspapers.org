Group-buying ads seeking a minimum number of customers before the deal expiry are increasingly used by the daily-deal providers. Unlike the traditional web ads, the advertiser's profits for group-buying ads depends on the time to expiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group size. Since both these quantities are time-dependent, optimal bid amounts to maximize profits change with every impression. Consequently, traditional static bidding strategies are far from optimal. Instead, bid values need to be optimized in real-time to maximize expected bidder profits. This online optimization of deal profits is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real-time (spot) bidding. To this end, we propose a real-time bidding strategy for group-buying deals based on the online optimization of the bid values. We derive the expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts, and dynamically vary bids to maximize profits. Further, to satisfy time constraints of the online bidding, we present methods of minimizing computation timings. We evaluate the proposed bidding on a multi-million click stream of 935 ads. The method shows significant profit improvement over the existing strategies.
