Let <i>H</i> be a finite family of graphs. A graph <i>G</i> is <i>H</i>-universal if it contains a copy of each <i>H</i> ∈ <i>H</i> as a subgraph. Let <i>H</i><i>(k,n)</i> denote the family of graphs on <i>n</i> vertices with maximum degree at most <i>k.</i> For all admissible <i>k</i> and <i>n</i>, we construct an <i>H</i><i>(k, n)</i>-universal graph <i>G</i> with at most <i>ckn<sup>2-2/k</sup></i> edges, where <i>c<sub>k</sub></i> is a constant depending only on <i>k.</i> This is optimal, up to the constant factor <i>c<sub>k</sub></i>, as it is known that <i>c'<sub>k</sub>n<sup>2-2/k</sup></i> is a lower bound for the number of edges in any such graph. The construction of <i>G</i> is explicit, and there is an efficient deterministic algorithm for finding a copy of any given <i>H</i> ∈ <i>H</i><i>(k,n)</i> in <i>G.</i>
