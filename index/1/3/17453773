This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm for the 3D range to 2D image registration problem in urban scene settings. Our input is a set of unregistered 3D range scans and a set of unregistered and uncalibrated 2D images of the scene. The 3D range scans and 2D images capture real scenes in extremely high detail. A new automated algorithm calibrates each 2D image and computes an optimized transformation between the 2D images and 3D range scans. This transformation is based on a match of 3D with 2D features that maximizes an overlap criterion. Our algorithm attacks the hard 3D range to 2D image registration problem in a systematic, efficient, and automatic way. Images captured by a high-resolution 2D camera, that moves and adjusts freely, are mapped on a centimeter-accurate 3D model of the scene providing photorealistic renderings of high quality. We present results from experiments in three different urban settings.
