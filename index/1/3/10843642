In this study, we experimentally investigated the effect of robot fingertip stiffness on the maximum resistible force. The maximum resistible force is defined as the maximum tangential force at which the fingertip can maintain contact when applying and increasing tangential/shearing force. We include in the definition of this term the effect of fingertip deformation. In contrast to our previous study [11], cylindrical fingertips with flat surfaces were used in this study so that the contact area would remain the same when there was no tangential/shearing force. This made it possible to see the effect of fingertip stiffness more clearly. We also investigated the effect of curvature of the contact surface, which was not investigated in depth in [11]. The main findings are as follows. 1) Harder fingertips produce larger resistible forces, irrespective of the shape of the contact surface (flat or curved). 2) For harder fingertips, the maximum resistible force depends largely on the shape of the contact surface, while for softer fingertips, the shape has little effect. 3) For softer fingertips, the magnitude of the resistible force changes little even when the normal force increases.
