This paper introduces a dynamic paging scheme based on the semi-realtime movement information of an individual user, which allows a more accurate predication of the user location at the time of paging. In general, a realtime location tracking scheme may require complex control schemes and incur unacceptably high computation and messaging cost. Our proposed approach, namely velocity paging scheme, relaxes the realtime constraints to semirealtime to provide a good combination of cost reduction and esse of implementation. The proposed velocity paging scheme utilizes semi-realtime velocity information, namely velocity classes, of individual mobile terminal and dynamically generates a paging zone (a list of cells to be paged) for it. Therefore, the total paging cost can be reduced due to the paging area reduction. Much consideration also has been given to reduce the complexity for the proposed scheme. As a result, it only requires minimal extra overhead and is feasible to implement in current cellular/PCS networks. The velocity paging can be combined with movement-based registration or other registration schemes. Analytical results of velocity paging and movement-based registration combination are provided to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the scheme under various parameters in comparison with location area scheme.
