Humans can walk stably and adaptively in the presence of various environmental changes. Their bodies have very complex musculoskeletal structures that contribute to their walking stability and adaptability. In this paper, we focus on the gluteus medius, one of muscles contributing to the support of the pelvis. The gluteus medius supports the pelvis when the leg is in a standing position, but it should not inhibit its smooth swing motion. This mechanism is assumed to be realized by the musculoskeletal structure. This paper is devoted to explaining the mechanism by reproducing it using artificial pneumatic muscles. We developed a musculoskeletal robot with a gluteus medius, and showed that the mechanism is well-designed for realizing two seemingly contradictory functions: being stiff to support the pelvis while standing and being smooth to allow swinging. This finding can be utilized for adaptive walking of musculoskeletal humanoid robots.
