This paper describes the design of HotJava Views, a user environment and suite of applications for a Network Computer. A Network Computer differs from the common Personal Computer in that it has no permanent local storage, but instead obtains its software and data as needed over the network from a central server. We have abandoned some characteristic features of current GUI interfaces, such as the desktop metaphor, file systems, and the distinction be-tween applications and documents. Our design principles are focused on simplicity, efficiency of operation, clarity of the interaction model, and tight integration between applications.
