Body rotation under free fall along a desired trajectory can be found in many applications such as sports, entertainment, and manufacturing. An appropriately designed body path could lower the forces at the joints during inversion and thus minimizing potential injury. This paper presents a method of developing dynamic models that characterize the interaction between the body of a live object undergoing inversion and the mechanical system driving the rotation. The method offers an effective means to analyze the sensitivity of the design and operational parameters on the body rotation. The models have been validated experimentally. The simulated and experimental results offer significant insights to the joint forces and a means to improve the body dynamics. While the results have immediate application in inverting live birds for poultry meat processing, we expect the model will provide a basis for analyzing body rotational dynamics in other applications such as gymnastics and roller coasters.
