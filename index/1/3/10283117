There are just two problems in building useful and usable computer systems: what to build, and how to build them. Empirical behavioral studies, including laboratory experiments, are utterly essential to solving the "what" problem. The reason is simply that there is no other way. The use of computers by humans for any interesting task is a highly complex phenomenon, involving the interaction of human intelligence, motivation and skilled performance, complex enough in their own right, with another information processhag system of lower, but still substantial complexity. Predicting what this complex combination of complexities will do, even as a function of minor variations, is certain to be almost always very difficult or impossible. Thus our current theories, engineering models and guidelines are imprecise and limited in scope, not only because of the immaturity of the field, but because most of its important phenomena are intrinsically intractable to analysis and prediction.
