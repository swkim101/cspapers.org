This report describes the practice of using executable acceptance testing for specifying programming assignments in software engineering courses. We summarize experiences from two courses introduced in two academic institutions over four semesters -- both from students' and instructors' perspectives. Examples of projects and the discussion of the assignment flows are given. The paper highlights testing as an all-encompassing activity in software development projects. It also contains recommendations for academics thinking of incorporating executable acceptance testing into their courses.
