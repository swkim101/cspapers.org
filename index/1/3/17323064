Model-based mutation analysis is a powerful but expensive testing technique. We tackle its high computation cost by proposing an optimization technique that drastically speeds up the mutant execution process. Central to this approach is the Featured Mutant Model, a modelling framework for mutation analysis inspired by the software product line paradigm. It uses behavioural variability models, viz., Featured Transition Systems, which enable the optimized generation, configuration and execution of mutants. We provide results, based on models with thousands of transitions, suggesting that our technique is fast and scalable. We found that it outperforms previous approaches by several orders of magnitude and that it makes higher-order mutation practically applicable.
