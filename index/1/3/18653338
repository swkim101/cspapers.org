While other robots use in-situ measurements for gas leak detection and localization, we propose to apply remote sensing. It is easier and safer to conduct, permits rapid scans and is applicable to leak sources high up. An IR-optical sensor is used, exploiting spectral absorption effects of gases. Tailored leak detection and localization strategies are proposed. A simulation environment with a 3D model of the gas concentration field is used for developing and testing the detection and localization strategies. The system performance is demonstrated in a case study with a chemical plant.
