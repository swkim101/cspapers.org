We present MIPSUnit, a unit test framework for MIPS assembly. MIPSUnit's primary benefit is that it reduces the time needed to grade assembly language assignments. It also provides a time-efficient means for giving students additional testing experience; therefore, it can serve as one component of a curriculum-wide emphasis on testing. MIPSUnit is a suite of two tools: MUnit, which allows users to test their assembly code with JUnit tests, and MSpec, which uses RSpec-style unit tests.
