The brain works in a state-dependent manner: processing strategies and access to stored information depends on the momentary functional state which is continuously re-adjusted. The state is manifest as spatial configuration of the brain electric field. Spontaneous and information-triggered brain electric activity is a series of momentary field maps. Adaptive segmentation of spontaneous series into spatially stable epochs (states) exhibited 210 msec mean segments, discontinuous changes. Different maps imply different active neural populations, hence expectedly different effects on information processing: Reaction time differred between map classes at stimulus arrival. Segments might be units of brain information processing (content/mode/step), possibly operationalizing consciousness time. Related units (e.g. triggered by stimuli during figure perception and voluntary attention) might specify brain submechanisms of information treatment.
