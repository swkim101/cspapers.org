Flight control for commercial aircraft has to fulfil stringent requirements.
 This paper describes first the main lines of the system development process in order to situate the software validation problem which is only a part of the whole validation exercise.
 The appropriate methods and tools used in the different software development stages are then presented.
 A great deal of our attention was in the software analysis stage (preliminary design) for which a software decomposition approach, a software integration strategy and a managerial procedure was developed.
 Real-time testing also deserved a great deal of effort. A full set of real-time facilities was created around our airborne computer (UMP 7800) which is a software oriented machine whose essential features are roughly described in the paper. Special emphasis is given to a hardware device (TRACE) connected to the computer bus which is capable to check and record critical numerical data and program paths.
 Finally some quantitative evaluation of the methodologies we use are given based on some of our avionics projects.
