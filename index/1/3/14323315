Prior research results show that comparison as a feedback technique can encourage additional savings; however, a limited number of home-energy studies explore social communication around feedback devices. We will develop a system that supports comparison and cross-household communication, and provides energy-use information. We will then deploy our system across 50 mixed-income renters. Our expected contributions include an interactive system for supporting comparison and collaboration; a better understanding of the conditions that motivate or discourage energy conservative behaviors for individuals that pay and do not pay for their electricity; and design recommendations for visualizations that allow comparison and collaboration across households.
