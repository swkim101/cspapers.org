Outdoor robots are faced with a variety of terrain types each possessing different characteristics. To ensure a safe traversal a robot has to infer the current ground surface from sensor readings. Recent techniques generate a model which predicts the terrain class from single vibration signals disregarding the temporal coherence between consecutive measurements. In this paper, we present a novel approach in which the final classification relies on the analysis of not only one, but several recent observations. Therefore, the probabilistic framework of the Bayes filter is adopted to the problem of terrain classification. We propose an adaptive approach which automatically adjusts its parameters according to the history of observations. To demonstrate the performance of our method we further describe and compare another technique based on temporal coherence. The evaluation using data collected from our RWI ATRV-Jr robot shows that our approach is both reactive and stable enough to detect fast terrain transitions and selective misclassifications.
