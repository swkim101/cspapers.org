In recent years locative media as an artistic approach towards exploring mediated urban spaces has been rising [1]. At the same time gathering of environmental data through sensor networks grows rapidly. Living Light Lab aims to facilitate on artistic and scientific approaches to feed invisible data back into the built environment with the aim to explore how we may visualize and display data in an abstract way. The project currently is in its concept and prototyping stage, therefore we will highlight the challenges we are facing. Further we will report on an initial pilot study which took place at the UCL Building Projection Party in June 2013.
