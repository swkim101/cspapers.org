This paper presents two versions of adaptive controllers for nonlinear bilateral teleoperators, each providing asymptotic convergence of velocity and position errors to zero, independent of constant time-delays. Moreover, the proposed schemes do not rely on the use of the scattering transformation. The paper also proves that the teleoperator is Input-to-State Stable from human operator and environment inputs to some synchronization signals. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.
