Task replication has recently been advocated as a practical solution to reduce latencies in parallel systems. In addition to several convincing empirical studies, analytical results have been provided, yet under some strong assumptions such as independent service times of the replicas, which may lend themselves to some contrasting and perhaps contriving behavior. For instance, under the independence assumption, an overloaded system can be stabilized by a replication factor, but can be sent back in overload through further replication. Motivated by the need to dispense with such common and restricting assumptions, which may cause unexpected behavior, we develop a unified and general theoretical framework to compute tight bounds on the distribution of response times in general replication systems. These results immediately lend themselves to the optimal number of replicas minimizing response time quantiles, depending on the parameters of the system (e.g., the degree of correlation amongst replicas).
