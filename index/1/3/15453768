Pivoting is the rotation of an object between two fingers using gravity and inertial forces to impart angular momentum. We present an analysis of the mechanics of pivoting and a framework for planning and execution. Extrinsic dexterity was defined by Chavan-Dafle et al. [1] as the use of external forces, such as gravity and inertial forces in post grasp manipulation. We analyze one such regrasp termed “pivoting” by Rao et al. [2]. We find a grasp and arm trajectory which can rotate an object between stable poses, if any. We demonstrate an implementation of pivoting with an ABB industrial arm and a two fingered gripper.
