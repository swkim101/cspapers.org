Effective software reliability evaluation requires theories of software reliability which define and deal with software reliability quantitatively, technologies for reliability data measurement and data analysis, techniques to estimate or predict software reliability, and practical reliability evaluation methodologies which effectively reflect the characteristics of software. This paper assesses the extents to which these requirements are currently met, and introduces improved approaches for an effective software reliability evaluation. Introduced are the methodologies for software reliability evaluation and the software reliability evaluation-aid tools.
