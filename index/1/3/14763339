Yield estimation has been and will continue to be the integral part in design flow, particularly under large process variability in advanced technology nodes. This paper proposes an efficient method that accelerates transistor-level statistical timing simulations which are intensively conducted in various design stages, such as in final timing verification, while considering thousands of random variables. The proposed method utilizes line sampling (LS), in which integration of randomly generated lines, not the random points, are evaluated. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method achieves 14 x to 300 x speed-up compared to the fastest one that has ever reported.
