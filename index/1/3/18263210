Bibliographies are fundamental tools for research communities. Besides the obvious uses as connection to previous research, citations are also widely used for evaluation purposes: the productivity of researchers, departments and universities is increasingly measured by counting their citations. Unfortunately, citations counters are just rough indicators: a deeper knowledge of individual citations -- where, when, by whom and why -- improves research evaluation tasks and supports researchers in their daily activity. Yet, such information is mostly hidden within repositories of scholarly papers and is still difficult to find, navigate and make use of. In this paper, we present a novel tool for exploring scientific articles through their citations. The environment is built on top of a rich citation network, encoded as a LOD, and includes a user-friendly interface to access, filter and highlight information about bibliographic data.
