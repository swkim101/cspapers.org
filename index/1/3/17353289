Many Android apps use SSL/TLS to transmit sensitive information securely. However, developers often provide their own implementation of the standard SSL/TLS certificate validation process. Unfortunately, many such custom implementations have subtle bugs, have built-in exceptions for self-signed certificates, or blindly assert all certificates are valid, leaving many Android apps vulnerable to SSL/TLS Man-in-the-Middle attacks. In this paper, we present SMV-HUNTER, a system for the automatic, large-scale identification of such vulnerabilities that combines both static and dynamic analysis. The static component detects when a custom validation procedure has been given, thereby identifying potentially vulnerable apps, and extracts information used to guide the dynamic analysis, which then uses user interface enumeration and automation techniques to trigger the potentially vulnerable code under an active Man-in-the-Middle attack. We have implemented SMV-HUNTER and evaluated it on 23,418 apps downloaded from the Google Play market, of which 1,453 apps were identified as being potentially vulnerable by static analysis, with an average overhead of approximately 4 seconds per app, running on 16 threads in parallel. Among these potentially vulnerable apps, 726 were confirmed vulnerable using our dynamic analysis, with an average overhead of about 44 seconds per app, running on 8 emulators in parallel.
