This paper reports on and demonstrates META-SHARE/QT21, a prototype implementation of a data sharing and annotation service platform, which was based on the META-SHARE infrastructure. META-SHARE, which has been designed for sharing datasets and tools, is enhanced with a processing layer for annotating textual content with appropriate NLP services that are documented with the appropriate metadata. In META-SHARE/QT21 pre-defined processing workflows are offered to the users; each workflow is a pipeline of atomic NLP services/tools (e.g. sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging). Currently, workflows for annotating monolingual and bilingual resources of various formats are provided (e.g. XCES, TXT, TMX). From the legal framework point of view, a simple operational model is adopted by which only openly licensed datasets can be processed by openly licensed services.
