This paper addresses recent progress in speaker-independent, large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition, which has opened up a wide range of near and mid-term applications. One rapidly expanding application area is the processing of broadcast audio for information access. At L IMSI , broadcast news transcription systems have been developed for English, French, German, Mandarin and Portuguese, and systems for other languages are under development. Au-dio indexation must take into account the speciÔ¨Åcities of audio data, such as needing to deal with the continuous data stream and an imperfect word transcription. Some near-term applications areas are audio data mining, selective dissemination of information and media monitoring.
