Supervised local tangent space alignment (SLTSA) is an extension of local tangent space alignment (LTSA) to supervised feature extraction. Two algorithmic improvements are made upon LTSA for classification. First a simple technique is proposed to map new data to the embedded low-dimensional space and make LTSA suitable in a changing, dynamic environment. Then SLTSA is introduced to deal with data sets containing multiple classes with class membership information.
