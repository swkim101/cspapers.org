Web-based malware equipped with stealthy cloaking and obfuscation techniques is becoming more sophisticated nowadays. In this paper, we propose J-FORCE, a crash-free forced JavaScript execution engine to systematically explore possible execution paths and reveal malicious behaviors in such malware. In particular, J-FORCE records branch outcomes and mutates them for further explorations. J-FORCE inspects function parameter values that may reveal malicious intentions and expose suspicious DOM injections. We addressed a number of technical challenges encountered. For instance, we keep track of missing objects and DOM elements, and create them on demand. To verify the efficacy of our techniques, we apply J-FORCE to detect Exploit Kit (EK) attacks and malicious Chrome extensions. We observe that J-FORCE is more effective compared to the existing tools.
