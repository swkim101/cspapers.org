In this paper we discuss the difficulties of designing and running a final year project course for computer science and information systems students. In particular, we present the design of a research-oriented final year project course, where the aim is to develop the student's critical thinking and research skills. We also discuss the lessons learnt during the seven years that the course has been given.
