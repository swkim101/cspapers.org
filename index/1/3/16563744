This paper explores the idea of manipulation-aided perception and grasping in the context of sorting small objects on a tabletop. We present a robust pipeline that combines perception and manipulation to accurately sort Duplo bricks by color and size. The pipeline uses two simple motion primitives to manipulate the scene in ways that help the robot to improve its perception. This results in the ability to sort cluttered piles of Duplo bricks accurately. We present experimental results on the PR2 robot comparing brick sorting without the aid of manipulation to sorting with manipulation primitives that show the benefits of the latter, particularly as the degree of clutter in the environment increases.
