We describe a complete, end-to-end system for taking well-composed photographs using a mobile robot. The general scenario is a reception, or other event, where people are roaming around talking to each other. The robot serves as an "event photographer", roaming around the same space as the participants, periodically taking photographs. These images are then sent to a workstation where participants can print the photographs out, or email them.
