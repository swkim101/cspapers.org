The introduction of domain knowledge into a document retrieval system has two important consequences; an increase in the effectiveness of retrieval and a decrease in the efficiency of text processing. In this paper, a method is presented of combining user-specified domain knowledge with efficient retrieval techniques based on probabilistic models. The domain knowledge is represented as a collection of frames that contain rules specifying recognition conditions for domain concepts and relationships between concepts. The inference network represented in these frames is used to infer the concepts that are related to a user's query. This approach is being implemented as part of the I3R expert intermediary system.
