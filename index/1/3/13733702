This work tackles the problem of controlling an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle equipped with a robotic Manipulator and it has been developed within the framework of the EU-funded ARCAS (Aerial Robotics Cooperative Assembly System) project. A behavioral control, based on the Null Space-based Behavioral (NSB) paradigm, is proposed to tackle the coordination between the arm and vehicle motions. To this aim, a set of basic functionalities (called elementary behaviors) are designed and combined in a priority order to attain complex tasks (called compound behaviors). The proposed controller has been experimentally validated on a multirotor aircraft with an attached 6 Degree of Freedoms manipulator. Two experimental case studies, involving several compound behaviors, have been reported and the results show the effectiveness of the approach.
