Clustering is a widely used knowledge discovery technique. It helps uncovering structures in data that were not previously known. The clustering of large data sets has received a lot of atten tion in recen t years, how ever,clustering is a still a challenging task since many published algorithms fail to do well in scaling with the size of the data set and the number of dimensions that describe the points, or in nding arbitrary shapes of clusters, or dealing e ectively with the presence of noise. In this paper, we presen t a new clustering algorithm, based in the fractal properties of the data sets. The new algorithm which w e call F ractal Clustering (F C) places poin ts incrementally in the cluster for whic h the change in the fractal dimension after adding the point is the least. This is a very natural way of clustering points, since points in the same cluster have a great degree of selfsimilarity among them (and m uch lessself-similarity with respect to poin tsin other clusters). F C requires one scan of the data, is suspendable at will, pro viding the best answ er possible at that point, and is incremental. We sho w via experiments that F C e ectively deals with large data sets, high-dimensionality and noise and is capable of recognizing clusters of arbitrary shape.
