Faceted search combines faceted navigation with direct keyword search, providing exploratory search capacities allowing progressive query refinement. It has become the de facto standard for e-commerce and product-related websites such as amazon.com and ebay.com. However, faceted search has not been effectively incorporated into non-commercial online community portals such as craigslist.org. This is mainly because unlike keyword search, faceted search systems require metadata that constantly evolve, making them very costly to build and maintain. In this paper, we propose a framework MASFA that utilizes a set of non-domain-specific techniques to build and maintain effective, portable, and cost-free faceted search systems in a mass-collaborative manner. We have implemented and deployed the framework on selected categories of Craigslist to demonstrate its utility.
