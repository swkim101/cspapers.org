Jive represents a novel approach to runtime visualization and analysis of Java programs. It facilitates program understanding and interactive debugging, featuring: multiple, customizable views of object structure; representation of execution history via sequence diagrams; interactive queries on runtime behavior; forward and reverse interactive execution. JIVE uses standard JVM and compilers.
