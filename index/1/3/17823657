This paper describes our experience using the Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) technique in an undergraduate database course for computer science majors during two semesters. JiTT was implemented by giving the students reading assignments and asking them to complete web-based reading tests the day before class, so that the teacher could detect weaknesses in students' understanding of the material and adjust the lesson plan just in time for the next day class. Based on surveys as well as on exams and course grades, we found a significant improvement on the students' interest in the course and learning of the material.
