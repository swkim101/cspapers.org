A new class of fluoroscopy, using a robotic mobile platform, is being developed. The Tracking Fluoroscope System (TFS) is intended to be an orthopedic diagnostic tool that provides more accurate and detailed in vivo pre-operative and post-operative information for surgeons. This is accomplished through the ability to fluoroscope natural and uninterrupted human joint motion during level walking, step climbing, and ramp walking. This overall functionality requires independent tracking of the position and orientation of the body with respect to the robotic platform, as well as the position of the joints with respect to the body. The overall robotic system, embodied in the TFS, necessary to accurately perform real-time imaging of joints in motion is discussed. Recent subject and joint tracking experimental results are presented.
