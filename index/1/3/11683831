Query result caching is an important mechanism for search engine efficiency. In this study, we first review several query features that are used to determine the contents of a static result cache. Next, we introduce a new feature that more accurately represents the popularity of a query by measuring the stability of query frequency over a set of time intervals. Experimental results show that this new feature achieves hit ratios better than those of the previously proposed features.
