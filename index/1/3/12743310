This paper develops a new approach of interactive assembly planning. This approach provides an intuitive hand-based interface for human operators to perform assembly operations directly in the virtual world. Its interactive planner then extracts the knowledge of mechanical assembly, and determines motion paths at run time with a biologically inspired neural network. From a single user-defined assembly sequence, this approach is able to automatically produce alternative assembly sequences with robot-level instructions.
