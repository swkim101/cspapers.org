Plagiarism has become a problem in introductory Computer Science courses. Programmed assignments can be copied and transformed with little human effort. A pertinent recommendation has resulted from this realization; an on-line system to detect programs that are “too similar” and hence suspected of plagiarism should be developed [4]. This paper discusses such a system for Pascal programs.
