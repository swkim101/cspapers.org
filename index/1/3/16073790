Machine type communication is becoming an important part of the communication system. More and more M2M applications are based on the cellular networks for the advantages of better coverage and lower network deployment cost. However, a large number of machines will cause the wireless communication system overload in radio access network. This paper describes the overload problem in the radio access network and suggests that MTC devices shall enter detached state if they do not have data to transmit.
