We present a new morphological analysis model that considers semantic plausibility of word sequences by using a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM). In unsegmented languages, since language models are learned from automatically segmented texts and inevitably contain errors, it is not apparent that conventional language models contribute to morphological analysis. To solve this problem, we do not use language models based on raw word sequences but use a semantically generalized language model, RNNLM, in morphological analysis. In our experiments on two Japanese corpora, our proposed model significantly outperformed baseline models. This result indicates the effectiveness of RNNLM in morphological analysis.
