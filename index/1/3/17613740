We propose a new machine architecture for high performance 
execution of late binding object oriented languages. The two principal mechanisms for attaining this goal are a fast context allocation/access scheme and an instruction translation lookaside buffer. New ideas in this 
paper include the concept and implementation of abstract instructions, using floating point addresses to solve the small object problem, and a novel context allocation/access mechanism.
