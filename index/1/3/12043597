The design and implementation of an interactive spot noise algorithm is presented. Spot noise is a technique that uses texture for the visualization of flow fields. Various design tradeoffs are discussed that allow an optimal implementation on a range of high-end graphical workstations. Two applications are given: the steering of a smog prediction simulation and browsing a very large data set resulting from a direct numerical simulation of turbulence. These applications provide the motivation for the need of interactive visualization techniques.
