We present a humanoid active audition system with improved noise cancellation using humanoid cover acoustics and the cover design for an industrial exterior design. For active audition, it is an important problem to distinguish between the internal sounds like motor noises and sounds which originate from the outer world. It is important that inevitable motor noise is cancelled while the humanoid is in motion. Therefore, humanoids require the exterior to cancel such internal noises because it separates humanoid inner world from the outer world. We report an active audition system focused on the sound source tracking by integrating audition, vision and motor movements using sound separation of the humanoid cover. The experiments show that the humanoid can track and localize sound sources more accurately, the noise cannot always be cancelled out optimally and further improvements are required.
