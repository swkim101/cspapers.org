In this paper we present a visual verification approach for robotic assembly manipulation which enables robots to verify their assembly state. Given shape models of objects and their expected placement configurations, our approach estimates the probability of the success of the assembled state using a depth sensor. The proposed approach takes into account uncertainties in object pose. Probability distributions of depth and surface normal depending on the uncertainties are estimated to classify the assembly state in a Bayesian formulation. The effectiveness of our approach is validated in comparative experiments with other approaches.
