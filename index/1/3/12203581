In this paper, we propose an optimal control framework for pneumatic actuators. In particular, we consider using Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) as a part of Pneumatic-Electric (PE) hybrid actuation system. An optimal control framework can be useful for PE hybrid system to properly distribute desired torque outputs to the actuators that have different characteristics. In the optimal control framework, the standard choice to represent control cost is squared force or torque outputs. However, since the control input for PAM is pressure rather than the force or the torque, we should explicitly consider the pressure of PAM as the control cost in an objective function of the optimal control method. We show that we are able to use pressure input as the control cost for PAM by explicitly considering the model which represents a relationship between the pressure input and the force output of PAM. We demonstrate that one-DOF robot with the PE hybrid actuation system can generate pressure-optimized ball throwing movements by using the optimal control method.
