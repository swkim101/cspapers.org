Cellular mechanical properties as the main physical performance characteristics have been actively studied in the past years for the study of cytobiology and the development of medicine. In this study, by combining Hertz model, a novel strategy is proposed to simultaneously measure the cellular mechanical properties including cellular mass, elasticity and viscosity, based on the principle of forced vibration stimulated by simple harmonic force, with piezoelectric transducer (PZT) as vibrator and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) as detector. The corresponding theoretical model was derived and the simulation was realized based on the proposed model. The experiments of indentations and vibrations with myoblasts and myotubes were implemented to calculate the three mechanical parameters of cells according to the proposed strategy. The results validated the proposed approach. This work would be useful for the development of cytology, medicine, previously diagnose, specific therapy and so on.
