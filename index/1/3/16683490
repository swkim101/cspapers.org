Large amounts of data pose special difficulties for Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Efficient means are required to ease this problem; this can be achieved using sufficient statistics rather than individual level data. Sufficient statistics are especially appropriate for Knowledge Discovery from distributed databases, where it may be either too expensive or prohibited by confidentiality constraints to communicate individual level data across the network. The data of interest are of a type similar to those found in OLAP data cubes and Data Warehouses. They consist of both numerical and categorical attributes (dimensions) and are contained within a hierarchical structure. There are few algorithms to date that explicitly exploit this hierarchical structure when carrying out knowledge discovery on these data. Using sufficient statistics in the form of aggregate data and accompanying statistical metadata retrieved from a distributed database, we use multi-level models to identify and present relationships between a single numerical attribute and a combination of other attributes at various levels of the hierarchy. On the basis of these relationships, rules in conjunctive normal form are induced. We present to the user the significant attribute relationships and interactions via a graphical interface rather than the traditional statistical table. Exceptions to these rules are discovered, and the user may browse these exceptions at different levels of the hierarchy.
