We present the design and implementation of a word-level stroking system called Fisch, which is intended to improve the speed of character-level unistrokes. Importantly, Fisch does not alter the way in which character-level unistrokes are made, but allows users to gradually ramp up to word-level unistrokes by extending their letters in minimal ways. Fisch relies on in-stroke word completion, a flexible design for fluidly turning unistroke letters into whole words. Fisch can be memorized at the motor level since word completions always appear at the same positions relative to the strokes being made. Our design for Fisch is suitable for use with any unistroke alphabet. We have implemented Fisch for multiple versions of EdgeWrite, and results show that Fisch reduces the number of strokes during entry by 43.9% while increasing the rate of entry. An informal test of "record speed" with the stylus version resulted in 50-60 wpm with no uncorrected errors.
