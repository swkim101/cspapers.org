The final step for obtaining very accurate DNA sequence data is known as "finishing." Most steps of DNA sequencing are highly automated, but it is only recently that researchers have looked at automating the finishing step. Our perspective is to look at automated finishing as an optimization problem, with the goal to minimize lab costs.We give new algorithms for solving this problem. We look at a model of the problem for which previous researchers gave an O(n4) algorithm (where n is the length of the DNA measured in reads). We give an algorithm that runs in O(n2â…“) worst case time. We then show that the algorithm runs in O(n) expected time, if we make an assumption, accepted by many molecular biologists, about randomness in the input data.
