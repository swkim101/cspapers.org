A new model named Boolean Latent Semantic Indexing model based on the Singular Value Decomposition and Boolean query formulation is introduced. While the Singular Value Decomposition alleviates the problems of lexical matching in the traditional information retrieval model, Boolean query formulation can help users to make precise representation of their information search needs. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections seem to show that the proposed model achieves substantial performance gains over the Latent Semantic Indexing model.
