Managing the supply chain has become vital to business success in the contemporary Electronic Commerce environment. There is broad agreement among practitioners and academics that integration, on a variety of dimensions, is the key to supply chain performance. Information integration is one important dimension, and the Internet is rapidly improving our ability to do so across global supply chains. Significant investments in information technology (IT) generally, and Internet technologies in particular, are being targeted specifically at supply chain management. The business impact of these IT investments depends not just on the information flows supported by these systems, but also on other physical characteristics of the supply chain. It is the complex interplay among information and non-information characteristics that results in business performance or the lack thereof.
