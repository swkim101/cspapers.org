Grassroots participation is a great resource for monitoring environmental phenomena, and collecting and analyzing data in a variety of fields, called Citizen Science. The proliferation of mobile devices has helped to boost citizen science activities. However, the creation of such tools is under the control of developers and accompanying infrastructure that most local organizations, which are often the bodies of citizen science activities, lack. This often hinders citizen science activities from prospering. This work aims to create a visual environment where people without programming skills can build mobile data-collection tools and manage data collectively. The expected contributions include a creation of a tool to prosper citizen science by lowering technical barriers; an understanding of the dynamics of data collection and management through grassroots participation; and implications for designing citizen science tools.
