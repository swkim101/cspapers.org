I hypothesize that I will be able to change parts of a game to elicit certain behaviors from players,and that these changes will also result in an increase of engagement and/or intrinsic motivation. Initial results in my testbed game, Scrabblesque, indicate that data-driven models and techniques can be used to influence player behavior and that these changes in play behavior manifest themselves as an increase in engagement and intrinsic motivation.
