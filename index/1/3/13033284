With the increase of web services and user demand's diversity, effective web service discovery is becoming a big challenge. Clustering web services would greatly boost the ability of web service search engine to retrieve relevant ones. In this paper, we propose a web service search engine Titan which contains 15,969 web services crawled from the Internet. In Titan, two main technologies, i.e., web service clustering and tag recommendation, are employed to improve the effectiveness of web service discovery. Specifically, both WSDL (Web Service Description Language) documents and tags of web services are utilized for clustering, while tag recommendation is adopted to handle some inherent problems of tagging data, e.g., uneven tag distribution and noise tags.
