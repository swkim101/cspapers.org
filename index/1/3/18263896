We propose a linear complexity method to estimate robust path delay fault coverage in digital circuits. We adopt a path counting scheme for a true-value simulator that uses flags for each signal line. These ags determine the new path delay faults detected by the simulated vector pair. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the method in estimating path delay fault coverage.
