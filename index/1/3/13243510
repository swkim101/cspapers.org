We present methods for training high quality object detectors very quickly. The core contribution is a pair of fast training algorithms for piece-wise linear classifiers, which can approximate arbitrary additive models. The classifiers are trained in a max-margin framework and significantly outperform linear classifiers on a variety of vision datasets. We report experimental results quantifying training time and accuracy on image classification tasks and pedestrian detection, including detection results better than the best previous on the INRIA dataset with faster training.
