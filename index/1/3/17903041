MEDLINE, the primary bibliographic database in life sciences, currently contains more than 17 million article citations and last year grew with 600,000 entries. Staying up-todate, finding relevant information and even extracting new knowledge becomes increasingly difficult in this field [1]. The peculiarities of biomedical terminology make building an effective IR system a challenge [3]. Firstly, biomedical terms are highly synonymous and ambiguous. Secondly, multi-word terms such as ‘Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy’ are commonly used, making a bag of words approach less effective. Thirdly, new terms and especially abbreviations are abundant. And finally there is the challenge of variation in terminology. Differences in spelling, use of hyphens and other special characters make it even more difficult to handle biomedical text. The TRECGenomics benchmarks have demonstrated that overcoming these challenges is far from trivial. Different attempts have been pursued to map text to a notion of concepts. Explicitly, by mapping texts to entries in controlled vocabularies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). But also implicitly, by for example treating collocated words as ‘concepts’. The goal of my PhD project is to study how to optimize biomedical IR by including conceptual knowledge from biomedical ontologies, while maintaining a theoretical sound framework. To achieve this I propose to approach terminology issues in biomedical IR as a form of cross-lingual IR (CLIR). The two ‘languages’ distinguished are the textual representation of query and documents, and their conceptual representation in terms of concepts from a biomedical
