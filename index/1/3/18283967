This paper describes the experiences and results on implementing a set of hyperspectral imaging analysis algorithms on the Itanium Processor Family. On Itanium architecture all instructions are transformed into bundles of instructions and these bundles are processed in a parallel fashion by the different functional units. Experimental results show that exploiting implicit parallelism and linking HP Mathematical LIBrary optimized for Itanium yield significant improvement in performance.
