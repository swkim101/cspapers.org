INTRODUCTiON The CHI community, and this conference in particular, is committed to empowering people with effective computer-human interaction which will enhance their experience, their productivity, and their creativity. But CHI is inherently a complex, applied field. In order for end-users to benefit from new ideas they must become technologies and the technologies must be developed, applied, and delivered. Moving across so many stages before end users can experience their benefits is an arduous passage for fledgling ideas.
