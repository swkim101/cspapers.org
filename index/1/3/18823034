We describe our research on integrating neuromorphic devices into a new computing system, where the system is not approximate by default and its operation automatically improves as a function of its resources and “experience”. We focus on communicating key insights and observations and then sketch our research agenda. We use the term neuromorphic broadly to mean any hardware specifically designed for machine learning or inspired by biological neural networks. There appear to be two basic modes of computing: (1) by logic, and (2) by pattern recognition. To date, there has generally been a gulf between these two modes, with the exception of work on approximate computing [2, 4, 1]. We seek to define and exploit a closer bridge between the two. We define Programmable Smart Machines (PSMs) as hybrid computing systems that behave as programmed but transparently learn and automatically improve their operation. The PSM research agenda explores the use of neuromorphic devices in addressing the challenges set forth by Michie in the Nature ’68 paper that introduced memoization [3]:
