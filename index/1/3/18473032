In this paper, we propose a new graphical password using object-based image ranking, called OBIR, which enables appropriate images to be presented to users during authentication. Research on graphical password is being conducted and receiving more and more public attention due to its potential of being an alternative for textual password. However, the main problem of graphical password is its vulnerability to shoulder surfing attacks, especially on mobile devices where the login password is easily visible in public. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel graphical password using image ranking method based on the objects in the image itself. The higher the ranking of an image is, the more appropriate it is to be user's selection without exposing too much information of the password to the shoulder-surfer. Upon our experiments, it is obtained that our image ranking method is effective in filtering appropriate pass-image that even if it is selected in public, the password is safe and therefore resistant to shoulder surfing.
