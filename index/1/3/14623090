This paper introduces and characterizes the Baxter Easyhand, a new 3D printed hand derived from the Yale T42 hand [5], [10], but designed specifically to be mounted on the Baxter robot from Rethink robotics. Because this hand is designed specifically for Baxter, we are able to make some important simplifications in the design relative to other 3D printed hands. In particular, the Easyhand is smaller than most other 3D printed hands and it is powered by the native Baxter gripper actuator. As a result, our hand is cheaper, lighter, and easier to interface with than other robot hands available for Baxter. This paper details the design of the hand and its mechanical characteristics and reports results from experiments that characterize its grasping performance.
