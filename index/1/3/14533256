This article presents an abstract space of dimensions which characterize the behavior of applications (i.e. functional cores) with regard to UIMS components. These dimensions such as responsiveness, accessibility, and instantiability, constitute a conceptual framework which captures the notion of functional core in terms adequate for UIMS designers. The dimension space may also be viewed as a requirements list for designing new UIMSs as well as a set of criteria for evaluating existing UIMSs.
