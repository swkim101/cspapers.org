We consider the problem of deterministic distributed coloring of an n-vertex graph with maximum degree Δ, assuming that every vertex knows a priori only its own label and parameters n and Δ. The aim is to get a fast algorithm using few colors. Linial [17] showed a vertex-coloring algorithm working in time &Ogr;(log* n) and using &Ogr;(Δ2 colors. We improve both the time and the number of colors simultaneously by showing an algorithm working in time &Ogr;(log*(n/Δ)) and using &Ogr;(Δ) colors. This is the first known &Ogr;(Δ)-vertex-coloring distributed algorithm which can work faster than in polylogarithmic time.
Our method also gives an edge-coloring algorithm with the number of colors and time as above. On the other hand, it follows from Linial [17] that our time of &Ogr;(Δ)-coloring cannot be improved in general. In addition we show how our method gives fast coloring algorithms in communication models weaker than Linial's.
