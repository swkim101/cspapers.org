Knowledge-Based Report Generation is a technique for automatically generating natural language summaries from databases. It is so named because it applies the tools of knowledge-based expert systems design to the problem of text generation. The technique is currently being applied to the design of an automatic natural language stock report generator. Examples drawn from the implementation of the stock report generator are used to describe the components of a knowledge-based report generator.
