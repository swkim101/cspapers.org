The logic has been shown to be more expressive than several variants of ATELand therefore the algorithm can also be used for ATEL model checking. We implement the algorithm in a model checker and apply it to an application on train control system. The performance of the algorithm is also reported, with a comparison showing improved results over a previous partially symbolic approach for ATEL model checking.
