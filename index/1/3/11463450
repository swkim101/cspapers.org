After analyzing fundamental impact characteristics of robot-human collisions in our previous work, the intention in the present paper is to augment existing knowledge in this field, verify previously given statements with standardized equipment of the German Automobile Club (ADAC), and provide a crash-test report for robots in general. Various new insights are achieved and a systematic and extensive set of data is provided. The presented work is divided into two papers. The main purpose of Part I is to give, similarly to reports known from the automobile world1, a fact based and result oriented view on our newest robot crash-test experiments. In Part II detailed discussions of the results listed in the present paper and recommendations towards a standard crash-test protocol for robot safety are carried out.
