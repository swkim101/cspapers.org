A VLSI chip for performing relational data base operations is proposed. The chip is a tree of processors (TOP), where each chip has elementary storage and processing capabilities. A relation will be stored in the lowest levels of a TOP. More precisely, every m-tuple will occupy a subtree whose root is s&equil; [log2(m+1)] âˆ’1 levels above the leaves. Denoting by h the height of the tree, the upper h-s levels will be used for routing and bookkeeping purposes. A number of basic operations such as allocate and deallocate subtrees, insert and compare m-tuples etc., are defined for the TOP's. Relational operations are effectively performed as simple combinations of basic operations. The architecture of a data base machine based on TOP's is also sketched. Such a machine is feasible with the current VLSI technology and could become attractive in few years if density and performance of VLSI keep improving at the current rate.
