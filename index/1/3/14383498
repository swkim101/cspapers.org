We define a Universal One-Way Hash Function family, a new primitive which enables the compression of elements in the function domain. The main property of this primitive is that given an element x. We prove constructively that universal one-way hash functions exist if any 1-1 one-way functions exist.
Among the various applications of the primitive is a One-Way based Secure Digital Signature Scheme, a system which is based on the existence of any 1-1 One-Way Functions and is secure against the most general attack known. Previously, all provably secure signature schemes were based on the stronger mathematical assumption that trapdoor one-way functions exist.
