Identifying the causes of problem during software development process is an important activity to improve the software quality. Causal Analysis is an efficient way used to identify the cause of problem. The difficulty of causal analysis is how to classify the causes of problem and larger effort is required to find the real problem in massive possible causes. In this paper, we propose an approach that applying program patterns on causal analysis process to reduce the efforts of identifying problems. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the program patterns provide software engineer efficient way to understand where the problems and provide expert the basis of solving the problem quantification which is clear and specific target.
