When information external to a component is not of importance to the implementation of that component but is present within it as an artifact of design or programming mechanisms, system structure suffers, resulting in greater difficulties in software evolution and reuse. I am investigating an approach to lessening the effects of such extraneous embedded knowledge through the use of dynamic execution information and static structural information, which comprise the concept of context.
