The shallow-water equations for the wind-driven oceanic circulation were solved in parallel, using Fourier pseudospectral methods. A domain decomposition approach was used to perform two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms (2-D FFTs), as part of a computational scheme for the parallel solution of the time dependent partial differential equations.
The algorithm was implemented using a shared memory approach, and tested on the ACE experimental multiprocessor workstation. The performance of the parallel code, including timings for execution, processor intercommunication and synchronization is discussed. It was found that the parallel efficiency of the method is satisfactory for reasonable problem sizes.
