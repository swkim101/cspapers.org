We present an approach for adaptive scheduling of soft real-time legacy applications (for which no timing information is exposed to the system). Our strategy is based on the combination of two techniques: 1) a real-time monitor that observes the sequence of events generated by the application to infer its activation period, 2) a feedback mechanism that adapts the scheduling parameters to ensure a timely execution of the application. By a thorough experimental evaluation of an implementation of our approach, we show its performance and its efficiency.
