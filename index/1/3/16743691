A formal model of data updates in a multidatabase environment is developed, and a theory of concurrency control in such an environment is presented. We formulate a correctness condition for the concurrency control mechanism and propose a protocol that allows concurrent execution of a set of global transactions in presence of local ones. This protocol ensures the consistency of the multidatabase and deadlock freedom. We use the developed theory to prove the protocol's correctness and discuss complexity issues of implementing the proposed protocol.
