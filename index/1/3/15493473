In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized active perception strategy that maximizes the convergence rate in estimating the (unmeasurable) formation scale in the context of bearing-based formation localization for robots evolving in ℝ3 × S1. The proposed algorithm does not assume presence of a global reference frame and only requires bearing-rigidity of the formation (for the localization problem to admit a unique solution), and presence of (at least) one pair of robots in mutual visibility. Two different scenarios are considered in which the active scale estimation problem is treated either as a primary task or as a secondary objective with respect to the constraint of attaining a desired bearing formation. The theoretical results are validated by realistic simulations.
