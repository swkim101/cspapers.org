We review here the results of one of the experiments performed at the 2003 Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop, hosted by Mitre Corporation and the Northeast Regional Research Center (NRRC). The experiment concentrates on query expansion using relevance feedback and explores the behaviour of several information retrieval systems using variable numbers of relevant documents.
