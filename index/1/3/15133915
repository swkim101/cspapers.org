During the past two days, we have heard some excellent presentation on current accomplishments and future plans for design automation. I submit that today's accomplishments lend adequate credence to almost anything we may wish to forecast for the future in this field. Since, to a great extent, that future will be determined by this group here assembled, it would be presumptuous of me to predict what will produce. Therefore, rather than forecast, I would like to challenge you with an old problem, suggest an approach to its solution and wait to see what kind of future you will mold.
