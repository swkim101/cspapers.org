Deep Learning is arguably the most rapidly evolving research area in recent years. As a result it is not surprising that the design of state-of-the-art deep neural net models proceeds without much consideration of the latest hardware targets, and the design of neural net accelerators proceeds without much consideration of the characteristics of the latest deep neural net models. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that there are significant improvements available if deep neural net models and neural net accelerators are co-designed.
