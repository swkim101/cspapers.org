Nanometer transistor size makes electronic systems more vulnerable to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity and radiation etc.). Therefore, it is important to test a system in its operational environment (in-field) to ensure constant performance and reliability. This paper presents a novel approach to test a system with ICs connected using multiple IEEE 1149.1 scan paths. A Flexible in-Field Test Controller (FiFTeC) is proposed, which applies test on an IEEE 1149.1 compliant system. In this approach, deterministic test patterns are utilized for high fault coverage. The deterministic test patterns are stored separately for each unique IC, which provides efficient storage as well as flexibility in test application. This approach also provides high diagnostic resolution.
