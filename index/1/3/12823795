The modern parallel I/O stack consists of several software layers with complex inter-dependencies and performance characteristics. While each layer exposes tunable parameters, it is often unclear to users how different parameter settings interact with each other and affect overall I/O performance. As a result, users often resort to default system settings, which typically obtain poor I/O bandwidth. In this research, we develop a benchmark guided auto-tuning framework for tuning the HDF5, MPI-IO, and Lustre layers on production supercomputing facilities. Our framework consists of three main components. H5Tuner uses a control file to adjust I/O parameters without modifying or recompiling the application. H5PerfCapture records performance metrics for HDF5 and MPI-IO. H5Evolve uses a genetic algorithm to explore the parameter space to determine well-performing configurations. We demonstrate I/O performance results for three HDF5 application-based benchmarks on a Sun HPC system. All the benchmarks running on 512 MPI processes perform 3X to 5.5X faster with the auto-tuned I/O parameters compared to a configuration with default system parameters.
