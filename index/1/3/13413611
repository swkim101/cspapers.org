The much-anticipated 3rd Generation Mobile Wireless Networks will deliver the promised revolution in ubiquitous connectivity and the seamless integration of voice and data applications. We have every reason to be optimistic today about the potential of a new paradigm of computing and communications, made possible by technological and business advances in wireless IP networks and network-based services. Vodafone and other major mobile network operators around the world are leading this revolution. In this presentation, we shall discuss some of the future directions in wireless networks focusing on technology-driven possibilities rather than commercially driven opportunities. The era of smart mobile devices and network-based applications and services, including high-performance computing, is closer than it may seem.
