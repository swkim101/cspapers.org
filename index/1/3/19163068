 
 The last two decades have seen extraordinary advances in industrial applications of constraint satisfaction techniques, while combinatorial problems have been pushed to the sidelines. We propose a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art in constraint satisfaction problems when applied to combinatorial problems in areas such as graph theory, set theory, algebra, among others. We believe such a study will provide us with a deeper understanding about the limitations we still face in constraint satisfaction problems.
