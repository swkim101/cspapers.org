We conducted a personal opinion survey in two rounds - years 2008 and 2011 - with the aim of investigating the level of knowledge and adoption of SOA in the Italian industry. We are also interested in understanding what is the trend of SOA (positive or negative?) and what are the methods, technologies and tools really used in the industry. The main findings of this survey are the following: (1) SOA is a relevant phenomenon in Italy, (2) Web services and RESTFul services are well-known/used and (3) orchestration languages and UDDI are little known and used. These results suggest that in Italy SOA is interpreted in a more simplistic way with respect to the current/real definition (i.e., without the concepts of orchestration/choreography and registry). Currently, the adoption of SOA is medium/low with a stable/positive trend of pervasiveness.
