ITSPOKE is a spoken dialogue system that uses the Why2-Atlas text-based tutoring system as its "back-end". A student first types a natural language answer to a qualitative physics problem. ITSPOKE then engages the student in a spoken dialogue to provide feedback and correct misconceptions, and to elicit more complete explanations. We are using ITSPOKE to generate an empirically-based understanding of the ramifications of adding spoken language capabilities to text-based dialogue tutors.
