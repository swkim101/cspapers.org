CLV type optical disks is a very large and important class of optical disk technology, of which CD-ROM disks form a subclass.
In this paper we present a model of retrieval from CLV optical disks. We then provide exact and approximate results analyzing the retrieval performance from them. Our analysis takes into account disks with and without a mirror in the read mechanism, small objects completely placed within block boundaries, placement that allows block boundary crossing, as well as very large objects (such as documents) placed within files.
In the second part of the paper we describe some fundamental implications of physical data base design for data bases stored on CLV optical disks. We show that very significant performance gains may be realized by appropriate design.
