Offender profiling concerns making inferences about a criminal from the crime(s) he has committed. Where descriptionsof the crimes are recorded electronically, text mining techniques provide a means by which recorded characteristics of the offenders can be linked with features of his crimes as revealed in the text. Past studies have used Language Modelling to identify characteristics that can be described by a categorical variable e.g. gender. Here we adapt the Language Modelling approach to allow estimation of numerical quantities such as age and distance travelled.
