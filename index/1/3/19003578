The finger mechanism equiped with omnidirectional driving roller is shown. The omnidirectional driving roller has two active rotational axes at the touching point. The finger mechanism with this roller can manipulate the grasped object with any arbitrary directional axes. Prototype model has been developed and basic motion of the finger has been confirmed though the experiments.
