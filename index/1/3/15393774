A new access method, called M-tree, is proposed to organize and search large data sets from a generic “metric space”, i.e. where object proximity is only defined by a distance function satisfying the positivity, symmetry, and triangle inequality postulates. We detail algorithms for insertion of objects and split management, which keep the M-tree always balanced - several heuristic split alternatives are considered and experimentally evaluated. Algorithms for similarity (range and k-nearest neighbors) queries are also described. Results from extensive experimentation with a prototype system are reported, considering as the performance criteria the number of page I/O’s and the number of distance computations. The results demonstrate that the Mtree indeed extends the domain of applicability beyond the traditional vector spaces, performs reasonably well in high-dimensional data spaces, and scales well in case of growing files.
