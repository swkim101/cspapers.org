Commercial web search engines rely on very large compute infrastructures to be able to cope with the continuous growth of the Web and user bases. Achieving scalability and efficiency in such large-scale search engines requires making careful architectural design choices while devising algorithmic performance optimizations. Unfortunately, most details about the internal functioning of commercial web search engines remain undisclosed due to their financial value and the high level of competition in the search market. The main objective of this tutorial is to provide an overview of the fundamental scalability and efficiency challenges in commercial web search engines, bridging the existing gap between the industry and academia.
