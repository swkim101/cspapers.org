This paper presents a solution to decentralized Voronoi coverage in non-convex polygonal environments. We show that complications arise when existing approaches to Voronoi coverage are applied for deploying a group of robots in non-convex environments. We present an algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. Our algorithm combines classical Voronoi coverage with the Lloyd algorithm and the local path planning algorithm TangentBug to compute the motion of the robots around obstacles and corners. We present the algorithm and prove convergence and optimality. We also discuss experimental results from an implementation with five robots.
