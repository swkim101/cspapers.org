An important problem in queueing network modeling is that of characterizing and analyzing relationships among alternative models of a single system. The problem is approached by developing the concept of a state space transformation, which is a mechanism for expressing the way one model can be mapped into another. After discussing state space transformations in general terms, some important transformations are presented. The usefulness of the technique is demonstrated by developing state space transformations for the shadow CPU technique for analyzing preemptive priority scheduling and the aggregate server method for modeling serialization delays.
