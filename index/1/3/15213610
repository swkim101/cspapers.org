GTE Laboratories is developing a new CAD data base to support the design of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. In designing the data base around a commercial DBMS with the intention of taking advantage of the useful features in such systems, several major problems have been encountered. The authors discuss those features of the new data base, including a novel data organization, which address these problems while satisfying the objective of providing full data management support for CAD.
