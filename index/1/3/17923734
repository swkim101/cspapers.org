Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have gained a significant amount of research lately, with a number of universities and industry sponsors paving the way with micro flying robots to perform Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Missions. However, much of the work done in flapping wing MAVs till date has not shown performance improvements over their Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL), rotary-wing counterparts. Research and development over the years has shown that insects and birds have unmatched flying capabilities in the Low Reynolds Number Regime. Their phenomenal flight performance is attributed to among others the highly energy efficient actuation systems and their power to weight ratios. The paper proposes and illustrates new and energy-efficient actuation mechanisms and incorporating them into MAVs. The paper begins by elaborating on the background of our research and the need for energy efficiency in MAVs; followed by showcasing resonant, elastic / restorative actuation mechanisms and their control methodology to reduce flight-actuation energy requirements. In conclusion, the paper contrasts and compares all the actuation systems for power intake, scalability and mechanical complexity.
