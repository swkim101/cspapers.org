The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is engaged in a robot research program. The program is aimed at the development and demonstration of technology required to integrate a variety of robntic functions (locomotion, manipulation, sensing and perception, decision making, and man-robot interaction) into a working robot unit operating in a real world environment and dealing with both man-made and natural objects. This paper briefly describes the hardware and software system architecture of the robot breadboard and summarizes the developments to date. The content of the paper is focused on the unique planning considerations involved in incorporating a manipulator as part of an autonomous robot system. In particular, the effects of system architecture, arm trajectory calculations, and arm dynamics and control are discussed in the context of planning arm motion in complex and changing sensory and workspace environments.
