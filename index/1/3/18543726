The main focus of my dissertation is long-term interaction with an Artificial Conversational Companion in the context of conversation training for second language acquisition. I use a data-driven approach and conversation analysis methods to build computational models for long-term interaction as a meaningful activity. I work on the concept of interaction profiles for human-agent interaction. The resulting models will be integrated in an AIML-based chatbot that helps to practice conversation in a foreign language.
