Many applications have used a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), such as in virtual and mixed realities, and tele-presence. The advantage of HMD systems is the ease of feeling a 3D world in the display of animation or movies. However, the field of view (FOV) of commercial HMD systems is too narrow for feeling immersion. The horizontal FOV of many commercial HMDs is around 60 degrees, significantly narrower than that of humans. In this paper, we propose a super wide field of view catadioptrical head-mounted display consisting of an ellipsoidal and a hyperboloidal curved mirror. The horizontal FOV of the proposed HMD is 180 degrees and includes the peripheral view of humans. It increases reality and immersion of users. As well, the central region (60 degrees) of the FOV can measure 3D distances using stereoscopics.
