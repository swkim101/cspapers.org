Retinal surgery is one of the most challenging types of surgery because of the scale and the fragility of the human eye anatomy. The surgeon suffers from limited positioning accuracy, tremor and poor force feedback directly affecting the quality of the surgical procedures. To tackle these issues, we developed a teleoperation system to assist surgeons during retinal surgery. The system offers features like motion scaling, tremor compensation and scaled force feedback. This paper reports on the design of the slave and the master.
