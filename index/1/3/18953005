We have mathematically shown that cortical maps in the primary sensory cortices can be reproduced by using three hypotheses which have physiological basis and meaning. Here, our main focus is on ocular dominance column formation in the primary visual cortex. Monte Carlo simulations on the segregation of ipsilateral and contralateral afferent terminals are carried out. Based on these, we show that almost all the physiological experimental results concerning the ocular dominance patterns of cats and monkeys reared under normal or various abnormal visual conditions can be explained from a viewpoint of the phase transition phenomena.
