This paper describes a rendering method for generating tangible drawings of spatial real world objects based on a theory of haptic image perception and understanding. The method is based on an analysis of the process of drawing used by blind people and on cognitive considerations. A haptic rendering pipeline has been implemented which uses methods such as folding out or flattening to create 2D images from 3D models. The evaluation currently being carried out is described and the results are discussed in a broader application context.
