Although recent deep learning based frameworks have made significant progress in multi-talker mixed speech separation, most existing deep learning based methods, focusing on separating all the speech channels rather than selectively attending the target speech and ignoring other sounds, may fail to offer a satisfactory solution in a complex auditory scene where the number of input sounds is usually uncertain and even dynamic. In this work, we employ ideas from auditory selective attention of behavioral and cognitive neurosciences and from recent advances of memory-augmented neural networks. Specifically, a unified Auditory Selection framework with Attention and Memory (dubbed ASAM) is proposed. Our ASAM first accumulates the prior knowledge (that is the acoustic feature to one specific speaker) into a life-long memory during the training phase, meanwhile a speech perceptor is trained to extract the temporal acoustic feature and update the memory online when a salient speech is given. Then, the learned memory is utilized to interact with the mixture input to attend and filter the target frequency out from the mixture stream. Finally, the network is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of the attended speech. We evaluate the proposed approach on WSJ0 and THCHS-30 datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully conducts two auditory selection tasks: the top-down task-specific attention (e.g. to follow a conversation with friend) and the bottom-up stimulus-driven attention (e.g. be attracted by a salient speech). Compared with deep clustering based methods, our method conducts competitive advantages especially in a real noise environment (e.g. street junction).
