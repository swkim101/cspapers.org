The problem base structure for purposeful systems is considered. It cones out that predicate calculus is rather unwieldy for this purpose; semantic nets should be preferred. The main attention is paid to the convenience in representation of descriptive and operational information in the form of universal item (concept) in order to obtain natural and straightforward means for simulation of discrete and continuous processes, to provide proper interaction between them. The wide use of concept hierarchy is proposed. A single universal operator is introduced: the instantiation of concepts. The material is presented in informal way.
