How should opinions of control knowledge sources be represented and combined? These issues are addressed for the case where control knowledge is used to form an agenda, i.e., a proposed knowledge source execution order. A formal model is developed in the Dempster/ Shafer belief calculus and computational problems are discussed as well. The model is applicable to many other problems where it is desired to order a set of candidates using a knowledge-based approach.
