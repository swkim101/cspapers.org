This paper deals with the mechanical design of a novel haptic Hand Exoskeleton (HE) that allows exerting controlled forces on the fingertip of the index and thumb of the operator. The proposed device includes several design solutions for optimizing the accuracy and mechanical performances. Remote Centers of Motion mechanisms have been adopted for delocalizing the encumbrance of linkages of the structure away from the operator's fingers. An improved stiffness of the transmission and reduced requirements for the actuators have been achieved thanks to a novel Patent Pending principle for integrating speed reduction ratio with the transmission system.
