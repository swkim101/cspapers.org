We show that a recently introduced lexical quality measure is also valid to measure textual Web accessibility. Our measure estimates the lexical quality of a site based in the occurrence in English Web pages of a large set of words with errors. We first compute the correlation of our measure with Web popularity measures to show that gives independent information. Second, we carry out a user study using eye tracking to prove that the degree of lexical quality of a text is related to the degree of understandability of a text, one of the factors behind Web accessibility.
