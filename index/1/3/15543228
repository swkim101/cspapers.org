The class and interaction structure of object-oriented designs may become fairly complex, and consequently difficult to develop and understand. Design patterns allow to govern this complexity. This paper presents the design process of a domain-specific black-box framework for the control of automated manufacturing systems. The design is performed as a sequence of transformation steps, guided by the use of generative design patterns. Starting out from a domain-specific model, which does not provide a degree of reusability sufficiently high for a framework, the transformation steps increase the reusability until a satisfactory degree is reached. The resulting class and interaction structure allows to create each application of the considered manufacturing subdomain by selecting, configuring and parameterizing of the framework classes.
