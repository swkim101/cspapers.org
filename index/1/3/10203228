We present a parameterized interpreter for modeling aspect-oriented mechanisms. The interpreter takes several parameters to cover different AOP mechanisms found in AspectJ, Hyper/J, and Demeter. The interpreter helps our understanding of the AOP mechanisms in two ways. First, its core part represents the common mechanical structure shared by different AOP mechanisms. Second, by reconstructing the existing AOP mechanisms and using parameters to configure the interpreter, we can illustrate the differences and similarities of those mechanisms clearly. This will also be helpful in rapid-prototyping a new AOP mechanism or a reflective AOP system that supports different mechanisms.
