In this paper, we propose a dynamic pushbroom stereo mosaic approach for representing and extracting 3D structures and independent moving targets from urban 3D scenes. Our goal is to acquire panoramic mosaic maps with motion tracking information for 3D (moving) targets using a light aerial vehicle equipped with a video camera flying over an unknown area for urban surveillance. In dynamic pushbroom stereo mosaics, independent moving targets can be easily identified in the matching process of stereo mosaics by detecting the "out-ofplace" regions that violate epipolar constraints and/or give 3D anomalies. We propose a segmentation-based stereo matching approach with natural matching primitives to estimate the 3D structure of the scene, particularly the ground structures (e.g., roads) on which humans or vehicles move, and then to identify moving targets and to measure their 3D structures and movements.
