We describe InstantApps, a WYSIWIG, model driven interpreter for developing and running web based database oriented applications. Applications are dynamically rendered through efficient runtime interpretation of meta-data which is manipulated through an intuitive visual designer. We also capture complex (multi-table) forms, workflow as well as business logic (using a variant of Google's MapReduce abstraction), distinguishing our approach from similar platforms in the literature as well as others recently made available on the internet
