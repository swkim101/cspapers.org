We develop a methodology to model and verify open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where agents may join in or leave at run time. Further, we specify properties of interest on OMAS in a variant of firstorder temporal-epistemic logic, whose characterising features include epistemic modalities indexed to individual terms, interpreted on agents appearing at a given state. This formalism notably allows to express group knowledge dynamically. We study the verification problem of these systems and show that, under specific conditions, finite bisimilar abstractions can be obtained.
