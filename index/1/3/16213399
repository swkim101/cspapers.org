In this paper, we propose a hybrid FUZZY P + ID controller to stabilize the towing cable tension between a cable ship and a burying system. First, we develop the model of a winch system driven by valve-controlled hydraulic motors and evaluate the step responses yielded by the conventional PID and the proposed FUZZY P+ID controllers using simulations. The comparative studies show that the control performance yielded by the FUZZY P+ID controller is superior. We replace the existing PID controller implemented on the towing winch with the FUZZY P + ID controller for burying cable tasks at speed up to 1 knot under sea waves with significant variations (peak-to-peak) from 1.5 to 2.5 meters. The real applications demonstrate that the FUZZY P + ID controller is much more robust than the conventional PID controller.
