Relocation in personal desktop resources is an interesting and promising research topic. This demonstration illustrates a new perspective in exploring desktop resources to help users re-find expected data resources more effectively. Different from existing works, our prototype OrientSpace has two features: automatically extract and maintain user tasks to support task-based exploration, and support vague search by exploiting associations between desktop resources.
