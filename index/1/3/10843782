This paper presents Strong Dependency, a formalism based on an information theoretic approach to information transmission in computational systems. Using the formalism, we show how the imposition of initial constraints reduces variety in a system, eliminating undesirable information paths. In this way, protection problems, such as the Confinement Problem, may be solved. A variety of inductive techniques are developed useful for proving that such solutions are correct.
