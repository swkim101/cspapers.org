For a class of Petri nets whose uncontrollable influence subnets are forward synchronization and backward conflict free (FSBCF) nets, this work studies their structure and properties and proposes an algorithm to transform a given generalized mutual exclusion constraint (GMEC) into an optimal admissible one. Compared with the path-based constraint transformation approaches, the proposed method has much higher computational efficiency. An example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.
