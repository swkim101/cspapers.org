In the k-median problem we are given a set S of n points in a metric space and a positive integer k. We desire to locate k medians in space, such that the sum of the distances from each of the points of S to the nearest median is minimized. This paper gives an approximation scheme for the plane that for any c > 0 produces a solution of cost at most 1+ 1/c times the optimum and runs in time O(n). The approximation scheme also generalizes to some problems related to k-median. Our methodology is to extend Aroraâ€™s [1, 2] techniques for the TSP, which hitherto seemed inapplicable to problems such as the k-median problem.
