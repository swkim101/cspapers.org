Attribute based proxy re-encryption scheme (ABPRE) is a new cryptographic primitive which extends the traditional proxy re-encryption (public key or identity based cryptosystem) to the attribute based counterpart, and thus empower users with delegating capability in the access control environment. Users, identified by attributes, could freely designate a proxy who can re-encrypt a ciphertext related with a certain access policy to another one with a different access policy. The proposed scheme is proved selective-structure chosen plaintext secure and master key secure without random oracles. Besides, we develop another kind of key delegating capability in our scheme and also discuss some related issues including a stronger security model and applications.
