The MEMOSE (Media Emotion Search) system is a specialized search engine for fundamental emotions in all kinds of emotional-laden documents. We apply a controlled vocabulary for basic emotions, a slide control to adjust the intensities of the emotions and the approach of broad folksonomies. The paper describes the indexing and the retrieval tool of MEMOSE and results from its evaluation.
