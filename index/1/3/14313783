Processing of data in many data analysis applications can be represented as an acyclic, coarse grain data flow, from data sources to the client. This paper is concerned with scheduling of multiple data analysis operations, each of which is represented as a pipelined chain of processing on data. We define the scheduling problem for effectively placing components onto Grid resources, and propose two scheduling algorithms. Experimental results are presented using a visualization application.
