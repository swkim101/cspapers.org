This paper presents a novel planner for dexterous manipulation with a multi-fingered robotic hand. This planner receives as input an initial grasp of the object and a desired trajectory of the object in task space (position and orientation). The planner computes the movements of the fingers which are required to move the object along this trajectory without breaking contacts. It uses a triangle mesh representation of the surfaces of the fingers and the object and a new contact evolution graph in order to compute all the possible transitions between the contact primitives of their surfaces. This planner have been implemented as a program which communicates with a five-fingered hand in order to test them in real manipulation tasks.
