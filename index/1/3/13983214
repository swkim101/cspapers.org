Providing fairness and system efficiency are important, often conflicting, requirements when allocating shared resources. In a hybrid storage system the problem is complicated by the high variability in request service times, caused by speed differences between heterogeneous devices and workload-specific variations in access time within a device. This paper describes a model for fair time-based resource allocation in a hybrid storage system that has better fairness and efficiency than traditional IOPS-based schemes. An analytical model is developed and an optimal algorithm for fairly allocating device times to applications while maximizing the system throughput or utilization is presented. The results are validated using Linux implementations.
