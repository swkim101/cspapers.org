The goal of the DEXARM project [1] is the developme nt of a robot arm comparable in size, force and de xterity to a human arm, to be used for space robotics applicatio ns n which the manipulation/intervention tasks wer e o iginally conceived for humans. These applications are typica lly external or internal servicing of orbiting plat forms or robotics for planetary exploration. The first user programme currently envisaged for DEXARM is EUROBOT [2].
