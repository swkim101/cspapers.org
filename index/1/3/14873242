Grasping individual objects from an unordered pile in a box has been investigated in static scenarios so far. In this paper, we demonstrate bin picking with an anthropomorphic mobile robot. To this end, we extend global navigation techniques by precise local alignment with a transport box. Objects are detected in range images using a shape primitive-based approach. Our approach learns object models from single scans and employs active perception to cope with severe occlusions. Grasps and arm motions are planned in an efficient local multiresolution height map. All components are integrated and evaluated in a bin picking and part delivery task.
