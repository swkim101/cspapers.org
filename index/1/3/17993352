In recent years, reliability has become a major issue and objective during the design of embedded systems. Here, different techniques to increase reliability like hardware-/software-based redundancy or component hardening are applied systematically during Design Space Exploration (DSE), aiming at achieving highest reliability at lowest possible cost. Existing approaches typically solely provide reliability measures, e. g. failure rate or Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF), to the optimization engine, poorly guiding the search which parts of the implementation to change. As a remedy, this work proposes an efficient approach that (a) determines the importance of resources with respect to the system's reliability and (b) employs this knowledge as part of a local search to guide the optimization engine which components/design decisions to investigate. First, we propose a novel approach to derive Importance Measures (IMs) using a structural evaluation of Success Trees (STs). Since ST-based reliability analysis is already used for MTTF calculation, our approach comes at almost no overhead. Second, we enrich the global DSE with a local search. Here, we propose strategies guided by the IMs that directly change and enhance the implemen- tation. In our experimental setup, the available measures to enhance reliability are the selection of hardening levels during resource allocation and software-based redundancy during task binding; exemplarily, the proposed local search considers the selected hardening levels. The results show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art approach regarding optimization quality, particularly in the search for highly-reliable yet affordable implementations - at negligible runtime overhead.
