Examining a domain outside of traditional software development may provide opportunities to address the challenges faced by global software teams. In this position paper, we examine the military model since its spirit of cooperative teamwork is well known and clearly documented. Specifically, we explore how an underlying code of conduct and the reinforcing subculture can create highly cohesive, effective teams. Referring to military models in order to build civilian teams is not without historical precedent; we hope that this investigation will prove fruitful. Ultimately, we seek to discover the qualities of the exceptional global software developer while exploring what we believe to be a rich research opportunity.
