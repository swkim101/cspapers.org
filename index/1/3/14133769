This paper focuses on documentation standards and their employment throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum. Specifically, it presents the motivation for a set of well-defined documentation standards for programming-intensive computer science courses. Additionally, it discusses the establishment of standards addressing both the procedure- and object-oriented programming paradigms. Finally, it relates the authors' experiences in using such standards to teach many software engineering principles along with required concepts in the undergraduate computer science curriculum.
