This paper presents an intent conformity model to collaboratively generate blacklists for cyberporn filtering. A novel porn detection framework via searches-and-clicks is proposed to explore collective intelligence embedded in query logs. Firstly, the clicked pages are represented in terms of the weighted queries to reflect the degrees related to pornography. Consequently, these weighted queries are regarded as discriminative features to calculate the pornography indicator by an inverse chi-square method for candidate determination. Finally, a candidate whose URL contains at least one pornographic keyword is included in our collaborative blacklists. The experiments on a MSN porn data set indicate that the generated blacklist achieves a high precision, while maintaining a favorably low false positive rate. In addition, real-life filtering simulations reveal that our blacklist is more effective than some publicly released blacklists.
