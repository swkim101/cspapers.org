For several years now the IFP Energies nouvelles (IF-PEN) group has been developing the OpenFlowSuite, a software suite in the oil and gas domain based on Eclipse RCP, incorporating graphical components and parallel calculators. These calculators are themselves developed in Fortran or C/C++. The processing chain "data entry", "database persistence", "calculator input", "execution" and "result processing" entails mapping between models and requires the development and maintenance of complex communication code. The pro-gress made in recent years in the field of model driven engineering, and the accompanying Eclipse tools, led us to consider introducing these solutions in management of the communication code. In this article we describe the introduction and use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) Eclipse tools in this context of industrial development of distributed scientific applications.
