With the increase of complexity in automotive control systems, the amount of data that needs to be managed is also increasing. Using a real-time database management system (RTDBMS) as a tightly integrated part of the software development process can give significant benefits with respect to data management. However, the variability of data management requirements in different systems, and the heterogeneousness of the nodes within a system may require a distinct database configuration for each node. In this paper we introduce a software engineering approach for generating RTDBMS configurations suitable for resource-constrained automotive control systems, denoted the COMET development suit. Using software engineering tools to assist developers with design and analysis of the system under development, different database configurations can be generated from pre-fabricated components. Each generated COMET database contains only functionality required by the node it is executing on.
