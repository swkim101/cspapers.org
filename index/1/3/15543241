Data structures courses traditionally offer a variety of assignments designed to expose students to the various aspects of a particular implementation of an abstract data type. The result is that students often learn about data structures in isolation from knowledge of applications. This gap in their background hurts them later when they must develop larger projects, either in upper level courses or as part of their jobs. This paper argues that data structures courses need to emphasize communication between structures as well as theory, and to expose students to the use of objects which have varying degrees of abstraction. One particular way of doing this is through the use of an animated maze solver as presented in this paper.
