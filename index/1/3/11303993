This paper describes the development of a general spatial data model for PROBE, a knowledge-oriented DBMS being developed at CCA [DAYA85, DAYASG]. The data model, called PDM, is an extension to the Daplex functional data model [SHIPII, FOX84]. The paper first describes the approach taken to defining spatial semantics in the model, and how these semantics were incorporated into the non-spatial aspects of the model. Second, some implementation aspects are discussed.
