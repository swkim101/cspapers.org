A novel algorithm for performing Independent Subspace Analysis, the estimation of hidden independent subspaces is introduced. This task is a generalization of Independent Component Analysis. The algorithm works by estimating the multi-dimensional differential entropy. The estimation utilizes minimal geodesic spanning trees matched to the sample points. Numerical studies include (i) illustrative examples, (ii) a generalization of the cocktail-party problem to songs played by bands, and (iii) an example on mixed independent subspaces, where subspaces have dependent sources, which are pairwise independent.
