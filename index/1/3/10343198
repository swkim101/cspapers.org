We will discuss how to better organize as graduate students and postdoctoral researchers seeking a career in liberal arts colleges (LACs). The BoF will bring together those who are interested in a career path to a LAC but do not have reliable advice and mentorship in their home departments and often turn out to be the only person in their department with such a career choice. Additionally, several people who have recently made a successful transition from graduate school to new faculty positions will attend the BoF.
