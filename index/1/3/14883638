The construction of application-specific Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) still needs considerable programming partly because the mapping between application data and its visual representation is complicated. This study proposes a system which generates GUIs by generalizing multiple sets of application data and its visualization examples. The most notable characteristic of the system is that programmers can interactively modify the mapping by “correcting” the system-generated visualization examples that represent the system's current notion of programmer's intentions. Conflicting mappings are automatically resolved via the use of constraint hierarchies.
