Various studies within NLP and Semantic Web use the so-called Google count, which is the hit count on a query returned by a search engine (not only Google). However, sometimes the Google count is unreliable, especially when the count is large, or when advanced operators such as OR and NOT are used. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that estimates the Google count robustly. It (i) uses the co-occurrence of terms as evidence to estimate the occurrence of a given word, and (ii) integrates multiple evidence for robust estimation. We evaluated our algorithm for more than 2000 queries on three datasets using Google, Yahoo! and MSN search engine. Our algorithm also provides estimate counts for any classifier that judges a web page as positive or negative. Consequently, we can estimate the number of documents with included references of a particular person (among namesakes) on the entire web.
