Querying heterogeneous XML document collections is an open problem. This will require building some sort of correspondence between the DTD of the different sources. We consider here the problem of matching the structure of XML documents from different sources. We introduce for that a stochastic structured document model and describe preliminary experiments performed on the INEX collection.
