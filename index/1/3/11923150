The Trusted Domain Machine (TDM) is a secure communication device for security guard applications. Its design isolates the security-critical functions into a physically isolated processing domain. This trusted physical domain includes a layer of core software that allows applications that are implemented on the TDM to control interdomain communication. The security-relevant application software is further separated into execution domains within the trusted domain to simplify its verification.
