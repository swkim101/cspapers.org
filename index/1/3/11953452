A system capable of performing approximate inferences under time constraints is presented. Censored production rules are used to represent both domain and control information. These are given a probabilistic semantics and reasoning is performed using a scheme based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Examples show the naturalness of the representation and the flexibility of the system. Suggestions for further research are offered.
