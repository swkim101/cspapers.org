Interest in domain-specific search is steadfastly increasing, yielding a growing need for domain-specific synonym discovery. Existing synonym discovery methods perform poorly when faced with the realistic task of identifying a target term's synonyms from among many candidates. We approach domain-specific synonym discovery as a graded relevance ranking problem in which a target term's synonym candidates are ranked by their quality. In this scenario a human editor uses each ranked list of synonym candidates to build a domain-specific thesaurus. We evaluate our method for graded relevance ranking of synonym candidates and find that it outperforms existing methods.
