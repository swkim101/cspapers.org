We consider the following problem: given a simple polygon <italic>P</italic> and a star-shaped polygon <italic>V</italic>, find a point (or the set of points) in <italic>P</italic> from which the portion of <italic>P</italic> that is visible is congruent to <italic>V</italic>. The problem arises in the localization of robots using a range-finder—<italic>P</italic> is a map of a known environment, <italic>V</italic> is the portion visible from the robot's position, and the robot must use this information to determine its position in the map. We give a scheme that preprocesses <italic>P</italic> so that any subsequent query <italic>V</italic> is answered in optimal time <italic>O</italic>(<italic>m</italic> + log <italic>n</italic> + A), where <italic>m</italic> and  <italic>n</italic> are the number of vertices in <italic>V</italic> and <italic>P</italic>, and A is the number of points in <italic>P</italic> that are valid answers (the output size). Our technique allows us to trade off smoothly between the query time and the preprocessing time or space. We also devise a data structure for output-sensitive determination of the visibility polygon of a query point inside a polygon <italic>P</italic>. We then consider a variant of the localization problem in which there is a maximum distance to which the robot can “see”—this is motivated by practical considerations, and we outline a similar solution for this case. We also show that a single localization query <italic>V</italic> can be answered in time  <italic>O</italic>(<italic>mn</italic>) with no preprocessing.
