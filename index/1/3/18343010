Software engineering has evolved, over a short period of time, into a dominant and omnipresent industry. In education we have recognized the importance of both managerial and technical aspects, but often failed to organize them in a coherent course with a relevant, if not realistic laboratory project. The problem is far-reaching, and should be dealt with accordingly. This paper presents our before and after findings, and elaborates on CPE 207, the new Software Engineering course that, in our opinion, helps in bridging the gap between university and industry.
