Approaches to natural language processing that use a phrasal lexicon have the advantage of easily handling linguistic constructions that might otherwise be extragrammatical. However, current phrasal lexicons are often too rigid: their phrasal entries fail to cover the more flexible constructions. FLUSH, for Flexible Lexicon Utilizing Specialized and Hierarchical knowledge, is a knowledge-based lexicon design that allows broad phrasal coverage.
