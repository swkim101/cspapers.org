A very accurate vehicle guidance is required in numerous agricultural applications, as seeding, spraying, row cropping,... Accuracy in vehicle localization can be obtained in realtime from a RTK GPS sensor. Several control laws, relying on this sensor, have been previously designed and provide satisfactory results as long as vehicles do not slide. However, sliding has to occur in agricultural tasks (sloping fields, curves on a wet land, ...). The challenge addressed in this paper is to preserve vehicle guidance accuracy in such situations. A nonlinear adaptive control law is here designed. Simulation results and field experiments, demonstrating the capabilities of that control scheme, are reported and discussed.
