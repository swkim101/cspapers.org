This paper discusses the application of the RCA-developed standard cell approach for generating low-cost, quick-turnaround random-logic LSI arrays using automatic placement and routing computer programs. Originally developed with government support1 for two-phase PMOS dynamic logic in 1967, the programs have been expanded to include many technologies2,3 and have gone through extensive evolutionary and revolutionary changes during the past 10 years. They have been used extensively by various government agencies and by many industrial concerns, including RCA. Perhaps a 1000 arrays using the PMOS, CMOS, and CMOS-SOS technologies have been generated using these programs and their derivations in the various companies. Within RCA more than 200 LSI arrays have been generated by these technologies.
 This paper describes these techniques and discusses various LSI circuits that demonstrate the operation of these programs, as well as the major changes that have occurred in them during the past 10 years. The applications include large LSI systems in addition to individual LSI circuit applications.
 The Multiport Placement and Routing Algorithm, which is introduced for the first time, demonstrates several CMOS-SOS LSI circuits (including the fastest and most powerful microprocessor yet designed) which show densities comparable to handcrafted custom LSI chips.
