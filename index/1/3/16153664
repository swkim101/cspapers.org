The Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) of an object records the variation of surface area with surface orientation, uniquely representing convex objects. The inversion problem for polyhedra (from an EGI to a description in terms of vertices and faces) has been solved, by an iterative algorithm [Little, 1983]. The algorithm depends upon the mixed volume, a geometric construction linking the areas and positions of the faces of an object. A robust method for determining object attitude from the EGI is developed here, using this construction. Experiments show the method's insensitivity to small attitude differences. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Orientation maps can be generated by binocular stereo [Baker and Binford, 1981] [Grimson, 1981], photometric stereo [Woodham, 1980], shape from shading [Horn, 1975], or by differentiation of laser range images[Brou, 1984]. By translating the surface normals of an object to a common point, a representation of the distribution of surface orientation is formed, called the Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) [Horn, 1984]. Figure 1 shows the Extended Gaussian Image of a polyhedron and the corresponding object. Horn and Ikeuchi[1984] demonstrated the feasibility of using EGIs for attitude determination, comparing the EGI of a prototype with a sensed EGI. The reconstruction method using the mixed volume suggests a new method for attitude determination. This method is practical and more robust than direct comparison of EGIs. A detailed discussion of this method is presented in [Little, 1985]. * This research was supported in part by a UBC University Graduate Fellowship and by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada grant A3390.
