In this paper, we consider existing asymptotically optimal inspection planning algorithm in coverage path planning with realistic visibility constraints of standard cameras. Although the existing approach is able to provide an optimal solution with omnidirectional sensing and limited sensing range, it is prohibitively computationally expensive for problems with only few objects to be covered and limited field of view. Based on the analysis of the utilized sampling-based strategy, we propose a heuristic approach to decrease computational requirements in problems with restricted viewing frustum, which is a more realistic model of a digital camera. In addition, we also consider a minimal distance and angle under which the object to be covered is captured by the forward looking camera to make a snapshot of the object with the required details.
