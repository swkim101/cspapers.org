It is generally accepted that a course in discrete structures such as Course B3 in Curriculum 68 recommendations [1] is an important part of a Computer Science program. In many institutions a Discrete Structures course is offered in the Computer Science Department although it overlaps courses in the Mathematics Department [2,3,4]. In smaller schools the size of the student body and staff limitations make such a solution impractical. At Augusta College we have met the objective of early exposure to discrete mathematics with applications in computer science by offering a two-hour computer science course as a co-requisite to a three-hour mathematics course. While this approach is a compromise it does appear to have some merit.
