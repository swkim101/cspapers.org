We define a clause tableau calculus for MaxSAT, prove its soundness and completeness, and describe a tableau-based algorithm for MaxSAT. Given a multiset of clauses , the algorithm computes both the minimum number of clauses that can be falsified in , and an optimal assignment. We also describe how the algorithm can be extended to solve weighted MaxSAT and weighted partial MaxSAT.
