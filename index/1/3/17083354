The opportunity for computer delivered instruction arises in the teaching of the mechanisms of computing to an introductory class. This topic encompasses the automated translation of a high-level program into assembly language, the loading and execution of individual instructions (the fetch-execute cycle), and the use of electronic circuits beneath the registers to actually do the computation. The processes are complex and dynamic, and are not easily expressed on the printed page or in a blackboard presentation. Furthermore, the student needs to spend some time thinking about them; he or she needs to watch different operations, observe the systemâ€™s behavior on various input sets, ask questions about it, and experiment with his or her own ideas. Ideally, we would like to enable students to do all these things independently, at their own pace, and to the degree necessary to become comfortable with the concepts. In fact, if the computer-delivered instruction is successful enough, it need not be duplicated in detail in lectures, thus freeing time for other parts of the course.
