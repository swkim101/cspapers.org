Machine translation of a source language sentence involves selecting appropriate target language words and ordering the selected words to form a well-formed target language sentence. Most of the previous work on statistical machine translation relies on (local) associations of target words/phrases with source words/phrases for lexical selection. In contrast, in this paper, we present a novel approach to lexical selection where the target words are associated with the entire source sentence (global) without the need to compute local associations. Further, we present a technique for reconstructing the target language sentence from the selected words. We compare the results of this approach against those obtained from a finite-state based statistical machine translation system which relies on local lexical associations.
