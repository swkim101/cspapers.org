To take advantage of the full potential of ubiquitous computing, we will need systems which minimize powerconsumption. Weiser et al. and others have suggested that this may be accomplished by a CPU which dynamically changes speed and voltage, thereby saving energy by spreading run cycles into idle time. Here we continue this research, using a simulation to compare a number of policies for dynamic speed-setting. Our work clarifies a fundamental power vs. delay tradeoff, as well as the role of prediction and of smoothing in dynamic speed-setting policies. We conclude that success seemingly depends more on simple smoothing algorithms than on sophisticated prediction techniques, but defer to the replication of these results on future variable-speed systems.
