The successful development of high speed digital computer systems usually requires that maximum performance be obtained from the selected technology. An optimum system design can be pursued only with confidence that the necessary performance levels can be achieved by the system components. [7][8] Without that confidence the alternative is a more pessimistic "worst case" system design. The necessary confidence can only be achieved by a continuing evaluation of the timing characteristics of the system components.
