A drag operation is used for many two-point functions in mouse-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but its usage in touchscreen GUIs is limited because it is mainly used for scrolling. We propose Push-Push as a second two-point touchscreen operation that is not in conflict with a drag operation. We implemented three application scenarios and showed how Push-Push can be used effectively for other two-point functions while overlapping drag operations are used for scrolling.
