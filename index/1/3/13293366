A linear arrangement of an n-vertex graph G = (V, E) is a one-one mapping f of the vertex set V onto the set In] = {0, 1 , . . . , n 1}. The bandwidth of this linear arrangement is the maximum distance between the images of the endpoints of any edge in E(G). When the input graph G is a tree, the best known approximation algorithm for the minimum bandwidth linear arrangement (which is based on the principle of volume respecting embeddings) outputs a linear arrangement which has bandwidth within O(log 3 n) of the optimal bandwidth. In this paper, we present a simple randomized O(log 2 n lov~-n)-approximation algorithm for bandwidth minimization on trees.
