Given a binary matroid M specified by a port oracle, we can in polynomial number of calls to the oracle construct a binary representation for M. For general matroids, we can in polynomial number of calls to a port oracle determine whether a given subset is independent (that is, we can simulate an independence oracle with a port oracle). The work is related to a theorem of Lehman on matroid ports, and is motivated by issues in computational learning theory.
