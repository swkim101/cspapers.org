Certification of computer professionals has been in the limelight over the past year or so, particularly with respect to activities leading to the creation of the Institute for Certification of Computer Professionals (ICCP) [1]. Most of the effort of those involved to date has been on organizational matters, but our attention is now turned to planning for improvements in existing testing programs and to the establishment of new programs. If these are to be effective, computer science education must have a major role. In keeping with the interests of SIGCSE, I wish to comment on that role from the perspective of one involved with the Institute. First I will set the context for my remarks by discussing the professional status of computing personnel and then certification and critically related activities will be described.
