The scales on the skin of a snake are an integral part of the snake's locomotive capabilities. It stands to reason that the integration of scales into the design of robotic snakes would open new properties to exploit. In this work, we present a robotic snake design that incorporates rigid scales in the casing of each module. To validate the impact of the scales, locomotion is tested under three conditions: with scales, covered in cloth with scales, and covered in cloth without scales. The performance of the snake robot, in each of the aforementioned scenarios, is evaluated based on its forward displacement while executing each of two pre-programmed gaits: inchworm and lateral undulation. The lateral undulation gait is tested under two additional conditions: pitched and un-pitched. Tracks of the experimental runs are presented followed by a statistical analysis demonstrating an increase in locomotive performance when incorporating scales in the chassis design.
