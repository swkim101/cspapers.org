The popularity of instant messaging (IM) services has recently attracted the interest of attackers that try to send malicious URLs or files to the contact lists of compromised instant messaging accounts or clients. This work focuses on a systematic characterization of IM threats based on the information collected by HoneyBuddy, a honeypot-like infrastructure for detecting malicious activities in IM networks. HoneyBuddy finds and adds contacts to its honeypot messengers by querying popular search engines for IM contacts or by advertising its accounts on contact finder sites. Our deployment has shown that with over six thousand contacts we can gather between 50 and 110 malicious URLs per day as well as executables. Our experiments show that 21% of our collected executable samples were not gathered by other malware collection infrastructures, while 93% of the identified IM phishing domains were not recorded by popular blacklist mechanisms. Furthermore, our findings show that the malicious domains are hosted by a limited number of hosts that remain practically unchanged throughout time.
