A social role is a set of characteristics that describe the behavior of individuals and their interactions between them within a social context. In this paper, we describe the architecture of a search engine for detecting roles in a social network. Our approach, based on indexed clusters, gives the user the possibility to define the roles interactively during a search session and retrieve the users for that role in milliseconds. We found that role selection strategies based on selecting people deviating from the average standards provides flexible query expressions and high quality results.
