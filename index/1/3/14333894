This paper presents a basic dance training system with a mobile robot. The system targets on beginners and enables them to learn basics of traditional dances easily. Learners can observe not only a fixed screen in front of them but also the display mounted on a mobile robot that moves according to the dance steps. These displays show actions of a dance master and real-time captured movement of the learners. The robot always takes its appropriate position so that the learners can easily know bad points of their actions. In other words, the robot plays a role as a "mobile mirror." We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and system through experiments.
