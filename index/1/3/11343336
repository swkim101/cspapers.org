The continuing deficit of computer related specialties is a cause for concern in the state of South Carolina. This deficit could be reduced if the two and four year colleges in the state offered more computer related courses to their students. Most of these colleges lack the appropriately trained faculty. In an effort to retrain existing faculty, a University of South Carolina Computer Science Institute was established in the Summer, 1979. The primary goals of the Institute are to upgrade the computer science competency of existing faculty, to utilize these newly trained faculty members to meet local demand for undergraduate instruction in computer related courses, and to conduct the Institute in a manner that allows statewide cooperation. Thus, participating colleges, knowing their own needs, will be able to integrate computer related courses into their programs of study. The larger colleges will be able to offer Baccalaureate programs with a major in computer science, and the smaller ones can offer two year certificate or training programs.
