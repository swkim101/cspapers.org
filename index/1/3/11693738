As people move through their environments, they do not move randomly. Instead, they are often engaged in typical motion patterns, related to specific locations they might be interested in approaching. In this paper we propose a method for adapting the behavior of a mobile robot according to the activities of the people in its surrounding. Our approach uses learned models of people's motion behaviors. Whenever the robot detects a person it computes a probabilistic estimate about which motion pattern the person might be engaged in. During the path planning it then uses this belief to improve its navigation behavior. In different practical experiments carried out on a real robot we demonstrate that our approach allows a robot to quickly adapt its navigation plans according to the activities of the persons in its surrounding. We also present experiments illustrating that our approach provides a better behavior than a standard reactive collision avoidance system.
