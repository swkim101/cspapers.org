Acquiring high-quality (temporal) facts for knowledge bases is a labor-intensive process. Although there has been recent progress in the area of semi-supervised fact extraction, these approaches still have limitations, including a restricted corpus, a fixed set of relations to be extracted or a lack of assessment capabilities. In this paper we introduce PRAVDA-live, a framework that overcomes these limitations and supports the entire pipeline of interactive knowledge harvesting. To this end, our demo exhibits fact extraction from ad-hoc corpus creation, via relation specification, labeling and assessment all the way to ready-to-use RDF exports.
