Wall and terrain following is a challenging problem for small, fast, and fragile robot vehicles. 
This paper presents a robust algorithm based 
on wide field integration of optic flow. Solutions for two dimensional and three dimensional wall following is provided for vehicles 
with non-holonomic velocity constraints that 
ensure that the focus of expansion of the flow field is known. The potential of the proposed 
algorithm is demonstrated in a simulation environment.
