The Department of Computer Science at the United States Air Force Academy teaches an introductory Pascal programming and problem solving course to 1400 freshman a year. Although the students have a wide range of prior programming experiences, very few have any practice with program design. To encourage proper solution design and alleviate the burdensome and demotivating reams of design documentation, the Department of Computer Science has developed an automated tool, the Automated Interactive Design Editor (AIDE). This paper will provide some background on the problems associated with student design documentation, describe how AIDE attempts to address this problem, and discuss future directions for the tool.
