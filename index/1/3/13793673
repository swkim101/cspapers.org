In this paper, we use semantic technologies for enriching trajectory data in the automotive industry for offline analysis. We proposed to re-use a combination of existing ontologies and we designed a Vehicle Signal Specification ontology to provide an environment in which we developed an application that analyzes the variations of signal values and enables to infer the "driving smoothness'' that we represent as additional annotations of semantic trajectories.
