Cognitive science researchers have emphasized the importance of ordering a complex task into a sequence of easy to hard problems. Such an ordering provides an easier path to learning and increases the speed of acquisition of the task compared to conventional learning. Recent works in machine learning have explored a curriculum learning approach called self-paced learning which orders data samples on the easiness scale so that easy samples can be introduced to the learning algo-rithm Ô¨Årst and harder samples can be introduced successively. We introduce a number of heuristics that improve upon self-paced learning. Then, we argue that incorporating easy, yet, a diverse set of samples can further improve learning. We compare these curriculum learning proposals in the context of four non-convex models for QA and show that they lead to real improvements in each of them.
