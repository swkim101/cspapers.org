This paper presents a decentralized data fusion approach to perform cooperative perception with data gathered from heterogeneous sensors, which can be static or carried by robots. Particularly, a Decentralized Delayed-State Extended Information Filter (DDSEIF) is described, where full state trajectories are considered to fuse the information. This permits to obtain an estimation equal to that obtained by a centralized system, and allows delays and latency in the communications. The sparseness of the information matrix maintains the communications overhead at a reasonable level. The method is applied to cooperative tracking and some results in disaster management scenarios are shown. In this kind of scenarios the target might move in both open field and indoor areas, so fusion of data provided by heterogeneous sensors is beneficial.
