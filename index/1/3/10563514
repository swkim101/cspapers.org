An automated business data processing system designer is described. Attention is centered on the I/O aspects of such systems and the development of optimizing design heuristics. The design of data organization and data accessing procedures for data processing systems operating on large keyed files of data is a common and recurrent activity in modern data processing applications. A considerable amount of understanding and expertise in the this area has been developed and it is time to begin codifying and automating this process. It should be possible to develop a system where the user has merely to specify the characteristics of his (input, output, and intermediate) data objects and their interrelations1 and the system will automatically determine the data organizations and accessing procedures that are optimal for his application. The optimizer for Protosystem I (an automatic programming system prototype at MIT's Project MAC) provides an example of how such automation can be accomplished. This paper describes the theory and algorithms behind the optimizer that is currently operational at Project MAC.
