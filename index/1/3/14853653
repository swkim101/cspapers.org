This paper presents a new X-blocking system which allows very high compression and full coverage even if the density of unknown values is very high and varies every shift. Despite the presence of Xs in scan cells, compression can be maximized by using PRPG and MISR structures. Results on industrial designs with various X densities demonstrate consistently high compression and full test coverage.
