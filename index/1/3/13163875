An aircraft that is capable of continuous flight offers a new level of autonomous capacity for unmanned aerial vehicles. We present an overview of the components and concepts of a small scale unmanned aircraft that is capable of sustaining powered flight without a theoretical time limit. We then propose metrics that quantify the robustness of continuous flight achieved and optimization criteria to maximize these metrics. Finally, the criteria are applied to a fabricated and flight tested small scale high efficiency aircraft prototype to determine the optimal battery and photovoltaic array mass for robust continuous flight.
