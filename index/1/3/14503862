Measuring distance or some other form of proximity between objects is a standard data mining tool. Connection subgraphs were recently proposed as a way to demonstrate proximity between nodes in networks. We propose a new way of measuring and extracting proximity in networks called "cycle free effective conductance"(CFEC). Our proximity measure can handle more than two endpoints, directed edges, is statistically well-behaved, and produces an effectiveness score for the computed subgraphs. We provide an efficien talgorithm. Also, we report experimental results and show examples for three large network data sets: a telecommunications calling graph, the IMDB actors graph, and an academic co-authorship network.
