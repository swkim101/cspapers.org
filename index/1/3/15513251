Some of my colleagues in IBM and myself have been jointly studying and discussing the problems involved in providing future graphics support in a FORTRAN environment. In this presentation I will attempt to summarize the major assumptions that have influenced this design study and report on some of the tentative conclusions reached as well as some, as yet, unanswered critical questions. This report is being made at this time in the hope that it will stimulate a critical evaluation on your part and provide us with some useful feedback. Your first opportunity for responding will be provided by the discussion session scheduled for later this afternoon. We hope you will participate by informing us about your own views and experiences with respect to graphical data processing.
