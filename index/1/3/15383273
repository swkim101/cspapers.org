INTRODUCTION The ICSE 97 Doctoral Consortium is a one day workshop prior to the regular ICSE technical conference. The goal of the doctoral consortium is to publicly discuss research goals, methods, and results at an early enough stage in Ph.D. research to provide useful guidance in completion of the dissertation research and initiation of a research career. The consortium and ICSE also provide an opportunity for student participants to interact with established researchers and others in the wider software engineering community. Ten student participants were selected from among thirty-nine complete submissions. Selection criteria included the stage of the research and its appropriateness to ICSE, in addition to technical strength of the submitted research abstract.
