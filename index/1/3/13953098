Predictive models in HCI, such as models of user performance, are often expressed as multivariate nonlinear regressions. This approach has been preferred, because it is compact and allows scrutiny. However, existing modeling tools in HCI, along with the common statistical packages, are limited to predefined nonlinear models or support linear models only. To assist researchers in the task of identifying novel nonlinear models, we propose a stochastic local search method that constructs equations iteratively. Instead of predefining a model equation, the researcher defines constraints that guide the search process. Comparison of outputs to published baselines in HCI shows improvements in model fit in seven out of 11 cases. We present a few ways in which the method can help HCI researchers explore modeling problems. We conclude that the approach is particularly suitable for complex datasets that have many predictor variables.
