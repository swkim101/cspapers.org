People talk about what they do, often at the same time as they are doing. This reporting has an important function in coordinating action between people working together on real everyday problems. It is also an important source of data for social scientists studying people's behavior. In this paper, we report on some studies we are doing on report dialogues. We describe two kinds of phenomena we have identified, outline a preliminary process model that integrates the report generation with the processes that are generating the actions being reported upon, and specify a systematic methodology for extracting relevant evidence bearing on these phenomena from text transcripts of talk about doing to use in evaluating the model.
