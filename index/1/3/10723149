vv hile it has long been recognized that memory latency was a key parameter of performance, the impact of memory bandwidth (or its absence) has always been much harder to characterize. The complex relationship between latency and bandwidth is much better understood today than it was in 1982. Nevertheless, this relationship in the ever-varying context of “modern” system designs, created a fertile ground for studying a range of solutions to the same problem over many generations of computers: how to balance bandwidth and latency to provide a cost-effective, highperformance memory system [1,3].
