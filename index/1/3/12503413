We present a new algorithm for multi-region segmentation of 2D images with objects that may partially occlude each other. Our algorithm is based on the observation that human performance on this task is based both on prior knowledge about plausible shapes and taking into account the presence of occluding objects whose shape is already known - once an occluded region is identified, the shape prior can be used to guess the shape of the missing part. We capture the former aspect using a deep learning model of shape, for the latter, we simultaneously minimize the energy of all regions and consider only unoccluded pixels for data agreement. Existing algorithms incorporating object shape priors consider every object separately in turn and can't distinguish genuine deviation from the expected shape from parts missing due to occlusion. We show that our method significantly improves on the performance of a representative algorithm, as evaluated on both preprocessed natural and synthetic images. Furthermore, on the synthetic images, we recover the ground truth segmentation with good accuracy.
