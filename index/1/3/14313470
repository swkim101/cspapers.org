The relationships among modules in a software project of a certain size can give us much information about its internal organization and a way to control and monitor development activities and evolution of large libre software projects. In this paper, we show how information available in CVS repositories can be used to study the structure of the modules in a project when they are related by the people working in them, and how techniques taken from the social networks fields can be used to highlight the characteristics of that structure. As a case example, we also show some results of applying this methodology to the Apache project in several points in time. Among other facts, it is shown how the project evolves and is self-structuring, with developer communities of modules corresponding to semantically related families of modules.
