The goal of this session is to make the software engineering community aware of the opportunities that exist to pursue such an experimental approach. In the remainder of the essay, we describe an emerging model for empirical work and the language for discussing it. We then focus on the current state of experimental software engineering, the road blocks barring effective progress, and what developers and researchers can do to remove them.
