Owing to dense deployment of light fixtures and multipath-free propagation, visible light localization technology holds potential to overcome the reliability issue of radio localization. However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. We present LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency, which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency (> 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. In our experiments, LiTell demonstrates high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and great potential to achieve sub-meter granularity.
