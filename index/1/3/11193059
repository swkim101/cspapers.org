We present an algorithm that decomposes a database scheme when the dependency set contains functional and multivalued dependencies. The schemes in the resulting decomposition are in fourth normal form and have a lossless join. Our algorithm does not impose restrictions on the allowed set of dependencies, and it never requires the computation of the full closure of the dependency set. Furthermore, the algorithm works in polynomial time for classes of dependencies that properly contain conflict-free dependency sets.
