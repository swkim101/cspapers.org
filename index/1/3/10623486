Brouwer's continuity principle states that all functions from infinite sequences of naturals to naturals are continuous, that is, for every sequence the result depends only on a finite initial segment. It is an intuitionistic axiom that is incompatible with classical mathematics. Recently Martín Escardó proved that it is also inconsistent in type theory.
