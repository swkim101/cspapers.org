In this paper, a novel repetitive control scheme is presented and discussed. The general framework is the control of repetitive tasks of robotic systems or, more in general, of automatic machines. The key idea of the proposed scheme consists in modifying the reference trajectory provided to the plant in order to compensate for external loads or unmodelled dynamics that cyclically affect it. By exploiting the dynamic filters for the B-spline trajectory planning, it has been possible to integrate the trajectory generation within a repetitive control scheme able to modify in real-time the reference signal with the aims of nullify interpolation errors. Experimental results obtained controlling two joints of a standard industrial manipulator are reported, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.
