We consider how patterns of figure use in the scientific literature relate to impact, change over time, and vary across disciplines. We use a convolutional neural network to embed figures as feature vectors in a high-dimensional space, then visualize this space as a 2D heatmap to expose patterns. We consider how these patterns vary with respect to time, impact, and discipline, concluding that high-impact papers tend to include significantly more data-carrying figures (i.e., visualizations), despite a downward trend in such figures overall. We also show how this approach can be used to bootstrap targeted information extraction projects for specific figure types, describing one such project involving phylogenetic trees.
