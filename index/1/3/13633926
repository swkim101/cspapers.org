Time-biased gain provides a unifying framework for information retrieval evaluation, generalizing many traditional effectiveness measures while accommodating aspects of user behavior not captured by these measures. By using time as a basis for calibration against actual user data, time-biased gain can reflect aspects of the search process that directly impact user experience, including document length, near-duplicate documents, and summaries. Unlike traditional measures, which must be arbitrarily normalized for averaging purposes, time-biased gain is reported in meaningful units, such as the total number of relevant documents seen by the user. In prior work, we proposed and validated a closed-form equation for estimating time-biased gain, explored its properties, and compared it to standard approaches. In this paper, we use stochastic simulation to numerically approximate time-biased gain. Stochastic simulation provides greater flexibility that will allow us, in future work, to easily accommodate different types of user behavior and increase the realism of the effectiveness measure.
