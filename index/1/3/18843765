PIVOT is an important relational operation that allows data in rows to be exchanged for columns. Although most current relational database management systems support PIVOT-type operations, to date a purely formal, algebraic characterization of PIVOT has been lacking. In this paper, we present a characterization in terms of extended relational algebra operators τ (transpose), Π (drop projection), and μ (unique optimal tuple merge). This enables us to (1) draw parallels with PIVOT and existing operators employed in Dynamic Data Mapping Systems (DDMS), (2) formally characterize invertible PIVOT instances, and (3) provide complexity results for PIVOT-type operations. These contributions are an important part of ongoing work on formal models for relational OLAP.
