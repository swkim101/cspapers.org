In this contribution we present the results of a pilot study in which an Extended Range Telepresence System is used to calibrate parameters of a pedestrian model for simulation. The parameters control a model element that is intended to make simulated agents walk in the direction of the estimated smallest remaining travel time. We use this to, first, show that that an Extended Range Telepresence System can serve for such a task in general and second to actually find simulation parameters that yield realistic results.
