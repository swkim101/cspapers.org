We demonstrate an XML full-text search engine that implements the TeXQuery language. TeXQuery is a powerful full-text search extension to XQuery that provides a rich set of fully composable full-text primitives, such as phrase matching, proximity distance, stemming and thesauri. TeXQuery enables users to seamlessly query over both structure data and text, by embedding full-text primitives in XQuery and vice versa. TeXQuery also supports a flexible scoring construct that scores query results based on full-text predicates and permits top-k queries. TeXQuery is the precursor of the full-text language extension to XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 currently being developed by W3C.
