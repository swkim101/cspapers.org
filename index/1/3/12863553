We obtain the first online algorithms for the node-weighted Steiner tree, Steiner forest and group Steiner tree problems that achieve a poly-logarithmic competitive ratio. Our algorithm for the Steiner tree problem runs in polynomial time, while those for the other two problems take quasi-polynomial time. Our algorithms can be viewed as online LP rounding algorithms in the framework of Buchbinder and Naor (Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, 2009); however, while the natural LP formulation of these problems do lead to fractional algorithms with a poly-logarithmic competitive ratio, we are unable to round these LPs online without losing a polynomial factor. Therefore, we design new LP formulations for these problems drawing on a combination of paradigms such as spider decompositions, low-depth Steiner trees, generalized group Steiner problems, etc. and use the additional structure provided by these to round the more sophisticated LPs losing only a poly-logarithmic factor in the competitive ratio. As further applications of our techniques, we also design polynomial-time online algorithms with poly-logarithmic competitive ratios for two fundamental network design problems in edge-weighted graphs: the group Steiner forest problem (thereby resolving an open question raised by Chekuri et. al. (SODA 2008)) and the single source â„“-vertex connectivity problem (which complements similar results for the corresponding edge-connectivity problem due to Gupta et. al. (STOC 2009)).
