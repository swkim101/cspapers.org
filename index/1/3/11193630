As a result of high precision and excellent dynamic properties parallel kinematic machines (PKM) are particularly suited for high-speed and high-accuracy object handling. To optimize the design of such PKM, only kinetostatic analysis is not sufficient. Additionally, dynamic properties should be taken into account. Hence, this research develops the dynamic model for a class of translational 3-RPC-manipulators with either pure prismatic joint or pure revolute joint actuation. For a given task the dynamic performance is compared to results of the kinetostatic analysis. Hence, it is shown that the dynamic properties highly influence the performance of the RPC-structure.
