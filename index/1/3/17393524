Presents seven sets of laboratory results testing variables in term position ranking which produce a phrase effect by weighting the distance between proximate terms. Results of the 73 tests conducted by this project are included, covering variant term position algorithms, sentence boundaries, stopword counting, every pairs testing, field selection, and combinations of algorithm including collection frequency, record frequency and searcher weighted. The discussion includes the results of tests by Fagan and by Croft, the need for term stemming, proximity as a precision device, comparisons with Boolean, and the quality of test collections.
