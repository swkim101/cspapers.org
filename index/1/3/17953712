This paper introduces a formal notition, the semanfic grammar, for defining programming languages. Semantic grammars combine denotational semantics and attribute grammars. They describe syntax and wmantics together, without separate tists of formulas or rules that need to be put into correspondence. They handle both static and dynamic semantics, both compileand run-time actions. â€˜Ihey describe languages at a high level of abstraction.
