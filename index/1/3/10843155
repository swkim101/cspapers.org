Early work on applied eye tracking investigated gaze as an input modality to interact with a desktop computer and discussed some of the human factors and technical aspects involved in performing common computer tasks with the eyes such as pointing and menu selection. Since then, eye tracking technology has considerably matured. Research on eye-based interaction is starting to gain interest in various specialized areas that are no longer restricted to desktop environment, such as virtual reality, human-human and humanrobot interaction. There is also a growing interest to take eye tracking out into the wild, to mobile and pervasive settings.
