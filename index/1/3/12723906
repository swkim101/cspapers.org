A method for calculating visual odometry for ground vehicles with car-like kinematic motion constraints similar to Ackerman's steering model is presented. By taking advantage of this non-holonomic driving constraint we show a simple and practical solution to the odometry calculation by clever placement of a single camera. The method has been implemented successfully on a large industrial forklift and a Toyota Prado SUV. Results from our industrial test site is presented demonstrating the applicability of this method as a replacement for wheel encoder-based odometry for these vehicles.
