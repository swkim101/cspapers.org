In this paper, we present an algorithm for simultaneously refining a probability distribution function (PDF) for the pose of a sensor network (i.e. the locations of the sensors), and inferring the spatial variations of measured environmental parameters. Our approach iteratively refines a network pose PDF by assuming that environmental parameters vary smoothly. Both our physical experiments, which sensed wireless signal strength as the environmental variable, and our numerical simulations demonstrate that the approach has promise.
