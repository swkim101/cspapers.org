I n t r o d u c t i o n peak rates of about 200 Mflops but its harmonic mean for the first fourteen Livermore loops is about 19 Mflops 1, while many important applications run at scalar speeds (3-5 Mflops). In short, hardware restrictions are passed into user software, restricting algorithm development and use because of difficulties in programming or performance. The restriction on uses of different algorithms can be very costly since many more operations may be used to compute a result than are actually required.
