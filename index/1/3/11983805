Classes represent key elements of knowledge in object-orientated source code. Class identifier names describe the knowledge recorded in the class and, much of the time, record some detail of the lineage of the class. We investigate the structure of Java class names identifying common patterns of naming and the way components of class identifier names are repeated in inheritance hierarchies. Detailed knowledge of class identifier name structures can be used to improve the accuracy of concept location tools, to support reverse engineering of domain models and requirements traceability, and to support development teams through class identifier naming recommendation systems.
