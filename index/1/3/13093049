In this paper we present a model for the representation of academic courses based on the organization and semantic relation of reusable teaching components using the unified modeling language. We describe an application of the model to cs101, but we believed that the model can be applied to any subject content of any discipline. Results indicate that by following this model, the knowledge of more experienced teachers can be stored in its representation and the course components are easier to be reused by less experienced teachers.
