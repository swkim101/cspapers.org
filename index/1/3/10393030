In a heterogeneous computer network, resources on each node are protected by the local security mechanism. Network services allow local resources to be accessed remotely from other nodes. Without appropriate network security measures, each node is vulnerable to attack from the network. This paper analyzes the heterogeneous Bell Labs Network (BLN) environment and lists the potential network security risks. By assessing the risks, counter-measures are proposed for minimizing potential exposure. These counter-measures are part of a global network security mechanism being implemented for BLN.
