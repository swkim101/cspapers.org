However, there is still little effort concentrated on optimizing the EMD metric towards better matching performance. To tackle this issue, we propose an EMD metric learning algorithm in this paper. In our method, the objective is to learn a discriminative distance metric for EMD ground distance matrix generation which can better measure the similarity between compared subjects. More specifically, given a group of labeled data from different categories, we first select a subset of training data and then optimize the metric for ground distance matrix generation. Here, both the EMD metric and the EMD flow-network are alternatively optimized until a steady EMD value can be achieved. This method is able to generate a discriminative ground distance matrix which can further improve the EMD distance measurement. We then apply our EMD metric learning method on two tasks, i.e., multi-view object classification and document classification. The experimental results have shown better performance of our proposed EMD metric learning method compared with the traditional EMD method and the state-of-the-art methods. It is noted that the proposed EMD metric learning method can be also used in other applications.
