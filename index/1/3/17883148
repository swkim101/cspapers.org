We study a logical system FQHT that is appropriate for reasoning about nonmonotonic theories with intensional functions as treated in the approach of [Bartholomew and Lee, 2012]. We provide a logical semantics, a Gentzen style proof theory and establish completeness results. The adequacy of the approach is demonstrated by showing that it captures the Bartholemew/Lee semantics and satisfies a strong equivalence property.
