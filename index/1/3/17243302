The ability to rely on similarity metrics invariant to image transformations is an important issue for image classification tasks such as face or character recognition. We analyze an invariant metric that has performed well for the latter - the tangent distance - and study its limitations when applied to regular images, showing that the most significant among these (convergence to local minima) can be drastically reduced by computing the distance in a multiresolution setting. This leads to the multi resolution tangent distance, which exhibits significantly higher invariance to image transformations, and can be easily combined with robust estimation procedures.
