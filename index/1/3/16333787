We present an algorithm for lambda expression reduction that avoids any copying that could later cause duplication of work. It is optimal in the sense defined by LÃ©vy. The basis of the algorithm is a graphical representation of the kinds of commonality that can arise from substitutions; the idea can be adapted to represent other kinds of expressions besides lambda expressions. The algorithm is also well suited to parallel implementations, consisting of a fixed set of local graph rewrite rules.
