ROSE is an experimental database system for CAD/CAM applications that organizes a database into entries and relationships. The data model of ROSE is an extension of the relational model and the data manipulation language is an extension of the relational algebra. Internally, ROSE is organized so that it can use operating system services to implement database system services. In this paper we describe five optimizations that have helped to make ROSE a fast database system for CAD/CAM.
