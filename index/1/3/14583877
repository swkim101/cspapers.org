The increasing expansion of websites and their web usage necessitates increasingly scalable techniques for Web usage mining that can be better cast within the framework of mining evolving data streams [1, 5]. Despite recent developments in mining evolving Web clickstreams [3, 6], there has not been any investigation of the performance of collaborative filtering [2] in the demanding environment of evolving data streams. In this paper, we study limited memory collaborative filtering based recommendations in evolving scenarios using a systematic validation methodology.
