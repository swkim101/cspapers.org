Elicitation studies, where users supply proposals meant to effect system commands, have become a popular method for system designers. But the method to date has assumed a within-subjects procedure and statistics. Despite the benefits of examining the relative agreement of independent groups (e.g., men versus women, children versus adults, novices versus experts, etc.), the lack of appropriate tools for between-subjects agreement rate analysis have prevented so far such comparative investigations. In this work, we expand the elicitation method to between-subjects designs. We introduce a new measure for evaluating coagreement between groups and a new statistical test for agreement rate analysis that reports the exact p-value to evaluate the significance of the difference between agreement rates calculated for independent groups. We show the usefulness of our tools by re-examining previously published gesture elicitation data, for which we discuss significant differences in agreement for technical and non-technical participants, men and women, and different acquisition technologies. Our new tools will enable practitioners to properly analyze their user-elicited data resulted from complex experimental designs with multiple independent groups and, consequently, will help them understand agreement data and verify hypotheses about agreement at more sophisticated levels of analysis.
