What are the objectives of this panel? The objectives are to: • Motivate education-based research as a valid scientific endeavor among faculty • Show how scientific research methods can be applied to classroom situations and learning in general • Show how published education-based research can inform and help make participants better teachers • Make participants aware of journals and conferences that publish education-based research • Make participants aware of funding programs that support education-based research Who should attend? All attendees at the conference are invited to contribute to the discussion. The primary target audience is teaching faculty at colleges and universities. We also strongly encourage attendance by students who are considering whether to pursue academic or industry positions after graduation. What is the format of the panel? The presenters will each cover general topics related to the objectives. Each will relate how they have managed to work education-based research into their own teaching environments. (Almstrum and Westbrook are non-tenure track teaching faculty members in research-oriented departments. McCauley is a tenure-track faculty member in a teaching-oriented department.) What are the topics that will be covered? Topics will include: • How to apply principles of scientific research to education. • How to use the classroom labs at your fingertips to generate research results that can inform our field. • Becoming part of a community of CS education researchers • Trade-offs between choosing a tenure-track position at a teaching-oriented department versus a non-tenure track teaching position at a research-oriented department. • How CS education research is regarded for promotion and tenure What is the proposed session length? 90 minutes.
