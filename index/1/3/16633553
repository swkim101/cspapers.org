Many mature development processes use structural coverage metrics to monitor the quality of testing. Recent studies suggest that commonly used control flow testing criteria poorly address state-based behavior of object oriented software. This paper presents DaTeC, a tool that provides useful coverage information of Java object states by implementing a novel contextual data flow testing approach.
