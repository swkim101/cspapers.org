We initiate the study of the minimum distortion problem: given as input two n-point metric spaces, find a bijection between them with minimum distortion. This is an abstraction of certain geometric problems in shape and image matching, and is also a natural variation and extension of the fundamental problems of graph isomorphism and bandwidth. Our focus is on algorithms that find an optimal (or near-optimal) bijection when the distortion is fairly small. We present a polynomial time algorithm that finds an optimal bijection between two line metrics, provided the distortion is less than 3+2âˆš2. We also give a parameterized polynomial time algorithm that finds an optimal bijection between an arbitrary unweighted graph metric and a bounded-degree tree metric.
