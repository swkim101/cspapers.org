This paper presented an approach to create 3D object models for robotic and vision applications in a fast and inexpensive way compared to established approaches. By using the RoboEarth system for storing the created object models users have world-wide access to the data and can immediately reuse a model as soon as it was created and uploaded. The approach shows general applicability for different kinds of cameras. In this work this was shown by two example implementations for the recognition process of objects. The quality of the recognition can be verified in the video. Combined with the knowledge saved in the RoboEarth database the objects can also be properly classified.
