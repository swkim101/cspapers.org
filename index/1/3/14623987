There are many timing unreliable computing components in modern computer systems, which are typically forbidden in hard real-time systems due to the timing uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a computation offloading mechanism to utilise these timing unreliable components in a hard real-time system, by providing local compensations. The key of the mechanism is to decide (1) how the unreliable components are utilized and (2) how to set the worst-case estimated response time. The local compensation has to start when the unreliable components do not deliver the results in the estimated response time. We propose a scheduling algorithm and its schedulability test to analyze the feasibility of the compensation mechanism. To validate the proposed mechanism, we perform a case study based on image-processing applications in a robot system and simulations. By adopting the timing unreliable components, the system can handle higher-quality images and with better performance.
