We describe a part-based object-recognition framework, specialized to mining complex 3D objects from detailed 3D images. Objects are modeled as a collection of parts together with a pairwise potential function. An efficient inference algorithm - based on belief propagation (BP) -finds the optimal layout of parts, given some input image. We introduce AggBP, a message aggregation scheme for BP, in which groups of messages are approximated as a single message. For objects consisting of N parts, we reduce CPU time and memory requirements from O(N2) to O(N). We apply AggBP on synthetic data as well as a real-world task identifying protein fragments in three-dimensional images. These experiments show that our improvements result in minimal loss in accuracy in significantly less time.
