This paper d e s c r i b e s a High-speed Prolog Machine (HIM) a r c h i t e c t u r e and i t s hardware s t r u c t u r e , which are developed as a product of F i f t h Genera t ion Computer System (FGCS} p r o j e c t in Japan. HIM r e a l i z e s high performance and provides a p r a c t i c a l programming environment. A major HIM f e a t u r e is a l a rge memory capac i t y and s p e c i a l i z e d hardware fo r u n i f i c a t i o n and s t ack o p e r a t i o n s . HIM has a c o m p i l e r o r i e n t e d a r c h i t e c t u r e with h i g h l e v e l s t a c k c o n t r o l i n s t r u c t i o n s . Furthermore, the HIM a r c h i t e c t u r e p r o v i d e s s i d e e f f e c t o p e r a t i o n s , n o n l o c a l e x i t con t ro l and mul t ip roces s support p r i m i t i v e s , which are e f f e c t i v e to develop system programs. The performance is e s t imated at 280 KLIPS (Kilo Logical In fe rences Per Second) in execu t ing a d e t e r m i n i s t i c "conca tena te" Prolog program. The HIM processor is implemented with h igh-speed CCML {Current Mode Logic) chips and with I00 nanosecond machine cycle. 1. I n t roduc t i on Recent ly , the logic-programming language P ro log [1 ] [2 ] [3 ] has been cons idered to have p o s s i b i l i t i e s use fu l in the f i e l d of A r t i f i c i a l I n t e l l i g e n c e , such as n a t u r a l l a n g u a g e p rocess ing and knowledge-based systems. Prolog is use fu l in AI r e sea rch due to i t s argument matching func t ion , automat ic back t rack ing con t ro l and i n t e r n a l database-management f a c i l i t i e s . R e a l i z a t i o n of these f e a t u r e s fo r Prolo9 programs r e q u i r e s huge working memory capac i t y and e x t e n s i v e execu t ion t ime. Prolo9 language p rocessors on convent iona l computers lack the necessary memory capacity and performance. There fo re , Prolo9 a p p l i c a t i o n programs on a conventional computer have been mainly l i m i t e d to exper imenta l use. In order to make Prolog a p r a c t i c a l language, an a t t r a c t i v e approach is to develop a h i g h l e v e l language machine[4] with both a high performance Pro log p rocessor and a l a rge real memory. Realizing a Prolog programming environment on the Prolog machine is also very important for developing practical application programs. A High-speed Prolog Machine (HPM) is designed to satisfy these goals. HPM is developed as a product of F i f t h Generation Computer System (FGCS) project in Japan. The FGCS project organizes a sequential inference machine (SIM)[6], which consists of a personal sequential inference machine (PSI)[5][6][7] and HIM. The PSI is suitable for relatively small-scale Prolog program execution. In the SIM, HPM provides high performance and large memory capacity to execute Prolog programs Loo large and too complex to perform on the PSI. HPM was designed to he a back-end processor, connected to the PSI. HIM is highly specialized for Prolo~ program execution. PSI and HPM differ at the machine instruction level. The level of H~4 is lower than tha t of PSI. Performance improvement in HIM is mainly due to compiler oPtimization techniques and specialized hardware modules, compared with microprogram i n t e r p r e t a t i o n techniques in the case of PSI. Although HIM's i n s t r u c t i o n s e t i s d i f f e r e n t from tha t of PSI, most Prolog programs can be executed on both machines. The fo l l owing s e c t i o n d e s c r i b e s the HIM des ign approach and system overview. Next, the HIM architecture background is discussed a~ the architecture is summarized. Then, the HIM hardware organization is described. Finally, HPM performance is estimated on a Prolog program example.
