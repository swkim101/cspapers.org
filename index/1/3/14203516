In many natural language applications, there is a need to enrich syntactical parse trees. We present a statistical tree annotator augmenting nodes with additional information. The annotator is generic and can be applied to a variety of applications. We report 3 such applications in this paper: predicting function tags; predicting null elements; and predicting whether a tree constituent is projectable in machine translation. Our function tag prediction system outperforms significantly published results.
