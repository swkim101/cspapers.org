Functional testing has become increasingly important due to the advent of VLSI technology. This paper presents a systematic procedure for generating tests for detecting functional faults in digital systems described by the register transfer language. Procedures for testing register decoding, instruction decoding, data transfer, data storage and data manipulation function faults in microprocessors are described step-by-step. Examples are given to illustrate the procedures.
