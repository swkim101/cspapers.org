This paper presents a detailed characterization of the Hokuyo URG-04LX 2D laser range finder. While the sensor specifications only provide a rough estimation of the sensor accuracy, the present work analyzes issues such as time drift effects and dependencies on distance, target properties (color, brightness and material) as well as incidence angle. Since the sensor is intended to be used for measurements of a tubelike environment on an inspection robot, the characterization is extended by investigating the influence of the sensor orientation and dependency on lighting conditions. The sensor characteristics are compared to those of the Sick LMS 200 which is commonly used in robotic applications when size and weight are not critical constraints. The results show that the sensor accuracy is strongly depending on the target properties (color, brightness, material) and that it is consequently difficult to establish a calibration model. The paper also identifies cases for which the sensor returns faulty measurements, mainly when the surface has low reflectivity (dark surfaces, foam) or for high incidence angles on shiny surfaces. On the other hand, the repeatability of the sensor seems to be competitive with the LMS 200.
