A study of leading-edge HP object technology projects was conducted to understand the current state of object-oriented practice, and projects' object-oriented analysis and design method needs. In this paper, we distill general best practices and pitfalls from the lessons learned in these projects. We also consider how the OOA/D methods support what the businesses have set out to accomplish, where they are deficient, and how they are being modified to better support project needs. We draw upon these lessons to point out areas where OOA/D methods and CASE tools require improvement.
