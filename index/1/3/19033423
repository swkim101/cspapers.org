Nowadays, brick and mortar retailers face a strong competition with online commerce. Instant feedback, product comparison or recommendations are relevant advantages of online commerce over traditional physical retailers. Ubiquitous Computing technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) can help to bring the benefits of online commerce to brick and mortar stores. We have been using RFID EPC Gen2 to identify and track garments in fitting rooms and point-of-sales in a real store in Barcelona, Spain. In this work we present the initial results of a real-customer model analysis using RFID data. We demonstrate how by analyzing basket and fitting room information we can extract differentiated patterns in the customers behavior. This model is intended to be used as part of an in-store recommender system and stock information. Future work includes improvement of data collection and customer identification
