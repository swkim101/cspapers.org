Motivated by applications to sensor and ad hoc networks, we study distributed algorithms for passing information and for computing averages in an arbitrarily connected network of nodes. Our work draws upon and contributes to a growing body of literature in three areas: (i) Distributed averaging algorithms, as formulated in Kempe, Dobra and Gehrke (2003), (ii) geometric random graph models for large networks of sensors, as put forth in Gupta and Kumar (2000), and (iii) the fastest mixing Markov chain on a graph, as studied recently in Boyd, Diaconis and Xiao (2003). For distributed averaging algorithms, we show that the averaging time, Tave, is related to the mixing time of an appropriate Markov chain on the network connectivity graph. In particular, we £rst show that the averaging time of any algorithm is lower bounded as Tave = Ω(log n + Tmix), where Tmix is the mixing time of the Markov chain associated with the algorithm. Given a Markov chain on the graph, we then derive an averaging algorithm whose averaging time achieves this lower bound. Further, the performance of our algorithm remains the same even if nodes are operating asynchronously. The close connection between the averaging time of distributed algorithms and mixing times on graphs motivates us to study the mixing time of random walks on geometric random graphs, G(n, r). We show that the natural random walk, which traverses the edge from i to j with a probability inversely proportional to the degree of node i, has a mixing time of the same order as the optimal (or fastest mixing) random walk on G(n, r). Our methods of analysis are general: they allow an easy recovery of previous results and can possibly be useful in other situations.
