In this paper we propose an energy control based algorithm for performing swing-up regrasping. In such regrasping motion, an object is manipulated using a robotic arm around a point pinched by the arms gripper. The aim is to manipulate the object from an initial angle to regrasp it on a new desired angle relative to the gripper. The pinching point function as a semi-active joint where the gripper is able to apply only dissipative frictional torques on the object to resist its motion. We address the problem by proposing an algorithm based on energy control. Simulations on a three degrees of freedom manipulator regrasping a bar validate the proposed algorithm.
