This paper presents an algorithm to iteratively drive a system quickly from one state to another. A simple model which captures the essential features of the system is used to compute the reference trajectory as the solution of an optimal control problem. Based on a lifted domain description of that same model an iterative learning controller is synthesized by solving a linear least-squares problem. The non-causality of the approach makes it possible to anticipate recurring disturbances. Computational requirements are modest, allowing controller update in real-time. The experience gained from successful maneuvers can be used to significantly reduce transients when performing similar motions. The algorithm is successfully applied to a real quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The results are presented and discussed.
