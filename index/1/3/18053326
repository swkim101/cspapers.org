This paper focuses on the exploration of term dependence in the application of sentence retrieval. The adjacent terms appearing in query are assumed to be related with each other. These assumed dependences among query terms will be further validated for each sentence and sentences, which present strong syntactic relationship among query terms, are considered more relevant. Experimental results have fully demonstrated the promising of the proposed models in improving sentence retrieval effectiveness.
