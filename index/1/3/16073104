Multi-backbone continuum robots have been demonstrated to possess wrench sensing capabilities by measuring the actuation load on each backbone and then using elaborate statics models. The ability to sense forces of interaction allows these robots to also control their interaction with the environment. In past studies, the force sensing models were subject to quasi-static assumptions. The goal of this paper is threefold: to update the wrench sensing model taking into account dynamic forces, to investigate the effect of these dynamic forces on the wrench sensing abilities of these robots and to present design atlases that help designers with the determination of critical dimensions ensuring bounded effect of dynamics on wrench sensing. The paper presents a simplified dynamics model using a Lagrangian formulation. This dynamics model is then used to update the wrench estimation model for a single-segment continuum robot. Finally, a set of normalized parameters is used to produce design atlases that help designers predict the effect of dynamics on the wrench estimation model. These results will allow improved performance in force sensing and control for multi-backbone continuum robots. Employing the methods presented in the paper, continuum robots, that have previously demonstrated excellent distal dexterity, will be able to control their force interaction with the anatomy better in future - thereby improving safety and the finesse of surgery.
