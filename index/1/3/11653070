Computational colour constancy tries to recover the colour of the scene illuminant of an image. Colour constancy algorithms can, in general, be divided into two groups: statistics-based approaches that exploit statistical knowledge of common lights and surfaces, and physics-based algorithms which are based on an understanding of how physical processes such as highlights manifest themselves in images. A combined physical and statistical colour constancy algorithm that integrates the advantages of the statistics-based colour by correlation method with those of a physics-based technique based on the dichromatic reflectance model is introduced. In contrast to other approaches not only a single illuminant estimate is provided but a set of likelihoods for a given illumination set. Experimental results on the benchmark Simon Fraser image database show the combined method to clearly outperform purely statistical and purely physical algorithms.
