We demonstrate the use of uncertain prediction in asystem for pedestrian navigation via audio with a combination ofGlobal Positioning System data, a music player, inertial sensing,magnetic bearing data and Monte Carlo sampling for a densityfollowing task, where a listener's music is modulated according tothe changing predictions of user position with respect to a targetdensity, in this case a trajectory or path. We show that this system enables eyes-free navigation around set trajectories or paths unfamiliar to the user and demonstrate that the system may be used effectively for varying trajectory width and context.
