This paper is devoted to the dynamic aspect of the IF02 conceptual model, an extension of the semantic IF0 model defined by S. Abite boul and R. Hull. Its original aspects are a “whole-event” approach, the use of constructors to express combinations of events, and the modularity and m-usability of specifiecltions in order to optimize the designer’s work. Furthermore, it offers an overview of the rep resented behaviour. To complement the modelling part, IF02 includes a derivation component which performs the implementation of specifications by using an active DBMS.
