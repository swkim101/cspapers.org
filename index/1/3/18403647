In the presence of sudden outbreaks, how can social media streams be used to strengthen surveillance capabilities? In May 2011, Germany reported one of the largest described outbreaks of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). By end of June, 47 persons had died. After the detection of the outbreak, authorities investigating the cause and the impact in the population were interested in the analysis of micro-blog data related to the event. Since Thousands of tweets related to this outbreak were produced every day, this task was overwhelming for experts participating in the investigation. In this work, we propose a Personalized Tweet Ranking algorithm for Epidemic Intelligence (PTR4EI), that provides users a personalized, short list of tweets based on the user's context. PTR4EI is based on a learning to rank framework and exploits as features, complementary context information extracted from the social hash-tagging behavior in Twitter. Our experimental evaluation on a dataset, collected in real-time during the EHEC outbreak, shows the superior ranking performance of PTR4EI. We believe our work can serve as a building block for an open early warning system based on Twitter, helping to realize the vision of Epidemic Intelligence for the Crowd, by the Crowd.
