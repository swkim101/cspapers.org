The paper reports an application of a special class of non-group cellular automata, referred to as D1/sup */CA, as the test machine embedded in the FSM to be synthesized. The state transition properties of D1/sup */CA are exploited in designing an easy testing scheme for the finite state machine. The scheme has been found to incur a small area overhead while providing extremely high coverages close to 100% for all single stuck-at faults in the circuit.
