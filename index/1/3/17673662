Most of the analysis of buffer sharing schemes has been aimed at obtaining the optimal operational parameters under stationary load situations. It is well known that in most operating environments the traffic load changes. In this paper, we address the problem of updating buffer allocation as the traffic load at a network node changes. We investigate the behavior of a complete partitioning buffer sharing scheme to gain insight into the dependency of the throughput upon system parameters. The summary of the analysis is presented in the form of a heuristic. The heuristic is shown to perform reasonably well under two different types of stress tests.
