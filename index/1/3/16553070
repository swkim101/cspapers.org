An outlier is an object that is considerably dissimilar with the remainder of the dataset. In this paper, we first propose the notion of centrality and center-proximity as novel outlierness measures which can be considered to represent the characteristics of all of the objects in the dataset. We then propose a graph-based outlier detection method which can solve the problems of local density, micro-cluster, and fringe objects. Finally, through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
