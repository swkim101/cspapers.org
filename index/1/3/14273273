In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generating a Yahoo!-like topic hierarchy for organizing Web images from users' perspectives. Relatively little effort has been devoted towards providing such a taxonomy simultaneously considering users' image requests for semantic and visual information. Based on the characteristic that a Web-image query may be refined by various attributes, the proposed approach hierarchically groups similar queries from search engine logs into topic classes at different semantic levels. The generated topic hierarchy has the advantages of organizing image data from users' perspectives for browsing, searching, annotation and users' needs analysis.A series of experiments have been conducted on real-world image search engine logs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible to generate topic hierarchies for Web images. Moreover, the generated hierarchy has been successfully applied to analysis of users' search interests, which have more focuses on some specific domains when compared with document requests.
