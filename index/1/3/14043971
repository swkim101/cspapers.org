This paper presents a computational method for calculating the shortest path along the surface of a product assembly between two components. The goal of this method is to check whether or not there is sufficient distance between two electrical components to prevent the occurrence of a spark between them. Our approach is an approximating method using a discrete weighted graph. To improve accuracy we have added two methods, geometric improvement and K-shortest path. Through experiments, we show that our method is effective for the quality assurance of electric components.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
