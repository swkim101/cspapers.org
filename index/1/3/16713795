The demand of storage space for electronic medical records is an issue for patient record digitalization. Mass storage and reliability of the cloud system do offer one solution for electronic medical records. However, cloud computing has significant implications for the privacy of patient information as well as for the confidentiality of hospitals. In this paper we present a new method of storing electronic medical records distributed at two different clouds and a local site using RAID-3 algorithm. By RAID-3, the segmented data stored at each cloud is meaningless and cannot be used alone. This will enhance the security of data then protect the privacy of patients. A prototype is implemented. Using 332K medical data as a benchmark to upload, in average, it takes 1.94 seconds and 3.69 seconds for the cloud storages, respectively.
