Let M be a parallel RAM with p processors and arithmetic operations addition and subtraction recognizing L ⊂ N n in T steps. (Inputs for M are given integer by integer, not bit by bit.) Then L can be recognized by a (sequential) linear search algorithm (LSA) in O ( n 4 (log( n ) + T + log( p ))) steps. Thus many n -dimensional restrictions of NP-complete problems (binary programming, traveling salesman problem, etc.) and even that of the uniquely optimum traveling salesman problem, which is Δ P 2 -complete, can be solved in polynomial time by an LSA. This result generalizes the construction of a polynomial LSA for the n -dimensional restriction of the knapsack problem previously shown by the author, and destroys the hope of proving nonpolynomial lower bounds on LSAs for any problem that can be recognized by a PRAM as above with 2 poly( n ) processors in poly( n ) time.
