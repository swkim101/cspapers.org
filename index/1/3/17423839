This paper addresses the problem of a 5-fingered hand manipulating a polyhedron. In particular, assuming frictional point contacts, we present an approach for computing a sequence of finger repositioning that allows the hand to switch from one grasping configuration to another while maintaining a force-closure grasp of the polyhedron during the entire process. The proposed approach captures ability to switch from one grasp to another in a graph structure, allowing regrasp planning to be reduced to a graph search problem. The proposed approach is implemented and preliminary results are presented.
