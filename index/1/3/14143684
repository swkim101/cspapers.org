Applications of Semantic Web technologies often require the management of metalevel information--that is, information that provides additional detail about domain-level information, such as provenance or access rights policies. Existing OWL-based tools provide little or no support for the representation and management of metalevel information. To fill this gap, we propose a framework based on metaviews--ontologies that describe facts in the application domain. We have implemented our framework in the KAON2 reasoner, and have successfully applied it in a nontrivial scenario.
