Most interesting machine tasks, e.g., visual pattern recognition, require large complex systems. Conventional machine designs are not well suited to the reliability demands of large complex systems. Many designs, conceived and tested on a small scale, and theoretically extendable to large scale systems, are still awkward and impractical as a large scale system because reliability appears to vary inversely with the number of components. Animal systems seem to have solved this problem and offer some hope for understanding the problem of how to build large complex systems with high reliablity. 
 
In particular animal systems seem to tolerate a great deal of component variation and noise. It is suggested that animal systems represent designs that actually take advantage of noise, unlike conventional machines, and that some of these animal systems may provide techniques which are applicable to the problem of constructing reliable machines from unreliable components.
