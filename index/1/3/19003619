To accomplish it, we propose ageneralized AUC (GAUC) to quantify the ranking performance ofpotential links (including positive, negative, and unknown statuslinks) in partially observed signed social networks. In addition, wedevelop a novel link recommendation algorithm by directly optimizingthe GAUC loss. We conduct experimental studies based upon Wikipedia,MovieLens, and Slashdot; our results demonstrate the effectivenessand the efficiency of the proposed approach.
