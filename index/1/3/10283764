Grid computing environments need secure resource control and predictable service quality in order to be sustainable. We propose a grid hosting model in which independent, self-contained grid deployments run within isolated containers on shared resource provider sites. Sites and hosted grids interact via an underlying resource control plane to manage a dynamic binding of computational resources to containers. We present a prototype grid hosting system, in which a set of independent globus grids share a network of cluster sites. Each grid instance runs a coordinator that leases and configures cluster resources for its grid on demand. Experiments demonstrate adaptive provisioning of cluster resources and contrast job-level and container-level resource management in the context of two grid application managers
