We propose a unifying framework for nonmonotonic logics, which subsumes previously published systems, and at the same time is very simple. We discuss some of the technicalities of the new general framework, illustrate briefly how some previous systems are special cases of it, and finish an informal discussion of the intuitive meaning of nonmonotonic inferences.
