The design of a general knowledge base for labeled graphs is presented. The design involves a partial ordering of graphs represented as subsets of nodes of a universal graph. The knowledge base's capabilities of fast retrieval and self-organization are a result of its ability to recognize common patterns among its data items. The system is being used to support a knowledge base in Organic Chemistry.
