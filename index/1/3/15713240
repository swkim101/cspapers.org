Small XML elements are often estimated relevant by the retrieval model but they are not desirable retrieval units. This paper presents a generic model that exploits the information obtained from small elements. We identify relationships between small and relevant elements and use this linking information to reinforce the relevance of other elements before removing the small ones. Our experiments using the INEX testbed show the effectiveness of our approach.
