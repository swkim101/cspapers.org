A new reinforcement learning architecture for nonlinear control is proposed. A direct feedback controller, or the actor, is trained by a value-gradient based controller, or the tutor. This architecture enables both efficient use of the value function and simple computation for real-time implementation. Good performance was verified in multi-dimensional nonlinear control tasks using Gaussian softmax networks.
