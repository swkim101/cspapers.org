Many existing clustering algorithms have good clustering performances, yet fail in producing balanced clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method for clustering, referred to as the Balanced Clustering with Least Square regression (BCLS), to minimize the least square linear regression, with a balance constraint to regularize the clustering model. In BCLS, the linear regression is applied to estimate the class-specific hyperplanes that partition each class of data from others, thus guiding the clustering of the data points into different clusters. A balance constraint is utilized to regularize the clustering, by minimizing which can help produce balanced clusters. In addition, we apply the method of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) to help optimize the objective model. The experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only produces good clustering performance but also guarantees a balanced clustering result.
