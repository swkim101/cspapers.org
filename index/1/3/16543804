Since October 1985, the automatic indexing system AIR/PHYS has been used in the input production of the physics data base of the Fachinformationsentrum Karlsruhe/West Germany. The texts to be indexed are abstracts written in English. The system of descriptors is prescribed. For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described. Finally, the conditions of the application as well as problems of further development are discussed.
