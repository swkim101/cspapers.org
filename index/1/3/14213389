We present a system that leverages physical layer features to combat Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) in low-power wireless networks. Our system incorporates: (i) a lightweight interference detection mechanism for low-power radios that recognizes the type of interference in the received signal, (ii) a lightweight error detection mechanism to estimate and characterize error patterns within interfered packets, and (iii) a CTI-aware protocol that dynamically adapts transmission and recovery mode to the current interference patterns. We implement a prototype of our system for the low-power IEEE 802.15.4 in software-defined radios (SDR). Our early results of the system components demonstrate that we can achieve a high accuracy in error detection and interference type identification. Moreover, we observed a significant performance improvement compared to the standard 802.15.4 systems without interference-awareness.
