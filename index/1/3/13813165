Single cell analysis has attracted much attention for revealing detailed and localized biological information. A local environmental control technique is desired when analyzing the detailed and localized properties of single cells. In this paper, we propose a local environmental stimulation system with micro dual-pipettes to stimulate the local reagent concentration dynamically, freely and automatically. When the local environment is controlled with chemical stimuli, the chemical solution is diffused and affects other objects. The local environment stimulation system with micro dual-pipettes can solve this problem by using spout pipette and suction pipette. As a cell analysis system, system quantification is necessary, so we try to realize it using a fluorescent substance. First step, we try to measure and control the light intensity. As an application of the system, the system can construct two-dimensional cell-organization by peeling off certain area of cell-sheet. Therefore, we try to control the area of peeling off cells using the system.
