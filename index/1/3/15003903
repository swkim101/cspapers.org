An essential feature of intelligent sensory processing is the ability to focus on the part of the signal of interest against a background of distracting signals, and to be able to direct this focus at will. In this paper the problem of auditory scene segmentation is considered and a model of the early stages of the process is proposed. The behaviour of the model is shown to be in agreement with a number of well known psychophysical results. The principal contribution of this model lies in demonstrating how streaming might result from interactions between the tonotopic patterns of activity of input signals and traces of previous activity which feedback and influence the way in which subsequent signals are processed.
