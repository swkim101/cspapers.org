Thwarting the severe threat posed by the voluminous malware variants demands effective, yet efficient, techniques for malware classification. Although machine learning offers a promising approach to automating malware classification, existing methods are oblivious of the costs associated with the different types of errors in malware classification, i.e., false positive errors and false negative errors. Such treatment adversely affects later applications of per-family malware analysis such as trend analysis. Against this backdrop, we propose a unified cost-sensitive framework for automated malware classification. This framework enforces the Neyman-Pearson criterion, which aims to maximize the detection rate under the constraint that the false positive rate should be no greater than a certain threshold. We develop a novel scheme to chain multiple Neyman-Pearson criteria on heterogeneous malware features, some of which may have missing values. Using a large malware dataset with labelled samples belonging to 12 families, we show that our method offers great flexibility in controlling different types of errors involved in malware classification and thus provides a valuable tool for malware defense.
