Mobile web browsing is experienced slow because of the limited rendering capability of the mobile devices, wireless latency, and incremental rendering of the page or resource loading. The browser renders resources in between two consecutive resource downloads. However, during this period, the wireless interfaces consume energy doing nothing useful. In this work, we measure the performance of SPDY for mobile web browsing. We demonstrate that mobile devices waste energy by keeping the wireless network interface idle between consecutive resource downloads. We next show that by identifying the embedded resources in a web page and downloading those resources in parallel at the very beginning can reduce the small idle periods and thus energy consumption by 20-50%, depending on the wireless network type.
