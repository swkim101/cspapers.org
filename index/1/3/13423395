High-end computing is suffering a data deluge from experiments, simulations, and apparatus that creates overwhelming application dataset sizes. End-user workstations-despite more processing power than ever before-are ill-equipped to cope with such data demands due to insufficient secondary storage space and I/O rates. Meanwhile, a large portion of desktop storage is unused. We present the FreeLoader framework, which aggregates unused desktop storage space and I/O bandwidth into a shared cache/scratch space, for hosting large, immutable datasets and exploiting data access locality. Our experiments show that FreeLoader is an appealing low-cost solution to storing massive datasets, by delivering higher data access rates than traditional storage facilities. In particular, we present novel data striping techniques that allow FreeLoader to efficiently aggregate a workstationâ€™s network communication bandwidth and local I/O bandwidth. In addition, the performance impact on the native workload of donor machines is small and can be effectively controlled.
