We consider the classic scheduling/load balancing problems where there are m identical machines and n jobs, and each job should be assigned to some machine. Traditionally, the assignment of jobs to machines is measured by the makespan (maximum load) i.e., the L{sub {infinity}} norm of the assignment. An {epsilon}-approximation scheme was given by Hochbaum and Shmoys for minimizing the L{sub {infinity}} norm. In several applications, such as in storage allocation, a more appropriate measure is the sum of the squares of the loads (which is equivalent to the L{sub 2} norm). This problem was considered in who showed how to approximate the optimum value by a factor of about 1.04. In fact, a more general measure, which is the L, norm (for any p {ge} 1) t can also be approximated to some constant which may be as large as 3/2. We improve e these results by providing an c-approximation scheme for the general L{sub p} norm (and in particular for the L{sub 2} norm). We also consider the case of restricted assignment of unit jobs where we show how to find in polynomial time, a solution a which is optimal for all norms.
