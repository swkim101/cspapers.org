We present a new tongue input device, the tongue joystick, for use by an actor inside an articulated-head character costume. Using our device, the actor can maneuver through a dialogue tree, selecting clips of prerecorded audio to hold a conversation in the voice of the character. The device is constructed of silicone sewn with conductive thread, a unique method for creating rugged, soft, low-actuation force devices. This method has application for entertainment and assistive technology. We compare our device against other portable mouth input devices, showing it to be the fastest and most accurate in tasks mimicking our target application. Finally, we show early results of an actor inside an articulated-head costume using the tongue joystick to interact with a child.
