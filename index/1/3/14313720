In order to automate routine inspections in large industrial environments, a mobile robotic system is being developed in the RoboGasInspector project. The robot's sensor-head consists of different instruments for remote gas sensing using multiple measurement principles. This contribution focuses on Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS). The measurement device allows quantitative gas concentration measurements and achieves high sensitivity due to the active measurement principle. On the contrary, TDLAS systems measure the concentration along a path at a time and require a diffusely reflecting background. Using a pan-tilt unit, objects and areas can be scanned. This paper describes the triangulation-maximization leak-localizing strategy (Tri-Max) used in the project RoboGasInspector. Results based on outdoor experiments in two industrial plants and a landfill dump are presented.
