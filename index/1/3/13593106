We give improved approximations for two classical embedcling problems: (i) minimizing the number of crossings in a drawing of a bounded degree graph on the plane; and (ii) minimizing the VLSI layout area of a degree four graph. These improved algorithms can be applied to improve a variety of VLSI layout problems. Our results are as follows. (i) We compute a drawing on the plane of a bounded degree graph in which the sum of the numbers of vertices and crossings is O(log a n) times the optimal minimum sum. This is a logarithmic factor improvement relative to the best known result. (ii) We compute a VLSI layout of a degree four graph in a grid with constant aspect ratio the area of which is O(log 4 n I times the optimal minimum layout area. This is an O(log 2 n) improvement over the best known long standing result.
