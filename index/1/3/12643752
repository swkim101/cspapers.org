This course provides an overview of state-of-the-art concepts and problems associated with implementing a distributed processing system. It defines what constitutes a distributed system and discusses contemporary models of distributed systems. The tutorial describes case studies including Ethernet, HYPERchannel, NESTAR, CLUSTER BUS, and Ungerman-Bass NET-ONE systems. A survey of design issues associated with system software, interconnection topology, and new hardware concepts is presented before concluding with observations on future system concepts.
