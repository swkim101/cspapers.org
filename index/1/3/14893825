Spatial perception is a challenging task for people who are blind due to the limited functionality and sensing range of hands. We present GIST, a wearable gestural interface that offers spatial perception functionality through the novel appropriation of the user's hands into versatile sensing rods. Using a wearable depth-sensing camera, GIST analyzes the visible physical space and allows blind users to access spatial information about this space using different hand gestures. By allowing blind users to directly explore the physical space using gestures, GIST allows for the closest mapping between augmented and physical reality, which facilitates spatial interaction. A user study with eight blind users evaluates GIST in its ability to help perform everyday tasks that rely on spatial perception, such as grabbing an object or interacting with a person. Results of our study may help develop new gesture based assistive applications.
