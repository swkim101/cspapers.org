This paper describes an object-oriented language called MixJuice, which uses the differences of class hierarchies as a unit of information hiding and reuse. In this language, classes — templates of objects — and modules — units of information hiding and reuse — are completely orthogonal, thus supporting separation of concerns. MixJuice is basically based on Java. However, its module mechanism is simpler and more powerful than that of Java. The MixJuice programmers can make use of all Java libraries and execution platforms1.
