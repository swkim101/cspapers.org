We introduce in this work a novel approach for semantic indexing and mental image search. Given semantic concepts defined by few training examples, our formulation is transductive and learns a mapping from an initial ambient space, related to low level visual features, to an output space spanned by a well defined semantic basis where data can be easily explored. With this method, searching for a mental visual target reduces to scanning data according to their coordinates in the learned semantic space. We illustrate the proposed method through our graphical user interface "Spacious", for the purpose of visualization and interactive navigation in generic image databases and satellite images.
