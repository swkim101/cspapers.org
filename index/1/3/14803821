Steering-by-Wire system has received lot of attention in the recent years because of the development of vehicle stability control systems and intelligent vehicle highway systems. The variable structure controller based on the reference model with a drive model is insensitive to parameter variations so that the available control authority and the effect of Steering-by-Wire system on vehicle yaw response and side slip response is estimated using computer simulations. The results of simulink demonstrate the benefits of the proposed control method in terms of improved vehicle responses and reduced driver steering effort.
