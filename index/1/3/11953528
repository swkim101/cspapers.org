This paper describes MIMUS, a multimodal and multilingual dialogue system for the in--home scenario, which allows users to control some home devices by voice and/or clicks. Its design relies on Wizard of Oz experiments and is targeted at disabled users. MIMUS follows the Information State Update approach to dialogue management, and supports English, German and Spanish, with the possibility of changing language on--the--fly. MIMUS includes a gestures--enabled talking head which endows the system with a human--like personality.
