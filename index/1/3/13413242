According to the rapid growth of data volume, it's increasingly complicated to present and navigate large amount of data in a convenient method on mobile devices with a small screen. To address this challenge, we present a new method which displays cluster information in a hierarchy pattern and interact with them by eyes' movement captured by the front camera of mobile devices. The key of this system is providing users a new interacting method to navigate and select data quickly by eyes without any additional equipment.
