We present a natural language interface system which is based entirely on trained statistical models. The system consists of three stages of processing: parsing, semantic interpretation, and discourse. Each of these stages is modeled as a statistical process. The models are fully integrated, resulting in an end-to-end system that maps input utterances into meaning representation frames.
