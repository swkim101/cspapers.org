Enterprise search is challenging due to various reasons, notably the dynamic terminology and domain structure that are specific to the enterprise, combined with the fact that search deployments are typically managed by domain experts who are not necessarily search experts. To address that, it has been proposed to design search architectures that feature two principles: comprehensibility of the ranking mechanism and customizability of the search engine by means of intuitive runtime rules. The proposed demonstration operates on top of an engine implementation based on this search philosophy, and provides an administrator toolkit to realize the two principles. In particular, the toolkit provides a complete visualization of the provenance (hence ranking) of search results, embeds an editor for programming runtime rules, facilitates the investigation of (the cause of) missing or low-ranked desired results, and provides suggestions of rewrite rules to handle such results.
