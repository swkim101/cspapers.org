We extend the effective Hilbert irreducibility theorem concerning the reduction of a single multivariate polynomial to one concerning the reduction of an algebraic set, defined by a system of polynomials. The theorem provides the basis for efficient Monte Carlo computations on several problems related to an algebraic set. These include: determining its dimension, counting its components, checking radical ideal membership and equality of algebraic sets, computing the degree of a component, sampling points in a component, and finding a representative general point for each component.
