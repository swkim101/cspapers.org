Global performance of agricultural robots is discussed to design the structure system reasonably. First, problems of the theoretical field capacity are summarized. Then a new macroscopic working environmental model is proposed. Third, the theoretical field capacity is extended to solve the problems based on two fundamental equations of working space and working time. Finally the validity of the extended theoretical field capacity is confirmed by deriving two design guidelines for structure systems of agricultural robots.
