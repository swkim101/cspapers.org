This paper presents a novel framework for multimodal news data aggregation, retrieval and browsing. News aggregations are contextualised within automatically extracted information such as entities (i.e. persons, places and organisations), temporal span, categorical topics, social networks popularity and audience scores. Further resources coming from professional repositories, and related to the aggregation topics, can be accessed as well. The system is accessible through a Web interface supporting interactive navigation and exploration of large-scale collections of news stories at the topic and context levels. Users can select news topics and sub-topics interactively, building their personal paths towards worldwide events, main characters, dates and contents.
