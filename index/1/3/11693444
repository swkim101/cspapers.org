The signs of social relationship in balance theory is objective and undirected which cannot characterize participants' bidirectional subjective opinions on social relationships. By redefining the signs with the bidirectional opinions according to homogeneity principle, we extend the balance theory by measuring the opinions with interactive language. Initial experimental results on Enron emails shows that the extended model supports the homogeneity principle of balance theory and make it possible to use balance theory to predict the directed opinions besides undirected signs.
