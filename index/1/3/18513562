A string x is said to be decomposed into strings yl,Y2,...,yn if x is in y1 @@@@ y2 @@@@ ... @@@@ yn where @@@@ is the shuffle operator. We consider the problem of decomposing x into yl,Y2,...,yn such that yl,Y2,...,yn belong to predetermined languages L1,L2,...,Ln, respectively. Conditions under which such a decomposition is unique are presented as well as uniquely decomposable L1,L2,...,Ln which are of practical significance from the viewpoint of time-multiplexed communication.
