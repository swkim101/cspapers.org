Network delays and delay variations are two of the most important network performance metrics directly impacting real-time applications such as voice over IP and time-critical financial transactions. This importance is illustrated by past work on understanding the delay constancy of Internet paths and recent work on predicting network delays using virtual coordinate systems. Merely understanding currently observed delays is insufficient, as network performance can degrade not only due to traffic variability but also as a result of routing changes. Unfortunately this latter effect so far has been ignored in understanding and predicting delay related performance metrics of Internet paths. Our work is the first to address this short coming by systematically analyzing changes in network delays and jitter of a diverse and comprehensive set of Internet paths. Using empirical measurements, we illustrate that routing changes can result in roundtrip delay increase of converged paths by more than 1 second. Surprisingly, intradomain routing changes can also cause such large delay increase.
 Given these observations, we develop a framework to analyze in detail the impact of routing changes on network delays between end-hosts. Using topology information and properties associated with routing changes, we explain the causes for observed delay fluctuations and more importantly identify routing changes that lead to predictable effects on delay-related metrics. Using our framework, we study the predictability of delay and jitter changes in response to both passively observed interdomain and actively measured intradomain routing changes.
