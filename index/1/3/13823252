This paper looks into the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Smart Sustainable Cities (SSC). It specifically points towards ICT's potential to help cities mitigate climate change and to support a 2ÂºC or lower trajectory and to involve citizens in city planning and when implementing solutions. The paper also focuses on the modelling, assessment methodologies and indicators for ICT and sustainability aspects of cities, not least with regards to climate change mitigation. Especially, it highlights the city GG emissions assessment standard by ITU, and the indicator sets from ITU and ISO and their enhancement. The paper emphasizes a sustainability and citizen-centric perspective, seeing ICT as instrumental in this respect. For assessments, the above mentioned ITU-T standard is considered reusable for impacts beyond global warming. For indicators, further research on outcome and impact indicators is suggested, and also strengthening of the socio-economic and cultural aspects.
