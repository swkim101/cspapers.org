The latest and possibly fastest of the general factoring methods for large composite numbers is the quadratic sieve of Carl Pomerance. A variation of the algorithm is described and an implementation is suggested which combines the forces of a fast pipeline computer such as the Cray I, and a high speed highly parallel array processor such as the Goodyear MPP. A running time analysis, which is based on empirical data rather than asymptotic estimates, suggests that this method could be capable of factoring a 60 digit number in as little as 10 minutes and a 100 digit number is as little as 60 days of continuous computer time.
