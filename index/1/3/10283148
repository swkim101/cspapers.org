To realize the highest performance possible for a sequential processor, and to realize utilization of a large amount of existing software, an integrated Prolog processor (IPP) and its optimized compiler are now being developed.
A tagged architecture under constraints of a general purpose computer and a memory management strategy to achieve a high performance are discussed and then an IPP architecture is presented. Based on the Prolog instruction set, which is an extension of Warren's, the Prolog compiler introduces new functions such as indexing by the optimal argument and global register assignment across determinate built-in predicates.
The performance of the IPP for the append program is 1 million logical inferences per second, which is the highest possible for a sequential processor. In the 8-queen program a considerable speed-up is obtained by the new functions.
