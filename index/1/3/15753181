The performance characteristics of a reliable broadcast protocol in a local-area network environment are analyzed. This protocol involves a source broadcasting a message to all destinations and collecting replies from these destinations. Reliability is achieved by using Send-and-Wait protocols for transmitting broadcast and reply messages. A queueing model is developed and results on the throughput and delay of the broadcast operation are obtained by approximate analysis. Numerical results showing the effect of model parameters on throughput are provided.
