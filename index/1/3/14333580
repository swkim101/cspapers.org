In this paper by tracing the history of the programs and outlining the programs themselves, a comparison will be made of the factors that lead to the creation and development of a computer science program in a large state university and in a small liberal arts college. In the first case the program leads to a baccalaureate degree in computer science. In the second it is a branch of the mathematics curriculum.
 Along with the factors of educational philosophy environmental factors such as the relationship of the department to the institution, equipment desired and available, the relationship to the computer center and facilities for faculty development will be considered.
