In this paper, we present a novel Chinese language model, and study its applications, in particular in Chinese pinyin-to-character conversion. In the new model, each word is associated with supporting context constructed by mining the frequent sets of nearby phrases and their distances to the word. Such information was usually overlooked in previous n-gram model and its variants. We apply the model to Chinese pinyin-to-character conversion and find that it offers a better solution to Chinese input. The model has lower perplexity in our evaluation and higher prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art n-gram Markov model for Chinese language.
