A representation for intersecting and crossing families of sets is presented. Its size for a family on n elements is O(nz), compared to O(G) for previous representations. Efficient algorithms to construct the representation are given. For example on a network of n vertices and m edges, the representation of all minimum cuts uses O(mlog (G/m)) space; it is constructed in O(nm log (nz/m)) time (this is the best-known time for finding one minimum cut). The representation is used to improve several submodular flow algorithms. For example a minimum-cost dijoin can be found in time O(nzm); as a result a minimum-cost planar feedback arc set can be found in time O(G). The previous bestknown time bounds for these two problems are a factor n larger. The representation is based on a separator theorem for intersecting families.
