We propose a local, generative model for similarity-based classification. The method is applicable to the case that only pairwise similarities between samples are available. The classifier models the local class-conditional distribution using a maximum entropy estimate and empirical moment constraints. The resulting exponential class conditional-distributions are combined with class prior probabilities and misclassification costs to form the local similarity discriminant analysis (local SDA) classifier. We compare the performance of local SDA to a non-local version, to the local nearest centroid classifier, the nearest centroid classifier, k-NN, and to the recently-developed potential support vector machine (PSVM). Results show that local SDA is competitive with k-NN and the computationally-demanding PSVM while offering the advantages of a generative classifier.
