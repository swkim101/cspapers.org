The World Wide Web (WWW) has become a major platform for hosting, discovering, and composing web services. Web service clustering is a technique for efficiently facilitating web service discovery. Most web service clustering approaches are based on suitable semantic similarity distance measure and a threshold. Threshold selection is essentially difficult and often leads to unsatisfactory accuracy. In this paper we propose a taxonomic clustering algorithm for grouping functionally similar web services. We have tested the algorithm on both simulation based randomly generated test data and the standard OWL-S TC test data set. We have observed promising results both in terms of accuracy and performance.
