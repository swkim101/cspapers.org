Event Registry is a system that can analyze news articles and identify in them mentioned world events. The system is able to identify groups of articles that describe the same event. It can identify groups of articles in different languages that describe the same event and represent them as a single event. From articles in each event it can then extract event's core information, such as event location, date, who is involved and what is it about. Extracted information is stored in a database. A user interface is available that allows users to search for events using extensive search options, to visualize and aggregate the search results, to inspect individual events and to identify related events.
