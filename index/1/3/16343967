Although humans present a natural ability to deal with knowledge about time and events, the codification and use of such knowledge in information systems still pose many problems. Hence, the development of applications strongly based on temporal reasoning remains a hard and complex task. Furthermore, albeit the last significant developments in temporal reasoning and representation (TRR) area, there still is a considerable gap for its successful use in practical applications. In this chapter we present VERITAS, a tool that focus time maintenance, that is one of the most important processes in the engineering of the time during the development of KBS. The verification and validation (VV special emphasis is given to the tool architecture and to the method used in anomaly detection. Finally, in section 5, achieved results are discussed and in section 6, we present some conclusions and ideas for future work.
