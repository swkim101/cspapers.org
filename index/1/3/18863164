Driven to create intuitive computing interfaces throughout our everyday space, various state-of-the-art technologies have been proposed for near-surface localization of a user's finger input such as hover or touch. However, these works require specialized hardware not commonly available, limiting the adoption of such technologies. We present SymmetriSense, a technology enabling near-surface 3-dimensional fingertip localization above arbitrary glossy surfaces using a single commodity camera device such as a smartphone. SymmetriSense addresses the localization challenges in using a single regular camera by a novel technique utilizing the principle of reflection symmetry and the fingertip's natural reflection casted upon surfaces like mirrors, granite countertops, or televisions. SymmetriSense achieves typical accuracies at sub-centimeter levels in our localization tests with dozens of volunteers and remains accurate under various environmental conditions. We hope SymmetriSense provides a technical foundation on which various everyday near-surface interactivity can be designed.
