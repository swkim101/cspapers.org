Due to poor signal strength, multipath effects, and limited on-device computation power, common GPS receivers do not work indoors. This work addresses these challenges by using a steerable, high-gain directional antenna as the front-end of a GPS receiver along with a robust signal processing step and a novel location estimation technique to achieve direct GPS-based indoor localization. By leveraging the computing power of the cloud, we accommodate longer signals for acquisition, and remove the requirement of decoding timestamps or ephemeris data from GPS signals. We have tested our system in 31 randomly chosen spots inside five single-story, indoor environments such as stores, warehouses and shopping centers. Our experiments show that the system is capable of obtaining location fixes from 20 of these spots with a median error of less than 10 m, where all normal GPS receivers fail.
