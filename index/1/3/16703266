We prove that for an arbitrarily small constant ε>0, assuming NP⊈ DTIME (2<sup>log<sup>O 1-ε</sup> n</sup>), the preprocessing versions of the closest vector problem and the nearest codeword problem are hard to approximate within a factor better than 2<sup>log<sup>1-ε</sup> n</sup>. This improves upon the previous hardness factor of (log n)<sup>δ</sup> for some δ>0 due to [AKKV05].
