Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been proposed in literature to overcome modularization shortcomings such as the tyranny of the dominant decomposition. However, the new language constructs introduced by AOP also raise new issues on their own-one of them is potential interference among aspects. In this paper we present an interference criterion to detect and thus help programmers to avoid advice order related problems
