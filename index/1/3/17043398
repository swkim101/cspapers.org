We propose a solution to problems involving temporal projection and explanation (e.g., the Yale shooting problem) based on the idea that whether a situation is abnormal should not depend upon historical information about how the situation arose. We apply these ideas both to the Yale shooting scenario and to a blocks world domain that needs to address the qualification problem.
