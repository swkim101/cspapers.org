This paper describes a complete VLSI design system on a small computer, that will provide a powerful but flexible design aid for most projected technologies into the 1990's. The paper describes existing design methods, highlighting the shortcomings of these methods. The advantages and disadvantages of a system that maintains the connectivity information through the complete design are discussed. Solutions to these disadvantages are proposed, and a description of how these are incorporated into a small computer CAD system is given.
