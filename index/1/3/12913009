This work introduces a model free approach to sentence compression, which grew out of ideas from Nomoto (2008), and examines how it compares to a state-of-art model intensive approach known as Tree-to-Tree Transducer, or T3 (Cohn and Lapata, 2008). It is found that a model free approach significantly outperforms T3 on the particular data we created from the Internet. We also discuss what might have caused T3's poor performance.
