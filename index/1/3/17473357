This paper presents some recent results obtained from using simulation to evaluate computer system performance when alternative job priority assignment algorithms are considered. Performance data are given for both individual computing centers and network computers.* A “pay-for priority” scheduling algorithm for the individual centers is explored and load leveling techniques for transmitting jobs between centers are evaluated. The effects of these algorithms on system performance are demonstrated through the use of a simulation model.
