We aimed to develop an active catheter that could be used safely in human blood vessels. We proposed and developed a micro valve for a water pressure-driven system with multi-degrees of freedom, to produce an active catheter that is compact and not driven electrically. In this paper, we proposed a new method that uses pressure pulses to control the bending angle of the active segment. We experimentally verified this control method using the new valve design.
