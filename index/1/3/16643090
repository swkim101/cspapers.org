Behavioural aspects ot Information Systems are nou taken. into account in a lot of Conceptual Hodels. However. the behavioural concepts ot these liodels have rarely been fully irpleaented in DIMS. RUBIS is an extended Relational DBtlS which supports an extended relational schema (including event and operation concepts) and automatic control ot the dynamic aspects of Applications, i.e event recognition, operation triggering and tire handling. After a short presentation of the basic concepts and the specification language used for the ertended Schema, we focus on tuo internal rechanisms : the Temporal Processor, which ranages the temporal aspects of specifications and recognizes temporal events, the Event Processor, which manages events treatment and synchronization. These tuo mechanisms permit an autoaatic execution of the extended schera and so provide rapid prototyping capabilities.
