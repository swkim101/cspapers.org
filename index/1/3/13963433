We present the novel kinematics, workspace characterization, functional prototype and impedance control of a six degrees of freedom haptic interface designed to train surgeons for laparoscopic procedures, through virtual reality simulations. The parallel kinematics of the device is constructed by connecting a 3RRP planar parallel mechanism to a linearly actuated modified delta mechanism with a connecting link. The configuration level forward and inverse kinematics of the device assume analytic solutions, while its workspace can be shaped to enable large end-effector translations and rotations, making it well-suited for laparoscopy operations. Furthermore, the haptic interface features a low apparent inertia with high structural stiffness, thanks to its parallel kinematics with grounded actuators. A model-based open-loop impedance controller with feed-forward gravity compensation has been implemented for the device and various virtual tissue/organ stiffness levels have been rendered.
