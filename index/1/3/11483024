This paper presents a curriculum consisting of a collection of subjects to prepare students for a career in "software development" while remaining within the scope normal for a major in a broad liberal arts degree. We describe the principles behind the construction of the curriculum, and contrast it with the more extensive "Software Engineering Body of Knowledge" appropriate in a professional Engineering degree.
