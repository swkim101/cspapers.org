Physically based rendering is the process of generating a 2D image from the abstract description of a 3D Scene. Despite the development of various new techniques and algorithms, the computational requirements of generating photorealistic images still do not allow to render in real time. Moreover, the configuration of good render quality parameters is very difficult and often too complex to be done by nonexpert users. This paper describes a novel approach called MAgarRO (standing for "Multi-Agent AppRoach to Rendering Optimization") which utilizes principles and techniques known from the field of multi-agent systems to optimize the rendering process. Experimental results are presented which show the benefits of MAgarRO -based rendering optimization.
