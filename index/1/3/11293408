Constrained objects are objects whose state is regulated by constraints. They are applicable in many domains, e.g., engineering and organizational modeling. Our proposed language (Cob) supports class hierarchies, constraints, and preferences; and our computational model supports constraint satisfaction, optimization and relaxation. Constrained objects are thus a declarative approach to object-oriented programming.
