Sensor networks have been used in a wide range of applications. Considerable research effort is currently devoted to design protocols that allow networks of inexpensive sensors to perform reliable remote control and monitoring functions, in spite of the limitations of each device.
 Our objective is to demonstrate a fully software implementation of the so called Pulse Coupled Oscillator Protocol, proposed in [2, 6] for the decentralized synchronization of radio devices. The PCO protocol is inspired by a model found in mathematical biology [5]. It is decentralized, scalable and simple, as we will show in our demonstration.
