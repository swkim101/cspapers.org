Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation flight can vastly increase operational range and persistence through autonomous aerial refuelling or efficient flight on a wingman's wake vortices. Differencing individual UAV state estimates is not sufficiently accurate for close formation operations and must be augmented with vehicle-to-vehicle observations. To this end, we propose a quaternion based unscented Kalman filter to fuse information from each UAV sensor suite with relative vision observations. The result is a vastly improved relative state estimate that is resilient to brief vision dropouts and degrades gracefully during extended dropouts. Simulated formation flight results validate the approach and provide a numerical analysis of the algorithm performance. Ground based experiments demonstrate the algorithm running in real-time on a dual-UAV system. This represents a significant step towards an airborne implementation.
