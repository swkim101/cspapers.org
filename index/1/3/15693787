We consider localitg-preserving hashing — in which adjacent points in the domain are mapped to adjacent or nearlyadjacent points in the range — when the domain is a ddimensional cube. This problem has applications to highdimensional search and multimedia indexing. We show that simple and natural classes of hash functions are provably good for this problem. We complement this with lower bounds suggesting that our results are essentially the best possible.
