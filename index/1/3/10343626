In this paper, we propose strategies for merging occupancy probabilities of target existence in multi-UAV cooperative search. The objective is to determine the impact of cooperation and type of information exchange on search time and detection errors. To this end, we assume that small-scale UAVs (e.g., quadrotors) with communication range limitations move in a given search region following pre-defined paths to locate a single stationary target. Local occupancy grids are used to represent target existence, to update its belief with local observations and to merge information from other UAVs. Our merging strategies perform Bayes updates of the occupancy probabilities while considering realistic limitations in sensing, communication and UAV movement - all of which are important for small-scale UAVs. Our simulation results show that information merging achieves a reduction in mission time from 27% to 70% as the number of UAVs grows from 2 to 5.
