In this paper, we introduce the Significant One Counting problem. Let ε and θ be respectively some user-specified error bound and threshold. The input of the problem is a stream of bits. We need to maintain some data structure that allows us to estimate the number of 1-bits in a sliding window of size <i>n</i> such that whenever there are at least θ<i>n</i> 1-bits in the window, the relative error of the estimate is guaranteed to be at most ε. When θ 1/<i>n</i>, our problem becomes the Basic Counting problem proposed by Datar <i>et al.</i> [<i>ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms</i> (2002), pp. 635--644]. We prove that any data structure for the Significant One Counting problem must use at least Ω(1/ε log<sup>2</sup> 1/θ + log ε θ<i>n</i>) bits of memory. We also design a data structure for the problem that matches this memory bound and supports constant query and update time. Note that for fixed θ and ε, our data structure uses <i>O</i>(log <i>n)</i> bits of memory, while any data structure for the Basic Counting problem needs Ω(log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>) bits in the worst case.
