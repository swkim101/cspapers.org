While multiple methods to extend the expressiveness of tangible interaction have been proposed, e. g., self-motion, stacking and transparency, providing haptic feedback to the tangible prop itself has rarely been considered. In this poster we present a semi-actuated, nano-powered, tangible prop, which is able to provide programmable friction for interaction with a tabletop setup. We have conducted a preliminary user study evaluating the users' acceptance for the device and their ability to detect changes in the programmed level of friction and received some promising results.
