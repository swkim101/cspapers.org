Modular integer exponentiation (given a, e, and m. compute a’ mod m) is a fundamental problem in algebraic complexity for which no efficient parallel algorithm is known. TLvo closely related problems are modular polynomial exponentiation (given a(z), e, and m(z), compute (a(z))e mod m(z)) and polynomial exponentiation (given a(z), e. and 2, compute the coefficient of zt in (a(z))“). It is shown that these latter two problems are in nfC2 when a(z) and m(z) are polynomials over a finite field whose characteristic is polynomial in the input size.
