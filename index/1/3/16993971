Virtual machines in the cloud typically run existing general-purpose operating systems such as Linux. We notice that the cloudâ€™s hypervisor already provides some features, such as isolation and hardware abstraction, which are duplicated by traditional operating systems, and that this duplication comes at a cost. We present the design and implementation of OS, a new guest operating system designed specifically for running a single application on a virtual machine in the cloud. It addresses the duplication issues by using a lowoverhead library-OS-like design. It runs existing applications written for Linux, as well as new applications written for OS. We demonstrate that OS is able to efficiently run a variety of existing applications. We demonstrate its sub-second boot time, small OS image and how it makes more memory available to the application. For unmodified network-intensive applications, we demonstrate up to 25% increase in throughput and 47% decrease in latency. By using non-POSIX network APIs, we can further improve performance and demonstrate a 290% increase in Memcached throughput.
