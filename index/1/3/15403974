Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular technique for solving large-scale machine learning problems. In order to parallelize SGD on multi-core machines, asynchronous SGD (Hogwild!) has been proposed, where each core updates a global model vector stored in a shared memory simultaneously, without using explicit locks. We show that the scalability of Hogwild! on modern multi-socket CPUs is severely limited, especially on NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) system, due to the excessive cache invalidation requests and false sharing. In this paper we propose a novel decentralized asynchronous SGD algorithm called HogWild++ that overcomes these drawbacks and shows almost linear speedup on multi-socket NUMA systems. The main idea in HogWild++ is to replace the global model vector with a set of local model vectors that are shared by a cluster (a set of cores), keep them synchronized through a decentralized token-based protocol that minimizes remote memory access conflicts and ensures convergence. We present the design and experimental evaluation of HogWild++ on a variety of datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art parallel SGD implementations in terms of efficiency and scalability.
