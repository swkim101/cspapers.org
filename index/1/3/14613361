This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for decremental maintenance of the transitive closure in a directed graph. The algorithm processes any sequence of edge deletions in <i>O</i>(<i>mn</i>) time and answers queries in constant time. Until now such time bound has only been achieved by a randomized Las Vegas algorithm.
 In addition to that, a few decremental algorithms for maintaining strongly connected components are shown, whose time complexity is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1.5</sup>) for planar graphs, <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) for graphs with bounded treewidth and <i>O</i>(<i>mn</i>) for general digraphs.
