Measurement, collection, and interpretation of network usage data commonly involves multiple stage of sampling and aggregation. Examples include sampling packets, aggregating them into flow statistics at a router, sampling and aggregation of usage records in a network data repository for reporting, query and archiving. Although unbiased estimates of packet, bytes and flows usage can be formed for each sampling operation, for many applications it is crucial to know the inherent estimation error. Previous work in this area has been limited mainly to analyzing the estimator variance for particular methods, e.g., independent packet sampling. However, the variance is of limited use for more general sampling methods, where the estimate may not be well approximated by a Gaussian distribution.
 This motivates our paper, in which we establish Chernoff bounds on the likelihood of estimation error in a general multistage combination of measurement sampling and aggregation. We derive the scale against which errors are measured, in terms of the constituent sampling and aggregation operations. In particular this enables us to obtain rigorous confidence intervals around any given estimate. We apply our method to a number of sampling schemes both in the literature and currently deployed, including sampling of packet sampled NetFlow records, Sample and Hold, and Flow Slicing. We obtain one particularly striking result in the first case: that for a range of parameterizations, packet sampling has no additional impact on the estimator confidence derived from our bound, beyond that already imposed by flow sampling.
