Theoretical and empirical analysis are equally important methods to understand election attacks. I discuss my recent work on domain restrictions on partial preferences and on new election attacks. I propose further study into modeling realistic election attacks and the advancement of the current state of empirical analysis of their hardness by using more advanced statistical techniques.
