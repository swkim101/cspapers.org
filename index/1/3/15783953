This empirical study attempts to find answers to the question of how a natural language (henceforth NL) system could resolve attachment of prepositional phrases (henceforth PPs) by examining naturally occurring PP attachments in typed dialogue. Examination includes testing predictive powers of existing attachment theories against the data. The result of this effort will be an algorithm for interpreting PP attachment.
