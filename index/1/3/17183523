In this paper, we propose mm-Waves for Near-Field IoT, ultra-low power transceivers. With small footprint and no external components, the transceivers could be integrated with the sensors, with the wireless sensor nodes organized in a Master-Slave, asymmetrical network. With low complexity and high energy efficiency, the slave nodes benefit from a minimalist design approach with integrated antennas and integrated resonators for absolute frequency accuracy. Two designs are presented. The first is a K-band, super-regenerative, logarithmic-mode, OOK receiver achieving a peak energy efficiency of 200pJ/bit at 4Mb/s and a BER of 10-3. With 800μW peak and 8μW average power, the sensitivity of the receiver is -60dBm for the same data and bit-error rates. Realized in a 65nm CMOS process from GF, the active area of the receiver is 740×670μm2. The second design is a 100Kb/s, V-band transceiver with integrated antenna. It achieves 20pJ/bit energy efficiency (Rx mode) and it provides means for 1/f noise mitigation.
