Engineering optimization methods for new product development model consumer demand as a function of product attributes and price in order to identify designs t hat maximize expected profit. However, prior approaches have ign ored the ability of competitors to react to a new product en trant; thus these methods can overestimate expected profit and select suboptimal designs that perform poorly in a competi tive market. We propose an efficient approach to new product design accounting for competitor pricing reactions by impo sing Nash and Stackelberg conditions as constraints, and we t est the method on three product design case studies from th e marketing and engineering design literature. We find that a S tackelberg leader strategy generates higher profit than a Nash strategy. Both strategies are superior to ignoring competitor reactions: In our case studies, ignoring price competition result s in overestimation of profits by 12%-79%, and accounting for price competition increases realized profits by up to 3.4 %. The efficiency, convergence stability, and ease of impl ementation of the proposed approach enables practical implementation for new product design problems in competitive markets.
