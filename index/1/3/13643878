This paper introduces a novel technique for integrating geometry from physical objects into computer aided design (CAD) software. We allow users to copy arbitrary real world object geometry into 2D CAD designs at scale through the use of a camera/projector system. This paper also introduces a system, CopyCAD, that uses this technique, and augments a Computer Controlled (CNC) milling machine. CopyCAD gathers input from physical objects, sketches and interactions directly on a milling machine, allowing novice users to copy parts of real world objects, modify them and then create a new physical part.
