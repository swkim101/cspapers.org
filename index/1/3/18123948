This paper describes the research activity on dataflow computing in Japan focusing on dataflow computer development at the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL). First, the history of dataflow computer development in Japan is outlined. Some distinguished milestones in the history are mentioned in detail. Second, two types of dataflow computing systems developed at ETL, SIGMA-1 and EM-4, are described with their research goals. The fundamental characteristics of the both systems are given and some comparisons are made. Finally, future problems toward new generation computer systems to meet the challenge of Tera FLOPS machines are discussed.
