Most schools that offer Master’s Degrees in Computer Science require some sort of culminating experience. Typically these experiences consist of a full fledged master’s thesis or project, an examination based on certain core courses, or a “capstone” course. The Hartford Graduate Center offers an unusual, perhaps unique, culminating experien ce. Students in the final year of their master’s program are required to take a one credit course called Computer Science Seminar. Over the course of the year the students attend six presentations by leaders in their re spective areas of computer science. Concurren tly, they work on modest sized (20 doublespaced pages) original or expository research papers. These papers are thoroughly reviewed by the faculty, and may be revised multiple times. At the end of the academic year, a conference is held at which each student presents his/her paper. Proceedings of the conference are published and a copy given to each st udent.
