Reservation-based channel access has been shown to be effective in providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees (e.g., timeliness) in wireless embedded real-time applications such as mobile media streaming and networked embedded control systems. While the QoS scheduling at the central authority (i.e., base station) has received extensive attention recently, the computation of resource requirements at each individual node has been widely ignored. An inappropriate resource requirement may lead to degraded support for real-time traffic and overprovisioning of scarce network resources. This work addresses this issue by presenting a strategy for nodes to determine minimal resource reservations that guarantee the real-time constraints of their network traffic. In addition, this paper examines the relationship between timeliness constraints of the traffic and resource requirements.
