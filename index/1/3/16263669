We demonstrate a method for partitioning a large lexicon into small equivalence classes, based on sequential phonetic and prosodic constraints. The representation is attractive for speech recognition systems because it allows all but a small number of word candidates to be excluded, using only gross phonetic and prosodic information. The approach is a robust one in that the representation is relatively insensitive to phonetic variability and recognition error.
