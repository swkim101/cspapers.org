This paper designs a new five-fingered robotic hand with a camera. Several morphological features of the human hand are integrated to improve the appearance of the hand. The drive system of this hand is under-actuated to eliminate the weight of the hand and to embed all the actuators inside the palm. Despite of this under-actuation, this hand can grasp objects in several different ways. In addition, the two different transmissions are adopted to drive the fingers according to their roles. These transmissions help not only to improve drive efficiency but also to secure the space of the embedded camera.
