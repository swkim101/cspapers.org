This paper describes the tests made on chunking methods used for
plagiarism detection. The result of the tests makes it possible to
decide on the best fitting chunking method for a given
application. For example, overlapping word chunking is good for
a grammar analyzer or for small databases, sentence chunking
suits best for finding quoted texts, hashed breakpoint chunking is
the fastest method therefore advisable for search in big set of
documents, or if more reliability is needed overlapping hashed
breakpoint chunking can be used as well.
