The floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) discipline is analyzed in networks with hidden terminals. According to FAMA, control of the channel (the floor) is assigned to at most one station in the network at any given time, and this station is guaranteed to be able to transmit one or more data packets to different destinations with no collisions. The FAMA protocols described consist of non-persistent carrier or packet sensing, plus a collision-avoidance dialogue between a source and the intended receiver of a packet. Sufficient conditions under which these protocols provide correct floor acquisition are presented and verified for networks with hidden terminals; it is shown that FAMA protocols must use carrier sensing to support correct floor acquisition. The throughput of FAMA protocols is analyzed for single-channel networks with hidden terminals; it is shown that carrier-sensing FAMA protocols perform better than ALOHA and CSMA protocols in the presence of hidden terminals.
