This poster presents an overview of the characteristics of a one-button information retrieval interface with closed captions from TV watching activities, which is intended to lighten the burden of remembering and entering query terms while watching TV. We investigated this interface with an experimental system named Video Bookmarking Search, which estimates query terms from closed captions with named-entity recognition and sentence labeling techniques. According to an empirical evaluation for 1,138 search queries from 206 bookmarks using seven actual TV shows on city life, travel, health, and cuisine, we found wider queries and search results are acceptable through the query-input-free interface, despite the fact that the number of queries and search results that are directly relevant to the users' original intentions is not high. The main reason is a watching user's interest is wider than what is expressed with query terms.
