By manipulation of electric fields, it is possible to detect the presence of foreign objects underwater. The presented work builds upon a previous result, in which was developed a neural network-based methodology allowing to address this detection problem for spherical objects. Hereafter, we show that the approach generalizes to the case of continuous walls. The technique relies on a neural model of the forward map (from scene configuration to electric measures). Exploiting this model, together with collected electric measures, it becomes possible to detect and infer the relative distance and orientation of a planar wall. In addition, we show that relying on a single forward model, only descriptive of the presence of a single wall, it is possible to address the same problem in presence of a combination of walls forming a corner or a corridor. Closing the motion control loop with information obtained using the proposed approach, it becomes possible to regulate position of a system at a fixed distance and orientation from a wall, with applications to the exploration and monitoring of flooded pipelines, or to surface quality monitoring of ships' hulls (in relation to biofouling). Data collected experimentally are used together with analytical models and numerical simulations to illustrate efficacy of the approach.
