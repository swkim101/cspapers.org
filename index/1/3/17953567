This paper presents development of energyefficient and fault-tolerant control of multiphase nonsinusoidal PM synchronous machines by making use of the Hamiltonian of optimal control theory. An analytical solution for the optimallinearization control is derived in a closed-form from the maximum principle formulation to linearize the machines and at same time to maximize machine efficiency for non-constant operational torque and speed while automatically deferring output voltage saturation. The controller can achieve voltage-totorque linearization even for faulty motors with open-circuited phase(s) making it suitable for high-risk applications. Experimental results are appended to underpin the performance of the energy-efficient controller.
