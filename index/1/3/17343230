Described here is a tool that fully meets the need for a High-Speed General Information Management System, HSGIMS, that can be used for secure, realtime management and manipulation of both timeindependent or static (e.g personnel records) and time-dependent or dynamic (e.g. battle scenario) data. In particular the HSGIMS is logically independent, can process all queries m small bounded times, and has a built-in security system for preventing access by unqualified users and the destruction of information by viruses.
