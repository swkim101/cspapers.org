In this paper, we present a Sequential Gating Ensemble Network (SGEN) for multi-scale face restoration issue. We first employ the principle of ensemble learning into SGEN architecture design to reinforce predictive performance of the network. The SGEN aggregates multi-level base-encoders and base-decoders into the network, which enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field. Instead of combining these base-en/decoders directly with non-sequential operations, the SGEN takes base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential data. Specifically, the SGEN learns to sequentially extract high level information from base-encoders in bottom-up manner and restore low level information from base-decoders in top-down manner. Besides, we propose to realize bottom-up and top-down information combination and selection with Sequential Gating Unit (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes two inputs from different levels and decides the output based on one active input. Experiment results demonstrate that our SGEN is more effective at multi-scale human face restoration with more image details and less noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. By using adversarial training, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results than other models through subjective evaluation.
