The Predictable Assembly from Certifiable Components (PACC) team at the Software Engineering Institute has developed a vehicle to create component-based systems that have predictable behavior prior to implementation. The project has been used to successfully predict performance and safety properties of real-time systems, but the concepts and technology can be applied to predict other properties (e.g., reliability, security).
