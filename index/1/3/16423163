The objectives and the general structure of a database management system designed for instructional use are described in this paper. Two high level interfaces which can be used to assist a student in query formulation are discussed. First of these interfaces is graphical and uses Macintosh microcomputer as a user's workstation. The other interface guides a student through the process of query formulation using a menu-driven approach. Preliminary experiences with these interfaces have shown that they can facilitate teaching of query formulation and help students to understand better the syntax and semantics of non-procedural query languages.
