Classical planning is inappropriate for generating actions in a dynamic world. This paper presents a formalism, called Gapps, that allows a programmer to specify an agent's behavior using symbolic goal-reduction rules that are compiled into an efficient parallel program. Gapps is designed for use in domains that require real-time response, that cannot be completely characterized by operator descriptions, and that allow multiple actions to be carried out in parallel.
