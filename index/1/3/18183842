A program implementing a novel approach to layout verification is presented. The approach uses topological and device information to eliminate most false and unchecked errors. This technique, coupled with a hierarchical front end to eliminated redundant checks, is appropriate for layout verification of VLSI designs. Design rules appropriate for this technique, some usage rules in the context of structured design, and a discussion of the future of design rule checking are also presented.
