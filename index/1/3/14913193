This paper gives an overview of the VGDS (Virtual Global Data Structure) project. The VGDS e ort focuses on developing an integrated, distributed environment that allows fast prototyping of a diverse set of simulation problems in scienti c and engineering domains, including regular, irregular, and adaptive problems. The framework de nes three base libraries, Array, Graph, and Tree, that capture major data structures involved in scienti c computation. The framework de nes multiple layers of class libraries which work together to provide data-parallel representations to application developers while encapsulate parallel implementation details into lower layers of the framework. The layered approach enables easy extension of the base libraries to a variety of application-speci c data structures. Experimental results on a Sun UltraSparc workstation cluster is reported.
