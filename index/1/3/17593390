Well-designed Web APIs must provide high levels of usability and must "get it right" on the first release. One strategy for accomplishing this feat is to identify usability issues early in the design process before a public release. Sketching is a useful way of improving the user experience early in the design phase. Designers can create many sketches and learn from them. The Rapido tool is designed to automate the Web API sketching process and help designers improve usability in an iterative fashion.
