This paper discusses the evolution of a unique setup for design of integrated circuit masks, using interactive graphics equipment in an open shop environment. The evolution of this design philosophy is traced from manual drafting and digitizing, through limited computer editing, to the present drawing-free methods. Implementation and continuing operation of the facility have posed many unusual problems of load distribution, priority management, control of users and procedures, and data integrity. Harris' solutions to these problems and the resulting high efficiency are discussed.
