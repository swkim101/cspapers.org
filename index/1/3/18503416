This paper describes the current state of implementation of a cognitive computer model of human plausible reasoning, based on the theory of plausible reasoning described by Collins and Michalski. Our goal is to use the simulation as a means of testing and refining the theory. This requires developing appropriate memory organization and search techniques to support of this style of inference, finding ways to estimate similarity in specific contexts and investigating ways of combining the sometimes contradictory conclusions reached when inferences of different types are used to answer questions.
