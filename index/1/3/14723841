We examine an approach for providing reliable, scalable multicast communication, using multiple multicast groups for reducing receiver processing costs in a multicast session. In this approach a single multicast group is used for the original transmission of packets. Retransmissions of packets are done to separate multicast groups, which receivers dynamically join or leave. We first show that by using an infinite number of multicast groups, processing overhead at the receivers are substantially reduced. Next, we show that, for a specific negative acknowledgment (NAK)-based protocol, most of this reduction can be obtained by using only a small number of multicast groups for a wide range of system parameters. Finally, we present a local filtering scheme for minimizing join/leave signaling when multiple multicast groups are used.
