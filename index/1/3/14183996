Large-scale computations required in the analysis and design of social network interactions and internet search have traditionally had a flavor distinct from EDA. With scale, density, and personalization on the web, the picture is changing. We show early evidence here that EDA-based methodologies in field simulation may show new techniques for search, relevance in online advertising, and social network simulation.
