This paper gives the results of our efforts to evaluate and tailor a software cost estimation model called COCOMO.1 The precise data for the analysis was collected from the records of 33 completed projects. We evaluate the original COCOMO model, which overestimates the efforts required to develop software in our environment. Then we tailor the model according to the COCOMO tailoring methodology. To increase the precision and stability of the tailored model, we delete some unnecessary cost drivers in a heuristic manner with the aid of nonparametric statistical method. As a result, we can greatly improve the model. Finally we suggest a method to tailor the COCOMO effort multipliers. We believe we maintain the same direction as the originator's philosophy, and that our efforts can contribute to the progress of the COCOMO tailoring methodology.
