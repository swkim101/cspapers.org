The Tor network has established itself as de-facto standard for anonymous communication on the Internet, providing an increased level of privacy to over a million users worldwide. As a result, interest in the security of Tor is steadily growing, attracting researchers from academia as well as industry and even nation-state actors. While various attacks based on traffic analysis have been proposed, low accuracy and high false-positive rates in real-world settings still prohibit their application on a large scale. In this paper, we present Torben, a novel deanonymization attack against Tor. Our approach is considerably more reliable than existing traffic analysis attacks, simultaneously far less intrusive than browser exploits. The attack is based on an unfortunate interplay of technologies: (a) web pages can be easily manipulated to load content from untrusted origins and (b) despite encryption, low-latency anonymization networks cannot effectively hide the size of request-response pairs. We demonstrate that an attacker can abuse this interplay to design a side channel in the communication of Tor, allowing short web page markers to be transmitted to expose the web page a user visits over Tor. In an empirical evaluation with 60,000 web pages, our attack enables detecting these markers with an accuracy of over 91% and no false positives.
