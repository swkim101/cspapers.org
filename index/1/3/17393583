We present a sound and complete logic for reasoning about Simple APL programs. Simple APL is a fragment of the agent programming language 3APL designed for the implementation of cognitive agents with beliefs, goals and plans. Our logic is a variant of PDL, and allows the specification of safety and liveness properties of agent programs. We prove a correspondence between the operational semantics of Simple APL and the models of the logic for two example program execution strategies. We show how to translate agent programs written in SimpleAPL into expressions of the logic, and give an example in which we show how to verify correctness properties for a simple agent program.
