In this paper, we present the notion and construction of threshold ring signature without random oracles. This is the first scheme in the literature that is proven secure in the standard model. Our scheme extends the Shacham-Waters signature from PKC 2007 in a non-trivial way. We note that our technique is specifically designed to achieve a threshold ring signature in the standard model. Interestingly, we can still maintain the signature size to be the same as the Shacham-Waters signature, while only a tiny computation cost is added.
