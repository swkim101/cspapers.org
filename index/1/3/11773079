Augmented Transition Network grammars have significant areas of unexplored application as a simulation tool for grammar designers. The intent of this paper is to discuss some current efforts in developing a grammar testing tool for the specialist in linguistics. The scope of the system under discussion is to display structures based on the modeled grammar. Full language definition with facilitation of semantic interpretation is not within the scope of the systems described in this paper. Application of grammar testing to an applied linguistics research enviroment is emphasized. Extensions to the teaching of linguistics principles and to refinement of the primitive ATN functions are also considered.
