As call centers become more pervasive, the customers seek individualized service and greater attention. The call centers are becoming the contact centers - a one-stop, single interface for all interactions - from pre-sales to post-sales, and continuing relationship. This paper presents some results in utilizing data mining in managing customer profile toward a greater business advantage. 
 
One solution is to build a predictive customer profile based on the customer's Lifetime Value (LTV). Many different types of data mining techniques can be combined to meet this challenge. 
 
This paper explores the solution to using knowledge discovery methods in integrated inbound/outbound call center environments. Significant performance gain is reported on a customized knowledge acquisition system over a conventional approach.
