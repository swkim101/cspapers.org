The issue of confidentiality and protection of individual privacy has become increasingly prominent as the use of computing and communication technology becomes widespread. In recent years, significant accomplishments in data security models and systems have mainly concentrated in protecting classified data in military and government organizations. These systems are not designed to protect individual privacy and rights. Protecting government classified data is, no doubt, an important area and research and development effort should be continued and encouraged. The proper use of data resources for supporting organizational functions without violating individualâ€™s privacy and rights is an issue which needs special attention today.
