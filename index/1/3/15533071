To date, data generates and arrives in the form of stream to propagate discussions of public events in microblog services. Discovering event-oriented topics from the stream will lead to a better understanding of the change of public concern. However, as the massive scale of the data stream, traditional static topic models, such as LDA, are no longer fit for topic detection and tracking tasks. In this paper, we propose a central topic model (CenTM), where a Multi-view Clustering algorithm with Two-phase Random Walk (MC-TRW) is devised to aggregate the LDA's latent topics into central topics. Furthermore, we leverage the aggregation of central topics alternately with MC-TRW and sequential topic inference to improve the scalability in the stream fashion, so as to derive the dynamic central topic model (DCenTM). Specifically, our model is able to uncover the intrinsic characteristics of the central topics and predict the trend of their intensity along a life cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed central topic model is event-oriented and of high generalization, it therefore can dispose the topic trend prediction effectively and precisely in massive data stream.
