In a multilevel secure database management system based on the replicated architecture, there is a separate database management system to manage data at or below each security level, and lower level data are replicated in all databases containing higher level data. In this paper, we address the open issue of concurrency control in such a system. We give a secure protocol that guarantees one-copy serializability of concurrent transaction executions and can be implemented in such a way that the size of the trusted code (including the code required for concurrency and recovery) is small.
