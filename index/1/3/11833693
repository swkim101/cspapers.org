With the objective of encouraging and supporting more critical thinking about broad issues of computer science throughout the curriculum, we propose the widespread use of popular press (non-academic) books as supplemental texts for a variety of courses. Our hypothesis is that such books, which address topics including the history, current issues, and future implications of computing technology, as well as ethical issues, technical details and even fictional treatments, can greatly contribute to a student's education in a variety of courses.
