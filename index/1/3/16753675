Using an Object-Oriented (00) model, we developed an architecture for an extensible and rtable class library designed to build applications sp at manipulate P rograms. This library enables a ate static program attributes an B plications to maniputo control and interrogate dynamic program attributes. In this paper, we describe our ex F riences using 00 techniques to build the class ibrary from the architecture and our experiences using, extending, and porting the library to build the first real client a lication: a symbolic, source-level C++ debugger. 8.n experiences have been both positive and negative, but overall we found that our approach allowed us to meet our design objectives.
