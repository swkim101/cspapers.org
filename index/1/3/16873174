This paper describes the optimization of a compliant motion task plan which guarantees the estimation of the inaccurately known position and orientation of the contacting objects to the required accuracy ("active sensing"). The task plan consists of: (1) the desired sequence of contact formations; and (2) the compliant path to execute during each of these contact formations. The plan is optimized to minimize the expected execution time, an important criterion in industrial applications. The theory is implemented for contacts between polyhedral objects.
