We describe a tool, MatchMaps, that generates sameAs and partOf matches between spatial objects (such as shops, shopping centres, etc.) in crowd-sourced and authoritative geospatial datasets. MatchMaps uses reasoning in qualitative spatial logic, description logic and truth maintenance techniques, to produce a consistent set of matches. We report the results of an initial evaluation of MatchMaps by experts from Ordnance Survey (Great Britainâ€™s National Mapping Authority). In both the case studies considered, MatchMaps was able to correctly match spatial objects (high precision and recall) with minimal human intervention.
