Systems dealing with personal information are legally required to satisfy the principle of data minimisation. Privacy-enhancing protocols use cryptographic primitives to minimise the amount of personal information exposed by communication. However, the complexity of these primitives and their interplay makes it hard for non-cryptography experts to understand the privacy implications of their use. In this paper, we present TRIPLEX, a framework for the analysis of data minimisation in privacy-enhancing protocols.
