The usage control (UCON) model was introduced as a unified approach to capture a number of extensions for traditional access control models. While the policy specification flexibility and expressive power of this model have been studied in previous work, as a related and fundamental problem, the safety analysis of UCON has not been explored. This paper presents two fundamental safety results for UCONA, a sub-model of UCON only considering authorizations. In UCONA, an access control decision is based on the subject and/or the object attributes, which can be changed as the side-effects of using the access right, resulting in possible changes to future access control decisions. Hence the safety question in UCONA is all the more pressing since every access can potentially enable additional permissions due to the mutability of attributes in UCON. In this paper, first we show that the safety problem is in general undecidable. Then, we show that a restricted form of UCONA with finite attribute value domains and acyclic attribute creation relation has a decidable safety property. The decidable model maintains good expressive power as shown by specifying an RBAC system with a specific user-role assignment scheme and a DRM application with consumable rights.
