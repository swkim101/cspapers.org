Technological advances in large-scale integrated circuits have caused mini and micro computer usage to multiply in the last few years. This behooves academic to treat the mini/micro phenomenon adequately. The same multiplication process, however, makes choosing a minicomputer all the more difficult. The problem is compounded by the hardware and electronics knowledge required to attain the best price advantage. This paper describes how one academic computer department selected and implemented a minicomputer on a restricted budget. It is written primarily for the reader without extensive knowledge of hardware electronics.
 This article is a description of the experiences of one academic computer department1 in buying, installing, and using an academic minicomputer. It is directed primarily to those having little or no expertise in electronics or computer hardware design. This description is in response to a number of inquiries of “What did you do?” It is a step-by-step description and, as such, is quite specific to our particular system, with which we have been well pleased. It is offered as a guide of experience both to those who might obtain a similar system and as a case to others as well.
