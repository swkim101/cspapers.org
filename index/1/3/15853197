We formulate the problem of query evaluatron over a relational database (EDB) supplemented by functronfree Horn clause rules (IDB) as a system of cooperatmg processes commumcatmg by message passing Shared memory 1s not requrred, makmg thus approach surtable for distributed systems Thus modularrzatron offers flexrbrhty of rmplementatron and opportumtres to use exrstmg operatmg system features to enhance performance, as well as provrdmg a step toward practrcal parallel rmplementatron The technique 1s based on top-down constructron of a rule/goal graph followed by a muted top-down and bottom-up evaluation strategy employmg “srdeways mformatron passing” to restrrct the computatron to relevant, or at least potentrally relevant, portrons of mtermedrate relatrons Termmatron 1s guaranteed, but the termmatron condrtrons are global m general, and their drstrrbuted asynchronous detection requires care We describe an efficient protocol to accomphsh this We descrrbe a greedy mformatron passmg strategy and mtroduce the monotone flow property for rules We discuss the relation of these concepts to acyclic database schemas and qual trees ‘Supported by NSF grant IST-84-12791 and a grant of IBM
