In this paper a new approach is proposed to obtain a compact mixed polarity Reed-Muller form, starting from a fixed polarity Reed-Muller expression; a fixed polarity Reed-Muller function is expressed into a truth vector, the truth vector is shrunk and the shrunk vector is mapped into a compact mixed polarity Reed-Muller function. An algorithm is proposed in C and applied to seven MCNC benchmarks. The results show that a significant are improvement can be made compared with published results.
