We describe a visualization technique that uses brushed, parallel histograms to aid in understanding concept drift in multidimensional problem spaces. This technique illustrates the relationship between changes in distributions of multiple antecedent feature values and the outcome distribution. We can also observe effects on the relative utilization of predictive rules. Our parallel histogram technique solves the over-plotting difficulty of parallel coordinate graphs and the difficulty of comparing distributions of brushed and original data. We demonstrate our technique's usefulness in understanding concept drifts in power demand and stock investment returns.
