EMG signals are an image of the control from the central nervous system transmitted to muscles. Intramuscular EMG signals are collected directly in muscles. The collected data contain information on the neural control of the muscle. This information can be used for controlling external devices (myo- electric control), however realtime processing of intramuscular EMG signals is complex. The aim of this paper is to present a sequential method to estimate parameters which can lead to an active drive of an upper limb prosthesis. A system model will be presented and then an algorithm detailed. Results of the proposed algorithm applied to simulated and experimental data will be discussed.
