This document describes the AlloBrain, the debut content created for presentation in the AlloSphere at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Cosm toolkit for the prototyping of interactive immersive environments using higher-order Ambisonics and stereographic projections. The Cosm toolkit was developed in order to support the prototyping of immersive applications that involve both visual and sonic interaction design. Design considerations and implementation details of both the Cosm toolkit and the AlloBrain are described in detail, as well as the development of custom human-computer interfaces and new audiovisual interaction methodologies within a virtual environment.
