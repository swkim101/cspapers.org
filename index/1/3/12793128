Associative Classification leverages Association Rule Mining (ARM) to train Rule-based classifiers. The classifiers are built on high quality Association Rules mined from the given dataset. Associative Classifiers are very accurate because Association Rules encapsulate all the dominant and statistically significant relationships between items in the dataset. They are also very robust as noise in the form of insignificant and low-frequency itemsets are eliminated during the mining and training stages. Moreover, the rules are easy-to-comprehend, thus making the classifier transparent. Conventional Associative Classification and Association Rule Mining (ARM) algorithms are inherently designed to work only with binary attributes, and expect any quantitative attributes to be converted to binary ones using ranges, like "Age = [25, 60]". In order to mitigate this constraint, Fuzzy logic is used to convert quantitative attributes to fuzzy binary attributes, like "Age = Middle-aged", so as to eliminate any loss of information arising due to sharp partitioning, especially at partition boundaries, and then generate Fuzzy Association Rules using an appropriate Fuzzy ARM algorithm. These Fuzzy Association Rules can then be used to train a Fuzzy Associative Classifier. In this paper, we also show how Fuzzy Associative Classifiers so built can be used in a wide variety of domains and datasets, like transactional datasets and image datasets.
