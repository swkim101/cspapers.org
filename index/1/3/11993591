In the past, there has been a tremendous advance in the area of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there are relatively few approaches for incorporating prior information or knowledge about structural similarities into the mapping process. Consider, for example, office buildings in which most of the offices have an identical geometric layout. The same typically holds for the individual stories of buildings. In this paper, we propose an approach for generating alignment constraints between different floors of the same building in the context of graph-based SLAM. This is done under the assumption that the individual floors of a building share at least some structural properties. To identify such areas, we apply a particle filter-based localization approach using maps and observations from different floors. We evaluate our system using several real datasets as well as in simulation. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly align multiple floors and allows the robot to generate consistent models of multi-story buildings.
