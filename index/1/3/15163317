Localization is a general-purpose representational technique for partitioning a problem into subproblems. A localized problem-solver searches several smaller search spaces, one for each subproblem Unlike most methods of partitioning, however, localization allows for subproblems that overlap - 1 e multiple search spaces may be involved in constructing shared pieces of the overall plan. In this paper we focus on two criteria for forming localizations scope and abstraction. We describe a method for automatically generating such localizations and provide empirical results that contrast their use in an office-building construction domain.
