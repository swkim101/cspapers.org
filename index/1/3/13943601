In this work we present a tool for assisting object-oriented framework instantiation based on Intelligent Agent technology. Differently from other approaches, the user is able to select the functionality needed for the new application, and based on this selection an agent elaborates a sequence of programming activities that should be carried out in order to implement it. In addition, the agent guides the execution of the activities according to the framework design. To enable this behavior, the framework need to be documented following the SmartBooks method, which extends traditional framework documentation with instantiation rules. In this paper we present an example of an instantiation environment built based on these ideas and the main characteristics of the SmartBooks method for documenting frameworks through instantiation knowledge rules.
