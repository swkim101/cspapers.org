The application of the Take-Grant Protection Model to hierarchical protection systems is explored. The proposed model extends the results of Wu [7] and applies the results of Bishop and Snyder [2] to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a hierarchical protection graph to be secure. In addition, restrictions on the take and grant rules are developed that ensure the security of all graphs generated by these restricted rules.
