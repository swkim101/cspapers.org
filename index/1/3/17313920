Five years of collaborative development have established message communication as a way of life on the ARPAnet. Many lessons were learned in building the network-wide message system, and it does a generally reliable and efficient job. However, the haste with which the system was built has forced numerous compromises and left many questions unresolved. This paper sketches the history and design of the system and then explores conclusions, compromises and questions in four areas of the technology: message form and structure, addressing, authentication and protection, and the implications of a network environment.
