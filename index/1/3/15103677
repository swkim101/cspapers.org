Content-based image suggestion (CBIS) targets the recommendation of products based on user preferences on the visual content of images. In this paper, we motivate both feature selection and model order identification as two key issues for a successful CBIS. We propose a generative model in which the visual features and users are clustered into separate classes. We identify the number of both user and image classes with the simultaneous selection of relevant visual features using the message length approach. The goal is to ensure an accurate prediction of ratings for multidimensional non-Gaussian and continuous image descriptors. Experiments on a collected data have demonstrated the merits of our approach.
