In this work we propose a sliding mode controller for in-hand manipulation that repositions a tool in the robot's hand by using gravity and controlling the slippage of the tool. In our approach, the robot holds the tool with a pinch grasp and we model the system as a link attached to the gripper via a passive revolute joint with friction, i.e., the grasp only affords rotational motions of the tool around a given axis of rotation. The robot controls the slippage by varying the opening between the fingers in order to allow the tool to move to the desired angular position following a reference trajectory. We show experimentally how the proposed controller achieves convergence to the desired tool orientation under variations of the tool's inertial parameters.
