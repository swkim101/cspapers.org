This paper proposes a storage management scheme for disk arrays, named hot mirroring. In this scheme, storage space is partitioned into two regions. One is the mirrored region, which is characterized by high performance and low storage efficiency. The other is the RAID5 region, which is characterized by low performance and high storage efficiency. Hot data blocks are stored in the former area, while cold blocks are stored in the latter. In addition, mirrored pairs and RAID5 stripes are orthogonally laid out, through which the performance degradation during rebuilding is minimized. Hot block clustering in hot mirroring achieves higher performance than conventional RAID5 arrays. The potential of hot mirroring is examined through extensive simulation.
