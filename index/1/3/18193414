The k-server problem is the problem of scheduling the motion of k mobile servers so as to serve a sequence of requests, where to serve a request is to move one of the k servers to the request site. Each request is served before any future requests are known. An online algorithm is known as competitive if its cost never exceeds a constant times that of an optimal offline adversary. Though no competitive deterministic online algorithms are known for any k > 2, we prove that a simple, natural randomized algorithm is competitive for the 3-server problem.
