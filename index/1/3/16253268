Effective advice depends on knowledge of the plans and goals of the person requiring help. Planning advice must be at a cognitively appropriate level for the user. HICCUPS, a dynamic planning system for a direct manipulation statistics program, is based on an ideal user model. Plans are generated from goals inferred from explicit goal statements from the user, knowledge about the statistics program, and the recent interactions with the interface. This exploitation of environmental information and inherent domain structure to restrict the amount of search and inferencing is a vital part of intelligent reasoning which is both fast and effective.
