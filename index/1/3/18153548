We propose categories of finer-grained polarity for a more effective aspect-based sentiment summary, and describe linguistic and ontological clues that may affect such fine-grained polarity. We argue that relevance for satisfaction, contrastive weight clues, and certain adver-bials work to affect the polarity, as evidenced by the statistical analysis.
