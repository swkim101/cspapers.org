In stark contrast to the 25% per year increase in areal density delivered by the magnetic disk industry during the 1970s and 1980s, yearly increases today are 60%, on par with DRAM density increases. Moreover, the storage industry is also delivering substantially higher data rates, smart disk-embedded readahead and writebehind, and a new generation of high-speed serial interconnects. This industry has also embraced Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive (or Independent) Disks (RAID) technology - 1997's RAID market is expected to be 13 billion dollars. With this rapidly evolving market and technology base, parallel storage systems must evolve beyond RAID levels 1 through 5. This talk is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in current trends in storage systems. It will highlight storage technology trends, RAID technology trends, and trends toward RAID-style support for network-based parallel storage systems.
