Network algorithms are usually stated from the viewpoint of the network nodes, but they can often be stated more clearly from the viewpoint of an active message, a process that intentionally moves from node to node. This paper gives some examples of this notion, and then discusses a means of implementing it. This implementation applied in both directions also demonstrates the logical equivalence of the two viewpoints.
