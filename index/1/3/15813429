We present an efficient algorithm for finding all maximal frequent word sequences in a set of sentences. A word sequence <i>s</i> is considered frequent, if all its words occur in at least <i>σ</i> sentences and the words occur in each of these sentences in the same order as in <i>s</i>, given a frequency threshold <i>σ</i>. Hence, the words of a sequence <i>s</i> do not have to occur consecutively in the sentences.
