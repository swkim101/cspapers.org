This paper investigates an approach for generating two grating images so that the moire pattern of their superposition resembles the target image. Our method is grounded on the fundamental moire theorem. By focusing on the visually most dominant (1,-1)-moire component, we obtain the phase modulation constraint on the phase shifts between the two grating images. For improving visual appearance of the grating images and hiding capability the embedded image, a smoothness term is added to spread information between the two grating images and an appearance phase function is used to add irregular structures into grating images. The grating images can be printed on transparencies and the hidden image decoding can be performed optically by overlaying them together. The proposed method enables the creation of moire art and allows visual decoding without computers.
