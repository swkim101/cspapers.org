We propose a new notion of intrusion-resilient signature schemes, which generalizes and improves upon both forward-secure [And97, BM99] and key-insulated [DKXY02] signature schemes. Specifically, similarly to the prior notions, time is divided into predefined time periods (e.g., days) so that a signature includes the time period number, changing which invalidates the signature. Also, similarly to key-insulated schemes, the user has two modules, signer and home base: the former generates signatures on its own, and the latter is needed only to help update the signerâ€™s key from one period to the next. The main strength of intrusion-resilient schemes, as opposed to prior notions, is that they remain secure even after arbitrarily many compromises of both modules, as long as the compromises are not simultaneous. Moreover, even if the intruder does compromise both modules simultaneously, it will still be unable to generate any signatures for the previous time periods. We provide an efficient intrusion-resilient signature scheme, provably secure in the random oracle model based on the strong RSA assumption. We also show how such schemes can eliminate the need for certificate revocation in the case of on-line authentication.
