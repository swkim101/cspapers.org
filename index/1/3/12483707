Object-Oriented Geometry and GraphicsJan Krc-Jediny & Augustin Mrazik, ArtInAppleS,Czechoslovakia
Spatial information is an important part of geographicinformation systems, CAD and CAM systems, and user interfaces forvisualization of any kind of information. The object-orientedapproach to spatial object modelling results in much moreunderstandable designs than non-object-oriented approaches.
This tutorial describes the design of several key components ofa system for dealing with spatial information which are: analyticalgeometry closed with respect to union, intersection and complementoperations; hierarchically structured objects for maintainingtopological information; object identity and problems arising fromchange of spatial objects in the database and user interface,transactions and copies of objects; dependencies of spatial objectsand their copies in the MVC user-interface architecture.
You should have experience in building user-interfaces andshould have some background in analytical geometry. Examples areshown in Smalltalk, so a basic knowledge of Smalltalk would behelpful.
