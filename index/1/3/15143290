In this paper we analyze a crowdsourcing system consisting of a set of users and a set of binary choice questions. Each user has an unknown, fixed, reliability that determines the user's error rate in answering questions. The problem is to determine the truth values of the questions solely based on the user answers. Although this problem has been studied extensively, theoretical error bounds have been shown only for restricted settings: when the graph between users and questions is either random or complete. In this paper we consider a general setting of the problem where the user--question graph can be arbitrary. We obtain bounds on the error rate of our algorithm and show it is governed by the expansion of the graph. We demonstrate, using several synthetic and real datasets, that our algorithm outperforms the state of the art.
