The computer science community is increasingly focusing its efforts on tasks related to the National Information Infrastructure. Hardware and software advances are being sought to make wide-area networks and technological resources in general more useful to mainstream society. With this transition comes a set of unavoidable political and social issues that have never been satisfactorily dealt with in the past. Grand challenges face the computer science community on both the technical and the socio-political sides of this “major upgrade.” This paper discusses various aspects of the enormous coordination problem that faces all of us and considers what the database community can do to help.
