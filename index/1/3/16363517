Mobile robots supported by an electromechanical tether can safely explore extremely rugged terrain in resource-limited environments. While a tether provides power, wired communication, and support on steep surfaces, it also reduces maneuverability; in cluttered environments the tether will contact obstacles, forming intermediate anchor points. In order for the robot to avoid tether entanglement, it must localize itself with respect to any added anchor points. Accordingly, we present a first approach towards nonvisual localization and mapping that utilizes tether measurements and wheel odometry to jointly estimate vehicle trajectory and tether-to-obstacle contact points. The proposed method is inspired by FastSLAM, where instead of updating a map of landmarks, tether length and bearing measurements are used to update sequential lists of anchor points for every particle representing a belief of the robot's trajectory. Results from both simulation and experiment using our Tethered Robotic eXplorer (TReX) demonstrate that (i) our method is more accurate than odometry alone, and (ii) we are able to map intermediate anchor points nonvisually.
