A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates multiple discrete components into a single chip, for example by placing CPU cores, network interfaces and I/O controllers on the same die. While SoCs have dominated high-end embedded products for over a decade, system-level integration is a relatively new trend in servers, and is driven by the opportunity to lower cost (by reducing the number of discrete parts) and power (by reducing the pin crossings from the cores to the I/O). Today, the mounting cost pressures in scale-out datacenters demand technologies that can decrease the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). At the same time, the diminshing return of dedicating the increasing number of available transistors to more cores and caches is creating a stronger case for SoC-based servers.
