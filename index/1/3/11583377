In this paper, we propose a GAS-CP-CDMA(cyclic-prefix code division multiple access system that uses Sequences with good autocorrelation property) and analyze the uplink signal-to-noise ratio performance of that system. Phase-shifted sequences are used for differentiating users. The signals of the GAS-CP-CDMA system experience no (or very little) interferences from co-cell signals because of the good autocorrelation property, but user signals of adjacent cells may yield interferences. The frequency reuse factor in the ordinary CDMA system is around 0.6 and the interference from adjacent cells is about 40 percent of the total interference in the conventional CDMA system. Our numerical analysis shows that the frequency reuse factor and user capacity versus signal-to-noise ratio of the GAS-CP-CDMA system are improved comparing to the conventional CDMA system. The uplink user capacity of the proposed system can be increased up to about twice of that of the conventional CDMA system.
