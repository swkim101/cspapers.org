Middleware has emerged as an important architectural component in supporting distributed applications. However conventional middleware technologies are not able to meet the requirements of a wide range of application domains. This position paper describes an approach based on non-functional policies that allows application-specific reconfiguration of ORBs. Reconfigurability is supported by combining the strengths of component-oriented programming and metaprogramming: an ORB is developed as an adaptable graph of meta-level components. However, the power of these techniques is more than an application programmer can handle, who is typically not an expert in metaprogramming nor ORB development. This problem is solved through a declarative binding between application at the baselevel and ORB implementation at the metalevel. This declarative binding is realized by instantiating application-specific policies that are interpreted by the metaprogram.
