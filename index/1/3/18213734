This paper describes an experimental fixturing system wherein fixel reaction forces, workpiece loading, and workpiece displacements are measured during simulated fixturing operations. The system's configuration, its measurement principles, and tests to characterize its performance are summarized. This system is used to experimentally determine the relationship between workpiece displacement and variations in fixel preload force or workpiece loading. We compare the results against standard theories, and conclude that commonly used linear spring models do not accurately predict workpiece displacements, while a non-linear compliance model provides better predictive behavior.
