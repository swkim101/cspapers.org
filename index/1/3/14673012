The development of Tera's MTA system was unusual. It respected the need for fast hardware and large shared memory, facilitating execution of demanding parallel application programs. At the same time, it provided a clean machine model enabling calculated compiler optimizations and easy programming as well as novel architectural features necessary to support fast parallel system software. From its inception, system and application needs have molded the MTA architecture. The result is a system that offers high performance and ease of programming by virtue of fast hardware, flat shared memory, and streamlined software systems.
