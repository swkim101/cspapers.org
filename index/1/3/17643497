This paper contains a description of several aspects of a course in introductory computer programming that is taught using a few basic control structure extensions to FORTRAN. The FORTRAN syntactic forms and flow diagram patterns of these structures are defined, and some of the advantages of these forms are listed. The problem solving methods developed in the course are outlined, and the structures are shown to be consistent with these methods. Some pedagogic considerations which provide an effective environment for the presentation of these control structures are described.
