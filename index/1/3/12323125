In this paper, a homography-based adaptive visual servo controller is described to enable a robot end-effector to track a desired Euclidean space trajectory as determined by a sequence of images for the fixed camera configuration. To achieve the objective, a Lyapunov-based adaptive control strategy is employed to actively compensate for unknown depth measurements and the lack of an object model. The error systems are constructed as a hybrid of pixel information and reconstructed Euclidean variables obtained by comparing the images and decomposing a homographic relationship.
