We present a framework integrating concepts from con- figuration management and process management. A language, interpretable by the environment, is proposed in order to specify the development process of versions and configurations. Two structuring mechanisms are provided: a class-subclass hierarchy and a task-subtask hierarchy. The resulting expressive power is illustrated on some examples. We describe then how the environment supports the processes specified in this language as well as how it supports the dynamic refinement of process specifications.
