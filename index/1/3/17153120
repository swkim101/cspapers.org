The design and implementation of a generalized database management system based on the RAP database machine is described. The GDBMS architecture, while is similar to the ANSI/SPARC view, has differences in the interpretation of its physical levels. The E/R model is chosen as the Meta Data Model (Conceptual Schema) which generates external model interfaces consisting of the relational, network, and hierarchical models. The SEQUEL, LSL, MRI --- like languages are supported at these interfaces. Structural and operational transformations from the external interfaces into the corresponding constructs of the RAP database machine have been implemented. The RAP DBMS assembler is found to be an efficient facility for language translation and in realizing common operational transformations. It performs these transformations in a way that preserves database consistency.
