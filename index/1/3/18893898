This paper proposes an iterative learning control method for simultaneous force/position tracking tasks by using a 5 D.O.F. robotic thumb under non-holonomic rolling constraints. In our previous works, "blind touching", which is defined as a point-to-point control scheme for the robot to realize a desired contact position and a contact force simultaneously without any external sensing, have proposed. In this paper, an iterative learning control manner to realize a desired continuous trajectory of the center of the contact point together with a desired contact force on the task plane is proposed. The usefulness of this learning control method is demonstrated by showing results of computer simulations.
