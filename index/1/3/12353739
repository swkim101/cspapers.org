High dynamic range images (HDRIs) are needed for capturing scenes that include drastic lighting changes. This paper presents a method to improve the dynamic range of a camera by using a reflective liquid crystal. The system consists of a camera and a reflective liquid crystal placed in front of the camera. By controlling the attenuation rate of the liquid crystal, the scene radiance for each pixel is adaptively controlled. After the control, the original scene radiance is derived from the attenuation rate of the liquid crystal and the radiance obtained by the camera. A prototype system has been developed and tested for a scene that includes drastic lighting changes. The radiance of each pixel was independently controlled and the HDRIs were obtained by calculating the original scene radiance from these results.
