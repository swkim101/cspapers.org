The object level control of a dexterous robot hand provides an intuitive high-level interface to solve fine manipulation tasks. In the past, many algorithms were proposed based on a weighted pseudoinverse of the grasp map. In a different approach Stramigioli introduces a virtual object - called "intrinsically passive controller (IPC)". This controller distributes the generalized object forces using coupling springs whose weighting have an intuitive physical meaning. Even though this controller has been known for several years we will present the first experimental results for a four-fingered hand. Furthermore, the term virtual grasp map is introduced and a method to parameterize the stiffness parameters in order to obtain an effective object level stiffness and a damping design is proposed. An implementation of the IPC is tested on the DLR Hand II and its performance is analyzed by manipulating soft and stiff objects.
