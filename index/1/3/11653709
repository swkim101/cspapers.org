This paper looks at the use of a Self Organizing Map (SOM), to link of records of crimes of serious sexual attacks. Once linked a profile can be derived of the offender(s) responsible.The data was drawn from the major crimes database at the National Crime Faculty of the National Police Staff College Bramshill UK. The data was encoded from text by a small team of specialists working to a well-defined protocol. The encoded data was analyzed using SOMs. Two exercises were conducted. These resulted in the linking of several offences in to clusters each of which were sufficiently similar to have possibly been committed by the same offender(s). A number of clusters were used to form profiles of offenders. Some of these profiles were confirmed by independent analysts as either belonging to known offenders or appeared sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation.The prototype was developed over 10 weeks. This contrasts with an in-house study using a conventional approach, which took 2 years to reach similar results. As a consequence of this study the NCF intends to pursue an in-depth follow up study.
