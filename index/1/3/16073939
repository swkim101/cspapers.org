SmartTokens are small-sized tangible tokens that can sense multiple types of motion, multiple types of touch/grip, and send input events wirelessly as state-machine transitions. By providing an open platform for embedding basic sensing capabilities within small form-factors, SmartTokens extend the design space of tangible user interfaces. We describe the design and implementation of SmartTokens and illustrate how they can be used in practice by introducing a novel TUI design for event notification and personal task management.
