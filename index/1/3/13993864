Framework-based applications controlled by XML configuration files are quite popularly used in current commercial applications. However, most of these frameworks are complex or not well documented, which poses a great challenge for programmers to correctly utilize them. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new tool to recommend XML configuration snippets automatically through mining tree patterns and pattern associations from the application repository with the aim of assisting the programmer to generate proper XML configurations during the production phase. In this demo, we showcase this tool by presenting the major techniques behind the tool and the typical usage scenarios of our tool.
