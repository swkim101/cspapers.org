In this paper, a power-assisted attitude control system consisting of parallel wires is proposed. This system controls the attitude of an object, thus reducing the burden on the operator and allowing direct manipulation. In our previous research, a power-assisted control system for an overhead crane was proposed. Operators could move a heavy object freely in horizontal and vertical directions and adjust one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) attitude by inputting a slight force grasping the object directly, that meant the operator did not feel any sensors. Our newly proposed equipment consists of an overhead crane and two linear cylinders. A power-assisted 2-DOF attitude control algorithm that controls the length of the cylinders and hoisting motion of the crane synchronously is proposed, and the effectiveness of the system is demonstrated in some experiments.
