First Story Detection is hard because the most accurate systems become progressively slower with each document processed. We present a novel approach to FSD, which operates in constant time/space and scales to very high volume streams. We show that when computing novelty over a large dataset of tweets, our method performs 192 times faster than a state-of-the-art baseline without sacrificing accuracy. Our method is capable of performing FSD on the full Twitter stream on a single core of modest hardware.
