Industrial robots are today separated from human workers by means of safety barriers, that protect humans from the risk of collisions. This separation has a clear negative influence on diffusion of robotic technology in shopfloors. On the other hand the removal of protective barriers gives rise to safety issues, that can be addressed with a combination of approaches, including sensor based reactive control. In this paper a distributed proximity sensor, to be mounted on the links of the manipulator, is presented. The optimal placement of the spots of such sensor is discussed, taking into account detection capabilities and safety enhancement. Experiments developed on an ABB IRB 140 robot using off-the-shelf infrared distance sensors as spots are presented.
