By the year 2020 it is expected that corresponding to every human being there would be seven connected devices. These connected devices will usher in the Internet of Things (IoTs) and would percolate every aspect of human life, changing the human experience at a fundamental level. In order to power these devices novel strategies would have to be developed as these devices will not only have a dynamic load, due to multiple features, but also dynamic sources if opportunistic energy harvesting is used to supplement the rechargeable battery. For the power delivery network, figures of merit would be to comprehend both the ability to supply the worst case design as well as to maintain high efficiency across a wide dynamic range. To maintain high efficiency for a large range we will need adaptive components on the load side as well as at the energy source. In this work we will discuss the general IoT power delivery network (PDN), current research and the state of the art PDN components, novel designs and control for interface circuits and energy harvesters.
