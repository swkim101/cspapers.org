We present the key lessons learned from the ESCORT European project. ESCORT is concerned with integrating diverse applications and devices for traffic control at the intersection level. The paper emphasises the difficulty of breaking existing, vertical products to build an integration platform, and the role of object technology (and UML in particular) in this context.
