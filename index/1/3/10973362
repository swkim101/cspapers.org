However, associating terms in the context to the cited document remains an open problem. We propose a novel document generation approach that statistically incorporates the context in which a document links to another document. We quantitatively show that the proposed generation scheme explains the linking phenomenon better than previous approaches. The context information along with the actual content of the document provides signiÔ¨Åcant improvements over the previous approaches for various real world evaluation tasks such as link prediction and log-likelihood estimation on unseen content. The proposed method is more scalable to large collection of documents compared to the previous approaches.
