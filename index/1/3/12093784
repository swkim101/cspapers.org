Neural-network ensembles have been shown to be very accurate classification techniques. Previous work has shown that an effective ensemble should consist of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well. Most existing techniques, however, only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set of networks. In this paper we present a technique called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. ADDEMUP works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on three DNA problems show that ADDEMUP is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing approaches. Experiments also show that ADDEMUP is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble.
