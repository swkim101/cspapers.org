Dynamically rendering the shape of an object offers a lot of new opportunities in the fields of virtual reality, design, and prototyping as bare hand interaction represents a very intutive way to explore objects. We propose a 3D-shape interface formed by a parallel kinematics connecting multiple nodes and present an inverse kinematics based on a retargeting algorithm to control these nodes. The shape is formed by simultaneously taking into account loop constraints, joint limits and user interaction points. Two alternative control modes for stiff and compliant objects are introduced and compared with each other in simulations.
