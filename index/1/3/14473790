Abrtract Current databarer do not proceu temporal information well. Databarer containing hirtorieal information (history databaser) have been proposed to provide more temporal capability by appending new data to relationr in&cad of deetructivaly updating them. Becauee hirtory databuee do not dircard data, they cannot diecard outdated database achemae. Thus, in any propoeal for a practical hiitory databw ryrtem, come method murt be provided for accarring data from outdated, yet hirtorically valid, database echemae. This paper investigates the probleme rerulting from restructuring a hirtory database. It then explorer different technique@ for maintaining multiple rchemae. Finally, it presentr Schema Temporal Logic (STL) ae a meane of retrieving data from multiple hirtorically valid databaee rchemae uring temporal logic.
