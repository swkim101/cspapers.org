We present deterministic sequences for use in sampling-based approaches to motion planning. They simultaneously combine the qualities found in many other sequences: i) the incremental and self-avoiding tendencies of pseudo-random sequences, ii) the lattice structure provided by multiresolution grids, and iii) low-discrepancy and low-dispersion measures of uniformity provided by quasi-random sequences. The resulting sequences can be considered as multiresolution grids in which points may be added one at a time, while satisfying the sampling qualities at each iteration. An efficient, recursive algorithm for generating the sequences is presented and implemented. Early experiments show promising performance by using the samples in search algorithms to solve motion planning problems.
