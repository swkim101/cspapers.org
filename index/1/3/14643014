In this paper, we introduce a simple procedure to predict wiring delay in bi-directional buses and a way of properly sizing the driver for each of its port. In addition, we propose a simple calibration procedure to improve its delay prediction over the Elmore delay of the RC tree. The technique is fast, accurate, and ideal for implementation in floorplanner during behavioral synthesis.
