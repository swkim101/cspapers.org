Automatically discovering semantic relations between ontologies is an important task with respect to overcoming semantic heterogeneity on the semantic web. Existing ontology matching systems, however, often produce erroneous mappings. In this paper, we address the problem of errors in mappings by proposing a completely automatic debugging method for ontology mappings. The method uses logical reasoning to discover and repair logical inconsistencies caused by erroneous mappings. We describe the debugging method and report experiments on mappings submitted to the ontology alignment evaluation challenge that show that the proposed method actually improves mappings created by different matching systems without any human intervention.
