In many real-time systems, the workload can be characterized as a set of jobs with linear precedence constraints among them. Jobs often have variable execution times and arbitrary release times. We describe three algorithms that can be used to compute upper bounds on completion times of such jobs scheduled on a priority-driven basis. The algorithms have different performance and complexity. Simulation was performed to compare their performance.
