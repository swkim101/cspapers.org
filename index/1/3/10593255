We address the problem of composing a story out of multiple short video clips taken by a person during an activity or experience. Inspired by plot analysis of written stories, our method generates a sequence of video clips ordered in such a way that it reflects plot dynamics and content coherency. That is, given a set of multiple video clips, our method composes a video which we call a video-story. We define metrics on scene dynamics and coherency by dense optical flow features and a patch matching algorithm. Using these metrics, we define an objective function for the video-story. To efficiently search for the best video-story, we introduce a novel Branch-and-Bound algorithm which guarantees the global optimum. We collect the dataset consisting of 23 video sets from the web, resulting in a total of 236 individual video clips. With the acquired dataset, we perform extensive user studies involving 30 human subjects by which the effectiveness of our approach is quantitatively and qualitatively verified.
