We introduce Re-FUSE, a framework that provides support for restartable user-level file systems. Re-FUSE monitors the user-level file-system and on a crash transparently restarts the file system and restores its state; the restart process is completely transparent to applications. Re-FUSE provides transparent recovery through a combination of novel techniques, including request tagging, system-call logging, and non-interruptible system calls.We tested Re-FUSE with three popular FUSE file systems: NTFS-3g, SSHFS, and AVFS. Through experimentation, we show that Re-FUSE induces little performance overhead and can tolerate a wide range of file-system crashes. More critically, Re-FUSE does so with minimal modification of existing FUSE file systems, thus improving robustness to crashes without mandating intrusive changes.
