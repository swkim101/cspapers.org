We demonstrate InstantEspresso, a system to explain the relationship between two sets of entities in knowledge graphs. Instant-Espresso answers questions of the form. Which European politicians are related to politicians in the United States, and how? or How can one summarize the relationship between China and countries from the Middle East? Each question is specified by two sets of query entities. These sets (e.g. European politicians or United States politicians) can be determined by an initial graph query over a knowledge graph capturing relationships between real-world entities. Instant-Espresso analyzes the (indirect) relationships that connect entities from both sets and provides a user-friendly explanation of the answer in the form of concise subgraphs. These so-called relatedness cores correspond to important event complexes involving entities from the two sets. Our system provides a user interface for the specification of entity sets and displays a visually appealing visualization of the extracted subgraph to the user. The demonstrated system can be used to provide background information on the current state-of-affairs between real-world entities such as politicians, organizations, and the like, e.g. to a journalist preparing an article involving the entities of interest. InstantEspresso is available for an online demonstration at the URL http://espresso.mpi-inf.mpg.de/.
