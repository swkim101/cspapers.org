In this paper we present a tool to annotate paper documents with vocal comments. This tool does not require specially processed documents, and allows natural and simple interactions: sticking a note to add a comment, and place an object on it to listen to the record. A pilot experiment in which teachers used this tool to annotate reports revealed that vocal comments require an extra effort compared to writing. We discuss future work that could either fix or take advantage of this extra effort.
