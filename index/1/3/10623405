We propose a framework based on a parametric quadratic programming (QP) technique to solve the support vector machine (SVM) training problem. This framework, can be specialized to obtain two SVM optimization methods. The first solves the fixed bias problem, while the second starts with an optimal solution for a fixed bias problem and adjusts the bias until the optimal value is found. The later method can be applied in conjunction with any other existing technique which obtains a fixed bias solution. Moreover, the second method can also be used independently to solve the complete SVM training problem. A combination of these two methods is more flexible than each individual method and, among other things, produces an incremental algorithm which exactly solve the 1-Norm Soft, Margin SVM optimization problem. Applying Selective Sampling techniques may further boost convergence.
