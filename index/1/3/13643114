Documenter is a geographical information system package developed in visualbasic6 and MsAccess2000. It imports and views maps with embedded databases. It includes searching, zooming and printing facilities. Documenter runs under all Windows operating systems. The documenter uses ActiveX technology, as OLE especially the object handler dynamic link library that does not activate the OLE server when the embedded object is used. One of The problems faced while developing the package is the inconsistency of maps starting points opened within the OLE container. Another problem was the interrelated coordinates of a map and how to manage the zooming of the maps within the OLE container putting in consideration the activation of the OLE server. The package solves those problems in a simple and creative manner. The GUI design of DOCUMENTER is collaboration between the system users and the developers. The software is developed using the IEF methodology. DOCUMENTER uses the OLE technology in a creative manner, which helps in minimizing the maps access time, and eliminates the need of the ole server while running the system a fact that decreases tremendously the licensing expenses.
