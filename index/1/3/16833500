We propose a neural network model for scalable generative transition-based dependency parsing. A probability distribution over both sentences and transition sequences is parameterised by a feedforward neural network. The model surpasses the accuracy and speed of previous generative dependency parsers, reaching 91.1% UAS. Perplexity results show a strong improvement over n-gram language models, opening the way to the efficient integration of syntax into neural models for language generation.
