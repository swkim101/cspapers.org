Built around a cost-effective embedded Linux platform, OpenVLC is an open source project (www.openvlc.org) for research in Visible Light Communication (VLC) Networks. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the OpenVLC1.0 platform, a flexible, software-defined, and low-cost research platform. OpenVLC1.0 consists of a simple electronic design, and a new driver of the Linux operating system that implements the MAC, part of the PHY layers and it offers an interface to Internet protocols. The electronics of OpenVLC implement a flexible optical front-end consisting of commodity low- and high-power Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), photodiodes (PDs), and ancillary electronic circuitry. In order to quickly start playing with VLC Networks, we have designed and developed a printed circuit board (OpenVLC1.0 cape). The cape can be plugged into the main embedded Beaglebone board. Researchers can then swiftly build PHY and MAC protocols using the software implementation (OpenVLC1.0 driver), and prototype innovative solutions in realistic network setups. In this demo, we show that OpenVLC1.0 can switch between different MAC protocols, it can choose different optical channel for data transmission and reception, and it can be employed jointly with standard TCP/IP diagnostic tools.
