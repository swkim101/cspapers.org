In earlier studies, the optimal wing kinematics that gives the best aerodynamic performance was determined with a robotic flapper. The geometry and physical properties of wings are also critical for designing and fabricating Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs). In this paper, the effects of wing aspect ratio and flexibility on aerodynamic performance are experimentally investigated to determine the optimal aspect ratio for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) wings at Reynolds number around 18,000. The comparison between the aerodynamic performance of rigid wings and flexible wings are also made whose veins are fabricated out of different materials.
