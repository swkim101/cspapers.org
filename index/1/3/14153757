We present an algorithm for checking satisfiability of a linear time temporal logic formula over a finite state concurrent program. The running time of the algorithm is exponential in the size of the formula but linear in the size of the checked program. The algorithm yields also a formal proof in case the formula is valid over the program. The algorithm has four versions that check satisfiability by unrestricted, impartial, just and fair computations of the given program.
