We developed fabrication and manipulation of hybrid nanorobots by 3D nano exposure and optical tweezers. Hybrid nanorobot is composed of photoresist and silicon nanowire. The robot is fabricated by femtosecond laser exposure and is connected to the glass substrate by a micropillar. The processing resolutions of the femtosecond laser exposure are 270 nm (line width) and 600 nm (thickness), respectively. The robot is released by cutting of the pillar by ablation with femtosecond laser. Release time is within four minutes. The released robot is manipulated by holographic optical tweezers (HOT). We succeeded in high-speed manipulation of the robot using HOT (transport speed: 100 μm/s, rotation speed: 1140 deg/s). The robot can be fabricated by incorporating temperature indicator to the robot body and inserting a silicon nanowire to the probe. The robot can be used as a thermal sensor by measuring temperature change from the probe to the robot body because silicon nanowire has high thermal conductivity (168 W/m·K). In this paper, we demonstrated fabrication, on-demand release, and manipulation of the robot in a solution. We also demonstrated temperature calibration and measurement to confirm the effectiveness of the temperature sensor.
