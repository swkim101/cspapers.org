Clock distribution networks can consume 35â€“70% of total chip power in high-performance designs [13]. Resonant clocks can potentially reduce this power by recycling the energy using on-chip inductors. We propose the first automated Resonant clOCK Synthesis (ROCKS) algorithm. Experimental results show that with 10% inductor area, clock power can be reduced by 34%. With more inductor area, up to 90% power savings is shown feasible.
