Applying abstracted biological locomotion principles with reduced actuation can result in an energetic vehicle with greater mobility because a vehicle with the fewest number of motors can have the highest power to mass ratio. One such hexapod is Whegs II, which benefits from abstracted cockroach locomotion principles and has just one motor for propulsion. Similar to Whegs I, it nominally runs in a tripod gait and passive mechanisms enable it to adapt its gait to the terrain. One of the drawbacks of Whegs I is that it cannot change its body posture. Cockroaches pitch their bodies up in anticipation of climbing a step to enable their front legs to reach higher. They also flex their bodies down while climbing to permit their front legs to maintain contact with the substrate. A bidirectional servo-driven body flexion joint has been implemented in Whegs II to accomplish both of these behaviors. It is shown to be highly mobile and energetic.
