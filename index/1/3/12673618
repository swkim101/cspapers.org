In this paper, we introduce an approach called FSBS (Forward Search in Belief Space) for online planning in POMDPs. The approach is based on the RTBSS (Real-Time Belief Space Search) algorithm of [1]. The main departure from the algorithm is the introduction of similarity measures in the belief space. By considering statistical divergence measures, the similarity between belief points in the forward search tree can be computed. Therefore, it is possible to determine if a certain belief point (or one very similar) has been already visited. This way, it is possible to reduce the complexity of the search by not expanding similar nodes already visited in the same depth. This reduction of complexity makes possible the real-time implementation of more complex problems in robots. The paper describes the algorithm, and analyzes different divergence measures. Benchmark problems are used to show how the approach can obtain a ten-fold reduction in the computation time for similar obtained rewards when compared to the original RTBSS. The paper also presents experiments with a quadrotor in a search application.
