We address the problem of performance prediction for parallel programs execut,ed on clusters of heterogeneous workstations on which resource contention is present. We develop a methodology for the construction of performance models whose analysis allows the estimation of the execution time of these programs. We use Timed Petri Nets to represent the behavior of parallel programs, and a contention model based on queueing theory t,o quantify the effects of resource contention on the execution time of the application processes. Our methodology is demonstrated through the construction of the model of an example program, which is also used t,o validate the predictions against measured execution times obtained by executing the program on two different clusters of workstations
