This paper investigates conceptually and empirically the novel sense matching task, which requires to recognize whether the senses of two synonymous words match in context. We suggest direct approaches to the problem, which avoid the intermediate step of explicit word sense disambiguation, and demonstrate their appealing advantages and stimulating potential for future research.
