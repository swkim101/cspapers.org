In the past, various computer languages aimed at users of dataflow computers have been designed and implemented. VAL, Id and SISAL are famous examples. One concept that is common to such languages is to maintain a sense of functionality by introducing a single assignment rule for all variables. DFCII, Dataflow C II, the language proposed here, is designed for writing practical application programs and system programs that must be executed in parallel on the SIGMAâ€“1. It is the most important dataflow research project being undertaken by the Electrotechnical Laboratory of Japan. This paper proposes the design of this new dataflow language, DFCII.
