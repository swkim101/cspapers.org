A simple nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed to solve the finite-time regulation of uncertain robot manipulators. The semiglobal finite-time stabilization is shown by using Lyapunov theory and finite-time stability theory. The proposed control algorithm does not involve the modeling information in the control law formulation and the control gains can be explicitly determined based on some well-known bounds extracted from the robot dynamics, and thus permits easy implementation. Simulations preformed on a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator demonstrate the expected properties of the proposed approach.
