The aim of this paper is to compare Bayesian network classifiers to the k-NN classifier based on a subset of features. This subset is established by means of sequential feature selection methods. Experimental results show that Bayesian network classifiers more often achieve a better classification rate on different data sets than selective k-NN classifiers. The k-NN classifier performs well in the case where the number of samples for learning the parameters of the Bayesian network is small. Bayesian network classifiers outperform selective k- NN methods in terms of memory requirements and computational demands. This paper demonstrates the strength of Bayesian networks for classification.
