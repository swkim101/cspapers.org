In this paper, we present a monocular SLAM method which uses vertical and the floor line features as sensory input. A line-based partial 3D map was built, in which many structural properties of the environment can be included. The vertical line and the floor line can be represented as simple 2D objects in the floor plane. These two heterogeneous types of line features were developed as independent SLAM features and combined to represent the environment in a more complete fashion. Although the vertical and floor line use different parameterization and initialization methods, their measurement models are integrated into a unified EKF framework. Experimental results show that this method is practical in a structured indoor environment.
