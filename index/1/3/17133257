This paper takes a cognition-centric approach for programming languages. It promotes the spreadsheet paradigm, with two concrete goals. First, it calls for the design and implementation of several language features to enhance the expressiveness of spreadsheet programming. Second, it describes a plan for rigorous empirical studies to retain the learnability of spreadsheet programming.
