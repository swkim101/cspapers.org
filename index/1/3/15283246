At Villanova University we have a popular course for non-majors focused on problem solving with computers, taught using our own lecture and lab materials. This paper seeks to describe the essence of the problem solving course by focusing on an assignment that is given after the first unit of the course has been completed. This assignment, writing an essay about how someone uses a computer to solve a problem, requires the application of most of the topics of the first third of the course and is very representative of the spirit of the course as a whole.
