Our poster shows how J2EE technologies, well-known design patterns and standard methodologies have successfully been applied in building a complete, robust and well-documented accounting application. Our experience demonstrates that those three factors allow for easy maintenance and reuse of components. The application, whose development was initially outsourced, is now maintained by a CNR internal group and other Public Administrations have shown interest in adopting some of its components.
 The poster tells, in brief, the story of the application from the planning phase to the latest developments.
