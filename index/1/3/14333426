In this paper, we present a model for improved discriminative semantic parsing. The model addresses an important limitation associated with our previous stateof-the-art discriminative semantic parsing model â€“ the relaxed hybrid tree model by introducing our constrained semantic forests. We show that our model is able to yield new state-of-the-art results on standard datasets even with simpler features. Our system is available for download from http://statnlp.org/research/sp/.
