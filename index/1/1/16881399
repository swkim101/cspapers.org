In the last decade computer science has been struggling to establish it's independent identity, pressured on one side by those who refuse to admit the existence of any new sciences and on the other by those who see computer science as no more than the art of constructing computer programs.
 We who are teaching computer science are caught in the middle. We must teach our students some of the art of computer technology through programming courses, but we also must instill in them those principles of the science of computing which set it apart as a discipline in its own right. We must keep ourselves from spending all our time teaching our students to program in a variety of different languages so they can get jobs as technologists. But we must also beware of spending an inordinate amount of time on the theory without teaching programming basics.
