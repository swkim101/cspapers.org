The paper proposes a novel approach to locating software components from a large component repository: context-aware browsing. Without any explicit input from software developers, this approach automatically locates and presents a list of software components that could possibly be used in the current development situation. This automation of the component location process not only greatly reduces the search space of components so that software developers can easily browse and choose the desired components, but also enables software developers to use components whose existence they do not even anticipate. A software agent that supports context-aware browsing has been developed and evaluated.
