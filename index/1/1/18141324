Blind spot check is important driving activity that is a good indicator of driversâ€™ proficiency and vigilance. By recognizing the blind spot check activity with drivers, it is possible to quantify and qualify the proficiency of the drivers, but also to cross validate this information with other data such the fatigue level. Thus, in this paper, we present a blind spot check activity recognition system where decision tree classifiers are modeled for each drivers and are used to automatically recognize the blind spot checks.
