In this paper, we describe a graph-based approach to the construction of simple mathematical proofs. In contrast with traditional linear proofs, this technique helps the student organize the solution process and provides a visual representation of the proof. This approach has been used to introduce proofs in a discrete structure course. The author has observed a statistically significant increase in students' performance when answering related test problems.
