The size of graphs has dramatically increased. Graph engines for a single machine have been emerged to process these graphs efficiently. However, existing engines have overlooked a data locality which is an imperative factor to improve the performance of these engines in the previous literature. In this paper, we show the importance of data locality with graph algorithms by running on graph engines based on a single machine.
