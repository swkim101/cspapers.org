Algorithm animation is the process of abstracting a program's data, operations, and semantics, and creating dynamic graphical views of those abstractions[Sta90]. Algorithm animation systems have been used for both instructional purposes such as augmenting classroom lectures and for "visually documenting" complex programs. To now, algorithm animation systems have supported only 2-D black-and-white or color views. Our work extends algorithin animation to three-dimensional computer graphics.
