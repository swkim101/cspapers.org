Whereas optical character recognition (OCR) systems learn to classify single characters; people learn to classify long character strings in parallel, within a single fixation. This difference is surprising because high dimensionality is associated with poor classification learning. This paper suggests that the human reading system avoids these problems because the number of to-be-classified images is reduced by consistent and optimal eye fixation positions, and by character sequence regularities.
