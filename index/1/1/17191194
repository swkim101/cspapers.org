Wikipedia's Current Events Portal (WCEP) is a special part of Wikipedia that focuses on daily summaries of news events. The WikiTimes project provides structured access to WCEP by extracting and indexing all its daily news events. In this paper we study this part of Wikipedia and take a closer look into its content and the community behind it. First, we provide descriptive analysis of the collected news events. Second, we compare between the news summaries created by the WCEP crowd and the ones created by professional journalists on the same topics. Finally, we analyze the revision logs of news events over the past 7 years in order to characterize the WCEP crowd and their activities. The results show that WCEP has reached a stable state in terms of the volume of contributions as well as the size of its crowd, which makes it an important source of news summaries for the public and the research community.
