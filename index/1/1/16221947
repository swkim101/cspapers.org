KMP/II is a multiprocessor system designed to work as a multi-lingual high level language computer in a distributed processing environment. The multiprocessor system is composed of up to 15 dynamically microprogrammable LSI processors. One processor executes OS functions. Another processor executes I/O functions. All the rest execute user programs as high level language job processors, emulating individual high level language. Allocation of high level language emulators to processors changes dynamically depending upon the load of user jobs in terms of the languages. Behaviour of processes of user jobs written in high level languages and system jobs are measured through monitoring typical minicomputers. Hardware characteristics of the system are also collected by measuring the prototype system. Simulations are done by a computer using the data obtained through the above measurements to determine the process scheduling and processor assignment algorithm and to prove the effectiveness of the design concept.
