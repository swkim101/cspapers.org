Thermocons describes our work in progress for evaluating thermal haptic feedback on the forehead as a viable feedback modality for integration with head mounted devices. The purpose was to identify the thermal perception for simultaneous feedback at three locations of the forehead. We provided hot-only, cold-only and hot/cold-mixed thermal stimulations at these location to identify the sensitivity for accurate perception. Our evaluation with 9 participants indicated that perceiving cold-only stimulations were significantly better with an accuracy of 88%. The perception accuracy for hot-only and hot/cold-mixed stimulations were 66% and 65% respectively.
