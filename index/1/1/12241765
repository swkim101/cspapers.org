We present a language RACHNA, which in our opinion, can form the basis of a CAD system. In RACHNA various hardware features like - asynchronism, parallelism, pipelining, timing and delays etc. can be described in a procedural frame-work. A number of control constructs have been provided, which can be suitably nested. It allows a designer to include structural information also, giving him a better control over the final hardware realization. A design can be evolved in a top-down manner by defining subsystems as Processes, Modules and Functions. RACHNA is associated with an interpreted graph model, which defines its semantics and is useful for simulation and logic synthesis.
