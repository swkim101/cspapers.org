This paper derives asymptotically tight bounds on the time-space tradeoffs for pebbling three different classes of directed acyclic graphs. Let N be the size of the graph, S the number of available pebbles, and T the time necessary for pebbling the graph. (a) A time space tradeoff of the form ST = &thgr;(N2) is proved for a special class of permutation graphs which implement the bit reversal permutation. (b) A time-space tradeoff of the form T = S &thgr;(N/S)&thgr;(N/S) is proved for a class of graphs constructed by stacking superconcentrators in series. (c) A time-space tradeoff of the form T = S.22&thgr;(N/S)is proved for pebbling general directed acyclic graphs.
