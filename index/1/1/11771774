We propose the concept of tethered satellite cluster systems, as an application of the RoboSat clusters. The system consists of some satellites joined by tethers, and keeps and changes the constellation with tension/length control of the tethers to perform various orbit service missions. We formulate the motion of the system in order to analyze the dynamics and establish the methods of coordinated control of tension and attitude of the satellite. In addition, we develop a ground experiment system including a reel mechanism for the tethered satellite cluster systems. We outline the system components and show results of the fundamental experiments for verification of the reel mechanism and the control methods.
