The goal of the KRL research group is to develop a knowledge representation language with which to bui ld sophisticated systems and theories of language understanding. This is a d i f f i cu l t goal to reach, one that wi l l require a number of years. We are using an iterative strategy with repeated cycles of design, implementation and testing. An in i t ia l design is described in an overview of KRI (Bobrow & Winograd, 1977). The system created in the f i rst cycle is called KRL-o, and this paper describes its implementation, an analysis of what was learned f rom our experiments in using KRL-o, and a brief summary of plans for the second iteration of the cycle (the KRi.-i system). In wr i t ing this paper, we have emphasized our d i f f icul t ies and disappointments more than our successes, because the major lessons learned f rom the iterative cycle were in the form of problems. We mention only br ief ly in the summary of experiments those features of Krelo that we found most satisfactory and useful.
