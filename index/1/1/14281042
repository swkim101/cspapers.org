In this paper, we describe TANGO as a collocational concordancer for looking up collocations. The system was designed to answer user's query of bilingual collocational usage for nouns, verbs and adjectives. We first obtained collocations from the large monolingual British National Corpus (BNC). Subsequently, we identified collocation instances and translation counterparts in the bilingual corpus such as Sinorama Parallel Corpus (SPC) by exploiting the word-alignment technique. The main goal of the concordancer is to provide the user with a reference tools for correct collocation use so as to assist second language learners to acquire the most eminent characteristic of native-like writing.
