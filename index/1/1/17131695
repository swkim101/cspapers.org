This paper describes an effort to use metrics to evaluate software designs early in the design process. Key facets of the work include a machine processable design notation and the definition of software design metrics. We believe that the future success of building an intelligent software design assistant depends on the ability to quantify attributes of a software design, as well as to have the representation of the design available for automated examination.
