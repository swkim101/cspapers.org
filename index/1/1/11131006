This paper describes a suite of laboratory experiments for a CS2 course. The main thrust of the experiments is to promote an understanding of a container-class library: the Standard Template Library for C++ or the Java Generic Library for Java. All of the experiments are stored on the World Wide Web, and students have considerable latitude on when each experiment must be completed.
