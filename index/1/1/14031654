The problem of automated discovery of process models from event logs has been intensively researched in the past two decades. Despite a rich field of proposals, state-of-the-art automated process discovery methods suffer from two recurrent deficiencies when applied to real-life logs: (i) they produce large and spaghetti-like models; and (ii) they produce models that either poorly fit the event log (low fitness) or highly generalize it (low precision). Striking a tradeoff between these quality dimensions in a robust and scalable manner has proved elusive. This paper presents an automated process discovery method that produces simple process models with low branching complexity and consistently high and balanced fitness, precision and generalization, while achieving execution times 2-6 times faster than state-of-the-art methods on a set of 12 real-life logs. Further, our approach guarantees deadlock-freedom for cyclic process models and soundness for acyclic. Our proposal combines a novel approach to filter the directly-follows graph induced by an event log, with an approach to identify combinations of split gateways that accurately capture the concurrency, conflict and causal relations between neighbors in the directly-follows graph.
