This paper presents a novel human-machine interface, named invisible messenger. It integrates real time visual tracking of face and sound beam forming by speaker array, and realizes remote whispering effect as if an invisible messenger were standing by you. Construction of a working prototype system and actual measurement using the system prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed idea.
