Sensor networks are used in a variety of applications such as battlefield reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and traffic monitoring. Security and privacy become important concerns when people are participants in sensor network applications [1]. In this research, we focus on providing a framework in which the privacy of people participating in sensor networks applications is protected.
