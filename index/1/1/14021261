In this paper, we propose that various keyword-based queries be processed over XML streams in a multi-query processing way. Our algorithms rely on parsing stacks designed for simultaneously matching terms from several distinct queries and use new query indexes to speed up search operations when processing a large number of queries. Besides defining a new problem and novel solutions, we perform experiments in which aspects related to performance and scalability are examined.
