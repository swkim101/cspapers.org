As the core-count increases, NoC has more and more impact on performance. It is already known that network latency can be reduced by making packets bypass intermediate routers asynchronously, e.g. SMART. Nevertheless, it is also important to reduce energy consumption of NoC. This work proposes Energy Efficient Router Bypassing (EERB) that employs router bypassing for energy reduction in addition to performance improvement. Simulation results show that EERB reduces dynamic energy consumed in buffers and crossbars by 30% compared to SMART.
