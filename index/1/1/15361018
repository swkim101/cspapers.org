The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content sites has created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions on various items such as e-commerce products, restaurants, etc. Ideally, a user wants to quickly decide whether an item is desirable, from the list of items returned as a result of her search query. This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.
