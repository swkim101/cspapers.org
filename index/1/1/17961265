Microsoft SQL Server was successful for many years for transaction processing and decision sup- port workloads with neither merge join nor hash join, relying entirely on nested loops and index nested loops join. How much difference do addi- tional join algorithms really make, and how much system performance do they actually add? In a pure OLTP workload that requires only record-to-record navigation, intuition agrees that index nested loops join is sufficient. For a DSS workload, however, the question is much more complex. To answer this question, we have analyzed TPC-D query perform- ance using an internal build of SQL Server with merge-join and hash-join enabled and disabled. It shows that merge join and hash join are both re- quired to achieve the best performance for decision support workloads.
