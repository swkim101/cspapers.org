Knowledge exploration is the activity of finding out what other people have thought about. Normally, people explore knowledge by reading books or articles or by talking to other people. This paper discusses an alternative approach: a system whose knowledge is in the form of text fragments plus a query language to help users access appropriate fragments. Drawing primary inspiration from database theory, hypertext systems, knowledge representation, and a study of textual fragments called fragment theory, the paper describes and motivates a data model to support knowledge exploration.
