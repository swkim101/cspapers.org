The nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier has long been used in pattern recognition, exploratory data analysis, and data mining problems. A vital consideration in obtaining good results with this technique is the choice of distance function, and correspondingly which features to consider when computing distances between samples. In this paper, a new ensemble technique is proposed to improve the performance of NN classifier. The proposed approach combines multiple NN classifiers, where each classifier uses a different distance function and potentially a different set of features (feature vector). These feature vectors are determined for each distance metric using Simple Voting Scheme incorporated in Tabu Search (TS). The proposed ensemble classifier with different distance metrics and different feature vectors (TS-DF/NN) is evaluated using various benchmark data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Results have indicated a significant increase in the performance when compared with various well-known classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed ensemble method is also compared with ensemble classifier using different distance metrics but with same feature vector (with or without Feature Selection (FS)).
