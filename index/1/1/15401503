SDN opens a new chapter in network troubleshooting as besides misconfigurations and firmware/hardware errors, software bugs can occur all over the SDN stack. As an answer to this challenge the networking community developed a wealth of piecemeal SDN troubleshooting tools aiming to track down misconfigurations or bugs of a specific nature (e.g. in a given SDN layer). In this demonstration we present EPOXIDE, an Emacs based modular framework, which can effectively combine existing network and software troubleshooting tools in a single platform and defines a possible way of integrated SDN troubleshooting.
