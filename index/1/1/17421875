Module localization is an important aspect of the operation of self-reconfigurable robots. The knowledge of spatial positions of modules, or at least of the overall shape which the modules form, is the usual prerequisite for reconfiguration planning. We present a general, decentralized algorithm for determining the positions of modules placed on a cubic grid from local sensor information. The connection topology of the robot is arbitrary. We assume that a module can sense the presence of its immediate neighbors on the grid and determine their positions in its own local coordinate system, but cannot sense the orientations of the coordinate systems of its neighbors. Since orientation cannot be directly communicated between modules, the modules can only exchange information about the relative positions of their neighbors. The algorithm aggregates this information over the entire network of modules and narrows down the set of valid positions for each module as far as possible. If there exists a unique locally-consistent assignment of coordinates to all modules then it is found.
