In this paper the important characteristics of shared and special purpose networks will be examined. The shared networks will include those which are shared among a variety of different types of data services and those which are shared between data services and voice services. Special purpose networks will ordinarily be those which are defined as meeting a particular specialized need for data communications.
 An attempt will be made to identify the structural differences in such networks, the characteristics of the user's needs which cause one network to be more appropriate than another, and the cost characteristics which lead to a choice of one mechanism or the other. Much of this will be in qualitative terms, although quantitative anslyses of certain situations will be made.
