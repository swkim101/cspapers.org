This paper presents a novel control architecture for controlling a moving remote center of motion in addition to the end-effector motion during robotic surgery. In minimally invasive surgery, it is common to require that the point at which the robot enters the body, called the incision point or the trocar, does not allow for any lateral motion. It is generally considered that no motion should be applied to this point in order to avoid inflicting damage to the patient's skin. However, in surgery, the patient's body may be moving, for example due to breathing or the beating of the heart. In order to compensate for this motion-or if we for some other reason want to leverage the possible motion of the incision point to improve performance in any other way-we derive a new framework which allows us to actively control the motion both at the incision point and the end effector. The novelty of the approach lies in the possibility of controlling both the incision point and the end effector to follow a trajectory, and that we find a Jacobian matrix that satisfies the velocity constraints in both the end-effector and the incision point frames. This allows us to formulate a framework that is not only suited for control, but also for analyzing the condition number of the Jacobian and avoid any singular configurations that may arise either as a result of the constrained motion or the manipulator geometry. The approach is verified experimentally on a redundant industrial manipulator.
