Digital Geolinguistic systems encourage collaboration between linguists, historians, archaeologists, ethnographers, as they explore the relationship between language and cultural adaptation and change. In this demo, we propose a Linked Open Data approach for increasing the level of interoperability of geolinguistic applications and the reuse of the data. We present a case study of a geolinguistic project named Atlante Sintattico d'Italia, Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt).
