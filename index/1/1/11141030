Project Information Bridge is a West German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology supported project. It has been conducted in cooperation with the Gesellschaft f√ºr Information und Dokumentation (Society for Information and Documentation) (GID) and the various data base hosts in West Germany. Its goal was to develop and test a working prototype of an add-on package for existing IR systems.This report covers the time period from October 1981 through March 1983 during which the prototype was successfully developed and tested. The principal emphasis was to provide users with search formulation aids applicable to specific document files searchable using differing IR systems. Aids for thesaurus construction for natural language words and for file construction and indexing have not at this date been tested. Should tests be completed prior to the conference date, information concerning these topics will be presented at the conference.
