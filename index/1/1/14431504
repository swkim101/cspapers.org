Educational theory suggests that student learning is enhanced when students pay attention to their own learning. In this paper, we describe a range of innovative techniques that we use to encourage students to reflect on the state of their knowledge, and on the process by which they acquire it. Examples include providing web-based arrangements for students to practice assessing material based on the criteria we use in marking, and allocating marks in assessment for reflective writing.
