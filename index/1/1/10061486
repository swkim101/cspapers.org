We describe ExCamera, a system that can edit, transform, and encode a video, including 4K and VR material, with low latency. The system makes two major contributions. 
 
First, we designed a framework to run general-purpose parallel computations on a commercial "cloud function" service. The system starts up thousands of threads in seconds and manages inter-thread communication. 
 
Second, we implemented a video encoder intended for fine-grained parallelism, using a functional-programming style that allows computation to be split into thousands of tiny tasks without harming compression efficiency. Our design reflects a key insight: the work of video encoding can be divided into fast and slow parts, with the "slow" work done in parallel, and only "fast" work done serially.
