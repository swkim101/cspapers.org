The "Ifbot" robot communicates with people by considering its own "emotions" and theirs. Ifbot has many facial expressions to communicate enjoyment. We first attempted to extract characteristics of Ifbot's facial expressions by mapping these to its emotional space, which we discuss in this paper. We applied a five-layer perceptron to the extraction. We also propose a method of seamlessly changing facial expressions using the emotional space. We report on some results of facial changes obtained with the proposed method.
