This paper describes a system which uses a mobile manipulator as a teleoperated tool for accessing and manipulating remote objects, in our challenge to extend mobile robot potentials and usage in human daily life. The specific task we set up in this research is to help humans browse books located in a library from a remote location via the Internet. This task was decomposed into three major parts which are, the extraction and return of a book from a bookshelf, its browsing, and the teleoperational interface needed for humans to access to this system via a media such as the Internet. We built and realized a robot system which enables remote humans to access and browse books in a library from the Internet.
