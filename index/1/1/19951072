Effective computer science curricula can develop students' abilities more broadly than just ensuring content mastery and algorithmic thinking. Computer science curricula may also include components focused on technical writing and communication skills, ethical practice of computing, effective teamwork and project management, and the application of computer science in a broader interdisciplinary context. In this session, attendees will be invited to share information about how they are incorporating this content into their curricula and the challenges they are facing in doing so. By sharing information about our current practices, attendees will help develop a survey of the variety of strategies CS programs are using to deliver this educational content. Attendees will also be given the opportunity to discuss the specific teaching challenges they encounter in their courses when teaching this content and share effective solutions they may have found to these problems.
