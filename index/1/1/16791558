A new approach to fault diagnosis of gear wear based on Teager-Huang transform is presented. This method is based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Teager Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) technique. EMD can adaptively decompose the vibration signal into a series of zero mean Amplitude Modulation-Frequency Modulation (AM-FM)Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). TKEO can track the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the AM-FM component at any instant. The experimental examples are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results provide strong evidence that the performance of the Teager-Huang transform approach is better to that of the Hilbert-Huang transform approach for gear fault detection. Teager-Huang transform can effectively diagnose the faults of the gear wear.
