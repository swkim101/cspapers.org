We consider the problem of computing the shortest path between two points in two- or three-dimensional space bounded by polyhedral surfaces. In the 2-D case the problem is easily solved in time <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt> log <italic>n</italic>).In the general 3-D case the problem is quite hard to solve, and is not even discrete; we present a doubly-exponential procedure for solving the discrete subproblem of determining the sequence of boundary edges through which the shortest path passes. The main result of this paper involves a favorable special case of the 3-D shortest path problem, namely that of finding the shortest path between two points along the surface of a convex polyhedron. We analyze this problem and solve it in time <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt> log <italic>n</italic>).
