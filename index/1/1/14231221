The paper describes the part of a general operating system Kernel supporting data management functions The operating system Kernel can be imbedded into microcode and viewed as an extended hardware interfaceFour Kernel instructions are defined to support data management They provide a powerful basis for the implementation of different kinds of access methods and file systems, including data base systems Advanced transaction processing concepts such as concurrency control, support of backout, commit and a variety of share options are included.
