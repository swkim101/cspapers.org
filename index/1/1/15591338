Bytecode instrumentation can be used effectively to (a) generate visualizations and (b) to modify the behavior of Eclipse plugins. In this demonstration, we will show two independent techniques that have in common that they obtain their results by modifying the binary representation of a given software system. In the first part of the demo, Chris Laffra will show experiments he performed on visualization of Eclipse plugins in the context of the JikesBT project. In the second part of the demo, Martin Lippert will show how to weave aspects into Eclipse plugins without having access to their source.
