The reliability analysis of ultra-reliable computer systems is an important problem for which various tools have been developed. But the existing tools can only analyze systems that work in missions consisting of a single phase. Usually a system goes through several phases where the stress on the components are different. Moreover, from phase to phase the system operational requirements, success criteria, and the failure rates of the elements of the systems may vary. In addition, the duration of any phase may be deterministic or random. These systems may include those employing fault detection, masking redundancy, and dynamic reconfiguration. Analysis of multiple phased systems is the topic of current interest and also of this paper. Different aspects of phased-mission systems have been discussed by several researchers [4-71.
