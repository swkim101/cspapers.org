Instruments used in many types of minimally invasive procedures, in particular laparoscopy, are rigid or only limitedly flexible and some tasks like suturing are difficult to perform with them. A novel hand-held, lightweight and ergonomic mechatronic instrument is presented in this paper. The instrument has a 3-DOF roll-pitch-roll end-effector controlled using an easy to use handle that provides the surgeon with a 6-DOF movement, including a distal circular movement which resembles the circular movement of stitching. The design of the instrument is based on a global study involving control, dexterity and ergonomic aspects, with the aim of developing an instrument that enhances the dexterity of the surgeon while having an intuitive and ergonomic interface. A proof of concept prototype was built and tested in vitro and in vivo.
