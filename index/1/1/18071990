This research addresses how constraint satisfaction interacts with the search mode, and how the ratio of breadth of effort to depth of effort can be controlled. Four search paradigms, each the best of its kind for non adversary problems, are investigated. One is depth first, and the others best first. All methods except one highly informed best first search use the same knowledge, and each of these methods is tested with and without the use of a constraint satisfaction procedure on sets of progressively more difficult problems. As expected, the most informed search does better than the less informed as the problems get more difficult. Constraint satisfaction is found to have a pronouncedly greater effect when coupled with the most informed algorithm. Large performance increments over A* can be produced by the use of a coefficient associated with the h term, and this algorithm produces solutions that are only 5% worse than optimal. This is a known phenomenon; however, the range of this coefficient is very narrow. We term this coefficient, which controls the ratio of depth of effort to breadth of effort, the adventurousness coefficient. The less tractable a problem the greater the adventurousness should be. We present evidence to support this.
