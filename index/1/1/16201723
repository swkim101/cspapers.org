The growing importance of post-silicon validation in ensuring functional correctness of high-end designs has increased the need for synergy between the pre-silicon verification and post-silicon validation. This synergy starts with a common verification plan. It continues with common verification goals and shared tools and techniques. This paper describes our experience in improving this synergy in the pre- and post-silicon verification of IBM's POWER7 processor chip and by leveraging pre-silicon methodologies and techniques in the post-silicon validation of the chip.
