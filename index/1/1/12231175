We describe a distributed method for keeping down “token-passing” overhead in a mobile multi-access network, by performing local corrections in the token-passing sequence as they become necessary due to changes in node spatial configuration. These corrections involve only a subset of the nodes in the network, thus reducing the required computational effort. The method consists of three distributed protocols. The first is for detecting deterioration and identifying a subset of nodes that constitutes a “problem area”, the second is to provide each node with the distances (propagation delays) to all other nodes, and the third is to use this topological information to construct a minimal spanning tree, from which a good “token passing” sequence can be derived. The second and third protocols may also have applications other than the one described here, such as position location, routing and broadcasting.
