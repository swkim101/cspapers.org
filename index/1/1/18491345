Raviyoyla v1 is an authenticated encryption algorithm submitted to the first round of the CAESAR competition which is a grand occasion launched recently to identify efficient, flexible and secure authenticated encryption primitives. Raviyoyla v1 is composed by an additive stream cipher motivated by the eSTREAM candidate MAG v2 and a keyed hash function. The designer declares $128$ bit security for authentication. In this paper, we propose a method to construct forgeries using a single query and the complexity is negligible. Indeed, we introduce differential of specific form to the public message and try to canceling it before outputting any authenticated tags. Specially, the differential is not restricted to any particular value and thus multiple forgeries may be made through a single query. Our theoretical analysis shows that the probability for a randomly selected differential of our form to be canceled out is at least $0.307143$. Therefore, it is sufficient to have three trials to obtain a forgery. Moreover, the probability can approaches one for some specialized values. Furthermore, the revised Raviyoyla v1 is vulnerable from our attack as well.
