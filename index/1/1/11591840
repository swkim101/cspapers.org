One technique in space planning that has received a lot of attention in the last five years is the use of linear graphs for representing floor plans (Levin, 1964; Casalaina and Rittel, 1967; Krejcirik, 1969; Grason, 1970a, 1970b, 1970c; Teague, 1970). The fact that this paper describes one such technique will probably provide its chief attraction for space planners. However, the paper is also intended as a case study in computer-implemented design. One of its purposes is to illustrate the relationship between the representation chosen for a design problem and the methods developed for solving that problem. This aspect will be introduced in more detail in the next section.
 The paper treats computerized space planning by discussing methods for the solution of a formal class of floor plan design problems. These methods have been implemented in an experimental computer program called GRAMPA (for GRAph Manipulating PAckage). The methods of solution depend on a special linear graph representation for floor plans called the dual graph representation and a pseudo-grammar called PGG for specifying these graphs.
 This paper is a condensation of a much larger document (Grason, 1970c). Because of this, the primary emphasis will be placed on results, rather than the reasoning behind the results. The interested reader can consult the larger document for more detailed descriptions of the material presented.
