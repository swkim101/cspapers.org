Synchronous reactive formalisms associate concurrent behaviors to precise schedules on global clock(s). This allows a non-ambiguous notion of "absent" signal, which can be reacted upon. But in desynchronized (possibly distributed) implementations, absent values must be explicitely exchanged, unless behaviors were already provably independent and asynchronous (a property formerly introduced as endochrony).
 We provide further criteria restricting "reaction to absence" to allow correct desynchronized implementation. We also show that these criteria not only depend on the desired correctness properties, but also on the desired structure of the implementation.
