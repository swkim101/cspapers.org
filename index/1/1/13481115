This paper describes recent enhancements to the Common Lisp system that BBN is developingl for its Butterfly multiprocessor. The BBN Butterfly is a shared memory multiprocessor that contains up to 256 processor nodes. The system provides a shared heap, parallel garbage collector, and window based I/O system. The 'future' construct is used to specify parallelism.
