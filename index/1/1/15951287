This paper discusses the authors' experience in teaching the first of four courses which comprise a sequence of courses especially constructed to retrain junior and senior high school teachers to teach Computer Science. A description of the goals of the project and details about this first course serve as a springboard for discussing how the objectives were met. Also included is a brief analysis of how teachers with various backgrounds fared and some suggestions for others desiring to teach a similar course.
