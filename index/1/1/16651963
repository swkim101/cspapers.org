We give a definition of one-counter languages. We show that the smallest full AFL containing this family is principal with full generator D'@@@@ @@@@, the semi-Dyck language on two letters. We then give without the proof, which shall be published elsewhere, our main result: an iteration theorem for one-counter languages that yields several corollaries.
