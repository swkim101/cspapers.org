The verification of power grids in modern integrated circuits must start early in the design process when adjustments can be most easily incorporated. This work describes a vectorless verification technique that deals with circuit uncertainty in the framework of current constraints. In such a framework, grid verification becomes a question of computing the worst-case voltage drops which, in turn, entails the solution of as many linear programs (LPs) as there are nodes. First, we extend grid verification to also check for the worst-case branch currents. We show that this would require as many LPs as there are branches. Second, we propose a starkly different approach to reduce the number of LPs in the verification problem. We achieve this by examining dominance relations among node voltage drops and among branch currents. This allows us to replace a group of LPs by one conservative and tight LP. Results show a dramatic reduction in the number of LPs thus making vectorless grid verification in the framework of current constraints practical and scalable.
