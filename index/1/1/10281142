This paper describes how integrity constraints, whether user supplied or automatically generated during the search, and analysis of failures can be used to improve the execution of function free logic programs. Integrity constraints are used to guide both the forward and backward execution of the programs. This work applies to arbitrary node and literal selection functions and is thus transparent to the fact whether the logic program is executed sequentially or in parallel.
