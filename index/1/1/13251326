A system for automatic test generation and fault location, FLT-700, is described in this paper. It can treat large digital systems with 100K blocks (logic gates) or more. This is realized by utilizing Scan-Path concept, automatic partitioning and test generation techniques and automatic fault location technique. Serviceability for large computer systems can, therefore, be improved and easy maintenance realized.
