I will introduce extreme classi cation which is a new area of machine learning research focusing on multi-class & multi-label problems involving millions of categories. Extreme classification has opened up a new paradigm for thinking about key applications such as tagging, ranking and recommendation. I will discuss algorithms for some of these applications and present results on tagging on Wikipedia, product recommendation on Amazon and search and advertising on the Bing search engine. More details can be found on The Extreme Classification Repository webpage at http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html
