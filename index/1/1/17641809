We study a duopoly setting that consists of two capacity-constrained sellers and a single buyer. The capacity of each seller is her private information. The sellers simultaneously offer menus of quantity-price contracts to the buyer. Then the buyer chooses a set of contracts to maximize his own utility. We show that under certain natural conditions there exists a pure strategy equilibrium for the sellers which defines an efficient allocation. We study the effects of asymmetry of information, using the full information setting as a benchmark. We show that the revenue is higher when the capacities obtained by the sellers are private information.
