This presentation discusses the evolution of the curriculum in object-oriented methods in the main undergraduate degree in the Department of Computer Science at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. The degree has a strong Software Engineering emphasis, and object-oriented analysis and design methods are complemented by a programming curriculum which uses Ada. The forthcoming Ada9X will have a substantial impact on the curriculum.
