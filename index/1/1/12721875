Grasping an object in a cluttered, unorganized environment is challenging because of unavoidable contacts and interactions between the robot and multiple immovable (static) and movable (dynamic) obstacles in the environment. Planning an approach trajectory for grasping in such situations can benefit from physics-based simulations that describe the dynamics of the interaction between the robot manipulator and the environment. In this work, we present a physics-based trajectory optimization approach for planning grasp approach trajectories. We present novel cost objectives and identify failure modes relevant to grasping in cluttered environments. Our approach uses rollouts of physics-based simulations to compute the gradient of the objective and of the dynamics. Our approach naturally generates behaviors such as choosing to push objects that are less likely to topple over, recognizing and avoiding situations which might cause a cascade of objects to fall over, and adjusting the manipulator trajectory to push objects aside in a direction orthogonal to the grasping direction. We present results in simulation for grasping in a variety of cluttered environments with varying levels of density of obstacles in the environment. Our experiments in simulation indicate that our approach outperforms a baseline approach that considers multiple straight-line trajectories modified to account for static obstacles by an aggregate success rate of 14% with varying degrees of object clutter.
