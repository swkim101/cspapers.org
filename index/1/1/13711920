In this paper we introduce Prohairetic Deontic Logic, a preference-based dyadic deontic logic. An obligation ‘ should be (done) if is (done)’ is true if (1) no: ^ is preferred to an ^ and (2) the preferred are . We show that this mixed representation solves several problems of deontic logic. Moreover, we discuss the relation between preferencebased deontic logic and qualitative decision theory.
