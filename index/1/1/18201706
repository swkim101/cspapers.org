This paper presents a new marker for robot programming by demonstration through motion imitation. The device is based on high intensity LEDs (light emission diodes) which are captured by a pair of industrial cameras. Using stereoscopy, the marker supplies 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) human wrist tracking with both position and orientation data. We propose a robust technique for camera and stereo calibration which maps camera coordinates directly into the desired robot frame, using a single LED. The calibration and tracking procedures are thoroughly described. The tests show that the marker presents a new robust, accurate and intuitive method for industrial robot programming. The system is able to perform in real-time and requires only a single pair of industrial cameras though more can be used for improved effectiveness and accuracy.
