We present a novel framework of system combination for multi-document summarization. For each input set (input), we generate candidate summaries by combining whole sentences from the summaries generated by different systems. We show that the oracle among these candidates is much better than the summaries that we have combined. We then present a supervised model to select among the candidates. The model relies on a rich set of features that capture content importance from different perspectives. Our model performs better than the systems that we combined based on manual and automatic evaluations. We also achieve very competitive performance on six DUC/TAC datasets, comparable to the state-of-the-art on most datasets.
