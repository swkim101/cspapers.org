A new variation of high order multiway tree structures, the P-tree is presented. P-trees have average access costs that are significantly better than those of B-trees and are no worse (and often better) in storage utilization. Unlike compact B-trees, they can be maintained dynamically, and unlike dense multiway trees and B-trees, their associated insertion algorithm, which is also presented, is cheap and involves (at most) a very localized rearrangement of keys.
