This paper presents an algorithm for planning the foothold positions of quadruped robots on irregular terrain. The input to the algorithm is the robot kinematics, the terrain geometry, a required motion path, as well as initial posture. Our goal is to develop general algorithm that navigate quadruped robots quasi-statically over rough terrain, using an APF (Artificial Potential Field) and graph searching. The algorithm is planning a sequence set of footholds that navigates the robot along the required path with controllable motion characteristics. Simulations results demonstrate the algorithm in a planner environment.
