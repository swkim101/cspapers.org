Scrolling is an essential part of our everyday computing experience. Contemporary scrolling techniques rely on the explicit initiation of scrolling by the user. The act of scrolling is tightly coupled with the user?s ability to absorb information via the visual channel.

We also introduce the use off-screen gaze-actuated buttons for document navigation and control.
