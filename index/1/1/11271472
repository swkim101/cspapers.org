The problem of similarity search (query-by-content) has attracted much research interest. It is a difficult problem because of the inherently high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Piecewise Polynomial Approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for using ensembles of two or more representations for more efficient indexing. The basic idea is that instead of committing to a single representation for an entire dataset, different representations are chosen for indexing different parts of the database. The representations are chosen based upon a local view of the database. For example, sections of the data that can achieve a high fidelity representation with wavelets are indexed as wavelets, but highly spectral sections of the data are indexed using the Fourier transform. At query time, it is necessary to search several small heterogeneous indices, rather than one large homogeneous index. As we will theoretically and empirically demonstrate this results in much faster query response times.
