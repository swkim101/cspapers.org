The paper discusses how the resource control hypothesis introduced earlier by the author accounts for the rather mysterious fact that English articles are rendered in Slavonic-languages by word order and vice versa. The definite versus indefinite distinction is viewed as a manifestation of the variable depth of nominal phrase processing. The depth of processing is determined by the availability of resources, which is indirectly controlled by the speaker with sufficient precision; articles appear to be only some of several resource control devices available in natural language.
