This paper describes a new data abstraction mechanism in an object-oriented model of computing. The data abstraction mechanism described here has been devised in the context of the design of Sina/st language. In Sina/st no language constructs have been adopted for specifying inheritance or delegation, but rather, we introduce simpler mechanisms that can support a wide range of code sharing strategies without selecting one among them as a language feature. Sina/st also provides a stronger data encapsulation than most of the existing object-oriented languages. This language has been implemented on the SUN 3 workstation using Smalltalk.
