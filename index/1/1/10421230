This paper shows that the weighted matching problem on general graphs can be solved in time O(n(m + n log n)), f or n and m the number of vertices and edges, respectively. This was previously known only for bipartite graphs. It also shows that a sequence of m nca and link operations on n nodes can be processed on-line in time O(ma(m, n)+n). This was previously known only for a restricted type of link operation.
