In this paper, we newly propose an on-chip force sensing by using a magnetically driven microtool (MMT) equipped with a frame structure for measurement of stimulant property of Pleurosira laevis. The design and fabrication of the force sensing structure with a displacement magnification mechanism based on beam deformation is discussed. Through the basic experiments, the advantages of the proposed layer fabrication technique and the performance of the force sensor are confirmed. The basic characteristics of P. laevis are also confirmed by using the developed MMT.
