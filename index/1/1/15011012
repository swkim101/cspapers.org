An independent set of three vertices is called an asteroidal triple if between every two vertices in the triple there exists a path avoiding the neighbourhood of the third. A graph is asteroidal triple-free (AT-free, for short) if it contains no asteroidal triple. A classic result states that a graph is an interval graph if and only if it is chordal and AT-free. Our main contribution is to exhibit a very simple, lineartime, recognition algorithm for interval graphs involving four sweeps of the we&known Lexicographic Breadth First Search. Unlike the vast majority of existing algorithms, we do not use maximal cliques in our algorithm we rely, instead, on a less well-known characterization by a linear order of the vertices.
