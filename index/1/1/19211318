This capability is challenging to achieve in long-term SLAM, when the environment appearance exhibits significant long-term variations across various time of the day, months, and even seasons. In this paper, we introduce a novel formulation to learn an integrated long-term representation based upon both holistic and landmark information, which integrates two previous insights under a unified framework: (1) holistic representations outperform keypoint-based representations, and (2) landmarks as an intermediate representation provide informative cues to detect challenging locations. Our new approach learns the representation by projecting input visual data into a low-dimensional space, which preserves both the global consistency (to minimize representation error) and the local consistency (to preserve landmarksâ€™ pairwise relationship) of the input data. To solve the formulated optimization problem, a new algorithm is developed with theoretically guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments have been conducted using two large-scale public benchmark data sets, in which the promising performances have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
