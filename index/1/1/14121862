Specification and verification of real-time systems are important research topics which have practical implications. In this work, we present a self-contained toolkit to analyze real-time systems, which supports system modeling, animated simulation and automatic verification (based on advanced model checking techniques like dynamic zone abstraction). In this tool, we adopt an event-based modeling language for describing real-time systems with hierarchical structure. Experiments show that our tool has compatible performance with the state-of-the-art verifiers, and complement them with additional capabilities like LTL model checking, timed refinement checking.
