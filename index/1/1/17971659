Recently, multiple locomotion gaits of snake have been realized by snake robots. However, previous locomotion gaits are mainly limited on two-dimensional plane. In this study, we make a snake robot that can move in three-dimensional space by connecting several units serially. The each unit is composed by assembling one pitch axis and one yaw axis, and it can have two passive wheels. We realize previously achieved basic locomotion gaits and simple cylinder climbing locomotion. In addition, we also realize cylinder climbing locomotion with helical form by the snake robot using mathematical continuum model.
