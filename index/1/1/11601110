During waking and sleep, the brain and mind undergo a tightly linked and precisely specified set of changes in state. At the level of neurons, this process has been modeled by variations of Volterra-Lotka equations for cyclic fluctuations of brainstem cell populations. However, neural network models based upon rapidly developing knowledge of the specific population connectivities and their differential responses to drugs have not yet been developed. Furthermore, only the most preliminary attempts have been made to model across states. Some of our own attempts to link rapid eye movement (REM) sleep neurophysiology and dream cognition using neural network approaches are summarized in this paper.
