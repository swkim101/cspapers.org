A file assignment case study of a computer system running Unix is presented. A queueing network model of the system is constructed and validated. A modeling technique for the movement of files between and within disks is proposed. A detailed queueing network model is constructed for several file distributions in secondary storage. The interdependencies between the speed of the CPU, the swapping activity, the visit ratios and the multiprogramming level are examined and included in the modeling technique. The models predict the performance of several possible file assignments. The various file assignments are implemented and comparisons between the predicted and actual performance are made. The models are shown to accurately predict user response time.
