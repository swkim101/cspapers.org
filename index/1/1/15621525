Software analysis patterns are believed to play a major role in reducing the cost and condensing the time of software product lifecycles. However, there are several deficiencies with today's analysis patterns. These deficiencies make it difficult to use analysis patterns as efficient reusable artifacts. This poster discusses the status of today's analysis patterns. It also introduces the novel concept of Stable Analysis Patterns. In addition, it introduces eight essential properties to evaluate analysis pattern reusability.
