This paper presents a systematic study of how to enhance recommender systems under volatile user interest drifts. A key development challenge along this line is how to track user interests dynamically. To this end, we first define four types of interest patterns to understand users' rating behaviors and analyze the properties of these patterns. We also propose a rating graph and rating chain based approach for detecting these interest patterns. For each users' rating series, a rating graph and a rating chain are constructed based on the similarities between rated items. The type of a given user's interest pattern is identified through the density of the corresponding rating graph and the continuity of the corresponding rating chain. In addition, we propose a general algorithm framework for improving recommender systems by exploiting these identified patterns. Finally, experimental results on a real-world data set show that the proposed rating graph based approach is effective for detecting user interest patterns, which in turn help to improve the performance of recommender systems.
