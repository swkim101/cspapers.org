The SYNARC model provides the architect-planner with a series of modular programs which allows him to evaluate and revise conceptual design solutions with a precision that has been heretofore lacking. SYNARC allows the architect to evaluate his conceptual design solution at every level of development from basic land plan to transportation systems location, from land-use and building locations to economic feasibility. It provides objective output data from physical attributes of the conceptual design solution for the architect to interpret. While the negative aspects of speculative investment and rigid financial considerations can never be isolated from solving the problems of the built-environment, the SYNARC model can allow the architect to deal with them in a more integrative, problem-solving process, perhaps producing design solutions which are more sensitive and sympathetic to all human needs.
