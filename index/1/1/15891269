A compact testbed for real-time Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless system performance evaluation in terms of un-coded bit-error rate is presented. Both the transmitter and the receiver are realized in form of a small PCB. The system operates in the frequency range from 3.1--5.0 GHz with a maximum data rate of 10 MBit/s. By means of two examples this poster illustrates possible applications of the testbed.
 In the first measurement presented in the poster, the performance of different UWB antennas is compared. In the second example, measurements involving the influence of the human body are performed in order to evaluate the real-world performance of Impulse radio UWB (IR-UWB) communication systems for body area and sensor network applications.
