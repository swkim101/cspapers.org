 
 Logic Programming and Argumentation Theory have been existing side by side as two separate, yet related, techniques in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoningfor many years.When Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) was first introduced in the nineties,the authors showed how a logic program can be encoded in an ABA framework andproved that the stable semantics of a logic program corresponds to the stable extension semantics of the ABA framework encoding this logic program.We revisit this initial work by provingthat the 3-valued stable semantics of a logic program coincides with the complete semantics of the encoding ABA framework,and that the L-stable semantics of this logic program coincides with the semi-stable semantics of the encoding ABA framework.Furthermore, we show how to graphically represent the structure of a logic program encoded in an ABA frameworkand that not only logic programming and ABA semanticsbut also Abstract Argumentation semantics can be easily applied to a logic program using these graphical representations.
