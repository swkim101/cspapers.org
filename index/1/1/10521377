In addition to providing small mean response times, modern applications seek to provide users predictable service and, in some cases, Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. In order to understand the predictability of response times under a range of scheduling policies, we study the conditional variance in response times seen by jobs of different sizes. We define a metric and a criterion that distinguish between contrasting functional behaviors of conditional variance, and we then classify large groups of scheduling policies.In addition to studying the conditional variance of response times, we also derive metrics appropriate for comparing higher conditional moments of response time across job sizes. We illustrate that common statistics such as raw and central moments are not appropriate when comparing higher conditional moments of response time. Instead, we find that cumulant moments should be used.
