Most consumer products, from automobiles t,o breakfast cereals, pay significant attention to the visual appearance they present to the consumer. Designers of these .products normally create custom appearances that reflect things such as the functionality or purpose of the product, the market they are trying to reach, and the image, that the company creating the product is trying to create. As graphical user interfaces begin to fully penetrate the consumer market, we expect that similar customization of appearance will and should become part of every day practice in user interface design as well. This paper describes new user interface toolkit techniques designed to support dynamic, even downloadable, appearance* changes for graphical user interfaces. The long teF.goal of this work is to create a system of styles which is analogous to current systems of fonts. That is, to provide a system for applying a style of visual appearance to an interface independent of the content of the interface, and for allowing such styles to be developed at least partially independent of specific user interface components; even in many cases supporting custom interactive components that did not exist when a style was created.
