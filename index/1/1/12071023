1. Introduction The following observations are a result of research at the University of Waterloo and of teaching experiences, reading courses and research with graduate students at Cleveland State University. From these experiences I have discovered that plotting techniques have proved a useful teaching tool to students in studying the problem of efficiently solving a large sparse (mostly zeros) system of linear equations which result from the application of the finite element method to two dimensional structural engineering problems. For such linear systems, a graphic method of depicting the step by step elimination of variables during Gaussian elimination has been used in teaching and research to study how different orderings of a system of equations affect the efficiency of Gaussian elimination in solving the system. However, until now the technique was only useful for small (hand drawn) systems. For real world problems llke those in structural engineering the number of diagrams which would have to be drawn becomes prohibitively large, numbering in the hundreds and thousands. The author has written a plotting package for the CALCOMP plotter which for the above systems will automatically generate a greatly reduced number of diagrams and yet still contain all the information , in an easy to understand form, that would have been contained if all the diagrams had been plotted. An outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we motivate the need for studying different orderings of a linear system before Gaussian elimination Is applied. Section 3 intrnduces the correspondence between mesh diagrams and the elimination of unknowns during Gaussian elimination. In section 4 several efficient plotting algorithms are introduced and discussed. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.
