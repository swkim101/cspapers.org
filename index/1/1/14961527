In case of motor impairments, steering a wheelchair can become a hazardous task. Typically, along corridors, joystick jerks induced by uncontrolled motions are source of wall collisions. This paper describes a vision based assistance solution for safe indoor semi-autonomous navigation purposes. To this aim, the control process is based on a visual servoing process designed for wall avoidance purposes. As the patient manually drives the wheelchair, a virtual guide is defined to progressively activate an automatic trajectory correction. The proposed solution does not require any knowledge of the environment. Experiments have been conducted over corridors that present different configurations and illumination conditions. Results demonstrate the ability of the system to smoothly and adaptively assist people during their motions.
