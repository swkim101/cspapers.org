We present a novel approach to automatically annotate images using associated text. We detect and classify all entities (persons and objects) in the text after which we determine the salience (the importance of an entity in a text) and visualness (the extent to which an entity can be perceived visually) of these entities. We combine these measures to compute the probability that an entity is present in the image. The suitability of our approach was successfully tested on 50 image-text pairs of Yahoo! News.
