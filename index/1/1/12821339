The Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec) focuses on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning methods to address the unique problems posed within the Security and Privacy application areas and on the implications of using those methods to solve such adversarial problems. The workshop serves as the premier venue for this particular fusion of application, algorithms, and theory and continues to attract submissions from a diverse set of researchers, who address newly arising problems within this ever growing field. The main goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers within the Security, Privacy, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning communities to discuss the role of AI and learning in security and privacy applications and, conversely, to present the unique needs of these problems to the AI and learning communities.
