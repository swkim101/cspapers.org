The Web explosion offers a bonanza of algorithmic problems. In particular, information retrieval in the web context requires methods and ideas that have not been addressed in the classic IR literature. This tutorial will survey emerging techniques for IR in the web context and discuss some of the pertinent open problems. The list of topics includes search engine technology, ranking and classification methods, web measurements (usage, size, connectivity), and new graph and data structure problems arising in the web IR context. 1 URL of Slides The slides of the talk can be found at http://www. research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Monika Henzinger/ slides.html ∗Compaq Systems Research Ctr., 130 Lytton Ave., Palo Alto, CA, 94301; http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Andrei Broder/ home.html; broder@pa.dec.com. †Compaq Systems Research Ctr., 130 Lytton Ave., Palo Alto, CA, 94301; http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/ Monika Henzinger/home.html; monika@pa.dec.com.
