We show how to compute O(/spl radic/log n)-approximations to SPARSEST CUT and BALANCED SEPARATOR problems in O/spl tilde/(n/sup 2/) time, thus improving upon the recent algorithm of Arora, Rao and Vazirani (2004). Their algorithm uses semidefinite programming and required O/spl tilde/(n/sup 4.5/) time. Our algorithm relies on efficiently finding expander flows in the graph and does not solve semidefinite programs. The existence of expander flows was also established by Arora, Rao, and Vazirani.
