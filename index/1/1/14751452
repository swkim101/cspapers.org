Increased product complexity has touched all aspects of testing: hardware, software, and procedures. The test data verification process is not immune to this increased complexity. Qualification, validation, and final inspection of the test data prior to its acceptance for use in production testing of printed circuit boards has matured to a science. Large test data volumes, circuit density, technology mixing, sophisticated testers, as well as the extensive product development process, have all contributed to this complexity. Recently, major emphasis and attention have been focused on this critical process. This paper explores the underlying problems associated with traditional test data verification. An effective approach, environment, and total strategy are proposed to deal with the test data verification challenge.
