Search in intranets and other collections of electronically available documents is the focus of this research prototype. We will demonstrate UKSearch, a search system that incorporates term hierarchies derived from markup structure. The term hierarchies our domain model are automatically constructed for the entire document collection and then applied to assist a user in the search process. Details can be found in [1]. We will show how UKSearch can be run on different document collections (Web sites) without the need for manual modification. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the system running on the BBC News domain: a user started by searching for “iraq” (one of the queries most frequently submitted to the BBC News site according to the log files we are using), and is now presented with the first level of the hierarchy of terms that has “iraq” as its root node. The user can also choose to ignore the suggestions and enter some query modification in the appropriate input field (e.g. “kay”). In any case the system will map the modified query against the domain model and initiate a new dialogue step. There is a heavy overlap between frequently submitted queries and the terms encoded in the domain model [1]. In other words frequent queries typically represent root nodes of the term hierarchies, and UKSearch can respond to any such user query as depicted in figure 1. Some evaluation results have been reported in [2]. Recently we have been able to acquire a substantial corpus of queries submitted in December 2003 to the search engine installed at the BBC Web site. This is the basis for a new task-based evaluation that is currently being performed. Results will be reported in a separate paper.
