Much of the literature on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is devoted to relatively small applications where simple metaphors are sufficient and where the emphasis is on productivity and minimization of learning times of naive users. Thus, in applications such as word processing, userâ€™s tasks are well understood and conventional techniques or alternative products are readily available to act as controls for user evaluation studies. In stark contrast, many areas in the practical industrial world present complex applications of engineering, scientific analysis or system control. In such applications the design of practical, usable interfaces presents formidable problems which have hardly been addressed by the HCI community. The magnitude of these problems stems from such considerations as consequences of the interface design for the risk to human life, enormous investment required for development, long time to project completion, potential consequences for industrial profitability or quality of life of the user and the fact that in some cases the tool under development has never before existed.
