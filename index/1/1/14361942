Mobile-enabled systems make use of mobile devices, RFID tags, sensor nodes, and other computing-enabled mobile devices to gather contextual data from users and the surrounding changing environment. Such systems produce computational data that can be stored and used in the field, shared between mobile and resident devices, and potentially uploaded to local servers or the cloud — a distributed, heterogeneous, context-aware, data production and consumption paradigm. Mobile-enabled systems have characteristics that make them different from traditional systems, such as limited resources, increased vulnerability, performance and reliability variability, and a finite energy source. There is significantly higher unpredictability in the execution environment of mobile apps. This workshop brings together experts from the software engineering and mobile computing communities — with notable participation from researchers and practitioners in the field of distributed systems, enterprise systems, cloud systems, ubiquitous computing, wireless sensor networks, and pervasive computing — to share results and open issues in the area of software engineering of mobile-enabled systems.
