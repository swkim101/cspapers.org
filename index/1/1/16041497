AIDE (ArchItecture Design Environment) is a modeling and simulation system designed to support the development of computer architectures. By providing a modular, hierarchical modeling environment plus interactive simulation and performance evaluation capabilities, AIDE facilitates the critical analysis necessary in top-down architecture designs. The system currently runs under the UNIX operating system on a VAX 11/780. This paper presents the organization of AIDE and discusses its application to computer architecture design.
