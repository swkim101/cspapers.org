In this paper we describe a new orbiting algorithm, called SHOCam, which enables simple, safe and visually attractive control of a camera moving around 3D objects. Compared with existing methods, SHOCam provides a more consistent mapping between the user's interaction and the path of the camera by substantially reducing variability in both camera motion and look direction. Also, we present a new orbiting method that prevents the camera from penetrating object(s), making the visual feedback -- and with it the user experience -- more pleasing and also less error prone. Finally, we present new solutions for orbiting around multiple objects and multi-scale environments.
