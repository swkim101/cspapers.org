In this paper, we present a novel hybrid recommender system called RelationalCF, which integrate content and demographic information into a collaborative filtering framework by using relational distance computation approaches without the effort of form transformation and feature construction. Our experiments suggest that the effective combination of various kinds of information based on relational distance approaches provides improved accurate recommendations than other approaches.
