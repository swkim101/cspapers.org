The goal of this work is to teach a robot to regrasp an object using knowledge obtained from human demonstration. This paper presents a task model that represents a human regrasping movement. The task model is based on the topological information and comprised of four task primitives. Human regrasping movement is recognised and represented as a sequence of these task primitives by the proposed recognition algorithm. The proposed method then maps each task primitive to the target robot hand using knowledge obtained from human demonstration. The experimental result verified the proposed task model by executing the regrasping movement on the real robot hand.
