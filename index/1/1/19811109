We demonstrate a new approach to refactoring which involves the decomposition of familiar high-level refactorings such as Extract method into their components. By understanding all refactorings as the introduction or elimination of degrees of freedom we show how a large proportion of programming edits are in fact micro-refactorings, and gain an insight into how tools that support these micro-refactorings could have a dramatic impact on developer productivity.
