As a test suite usually contains redundancy, a subset of the test suite (representative set) may still satisfy all the test objectives. As the redundancy increases the cost of executing the test suite, many test suite reduction techniques have been brought out in spite of the NP-completeness of the general problem of finding the optimal representative set of the test suite. In the literature, some experimental studies of test suite reduction techniques have already been reported, but there are still shortcomings of the studies of these techniques. This paper presents an experimental comparison of the four typical test suite reduction techniques: heuristic H, heuristic GRE, genetic algorithm-based approach and ILP-based approach. The aim of the study is to provide a guideline for choosing the appropriate test suite reduction techniques.
