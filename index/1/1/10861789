This paper discusses an active shaping method for an unknown rheological object by considering the characteristics of viscoelasticity. By utilizing a four-element model for approximating the dynamic characteristics of object's deformation, we drive the deformation decomposition into the elastic response and the plastic one. For shaping the object, we then propose a two-phase strategy for controlling the resultant deformation; in the first phase the viscoelastic parameters are estimated with avoiding the over deformation, based on the elastic response; in the second phase the desired resultant deformation is generated by actively managing the integral force, based on the plastic response. This strategy has an advance that the handling time of the robot is given by a finite time, while the desired resultant deformation is theoretically completed in the infinite time. We finally show experimental results for confirming the validity of the proposed strategy.
