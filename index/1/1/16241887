This paper presents a method to track in real-time a 3D textureless object which undergoes large deformations such as elastic ones, and rigid motions, using the point cloud data provided by an RGB-D sensor. This solution is expected to be useful for enhanced manipulation of humanoid robotic systems. Our framework relies on a prior visual segmentation of the object in the image. The segmented point cloud is registered first in a rigid manner and then by non-rigidly fitting the mesh, based on the Finite Element Method to model elasticity, and on geometrical point-to-point correspondences to compute external forces exerted on the mesh. The real-time performance of the system is demonstrated on synthetic and real data involving challenging deformations and motions.
