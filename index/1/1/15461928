Multiple-generation product strategy is favored in a variety of markets. Instead of introducing a single product to the market, companies incline to introduce a line of multiple-generation products to the market to better utilize technology assets and resources in an elongated time span. For such product development and launch scenarios, cannibalization can occur however. That is, when a new product generation comes to the market, the current generation is not withdrawn from the market but remains in the market to compete with the new one. In this research, we propose a new framework to predict the sales and introduction timing for every product generation in a multiple-generation product line. Based on historical sales trend from a similar product of an existing and mature market, the proposed framework can effectively predict the performance of the entire product line over its lifecycle. In this study, we demonstrate a case study implementing the proposed framework on Apple Incorporationâ€™s iPhone product line. The result shows that the forecast performance of the model is very close to real data.
