In the past few years, there has been considerableeffort by industryand governmentto develop secure operating systems. In recent months, the movie War Games and the Milwaukee 414 club have brought attention to the computer security problem long suppressed by embarrassed system administrators. One likely candidate for security enhancements is the UNIX operating system. The portability and sharing capabilities of UNIX have made it ideal for large-scale development projects as well as for the small workstation. LINUS IV is a UNIX-like system that preserves the UNIX environment while greatly increasing the protection within the system. This paper describes UNIX, security issues in computing, and how LINUS IV could enhance security in an easy-to-use system.
