Eavesdropping is becoming rampant on the Internet. We, as CERT-IT, have recorded a great number of sniffing attacks in the Italian community. In fact, sniffing is the most popular hacker's attack technique all over the Internet.

It is not to be considered as a definitive solution but rather as a "bandaid" solution, to deal with one of the most serious security threats of the moment.
