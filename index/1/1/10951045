We propose a method for automated gen- 
eration of adult humor by lexical replace- 
ment and present empirical evaluation re- 
sults of the obtained humor. We propose 
three types of lexical constraints as build- 
ing blocks of humorous word substitu- 
tion: constraints concerning the similarity 
of sounds or spellings of the original word 
and the substitute, a constraint requiring 
the substitute to be a taboo word, and con- 
straints concerning the position and con- 
text of the replacement. Empirical ev- 
idence from extensive user studies indi- 
cates that these constraints can increase 
the effectiveness of humor generation sig- 
nificantly.
