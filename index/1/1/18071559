The database and document worlds have traditionally had different approaches to security. Databases provide access controls on structured data, while document security interrogates the outgoing information, based on document markings and actual contents. For the emerging world in which many documents are generated from structured data (and vice versa), the separation can cause failure, implementation-dependence, inconsistency, and wasted effort. After comparing approaches and mechanisms in the two areas, we identify issues in security administration and implementation in military and medical applications. We then present elements of a unifying model.
