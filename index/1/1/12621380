To quote from CERN, the creators of the Web, “The World Wide Web (WWW) is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge. It is an initiative started at CERN, now with many participants. It has a body of software, and a set of protocols and conventions. WWW uses hypertext and multimedia techniques to make the web easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute to.”
