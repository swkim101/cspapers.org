Research is increasingly highlighting the potential for situated crowdsourcing to overcome some crucial limitations of online crowdsourcing. However, it remains unclear whether a situated crowdsourcing market can be sustained, and whether worker supply responds to price-setting in such a market. Our work is the first to systematically investigate workers' behaviour and response to economic incentives in a situated crowdsourcing market. We show that the market-based model is a sustainable approach to recruiting workers and obtaining situated crowdsourcing contributions. We also show that the price mechanism is a very effective tool for adjusting the supply of labour in a situated crowdsourcing market. Our work advances the body of work investigating situated crowdsourcing.
