Precise search of visually-similar vehicles poses a great challenge in computer vision, which needs to find exactly the same vehicle among a massive vehicles with visually similar appearances for a given query image. In this paper, we model the relationship of vehicle images as multiple grains. Following this, we propose two approaches to alleviate the precise vehicle search problem by exploiting multi-grain ranking constraints. One is Generalized Pairwise Ranking, which generalizes the conventional pairwise from considering only binary similar/dissimilar relations to multiple relations. The other is Multi-Grain based List Ranking, which introduces permutation probability to score a permutation of a multi-grain list, and further optimizes the ranking by the likelihood loss function. We implement the two approaches with multi-attribute classification in a multi-task deep learning framework. To further facilitate the research on precise vehicle search, we also contribute two high-quality and well-annotated vehicle datasets, named VD1 and VD2, which are collected from two different cities with diverse annotated attributes. As two of the largest publicly available precise vehicle search datasets, they contain 1,097,649 and 807,260 vehicle images respectively. Experimental results show that our approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.
