This paper introduces the programming language Modular Smalltalk, a descendant of the Smalltalk-80 programming language. Modular Smalltalk was designed to support teams of software engineers developing production application programs that can run independently of the environment in which they are developed. We first discuss our motivation for designing Modular Smalltalk. Specifically, we examine the properties of Smalltalk-80 that make it inappropriate for our purposes. We then present an overview of the design of Modular Smalltalk, with an emphasis on how it overcomes these weaknesses.
