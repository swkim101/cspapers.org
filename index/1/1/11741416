Uncertainty and conflicting stakeholders' objectives make many requirements and architecture decisions particularly hard. Quantitative probabilistic models allow software architects to analyse such decisions using stochastic simulation and multi-objective optimisation, but the difficulty of elaborating the models is an obstacle to the wider adoption of such techniques. To reduce this obstacle, this paper presents a novel modelling language and analysis tool, called RADAR, intended to facilitate requirements and architecture decision analysis. The language has relations to quantitative AND/OR goal models used in requirements engineering and to feature models used in software product lines. However, it simplifies such models to a minimum set of language constructs essential for decision analysis. The paper presents RADAR's modelling language, automated support for decision analysis, and evaluates its application to four real-world examples.
