1 Introduction GAMES-II is an european AIM project aiming at developing a general methodology for the construction of medical knowledge based systems (KBS) based on a general model of medical reasoning. Such a model splits medical reasoning in two subsequent steps. While the first one is aimed at selecting a set of hypotheses representing possible solutions of the problem at hand, the second one is aimed at testing each of them. Because of the paradigm on which it is rooted, the model has been dubbed select and test model (STModel). It can represent the three generic medical tasks: diagnosis, therapy planning and patient monitoring, by defining the knowledge roles played by the domain entities in each one of them. The GAMES-II methodology is based on three principles that have emerged during the last decade of AI research: (i) knowledge level modeling, (ii) reusability of both task and domain knowledge, (iii) integration of multiple reasoning techniques. The knowledge modeling (Newell, 1982) principle states that knowledge should be modeled on a higher level than that of exploited knowledge representation formalisms, to avoid premature design decisions, and to facilitate communication with domain experts. The second principle implies that the complexity of KBS development must, just as with any other engineering activity, be tackled by the construction of libraries of reusable components (Puerta et al., 1992). The third principle is based on the consideration that the "weak methods" are too weak, and therefore that KBS should use multiple specialised
