Recent demands in robotics accelerated the growth of high precision technology using parallel mechanism in various applications such as medicine, environmental investigations, industry, inteligent systems etc. Maintaining the desired dynamic behavior of systems in the face of perturbations and other uncertainties has become the ultimate goal in stability of robotic systems, [1]. In some robotic systems the external disturbances cannot be accurately predicted. However, the appropriately chosen parameters can be kept inside acceptable boundaries.
