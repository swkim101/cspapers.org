We have successfully produced emulsion droplets on a chip with size-control and on-demand droplet generation by using magnetically driven microtool (MMT) which has a parallel plate structure to be constrained in translational motion. With a lateral motion of MMT in microchannels, the continuous phase can be cut into different size of droplets and the dispersed phase flow can inflow into the microchannels by the movement of MMT to obtain both of size-controlled and on-demand droplets actively. The size range of the produced droplet was three times as large as the previous system by using novel hydraulic design of the chip, and also the dispersing the fluid was successfully prevented from leakage when it is chopped by using MMT.
