We present a dimension measurement visualization technique using a consumer tablet device. A user is able to control the position and size of a virtual dimension image and confirm the specified dimension on the camera view. The system utilizes speaker and microphone sensor as distance detector to extract information needed for correct sizing of the visualized measurement. Our technique does not require the use of a physical marker or a view of the ground. We implemented a module that could cope with a noisy environment. We also implemented a guide mark module that enables use of the system when multiple objects are presented in the camera view.
