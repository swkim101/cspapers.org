Fully automated compilation of sequential Fortran to efficient multitasking code is impractical; tools need to be developed to aid users in interactively converting sequential to multitasking Fortran. This paper reports on experience using an interactive Parallelizing Assistant Tool (PAT) to convert sequential Fortran applications (ranging from short benchmarks to large application programs) to Cray microtasking Fortran, and discusses the advantages and limitations of interactive parallelization. We also introduce a taxonomy of task parallelization.
