Multi-label classification with many classes has recently drawn a lot of attention. Existing methods address this problem by performing linear label space transformation to reduce the dimension of label space, and then conducting independent regression for each reduced label dimension. These methods however do not capture nonlinear correlations of the multiple labels and may lead to significant information loss in the process of label space reduction. In this paper, we first propose to exploit kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) to capture nonlinear label correlation information and perform nonlinear label space reduction. Then we develop a novel label space reduction method that explicitly combines linear and nonlinear label space transformations based on CCA and KCCA respectively to address multi-label classification with many classes. The proposed method is a feature-aware label transformation method that promotes the label predictability in the transformed label space from the input features. We conduct experiments on a number of multi-label classification datasets. The proposed approach demonstrates good performance, comparing to a number of state-of-the-art label dimension reduction methods.
