In this paper we treat the problem of subdividing a database and allocating the fragments to the sites in a distributed database system in order to maximize non-duplicative parallelism. Our goal is to establish a conceptual framework for distributing data without being committed to specific cost models.We introduce the concept of "local sufficiency" as a measure of parallelism, and show how certain classes of queries lead naturally to irredundant partitions of a database that are locally sufficient. For classes of queries for which no irredundant distribution is locally sufficient, we offer ways to introduce redundancy in achieving local sufficiency
