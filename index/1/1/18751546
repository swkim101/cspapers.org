Repair based techniques are a standard way of dealing with inconsistency in the context of ontology based data access.We propose a novel nonobjection inference relation (along with its variants) where a query is considered as valid if it follows from at least one repair and it is consistent with all the repairs. These inferences are strictly more productive than universal inference while preserving the consistency of its set of conclusions. We study the productivity and properties of the new inferences. We also give experimental results of the proposed nonobjection inference.
