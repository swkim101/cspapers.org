In today's world, brand based shopping is popular especially in product lines like clothing and shoes, appliances, and electronics. Because of the importance of brands while shopping, it has become important for online shopping portals to consider brand loyalty and brand preferences of users. In this paper, we describe a system designed for brand-based shopping and exploration. The system is built by analyzing a large query set consisting of 115M queries from eBay.com -- a vibrant marketplace with more than 95M active users. The system allows brand-pivoted exploration of inventory. It allows exploration and purchase of substitute branded goods (e.g. Sony camcorder for Canon camcorder) and complementary branded merchandise (e.g. Lego castle set for Lego train station set).
