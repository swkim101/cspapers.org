In this paper we describe a new "research and action" based course designed to give undergraduate students the opportunity to think beyond the classroom, to reach out and examine some of the broader issues surrounding computing. "Understanding and Broadening the Images of Computing" researches the images, the realities and the (mis)perceptions of computing that influence public understanding and participation in the field. Along with research students are encouraged to see themselves as future professionals who can be actively involved in re-shaping and re-presenting the field. To this purpose, students build an action component working in teams to develop and implement a public presentation aimed at broadening understanding of computing.
