This paper describes the development of a senior computer design laboratory, the purpose of which is to provide an environment where the computer design experience is as realistic and complete as possible for each student. In this laboratory, which is required for the whole senior year, students undertake the design of a CPU-based system that may be stand-alone or a part of another system. The design effort is as complete as possible, starting with a development proposal, including the hardware design and construction, and development of all necessary software in the C language, and concluding with extensive documentation. Thus, the students are encouraged to put to use a considerable amount of knowledge acquired in previous courses including computer architecture and interfacing, algorithm, languages and operating systems. They become members in groups that design components, with complexity approaching levels found in commercial products and are well prepared to become computer engineers.
