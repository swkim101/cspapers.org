This paper presents a systematic test methodology targeting bus line interconnect defects using IDDT testing and Boundary Scan. Traditional test is unable to detect all possible defects, especially timing-related faults. Open and short defects on interconnects between embedded modules can be detected by IDDT testing. Boundary Scan can provide accessibility to internal buses. A statistical analysis is presented discussing the uncertain factors due to process variations and power fluctuation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique on shorts, opens or the other non stuck-at fault type defects is also illustrated.
