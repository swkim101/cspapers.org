We present Episodic Logic (EL), a highly expressive knowledge representation well-adapted to general commonsense reasoning as well as the interpretive and inferential needs of natural language processing. One of the distinctive features of EL is its extremely permissive ontology, which admits situations (episodes, events, states of affairs, etc.), propositions, possible facts, and kinds and collections, and which allows representation of generic sentences. EL is natural language-like in appearance and supports intuitively understandable inferences. At the same time it is both formally analyzable and mechanizable as an efficient inference engine.
