This work describes how the localisation of autonomous underwater vehicles can be supported through networked acoustic communication. The localisation approach includes timing information within acoustic messages to create an interrogation scheme similar to that of long-baseline methods, but realised at the application level of the network. In this way, the network itself is able to provide vehicle localisation information, reducing the needs for additional on-board sensors or dedicated deployed platforms/transponders. The aim of this work is to report at sea localisation results as obtained in two completely different application scenarios. The first one is represented by the FP7 MORPH project (HORTA15 sea trial) where the proposed approach has been applied to support navigation of a fleet of AUVs in a tight formation and in very shallow waters. The second application is represented by the NATO STO CMRE multistatic network demonstrator with the acoustic network used to support navigation of AUVs working in large operational areas. In this latter case, results are given from the COLLAB-NGAS14 experimental campaign.
