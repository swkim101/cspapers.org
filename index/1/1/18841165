In this paper, we address the problem of buffer management in a DBMS when the workload consists of transactions of different priority levels. We present Priority-Hints. a new buffer management algorithm that uses hints provided by the DBMS access methods. The performance of Priority-Hints is compared to that of priority buffer management schemes introduced earlier for a variety of workloads. Our simulation results indicate that Priority-Hints performs consistently better than simple LRU-based algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm approaches (and in some cases surpasses) the performance of highly sophisticated algorithms that require much more information to be provided to the buffer manager.
