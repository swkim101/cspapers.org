Problem and goal. The planning of software projects takes place under considerable uncertainty. For various reasons, the time needed to complete a development activity in a software project is hard to estimate. Feedback between activities in the process causes rework and delays. These circumstances make project scheduling a notoriously difficult task for the managers of software projects. The goal of this paper is to begin a systematic study of how the choice of good (or even optimal) scheduling decisions in a software project depends on certain characteristics of the project or product, such as the strength of the coupling between the components or the degree of specialization of the teams on different tasks. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop guidelines for managers how to schedule their software projects in the best possible way.
