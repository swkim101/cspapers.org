Let f be a partial recursive function defined in terms of other functions g1,...,gn such that f converges if and only if some well defined assertions about the convergency of g1,...,gn hold: then we can find a total function (depending on the number of steps required to compute g1,...,gn) that bounds the step counting function of f almost everywhere f is defined. It is also shown that, in that case, to compute the bound to the step counting function is not much harder than computing the step counting function itself.
