This work proposes a kinematic control method for human-robot handshake motions achieving fast motion synchronization given a preset internal robot handshake motion and a compliance level that reflects the robot's level of passiveness. The proposed method combines a non-linear dynamic system having an attractive limit cycle with an admittance controller and an adaptation mechanism so that interaction forces are minimized and a consensus oscillation is achieved between the engaging participants. The proposed method is validated by experimenting with a KUKA LWR4+ 7dof arm under various scenarios.
