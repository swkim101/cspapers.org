It has become common in statistical studies of natural language data to use measures of lexical association, such as the information-theoretic measure of mutual information, to extract useful relationships between words (e.g. [Church et al., 1989; Church and Hanks, 1989; Hindle, 1990]). For example, [Hindle, 1990] uses an estimate of mutual information to calculate what nouns a verb can take as its subjects and objects, based on distributions found within a large corpus of naturally occurring text.
