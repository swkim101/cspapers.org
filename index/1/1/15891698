We compare various document clustering techniques including K-means, SVD-based method and a graph-based approach and their performance on short text data collected from Twitter. We define a measure for evaluating the cluster error with these techniques. Observations show that graph-based approach using affinity propagation performs best in clustering short text data with minimal cluster error.
