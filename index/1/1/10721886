The walk, which was originally designed for and tested on an actual Nao robot before being employed in the 2011 RoboCup 3D simulation competition, was the crucial component in the UT Austin Villa team winning the competition in 2011. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that robot behavior has been conceived and constructed on a real robot for the end purpose of being used in simulation.  The walk is based on a double linear inverted pendulum model, and multiple sets of its parameters are optimized via a novel framework. The framework optimizes parameters for different tasks in conjunction with one another, a little-understood problem with substantial practical significance.  Detailed experiments show that the UT Austin Villa agent significantly outperforms all the other agents in the competition with the optimized walk being the key to its success.
