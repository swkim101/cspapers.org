In order to realize many of the potential benefits associated with robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery, the robot must be more than a remote controlled device. Currently using a surgical robot can be challenging, fatiguing, and time consuming. Teaching the robot to actively assist surgical tasks, such as suturing, has the potential to vastly improve both patient outlook and the surgeon's efficiency. One obstacle to completing surgical sutures autonomously is the difficulty in tracking surgical suture threads. This paper proposes an algorithm which uses a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve to model a suture thread. The NURBS model is initialized from a single selected point located on the thread. The NURBS curve is optimized by minimizing the image match energy between the projected stereo NURBS image and the segmented thread image. The algorithm is able to accurately track a suture thread as it translates, deforms, and changes length in real-time.
