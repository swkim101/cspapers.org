We propose a method of real-time monocular camera-based localization in known environments. With the goal of controlling high-speed micro air vehicles (MAVs), we localize with respect to a mesh map of the environment that can support both pose estimation and trajectory planning. Using only limited hardware that can be carried on a MAV, we achieve accurate pose estimation at rates above 50 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art mesh-based localization algorithms. In our simultaneous tracking and rendering (STAR) approach, we render virtual images of the environment and track camera images with respect to them using a robust semi-direct image alignment technique. Our main contribution is the decoupling of camera tracking from virtual image rendering, which drastically reduces the number of rendered images and enables accurate full camera-rate tracking without needing a high-end GPU. We demonstrate our approach in GPS-denied indoor environments.
