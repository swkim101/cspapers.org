This paper attempts to tackle the problem of lipreading by building visual sequence classifiers that are based on salient temporal signatures. The temporal signatures used in this paper allow us to capture spatio-temporal information that can span multiple feature dimensions with gaps in the temporal axis. Selecting suitable temporal signatures by exhaustive search is not possible given the immensely large search space. As an example, the temporal sequence used in this paper would require exhaustively evaluating 22000 temporal signatures which is simply not possible. To address this, a novel gradient-descent based method is proposed to search for a suitable candidate temporal signature. Crucially, this is achieved very efficiently with O(nD) complexity, where D is the static feature vector dimensionality and n the maximum length of the temporal signatures considered. We then integrate this temporal search method into the AdaBoost algorithm. The results are spatio-temporal strong classifiers that can be applied to multi-class recognition in the lipreading domain. We provide experimental results evaluating the performance of our method against existing work in both subject dependent and subject independent cases demonstrating state of the art performance. Importantly, this was also achieved with a small set of temporal signatures.
