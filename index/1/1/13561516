A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is used to model objects of different types and their relationships. Meta-paths are sequences of object types. They are used to represent complex relationships between objects beyond what links in a homogeneous network capture. We study the problem of classifying objects in an HIN. We propose class-level meta-paths and study how they can be used to (1) build more accurate classifiers and (2) improve active learning in identifying objects for which training labels should be obtained. We show that class-level meta-paths and object classification exhibit interesting synergy. Our experimental results show that the use of class-level meta-paths results in very effective active learning and good classification performance in HINs.
