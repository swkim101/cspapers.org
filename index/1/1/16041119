We present a representational format for observed movements The representation has a temporal structure relating components of a single complex movement. We also present OXBOW, an unsupervised learning system, which constructs classes of these movements. Empirical results indicate that the system builds abstract movement concepts with appropriate component structure allowing it to predict the latter portions of a partially observed movement.
