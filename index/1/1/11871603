CEMTool is a command style design and analyzing package for scientific and technological algorithm and a matrix based computation language. In this paper, we present new FEM (finite element method) package in CEMTool environment. In contrast to the existing MATLAB PDE Toolbox, our proposed FEM package can deal with the combination of the reserved words. Also, we can control the mesh in a very effective way. With the introduction of new mesh generation algorithm and NDM (nested dissection method), our FEM package can guarantee the shorter computational time than MATLAB PDE Toolbox. In addition, using the advanced electromagnetics library of CEMTool FEM package, we can analyze the practical problems such as the motor field analysis. Consequently, with our new FEM package, we can overcome some disadvantages of the existing MATLAB PDE Toolbox
