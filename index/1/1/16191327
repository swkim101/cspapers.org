We present a method for planning and execution in very high-dimensional mixed discrete and continuous spaces in the presence of uncertainty using an implicit, factored approximation representation of pre-images and extend it to planning in belief space. We demonstrate the approach in a mobile-manipulation domain combining pushing with pick-and-place manipulation with error in sensing and manipulation. We show empirically that execution monitoring using pre-images improves computational efficiency over continual replanning, and that the hierarchical planning method it enables provides further efficiency improvements.
