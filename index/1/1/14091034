The paper presents Leviathan, an LTL satisfiability checking tool based on a novel one-pass, treelike tableau system, which is way simpler than existing solutions. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, the tool has performance comparable in speed and memory consumption with other tools on a number of standard benchmark sets, and, in various cases, it outperforms the other tableau-based tools.
