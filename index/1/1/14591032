This paper reports a new dynamic programming environment for FDNet. The FDNet was designed as a flexible system that can accept new functions by reforming the network itself. Another feature that the relation networks in FDNet are described by XML can help to expand the network scale easily. Our new dynamic editing system uses the feature, and communicates via TCP/IP network for editing. Some trials reported in this paper shows a capability of an automatic self-editing function in the imitating robot system.
