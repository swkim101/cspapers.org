In this paper we describe an approach towards integrating mid-range sensing data into a dynamic path planning algorithm. The key problem, sensing for planning is addressed in the context of outdoor navigation. An algorithmic approach is described towards solving these problems and both simulation results and initial experimental results for outdoor navigation using wide baseline stereo data are presented.
