We present the first study on the approximability of geometric versions of the unique coverage problem and the minimum membership set cover problem. In the former problem, one is given a family of sets of elements from some universe and aims to select sets that maximize the number of elements contained in precisely one selected set. Unique Coverage has important applications in wireless networks and it is thus natural to consider it in a geometric setting. We use the well-known (unit) disk model for wireless networks and show that Unique Coverage remains NP-hard in this case and present a polynomial-time 1/18-approximation algorithm. This algorithm is extended to the budgeted low-coverage problem, where covering can element multiple times yields less profit and we have a fixed budget to 'buy' sets. We give an asymptotic FPTAS in case the disks have arbitrary size, but bounded ply. For the case that the geometric objects are arbitrary fat objects, we show that these problems are as hard to approximate as in the general case. In the minimum membership set cover problem, the goal is to cover all elements while minimizing the maximum number of sets in which any element is contained. For unit squares and unit disks, we show that the problem remains NP-hard and does not admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with ratio smaller than 2 unless P=NP. For unit squares, we give a 5-approximation algorithm for instances where the optimum objective value is bounded by a constant.
