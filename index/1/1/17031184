Continuum structures with a very high or infinite number of degrees of freedom (DOF) are very interesting structures in nature. Mimicking this kind of structures artificially is challenging due to the high number of required DOF. This paper presents a kinematic and dynamic model for an underwater robotic manipulator inspired by Octopus vulgaris. Then, a prototype arm inspired by live octopus is presented and the model validated experimentally. Initial comparisons of simulated and experimental results show good agreement.
