Fault monitoring is an important concern to be addressed for distributed system. With the help of an efficient fault monitoring scheme, it would be easy to determine the crash and quickly take the recovery steps. Fault monitor typically detects faults by sending and receiving messages to remote objects. We enhanced our technique ACID further with experimenting with giving precedence to the most recent response in the queue and reducing the influence factor of the last response. We tested the enhanced technique eACID to the parameters i.e. adaptiveness to the environment, convergence to the optimal value of timeout and self intelligence for not loading or pushing the object that is being monitored . We experimented with our technique along with some other proposed techniques, our scheme; eACID gave better results when compared with the schemes.
