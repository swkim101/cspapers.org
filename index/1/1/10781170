Refactoring object-oriented (OO) code to aspects is an error-prone task. To support this task, this paper presents ConcernReCS, an Eclipse plug-in to help developers to avoid recurring mistakes during software aspectization. Based on a map of concerns, ConcernReCS automatically finds and reports error-prone scenarios in OO source code; i.e., before the concerns have been refactored to aspects.
