It is well known that pragmatic knowledge is useful and necessary in many difficult language processing tasks, but because this knowledge is difficult to acquire and process automatically, it is rarely used. We present an open information extraction technique for automatically extracting a particular kind of pragmatic knowledge from text, and we show how to integrate the knowledge into a Markov Logic Network model for quantifier scope disambiguation. Our model improves quantifier scope judgments in experiments.
