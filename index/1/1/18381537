The design, implementation, and deployment of a new computer system for closed loop control of the JASON underwater robot at full ocean depth is described. Several design principles for the rapid development of large scale robot control systems are articulated and illustrated with examples from the JASON system. The use of subsystems with differing computer architectures permit effective matching of capability to function. A two-part system design partitions safety-critical from nonsafety-critical subsystems for cost-effective implementation and enhancement. A machine-independent message-passing communication protocol, JasonTalk, enables integration of disparate computer architectures into a unified system. Results from a recent JASON deployment in the Pacific Ocean are discussed.
