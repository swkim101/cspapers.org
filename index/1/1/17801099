In this paper a model-free approach for damping control of Variable Stiffness Actuators is proposed. The idea is to take advantage of the possibility to change the stiffness of the actuators in controlling the damping. The problem of minimizing the terminal energy for a one degree of freedom spring-mass model with controlled stiffness is first considered. The optimal bang-bang control law uses a maximum stiffness when the link gets away from the desired position, i.e. the link velocity is decreasing, and a minimum one when the link is going towards it, i.e. the link velocity is increasing. Based on Lyapunov stability theorems the obtained law has been proved to be stable for a multi-DoF system. Finally, the proposed control law has been tested and validated through experimental tests.
