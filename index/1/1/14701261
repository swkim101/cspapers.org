Statistical simulation systems can provide an accurate and efficient way to carry out early design studies for processors. One such system, HLS, has a rapid simulation capability, but our experiments demonstrate that several modeling improvements are possible. The front-end graph structure in HLS is hampered by workload modeling at the instruction level that reduces the accuracy of program simulation. The workload and processor models require significant changes to provide accurate results for a variety of benchmarks. We improve HLS by modeling the workload at the granularity of the basic block and by changing the processor model to more closely reflect components in modern microprocessors. The specific techniques improve HLS accuracy by a factor of 3.78 at the cost of increased storage and runtime requirements. Our examination of HLS points to a pitfall for simulator developers: reliance on a single small set of benchmarks to qualify a simulation system. A simple regression model shows that the SPECint95 benchmarks, the original benchmarks used to calibrate HLS, have characteristics that yield to very simple modeling.
