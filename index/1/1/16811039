and correctness of dml programs can be proved. An axiomatic basis for defining the semantics of navigational data manipulation languages is presented. This basis consists of an abstraction of the network data model achieved by three abstract data types, an assertion language to express Properties of database states, and a DML to Program the transactions. The proof rules of the DML constructs and the axioms defined on the data types can be used to establish the correctness of transactions. Potential applications of the proposed formalism in language design, semantic definition of existing languages, and integrity management, are outlined via examples.
