We present a variant of the Ajtai-Dwork public-key cryptosystem where the size of the public-key is only <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>log <i>n</i>) bits and the encrypted text/clear text ratio is also <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>log <i>n</i>). This is true with the assumption that all of the participants in the cryptosystem share <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>log <i>n</i>) random bits which has to be picked only once and the users of the cryptosystem get them e.g. together with the software implementing the protocol. The public key is a random lattice with an <i>n</i><sup>c</sup>-unique nonzero shortest vector, where the constant <i>c</i>>1‾2 can be picked arbitrarily close to 1‾2, and we pick the lattice according to a distribution described in the paper. We do not prove a worst-case average-case equivalence but the security of the system follows from the hardness of a randomized diophantine approximation problem related to a well-known theorem of Dirichlet.
