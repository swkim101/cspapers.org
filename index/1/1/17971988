This paper presents a control method to implement trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection characteristics for the link-side dynamics of compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear spring characteristics. This is achieved by introducing new motor coordinates reflecting the damping and feedforward terms and shaping the dynamics of the motor such that it structurally equals the dynamics in the original coordinates. Thus, the approach achieves the control goal while changing the original plant dynamics only to a minimum extent. Passivity, stability, and convergence properties of the closed loop dynamics are proven. The performance of the control approach has been experimentally evaluated on the variable stiffness robot arm DLR Hand Arm System, where the stiffness in each of the joints is highly nonlinear. To our best knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated tracking controller for compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear elastic elements.
