Computer systems technology today has become so complex that a mere lecture style of teaching is no longer a viable means of instruction. Professionals in the field must have a strong familiarity with hardware devices, systems design concepts, data base techniques, and telecommunications. Many feel that students can only learn these techniques through integrated laboratory assignments. Thus, one of the major thrusts in computer science today is the establishment of a laboratory learning environment in which students work independently and in teams to solve various types of integrated design problems.This panel session is dedicated to a discussion of the types of hardware, their application in the teaching of computer and information sciences, and methods for acquiring the necessary equipment. The panelists for this discussion have either established or are in the process of establishing a computer laboratory. Each panelist will describe their approach to the computer laboratory design, the purposes for which the equipment is to be used, student and faculty reaction to the usage of the lab, and administrative problems associated with implementing and operating a computer laboratory.
