Modern cars integrate a huge number of functionalities with high bandwidth, real-time, and reliability requirements. Ethernet offers the possibility to satisfy these bandwidth requirements and enables the usage of temporal redundancy mechanisms to increase the reliability of the communication network. In this paper, we present a lightweight formal analysis approach for the determination of the transmission reliability of messages in switched Ethernet networks under the influence of transient errors. In particular, this approach takes the interrelation between the individual message reliability and the timing behavior of the communication network into account. We present both a fast approach delivering a pessimistic safe reliability bound and a more sophisticated approach that results in a tighter yet still safe bound. The proposed approaches are compared by performing a design space exploration of an automotive communication network.
