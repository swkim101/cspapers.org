A growing number of approaches and tools have been utilised attempting at generating hypertext content with embedded metadata. However, little work has been carried out on finding a generic solution for publishing and styling Web pages with annotations derived from existing RDF data sets available in various formats. This paper proposes a metadata-driven publishing framework assisting publishers or webmasters in generating semantically-enriched content (HTML pages or snippets) by harnessing distributed RDF(a) documents or repositories with little human intervention. This framework also helps users to create and share so-called micro-themes, which is applicable to the above generated content for the purpose of page styling and also highly reusable thanks to the adopted semantic attribute selectors.
