Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is evolving as an attractive alternative to other public-key schemes such as RSA by offering the smallest key size and the highest strength per bit. The importance of ECC has been recognized by the US government and the standards bodies NIST and SECG. Standards for preferred elliptic curves over prime fields GF(p) and binary polynomial fields GF(2m) as well as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) have been created. A security protocol based on ECC requires support for different curves representing different security levels. This is particularly true for server applications that are exposed to requests for secure connections with different parameters generated by a multitude of client devices. Reported implementations of ECC over GF(2m) typically choose to implement each curve as a special case so that modular reduction can be optimized, thus improving the overall performance. In contrast, this paper focuses on generic implementations of ECC point multiplication for arbitrary curves over GF(2m). We present a novel reduction algorithm that allows hardware and software implementations for variable field degrees m. Though not as high in performance as an implementation optimized for a specific curve, it offers an attractive solution to supporting infrequently used curves or curves not known at the time of the implementation.
