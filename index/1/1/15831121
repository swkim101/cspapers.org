poster, we introduce the mechanism of handling the ordering structure of XML data by using the Nested Relational Sequence Database System (NRSD), which is built upon the Nested Relational Sequence Model (NRSM) we developed earlier on. We demonstrate that the storing and querying of XML data are desirable over an NRS relation, which we incorporate an index system into the NRSD. Our preliminary experimental results show that the NRSD provides benefits of minimizing the storage size while maintaining the following three types of order in XML data: the ancestor order, the sibling order and the value order.
