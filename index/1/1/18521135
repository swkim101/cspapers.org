In this paper, we give an algorithm for output-sensitive construction of an j-face polytope that is defined by n halfspaces in E4. Our algorithm runs in O((n + f)log2 f) time and uses O(n + j) space. This is the first algorithm within a polylogarithmic factor of optimal O(nlogf + j) time over the whole range of j. By a standard lifting map, we obtain output-sensitive algorithms for the Voronoi diagram or Delaunay triangulation in E3 and for the portion of a Voronoi diagram that is clipped to a convex polytope. Our approach also simplifies the “ultimate convex hull algorithm” of Kirkpatrick and Seidel in E2.
