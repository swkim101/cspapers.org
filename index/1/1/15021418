Smart home technology provides benefits for the elderly in six primary categories: safety, health and nutrition, physical activity, personal hygiene and care, social engagement, and leisure. Safety is about detecting and mitigating, if not removing, hazards from the user's environment. Social engagement relates to the smart home functions that allow the elderly to combat social isolation, such as by connecting the elderly with friends and family. Leisure activities are about how a smart home can allow users to spend their free time. Physical Activity relates to the concept of movement from the user, such as having them engage in non-sedentary activities. Nutrition and Health is related to the monitoring of a user's state of health. Personal hygiene and care encompasses the ways that a smart home can improve the user's well-being and assist in his/her daily activities. This workshop paper will present existing technologies in the aforementioned fields and highlight areas where development is lacking. In addition, an evaluation on past smart home designs is conducted to determine whether they fulfill the six proposed primary categories.
