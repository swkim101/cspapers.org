This paper describes a course-related project in concurrent programming using the Ada language. Dijkstra’s famous “dining philosophers” problem [Dijkstra 71] is used as a vehicle for developing a program rich enough in system construction problems to be realistic yet small enough to be manageable in a classroom situation. The program-PortabIe Diners—is also nicely animated and fun to observe in execution.
