Distribution in Parallel Programs for Distributed Memory Multiprocessors Michael Gerndt University of Vienna Institute for Statistics and Computer Science Ratllausstr. 19/11/3 A-101O Vienna, Austria EMAIL: A4424DANQAWlUNIl l. bitnet One of the most important issues in parallel programming for distributed memory multiprocessors is to distribute data and work in a cooperative way, so that data are mostly available where they are needed. This paper discusses masking, a technique to distribute work among parallel processes running on a distributed memory multiprocessor. This technique was developed for the parallelization of Fortran 77 programs for the SUP RENUM supercomputer. In the semi-automatic parallelization system SUPERB we implemented masking on the basis of a user defined data distribution. Both concepts, data and work distribution, are very general concepts and can be applied to parallel programs for all kinds of multiprocessors based on memory hierarchies.
