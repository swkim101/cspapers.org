Previous research often focus on social influence analysis in network-level or topic-level. In this paper, we concentrate on predicting item-level social influence to reveal the users' influences in a more fine-grained level. We formulate the social influence prediction problem as the estimation of a user-post matrix, where each entry in the matrix represents the social influence strength the corresponding user has given the corresponding web post. To deal with the sparsity and complex factor challenges in the research, we model the problem by extending the probabilistic matrix factorization method to incorporate rich prior knowledge on both user dimension and web post dimension, and propose the Probabilistic Hybrid Factor Matrix Factorization (PHF-MF) approach. Intensive experiments are conducted on a real world online social network to demonstrate the advantages and characteristics of the proposed method.
