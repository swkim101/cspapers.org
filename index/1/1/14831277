Autonomous mobile robots need very reliable navigation capabilities in order to operate unattended for long periods of time. This paper reports on first results of a research program that uses par tially observable Markov models to robustly track a robots location in office environments and to direct its goal-oriented actions. The approach explicitly maintains a probability distribution over the possible locations of the robot taking into account various sources of uncertainly including approximate knowledge of the environment and actuator and sensor uncertainty. A novel feature of our approach is its integration of topological map information with approximate metric information. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach in controlling an actual indoor mobile robot navigating corridors.
