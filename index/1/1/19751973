In this paper, we present the design of input-output coupler systems using two and three volume gratings with 45deg slant angle at 1550 nm wavelength. DuPont HRF-600 photopolymer is used for both producing a planar waveguide and constructing the embedded Bragg grating coupler. With 5times5 mm grating size, simulation results reveal that total system throughput will reach nearly 60% for two-grating and 70% for three-grating input-output coupler system. This scheme can also apply to holographic beam splitter.
