While Jacobson OOSE’s concept of use cases for functional requirements modeling for software systems and for business process reengineering has been widely adopted in the software community, the concept has been neither understood properly nor practiced effectively as evidenced by the success rates of numerous large and medium projects attempting to apply use case driven object-oriented software engineering . This report discusses the author’s experience with projects whose success or failure from technical view point was affected by use case modeling policies adopted in those projects. It discusses the specific reasons where they went wrong and how it should have been handled. While the problems the author has identified in this report and his recommendations to solve those problems extremely important to successful project management, they have not been discussed before.
