ABLE, an array-based linguistic editor, is a layout modeling language for storage/logic arrays (SLA's) that is based on the LISP programming language. This paper describes ABLE's design, presents an ABLE layout program, and evaluates ABLE's usefulness in SLA-based circuit design. ABLE embodies a linguistic approach to computer-aided design (CAD) for very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits; digital system designers can represent SLA-based integrated circuits as relatively abstract and highly flexible ABLE layout programs. The informational complexity of VLSI design can be reduced both by using straightforward CAD algorithms based on the SLA structured logic layout technique, and by using user-definable procedural models within LISP-based layout modeling languages.
