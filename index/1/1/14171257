An intelligent kiosk is a public information kiosk that senses the presence of humans and communicates in a natural way. To examine issues of human-kiosk interaction, we have built and deployed two versions of intelligent kiosks. The first kiosk design combines machine vision to locate and track people in the vicinity with an animated talking head that focuses on clients and talks to them. The second kiosk design uses infrared and sonar sensors to sense clients and multiple interacting agents to communicate with the client. The foremost lessons learned from public trials include (1) people are attracted to an animated face that watches them, (2) small mobile agents interact better with kiosk content than a single fixed face, (3) speaker-independent speech recognition is only useful in targeted applications, and (4) the quality of the content on the kiosk strongly influences the client's evaluation of the quality of the technology.
