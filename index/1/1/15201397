In this paper the problem of delayed virtual environments in haptics is addressed. We show that the approach outlined is no longer passive in case of (computational) delay on the output of the virtual environment. Passivity can be recovered using scattering theory; a discretization algorithm which leads to a discrete passive port-Hamiltonian systems with respect to any delay on the output is proposed.
