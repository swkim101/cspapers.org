Datapac is the public, packet-switched data communication network recently introduced into service by the Trans-Canada Telephone System. It supports two distinct categories of services - 'priority' and 'normal', where the priorities are user assigned. The delay performance for the Datapac services is specified in terms of the 'average delay' as well as '90th percentile delay' for priority and normal class packets. This paper presents some queueing models for estimating packet delays in the communication subnetwork of Datapac. The models can be applied for analyzing the sensitivity of packet delays to changes in such system parameters as: link capacities, link occupancies, relative packet lengths for priority and normal class packets and relative mix of priority and normal class packets.
