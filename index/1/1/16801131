Retrieval system evaluation plays an important role in judging the efficiency and effectiveness of the retrieval process. Several different evaluation criteria, deemed most critical to user population, were pointed out ir(SALTON83, CLEVERDON70]; namely, recall, precision, effort, time, form of presentation and coverage. Among them, recall and precision have received the most attention in the literature. Recall is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant documents that are retrieved to the total number of relevant documents. Preci&n, on the other hand, is the number of relevant documenrs retrieved divided by the number of retrieved documents. In particular, a recall-precision graph is often used as a combined evaluation measure of retrieval systems. Such a graph, given an arbitrary recall point, tells us the corresponding precision value.
