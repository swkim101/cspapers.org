In this paper, we address issues related to the reengineering of large-scale software systems. The key to the software re-engineering activity is the ability to recover (re-engineer) "lost" or otherwise unavailable information concerning specification and system design decisions from the information available in the existing system source code. Subsequently, a forward engineering step may reimplement and possibly upgrade the existing systems. This paper describes the underlying princi- ples of a knowlkige-based Software Re-engineering Environment (SRE) which is intended to provide high-level support to various software maintenance and re-engineering activities.
