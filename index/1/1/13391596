We Imbed Into a first order logic a representation language that combines a temporal knowledge with time stamps in a hierarchical fashion. Each time structure contains its own chronology of events: sufficient information for an encoding of a classical temporal logic. By quantifying over time structures, we encode a modal logic of temporal knowledge. In addition, we show how to achieve the effect of nonmonotonic inference, by simulating preferential entailment within a first order framework.
