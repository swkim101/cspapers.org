We consider an extension of omega-regular expressions where two new variants of the Kleene star L* are added: LB and LS . These exponents act as the standard star, but restrict the number of iterations to be bounded (for LB) or to tend toward infinity (for LS). These expressions can define languages that are not omega-regular. We develop a theory for these languages. We study the decidability and closure questions. We also define an equivalent automaton model, extending Buchi automata. This culminates with a - partial -complementation result
