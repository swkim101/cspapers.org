We introduce a privacy management approach that leverages users' memory and opinion of their friends to set policies for other similar friends. We refer to this new approach as Same-As Privacy Management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our privacy management improvements, we implemented a prototype Facebook application and conducted an extensive user study. We demonstrated considerable reductions in policy authoring time using Same-As Privacy Management over traditional group based privacy management approaches. Finally, we presented user perceptions, which were very encouraging.
