New forms of natural user interfaces, particularly tabletops, are now a possibility due to the staggering advances in sensing and display technology. There is an immediate need for corresponding progress on the foundational software for exploiting the potential of these new hardware products. This requires research into natural and effective gestural interaction, with careful consideration of the core facilities needed for effective and consistent use. At the same time, an exploration of real-world tabletop applications will provide a basis for studying and advancing the core functionality.
 In this video, we illustrate several aspects of our ongoing research on interactive surfaces. This includes studying the core functionality of tabletops, such as gestures and interaction primitives, file access, application switching, transfer of information between devices, and user modeling for personalisation. These core functions have been used as the foundation for a number of real-world deployed applications. The key contributions of this work are the novel primitives for tabletops interaction as well as the applications that have been created by building upon them.
