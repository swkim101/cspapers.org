Active or reactive database management systems (DBMSS) provide an event-based rule capability that can be used to support a number of database functionality (e.g., integrity enforcement, view materialization, management of index structures, applicability of compiled query plane when access methods change) in a uniform way. Rules used for supporting active capability consists ofi au event expression, one or more conditions, an action, and a set of attributes. An event expression specifies the sequence of events whose occurrence triggers the evaluation of the condlt ion. A condition is a aide effect-free boolean computation (set computation in general) on the database state and an action is an arbitrary sequence of operations. Attributes, typically, specify rule characteristics such as coupling mode, event consumption mode, and precedence relationahlp among rules. A rule with these. components is termed an ECA or eventcondition-action rule in the literature [3].
