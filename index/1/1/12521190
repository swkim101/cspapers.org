In this paper we present our ongoing work to build an approach to empower users of IoT-based cyber physical systems to protect their privacy by themselves. Our approach allows users to identify the privacy risks involved in sharing private data with a data consumer, assess the value of their private data based on identified risks and take a pragmatic data sharing decision balancing the risks with the benefits generated by the sharing. Our approach features a knowledgebase, called the Privacy Oracle, that exploits the power of the Semantic Web to determine how raw metadata can be combined by data consumers to infer privacy-sensitive information as well as the privacy risks associated with the disclosure of inferred information.
