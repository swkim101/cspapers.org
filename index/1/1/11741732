We study generalizations of the ``Prophet Inequality'' and ``Secretary Problem'', where the algorithm is restricted to an arbitrary downward-closed set system. For 0,1 values, we give O(n)-competitive algorithms for both problems. This is close to the Omega(n/log n) lower bound due to Babaioff, Immorlica, and Kleinberg. For general values, our results translate to O(log(n) log(r))-competitive algorithms, where r is the cardinality of the largest feasible set. This resolves (up to the O(loglog(n) log(r)) factor) an open question posed to us by Bobby Kleinberg.
