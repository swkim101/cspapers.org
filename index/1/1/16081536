This demonstration presents an infrastructure for computing multilingual semantic relatedness and correlation for twelve natural languages by using three distributional semantic models (DSMs). Our demonsrator - DInfra (Distributional Infrastructure) provides researchers and developers with a highly useful platform for processing large-scale corpora and conducting experiments with distributional semantics. We integrate several multilingual DSMs in our webservice so end user can obtain a result without worrying about the complexities involved in building DSMs. Our webservice allows the users to have easy access to a wide range of comparisons of DSMs with different parameters. In addition, users can configure and access DSM parameters using a easy to use API.
