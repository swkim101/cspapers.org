We report findings from an exploratory study whose overall goal was to design an online document surrogate for journal articles, customized for use in climcal problem solving. We describe two aspects of literature-based medical decision making. First, there are interaction effects among citations in a search output (or among articles in a stack of articles) that affect the physician's judgment of clinical applicability. Second, physicians select among different information processing strategies when attempting to use literature for tinding an answer a clinical question.
