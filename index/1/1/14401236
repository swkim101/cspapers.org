Many outlier detection methods do not merely provide the decision for a single data object being or not being an outlier but give also an outlier score or "outlier factor" signaling "how much" the respective data object is an outlier. A major problem for any user not very acquainted with the outlier detection method in question is how to interpret this "factor" in order to decide for the numeric score again whether or not the data object indeed is an outlier. Here, we formulate a local density based outlier detection method providing an outlier "score" in the range of [0, 1] that is directly interpretable as a probability of a data object for being an outlier.
