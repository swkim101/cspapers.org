Reasoning about one's personal schedule of appointments is a common but surprisingly complex activity. Motivated by the novel application of planning and temporal reasoning techniques to this problem, we have extended the formalization of the temporal distance model of Dechter, Meiri, and Pearl. We have developed methods for using dates as reference intervals and for meeting the challenge of repeated activities, such as weekly recurring appointments.
