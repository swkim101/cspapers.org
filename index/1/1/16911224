A model of a machine (computing system) is briefly presented for the purpose of teaching characteristics of machine organization. The model is appropriate 'for describing levels which are virtual machines, interpreters, or applications programs running in an execution environment. It is useful as a foundation for theoretical aspects of operating systems and computer systems architecture at the college junior and senior level. It encompasses the interaction among resources which are involved in executing programs. The model has been used in the analysis of existing machine architectures, such as IBM 360, Honeywell 6000, Burroughs B6700, and DEC PDP-11 among others. It is suitable for describing new architectures, and for the design of multi-level virtual machine architectures. The model is consistent with existing machine models, which are in effect subsets of it. The model provides a unifying foundation upon which to present and compare computer architecture issues from organization to operating systems and computer systems architecture.
