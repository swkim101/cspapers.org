The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) provides a middleware infrastructure that allows applications running on different hardware and operating systems, and developed in different languages to work together seamlessly. CORBA supplies high-level libraries and utilities that hide the details of message passing, making it relatively painless to develop distributed systems. We have used CORBA in two different undergraduate courses, CS1 and an advanced elective entitled Event Driven Programming. In CS1 students are presented with a CORBA based email server and develop a simple email client to communicate with it. In Event Driven Programming students use CORBA to develop client-server and peer to peer applications. We have found that CORBA is an ideal infrastructure for introducing distributed computing at both levels. Students are relieved of the necessity to learn low level communication primitives and can concentrate almost entirely on application design and development issues. This paper provides a brief high-level overview of CORBA and then discusses how we have used CORBA in our courses. We also include analysis of some preliminary data analysis on problems students encountered while developing CORBA based applications.
