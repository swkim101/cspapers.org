Inspired by previous work, where decipherment is used to improve machine translation, we propose a new idea to combine word alignment and decipherment into a single learning process. We use EM to estimate the model parameters, not only to maximize the probability of parallel corpus, but also the monolingual corpus. We apply our approach to improve Malagasy-English machine translation, where only a small amount of parallel data is available. In our experiments, we observe gains of 0.9 to 2.1 Bleu over a strong baseline.
