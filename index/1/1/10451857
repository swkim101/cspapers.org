This paper analyzes the issues that arise when trying to add annotations to the dialogues in the Switchboard corpus according to ISO standard 24617-2, exploiting the existing SWBD-DAMSL annotations. These issues relate to differences between the two tag sets; to the highly multidimensional view that underlies the ISO standard; to differences in segmenting the dialogues into functional units; to the use of in-line markups for certain phenomena in Switchboard, and to the use of intra-dialogue dependence relations as defined in the ISO standard. The analysis is supplemented by a discussion of how the existing annotations may be helpful to semi-automatically create a fullyfledged ISO standard annotation alongside the existing SWBD-DAMSL annotation.
