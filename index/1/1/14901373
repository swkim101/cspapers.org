As well as identifying relevant information, a successful information management system must be able to present its findings in terms which are familiar to the user, which is especially challenging when the incoming information is in a foreign language (Levow et al., 2001). We demonstrate techniques which attempt to address this challenge by placing terms in an abstract 'information space' based on their occurrences in text corpora, and then allowing a user to visualize local regions of this information space. Words are plotted in a 2-dimensional picture so that related words are close together and whole classes of similar words occur in recognizable clusters which sometimes clearly signify a particular meaning. As well as giving a clear view of which concepts are related in a particular document collection, this technique also helps a user to interpret unknown words.
