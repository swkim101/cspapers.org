Research was conducted to determine the effect of a constructivist learning environment upon field dependent (FD) and field independent (FI) students' achievement in an introductory computer programming course. Prior research in traditional environments had established a correlation between field dependence / independence (FD/I) and the design stage of programming.
A correlational design was followed, using introductory computer science students in their first programming course. A pretest of BASIC programming ability was given to assess baseline proficiency. The Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) was given to assess each subject's measure of FD/I. A constructivist model for learning programming was implemented. Achievement tests in two of the stages of programming, design and coding were administered. As additional dependent variables, student construction of programming elements â€” the design (semantic) elements, and the language-specific coding (syntax) elements - were collected in a portfolio and examined for both qualitative and quantitative differences.
No significant correlations were found between FD/I and the achievement scores of design and coding. No correlation was expected between FD/I and coding. There was no interaction between FD/I and design versus coding. The correlation between FD/I and the quantity of reconstructed programming elements was not significant. The correlation between FD/I and the quality of reconstructed programming elements was not significant. No interaction was found between FD/I and the quantity or quality of semantic versus syntactic elements. Stepwise multiple regression identified two predictors, for design, the predictor was the pretest. Coding was predicted by the quantity of syntactic programming elements.
 The principal finding of this research, in contrast to findings in traditional environments is that within this constructivist environment, the cognitive style of FD/I was not found to influence programming achievement.
