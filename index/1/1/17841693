Object-Oriented programming is now the basis for many introductory courses in programming. But while it seems students successfully learn program implementation in such courses, it is less clear whether they learn program design. In 1996 we organized a workshop to address how to better teach 00 design in first year computer science courses in universities and colleges. In 1997 we organized a follow-up workshop on resources to assist educators in teaching 00 design early.
