A person or other entity is often associated with multiple URL endpoints on the web, motivating the task of determining whether a given pair of webpages is coreferent to a given entity. To strike a balance between unsupervised and supervised methods that require annotated data, we build a positive and unlabelled (PU) learning model, where we obtain positive examples using web search-based distant supervision. We evaluate our proposed approach using the SemEval-2007 WePS and ALTA-2016 shared task datasets.
