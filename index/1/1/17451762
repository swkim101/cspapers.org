The mass properties are important to control robot dynamics or study human dynamics. In our previous works, we proposed a method to identify inertial parameters of legged mechanisms from base-link dynamics, using generalized coordinates and external forces information. In this paper, we propose an identification method based on floating-base dynamics, when the system has no external force. Inertial parameters can be identified without force measurement, only from motion data. The method has been tested on two examples; a simple chain consisted of two links and the human body dynamics.
