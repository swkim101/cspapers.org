The lexicon now plays a central role in our implementation of a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), given the massive relocation into the lexicon of linguistic information that was carried by the phrase structure rules in the old GPSG system. HPSG's grammar contains fewer than twenty (very general) rules; its predecessor required over 350 to achieve roughly the same coverage. This simplification of the grammar is made possible by an enrichment of the structure and content of lexical entries, using both inheritance mechanisms and lexical rules to represent the linguistic information in a general and efficient form. We will argue that our mechanisms for structure-sharing not only provide the ability to express important linguistic generalization about the lexicon, but also make possible an efficient, readily modifiable implementation that we find quite adequate for continuing development of a large natural language system.
