Human beings are using and consuming resources to make various products. However, the resources on the earth are limited. Therefore, recycling of the resources is very important for human beings now and in the future. After use of the products, they are thrown away or burnt while discharging COx. The environment of the earth is being damaged and the resources are being exhausted. In order to reuse the resources and to protect the environment of the earth, this paper introduces a conceptual design of disassembly automation system for automated manufacturing with ecological recycling. The system employs many robots to disassemble the used products. The disassembly process has to deal with a lot of uncertainty of the used products, while assembly process does not have to deal with so much uncertainty of the products. This paper explains a configuration of the system, functions of the robots and some problems.<<ETX>>
