This paper describes PARIS, an implemented system that facilitates the reuse of partially interpreted schemas. A schema is a program and specification with abstract, or uninterpreted, entities. Different interpretations of those entities will produce different programs. The PARIS System maintains a library of such schemas and provides an interactive mechanism to interpret a schema into a useful program by means of partially automated matching and verification procedures.
