optical fiber based interconnections using wavelength division multiplexing to support multiple concurrent channels on a single link have the potential for surmounting the performance and implementation problems of conventional electronic links operated at high data rates. Jn this paper we present a trace-driven performance evaluation of several proposed schemes for implementing high performance, single hop WDM interconnections for distributed shared memory and distributed memory multiprocessors. A large variety of such interconnections schemes employ tunable transmitters and/or receivers, although integrated wide-range tunable components that can be tuned quickly srecurrently unavailable. Our studies show that a simple scheme using a small number of fried-tuned components can easily perform better than or close to the best scheme that uses tunable components even if the tunable scheme is given the undue advantage of using fast, wide range tunable components. We also show that if fast, wide range tunable components become available, tunable schemes that are based on the use of common slotted control channels or dynamic time division multiple access protocols provide an acceptable level of performance.
