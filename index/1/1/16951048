This paper studies heterogeneous database systems from the multiple (poly) source @rrt) perspective. It aims at addressing issues such as “where is the data from” and “which intermediate data sources were used to arrive at that data” issues which are critical to many users in utilizing information composed from multiple sources. Specifically, it presents a polygen model for resolving the Data Source Tagging and Intermediate Source Tagging problems. Secondly, it presents a data-driven query translation mechanism for mapping a polygen query into a set of local queries dynamically. A concrete example is also provided to exemplify polygen query processing.
