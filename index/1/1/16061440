A simplified model of a bidirectional road tunnel is used for simulation and control of the evolution of pollutant concentrations in the tunnel. We present simulations, implemented through mixed C and Scilab code, of the system without control, with simple control strategies based on threshold and a first attempt to control the pollutant concentrations with a linear feedback control based on linearized and further simplified equations
