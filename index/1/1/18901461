In this paper we present a first step toward evaluating the performance of database machines. More precisely, we have implemented a simulation program SPADE (Simulation Program for the Analysis of Database Machines and Environments). This program was written to evaluate one database machine proposal, MUFFIN [STON79], but is of sufficient generality to model other homogeneous database machine environments.
