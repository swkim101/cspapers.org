This paper describes FERRET, an interactive question-answering (Q/A) system designed to address the challenges of integrating automatic Q/A applications into real-world environments. FERRET utilizes a novel approach to Q/A - known as predictive questioning - which attempts to identify the questions (and answers) that users need by analyzing how a user interacts with a system while gathering information related to a particular scenario.
