This paper deals with the relationships between logic and relational data bases. A goal of the paper is to show, through many results published in the literature, how logic can provide a formal support to study classical database problems, and in some cases, how logic can go further, helping first in their comprehension, and then in their solution. The main points discussed are : query evaluation and data base schema analysis.
