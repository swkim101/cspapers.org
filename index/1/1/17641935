The research described in this paper deals with the design automation of the central processor of a digital computing system. The principal aim has been to lay the groundwork for a new and unexplored area in the field of computer design. While conventional design automation systems provide the user with a convenient method of describing his design, we explore the possibility of giving the user the ability of describing the desired computer architecture along with the available building blocks with which it is to be implemented.
 In this paper we will describe the facilities of the model and then discuss a solution technique we have developed. In the statement of the model we will not attempt to include any of the mathematical formalism that underlies it.
