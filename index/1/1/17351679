Models of software intensive systems often are unnecessarily complex due to inappropriate modeling language capabilities. In the context of model driven generation of automation system parameters, we propose a multi-level modeling approach to prevent unnecessary complex models. The mechanism, based on a unified notion of classes and objects, allows modeling the domain entities concisely and builds the foundation for stepwise-refinement and model reuse.
