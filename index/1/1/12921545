Across the World Wide Web there is government censorship and monitoring of political messages and "morally-corrupting" material. Google have been in the news recently for capitulating to the Chinese government's demands to ban certain kinds of content, and also for refusing topass logs of browsing habits to the US government (while Microsoft and Yahoo complied wth the request). How can the Web survive as a unified, global information environment in the face of government censorship? Can governments and the private sector come to an agreement on international legal standards for the free flow of information and privacy.
