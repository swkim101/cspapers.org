The authors have designed and constructed a new type of actuation for a spherical robot. The proposed actuation system consists of a large number of individually inflatable rubber bladders covering a sphere. Inflation of one or more of these bladders imparts a moment to the sphere and coordinated inflation results in a directed motion. Further, the authors introduce a scheme for steering the robot by correctly selecting the proper bladders to inflate so that motive force is developed in a specified direction. The control scheme utilizes a passively rolling inner vehicle with a directional, remotely positioned light source that causes valves housed within the sphere to inflate the designated bladders through optical commutation.
