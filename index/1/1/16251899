This paper describes DOGHED (Dialog Output Generator for HEterogeneous Devices), a multimodal generation component which is a part of a dialog system that supports adaptation of multimodal content based on user preferences and their current device. Existing dialog systems focus on generating output for a single device that might not be suitable when users access the system using different devices. Multimedia presentation systems can be built that support several device types. However, most content presentation and layout is done off-line and defined at the document level.
