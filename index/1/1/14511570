The Ambient Calculus is a process calculus where processes may reside within a hierarchy of locations and modify it. The purpose of the calculus is to study mobility, which is seen as the change of spatial configurations over time. In order to describe properties of mobile computations we devise a modal logic that can talk about space as well as time, and that has the Ambient Calculus as a model.
