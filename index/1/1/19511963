The author describes a vibration-analysis based diagnostic monitoring system for robot operations. The robot vibration is represented by a stochastic model. The change in robot operation speed is monitored for preventive maintenance. Robot operation state is recognized through cluster analysis. A fuzzy-logic based comprehensive-assessment is applied to improve the reliability of diagnostic decisions. A real-time algorithm is developed for online diagnostic monitoring. Experimental results show the applicability of the technique.
