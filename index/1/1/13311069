Printed Circuit Board implementation has been described as the most expensive and time-consuming effort in the product design cycle. Experience has proven modern design automation systems are capable of significant reductions in design time. This does not say that all PCB design should be done on design automation systems. This paper addresses three classes of PCB's, and describes proven techniques for methods of classification and cost effective solutions. The oral presentation will be accompanied by visual aids (slides) of actual designs in each classification.
