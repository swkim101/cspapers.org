The aim of this paper is to present some measurements on the performance of a X.25 packet switching subnetwork and of a typical X.25 DTE-DCE interface. The communication parameters considered are the window size of the link layer flow control, the length and contents of the packets and the internode distance. The collected measurements on the X.25 subnetwork are compared with others obtained through different versions of DTE connected to the same subnetwork. Some considerations are presented about the time spent by the packets inside the DTE and consequently about the efficiency of the DTE version used in these experiments.
