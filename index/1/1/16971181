In our previous work [1], the potential benefits of Magneto-Rheological Fluid based actuators to the field of haptics were studied. Our results showed that the superior mechanical attributes of such actuators contribute to improvement of stability and transparency in haptic devices. To this end, a novel design of a small-scale MRF-based clutch, was proposed in [1]. This paper reports on the development and validation of the proposed MRF-based clutch. In addition, a closed-loop torque control strategy is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme comes from the magnetic field measurement and is used to compensate for the nonlinear behavior using an estimated model, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Such a control strategy eliminates the need for torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The performance of the developed design and the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control techniques are experimentally validated. The results clearly demonstrate that the clutch shows great potential for use in a multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface for a class of medical applications.
