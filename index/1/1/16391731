Real-world datasets often have representations in multiple views or come from multiple sources. Exploiting consistent or complementary information from multi-view data, multi-view clustering aims to get better clustering quality rather than relying on the individual view. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method called multi-view concept clustering based on concept factorization with local manifold regularization, which drives a common consensus representation for multiple views. The local manifold regularization is incorporated into concept factorization to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the data space. Moreover, the weight of each view is learnt automatically and a co-normalized approach is designed to make fusion meaningful in terms of driving the common consensus representation. An iterative optimization algorithm based on the multiplicative rules is developed to minimize the objective function. Experimental results on nine reality datasets involving different fields demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.
