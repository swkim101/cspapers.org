In the era of deep sub-wavelength lithography for nanometer VLSI designs, manufacturability and yield issues are critical and need to be addressed during the key physical design implementation stage, in particular detailed routing. However, most existing studies for lithography-friendly routing suffer from either huge run-time due to the intensive lithographic computations involved, or severe loss of quality of results because of the inaccurate predictive models. In this paper, we propose AENEID - a fast, generic and high performance lithography-friendly detailed router for enhanced manufacturability. AENEID combines novel hotspot detection and routing path prediction techniques through modern data learning methods and applies them at the detailed routing stage to drive high delity lithography-friendly routing. Compared with existing litho-friendly routing works, AENEID demonstrates 26% to 66% (avg. 50%) of lithography hotspot reduction at the cost of only 18%â€“38% (avg. 30%) of run-time overhead
