The performance of interactive cloud services depends heavily on which data centers handle client requests, and which wide-area paths carry traffic. While making these decisions, cloud service providers also need to weigh operational considerations like electricity and bandwidth costs, and balancing server loads across replicas. We argue that selecting data centers and network routes independently, as is common in today's services, can lead to much lower performance or higher costs than a coordinated decision. However, fine-grained joint control of two large distributed systems---e.g., DNS-based replica-mapping and data center multi-homed routing---can be administratively challenging. In this paper, we introduce the design of a system that jointly optimizes replica-mapping and multi-homed routing, while retaining the functional separation that exists between them today. We show how to construct a provably optimal distributed solution implemented through local computations and message exchanges between the mapping and routing systems.
