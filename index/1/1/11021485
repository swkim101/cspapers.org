We present an account of human concept learning—that is, learning of categories from examples—based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL). In support of this theory, we tested a wide range of two-dimensional concept types, including both regular (simple) and highly irregular (complex) structures, and found the MDL theory to give a good account of subjects' performance. This suggests that the intrinsic complexity of a concept (that is, its description length) systematically influences its learnability.
