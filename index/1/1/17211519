The new Carnegie Mellon Autonomous I and Vehicle group has produced the first demonstrations of road following robots. In this paper we first describe the robots that are part of the CMU Autonomous Land Vehicle project. We next describe the vision system of the CMU ALV. We then present the control algorithms, including a simple and stable control scheme for visual servoing. Finally we discuss our plans for the future.
