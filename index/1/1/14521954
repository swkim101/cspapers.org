Robotic rehabilitation devices are attractive to physical therapists. Various leg exoskeletons have been developed during the past decade and have been used in gait training. Traditional exoskeletons usually have a complex structure and add extra inertia to the wearer's leg, which may change their natural gait. In this paper, we present the design of a cable-driven active leg exoskeleton (C-ALEX) for human gait training. The advantages of cable-driven designs are that they have a simpler structure, add minimal inertia to the human limbs, and do not require precise joint alignment. C-ALEX employs the “assist-as-needed” control strategy to help the ankle center move along a prescribed path. An experiment with 6 healthy subjects was conducted who walked with C-ALEX on a treadmill. The results showed that C-ALEX is capable of helping the subjects better track a prescribed ankle path.
