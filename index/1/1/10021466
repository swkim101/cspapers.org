Visual servoing methods are commonly classified as image based or position based, depending on whether image features or the robot pose is used in the feedback loop of the control law. Choosing one method over the other gives stability in the chosen state but surrenders all control over the other, which can lead to system failure if feature points are lost or the robot moves to the end of its reachable space. We present a hybrid switched system visual servo method that utilizes both image based and position based control laws. Through a switching scheme we present, this method provides asymptotic stability in both the image and pose and prevent system failure.
