With a huge number of active users on microblogs, it becomes increasingly important to identify authoritative users on specific topics. This paper tackles the task of finding authorities on Twitter given any query topic. Although there exists much work on identifying influential users on Twitter, most of them focus on global authority regardless of the topic. We propose a novel Topical Authority Propagation (TAP) model by utilizing the fact that topical authority can be propagated through retweeting, i.e., if a user's tweet on a given topic is retweeted by a topical authority, that user is likely to be an authority on the topic as well. Topical relevance of candidate authorities can be seamlessly integrated into the model. Link analysis algorithms such as PageRank can then be utilized to characterize how topical authority is propagated through retweeting. We conduct a set of experiments on Twitter and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
