The purpose of the Micromodules project is to greatly reduce the amount of effort expended on logic design, fabrication and debug for small quantity developments. Secondly, with this modular approach, a quick reaction capability is sought that would allow a large reduction in the time interval between system specification and the delivery of the finished product. Finally, by simultaneously simplifying and speeding up the development process, we aim to improve the practicability of implementing more complex equipments.
