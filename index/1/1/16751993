We present a multilingual joint approach to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Our method exploits BabelNet, a very large multilingual knowledge base, to perform graph-based WSD across different languages, and brings together empirical evidence from these languages using ensemble methods. The results show that, thanks to complementing wide-coverage multilingual lexical knowledge with robust graph-based algorithms and combination methods, we are able to achieve the state of the art in both monolingual and multilingual WSD settings.
