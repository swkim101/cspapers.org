In this ongoing work, we are interested in multiprocessor energy efficient systems, where task durations are not known in advance, but are know stochastically. More precisely, we consider global scheduling algorithms for frame-based multiprocessor stochastic DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) systems. Moreover, we consider processors with a discrete set of available frequencies.
