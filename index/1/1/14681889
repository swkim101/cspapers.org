Continuation Denotational Semantics is now a standard method of formally specifying a programming language (even ADA the “language of the 80’s” has almost succumbed). Completion semantics is the natural operational analogue of continuation semantics. A continuation specifies what function the “rest of the program” computes; a completion is a representation of this function. Continuation semantics contains higher order functions and is denotational whereas completion semantics contains only first order domains and is operational (i.e. referentially opaque).
