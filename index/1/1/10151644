We provide a solution for elementary science test using instructional materials. We posit that there is a hidden structure that explains the correctness of an answer given the question and instructional materials and present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs and instructional materials), and uses what it learns to answer novel elementary science questions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms several strong baselines.
