In this paper we explore the use of shapes of noses for performing partial human biometrics. The basic idea is to represent nasal surfaces using indexed collections of iso-curves, and to analyze shapes of noses by comparing their corresponding curves. We extend past work in Riemannian analysis of shapes of closed curves in ‚Ñù3 to obtain a similar Riemannian analysis for nasal surfaces. In particular, we obtain algorithms for computing geodesics, computing statistical means, and stochastic clustering. We demonstrate these ideas in two application contexts : authentication and identification. We evaluate performances on a large database involving 2000 scans from FRGC v2 database, and present a hierarchical organization of nose databases to allow for efficient searches.
