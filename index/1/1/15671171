Much of the work in these directions has however focussed on coming up with appropriate diversity metrics and compiling those metrics in to the solvers/planners. Most approaches use linear-time greedy algorithms for exploring the state space of solution combinations for generating a diverse set of solutions, limiting not only their completeness but also their effectiveness within a time bound. In this paper, we take a combinatorial search perspective on generating diverse solutions. We present a generic bi-level optimization framework for finding cost-sensitive diverse solutions. We propose complete methods under this framework, which guarantee finding a set of cost sensitive diverse solutions satisficing the given criteria whenever there exists such a set. We identify various aspects that affect the performance of these exhaustive algorithms and propose techniques to improve them. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework compared to an existing greedy approach.
