The paper presents the results of the first large-scale human evaluation of automatic grammatical error correction (GEC) systems. Twelve participating systems and the unchanged input of the CoNLL-2014 shared task have been reassessed in a WMT-inspired human evaluation procedure. Methods introduced for the Workshop of Machine Translation evaluation campaigns have been adapted to GEC and extended where necessary. The produced rankings are used to evaluate standard metrics for grammatical error correction in terms of correlation with human judgment.
