Cloud computing is believed to be the next major paradigm of computing because it will substantially reduce the cost of IT systems. Ensuring security in the cloud-end is necessary because customers' data are stored and processed there. Previous studies have mainly focused on secure cloud-end storage, whereas secure cloud-end computing is much less investigated. The current practice is solely based on Virtual Machines (VM), and cannot offer adequate security because the guest Operating Systems (OS) often can be easily breached (e.g., by exploiting their vulnerabilities). This motivates the need of solutions for more secure cloud-end computing. This poster presents the design, implementation and analysis of a candidate solution, called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which takes advantage of both virtualization and trusted computing technologies simultaneously. The novelty behind TEE is the virtualization of the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).
