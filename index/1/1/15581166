A method to create a mobile head-mounted display (HMD) a proprietary controller for interactive virtual reality (VR) content is proposed. The proposed method uses an interface cartridge printed with a conductive pattern. This allows the user to operate a smartphone by touching on the face of the mobile HMD. In addition, the user can easily create a mobile HMD and interface cartridge using a laser cutter and inkjet printer. Changing the form of the conductive pattern allows the user to create a variety of controllers. The proposed method can realize an environment that can deliver a variety of interactions with VR content.
