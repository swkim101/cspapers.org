In this position paper we describe how technologies from the Web of Things domain could help to simplify and automate the interaction between robotic devices and their surroundings. Specifically, we discuss how Web patterns like Resource-oriented Architectures or Representational State Transfer together with semantic metadata could help to create environments where robots seamlessly interact with other devices in their vicinity: Using services provided by other devices and offering services themselves. One of the main goals in the Web of Things community is to furnish smart environments with sensors and actuators that offer self-described interfaces and are openly accessible from other devices -- Robots should be enabled to make use of this wealth of instrumentation of their surroundings!
