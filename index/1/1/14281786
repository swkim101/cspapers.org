With the increasing use of mobile devices to access the Internet anytime and anywhere, the relevance of disconnected operation has emerged. Disconnected operation allows users to execute applications during temporary failures in networks or when they explicitly decide to work off-line. This paper presents a system, called Jamp, that uses mobile computation (or logical mobility) to handle disconnections. Jamp has abstractions supporting the migration of groups of objects and classes to other nodes of the network. In this way, programmers can pushapplications to clients with code and data that makes disconnected operation possible.
