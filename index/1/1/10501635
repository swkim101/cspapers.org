The MIROWeb Espris developped a unique technology to integrate multiple data sources through an object-relational model with semistructured data types. In addresses the problem of integrating irregular web sources and regular relational databases through a mediated architecture based on hybrid model, supporting relational object and semi-structured features. The project data exchange format is XML, the new standard of the Web and the pivot language is XMLQL, a query language based on XML templates from AT&T. The demonstration will show the data warehousing approach for mediation, based on Oracle 8 and a semi-structured cartridge developped in the project for supporting XML and XMLQL queries.
