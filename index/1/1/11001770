An important concept in social web services is social actions such as making connections and communicating with others and adding annotations to web resources. Predicting social actions would improve many fundamental web applications, such as recommendations and web searches. One remarkable characteristic of social actions is that they involve multiple and heterogeneous objects such as users, documents, keywords, and locations. However, the high-dimensional property of such multinomial relations poses one fundamental challenge, that is, predicting multinomial relations with only a limited amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new multinomial relation prediction method, which is robust to data sparsity. We transform each instance of a multinomial relation into a set of binomial relations between the objects and the multinomial relation of the involved objects. We then apply an extension of a low-dimensional embedding technique to these binomial relations, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem guaranteeing global optimal solutions. We also incorporate attribute information as side information to address the “cold start” problem in multinomial relation prediction. Experiments with various real-world social web service datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust against data sparseness as compared to several existing methods, which can only find sub-optimal solutions.
