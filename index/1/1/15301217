A single user general purpose multiprocessor computing system developed around a high level language is described. Both the hardware configuration and its relation to the accompanying software are discussed. The multiprocessor presented is designed for the single user; commonly used techniques such as time-sharing, swapping and user protection are discarded. The system provides a mechanism in the language for the separation of process and processor, and enables a description of some characteristics of the latter. A PROCESSOR type is introduced in the language that corresponds exactly to hardware processing elements, and it is shown that by being able to manipulate items of this type, a versatile computer and research tool is developed which enables further investigation into synchronisation protocols and interconnection techniques.
