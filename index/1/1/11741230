Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers, are specifically designed to address the innate limitation of Web search engines by helping users obtain information from a community. Understanding the user intent of questions would enable a CQA system identify similar questions, find relevant answers, and recommend potential answerers more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose to classify questions into three categories according to their underlying user intent: subjective, objective, and social. In order to identify the user intent of a new question, we build a predictive model through machine learning based on both text and metadata features. Our investigation reveals that these two types of features are conditionally independent and each of them is sufficient for prediction. Therefore they can be exploited as two views in co-training - a semi-supervised learning framework - to make use of a large amount of unlabelled questions, in addition to the small set of manually labelled questions, for enhanced question classification. The preliminary experimental results show that co-training works significantly better than simply pooling these two types of features together.
