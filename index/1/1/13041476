Understanding and retrieving videos based on their semantic contents is an important research topic in multimedia data mining and has found various real- world applications. Most existing video analysis techniques focus on the low level visual features of video data. However, there is a "semantic gap" between the machine-readable features and the high level human concepts i.e. human understanding of the video content. In this paper, an interactive platform for semantic video mining and retrieval is proposed using relevance feedback (RF), a popular technique in the area of content-based image retrieval (CBIR). By tracking semantic objects in a video and then modeling spatio-temporal events based on object trajectories and object interactions, the proposed interactive learning algorithm in the platform is able to mine the spatio-temporal data extracted from the video. An iterative learning process is involved in the proposed platform, which is guided by the user's response to the retrieved results. Although the proposed video retrieval platform is intended for general use and can be tailored to many applications, we focus on its application in traffic surveillance video database retrieval to demonstrate the design details. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by our experiments on real-life traffic surveillance videos.
