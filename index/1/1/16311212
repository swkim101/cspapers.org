The success of recognizing periodic actions in single-person-simple-background datasets, such as Weizmann and KTH, has created a need for more difficult datasets to push the performance of action recognition systems. We identify the significant weakness in systems based on popular descriptors by creating a synthetic dataset using Weizmann dataset. Experiments show that introducing complex backgrounds, stationary or dynamic, into the video causes a significant degradation in recognition performance. Moreover, this degradation cannot be fixed by fine-tuning the system or selecting better interest points. Instead, we show that the problem lies at the cuboid level and must be addressed by modifying cuboids.
