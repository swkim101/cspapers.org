The tree-transducer grammars that arise in current syntactic machine translation systems are large, flat, and highly lexicalized. We address the problem of parsing efficiently with such grammars in three ways. First, we present a pair of grammar transformations that admit an efficient cubic-time CKY-style parsing algorithm despite leaving most of the grammar in n-ary form. Second, we show how the number of intermediate symbols generated by this transformation can be substantially reduced through binarization choices. Finally, we describe a two-pass coarse-to-fine parsing approach that prunes the search space using predictions from a subset of the original grammar. In all, parsing time reduces by 81%. We also describe a coarse-to-fine pruning scheme for forest-based language model reranking that allows a 100-fold increase in beam size while reducing decoding time. The resulting translations improve by 1.3 BLEU.
