Table summarization is necessary in various scenarios where it is hard to display a large table. It can benefit from knowledge about acceptable value clustering alternatives. In this paper, we formulate the problem of table summarization with the help of domain knowledge lattices. We provide the outline of a fuzzy mechanism to express alternative clustering strategies. We further sketch a novel ranked set cover based evaluation mechanism (RSC) to tackle with the inherent complexity.
