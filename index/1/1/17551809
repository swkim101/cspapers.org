Many learning applications are characterized by high dimensions. Usually not all of these dimensions are relevant and some are redundant. There are two main approaches to reduce dimensionality: feature selection and feature transformation. When one wishes to keep the original meaning of the features, feature selection is desired. Feature selection and transformation are typically presented separately. In this paper, we introduce a general approach for converting transformation-based methods to feature selection methods through l1/lâˆž regularization. Instead of solving feature selection as a discrete optimization, we relax and formulate the problem as a continuous optimization problem. An additional advantage of our formulation is that our optimization criterion optimizes for feature relevance and redundancy removal automatically. Here, we illustrate how our approach can be utilized to convert linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the dimensionality reduction version of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to two new feature selection algorithms. Experiments show that our new feature selection methods out-perform related state-of-the-art feature selection approaches.
