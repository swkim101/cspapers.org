This paper advocates an implicit-surface representation of generic 3-D surfaces to take advantage of occluding edges in a very robust way. This lets us exploit silhouette constraints in uncontrolled environments that may involve occlusions and changing or cluttered backgrounds, which limit the applicability of most silhouette based methods. This desirable behavior is completely independent from the way the surface deformations are parametrized. To show this, we demonstrate our technique in three very different cases: modeling the deformations of a piece of paper represented by an ordinary triangulated mesh; tracking a person's shoulders whose deformations are expressed in terms of Dirichlet free form deformations; reconstructing the shape of a human face parametrized in terms of a principal component analysis model.
