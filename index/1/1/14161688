Exact side effects of subroutine calls are essential for exact interprocedural dependence analysis. To summarize the side effect of multiple array references, a collective representation of all the array elements accessed is needed. So far all existing forms of collective summary of side effects of multiple array references are approximate.
In this paper, we propose an approach for exact interprocedural dependence analysis based on the Omega test. In particular, we provide a method of representing the exact image of multiple array references in the form of integer programming projection and a method of back-propagation to form the exact side effect on the actual array.
The representation of the exact side effect proposed in this paper can be used by the Omega test to support the exact interprocedural dependence analysis in parallelizing compilers or semi-automatic parallelization tools.
