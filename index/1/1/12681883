Method and apparatus for organizing and joining conductors of multi-conductor cables such as communication cables. An elongated multiple connector structure having a series of open-channels, the entrance ends of which are intersected by guide channels, each having a releasable holder at one end so that a bundle of wires may be separated, organized and held in the channels in bridging relation to connection sockets. Various types of releasable holders or retainers are disclosed including retainers which may also serve to strip insulation from a portion of each wire. Plugs are forced into the sockets and press bridging portions of the wires therein to strip the insulation and establish permanent electrical connections. Each socket is provided with a sharp edge to shear the excess portions of the wires as the plugs are forced into the sockets. A compact assembly or array of elongated connector blocks and/or block segments may be formed by novel assembly components which include means for structurally connecting a selected wire or wires in a socket of a first block or segment with a selected wire or wires in a socket of a second block or segment mounted on the first block. A single connector unit, particularly adapted for household use, is also disclosed.
