The task of clinical decision support (CDS) involves retrieval and ranking of medical journal articles for medical records of diagnosis, test or treatment. Previous studies on this task are based on bag-of-words representations of document texts and general retrieval models. In this paper, we propose to use the paragraph vector technique to learn the latent semantic representation of texts and treat the latent semantic representations and the original bag-of-words representations as two different modalities. We then propose to use the graph-based multi-modality learning algorithm for document re-ranking. Experimental results on two TREC-CDS benchmark datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed approach.
