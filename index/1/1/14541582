When training neural networks by the classical backpropagation algorithm the whole problem to learn must be expressed by a set of inputs and desired outputs. However, we often have high-level knowledge about the learning problem. In optical character recognition (OCR), for instance, we know that the classification should be invariant under a set of transformations like rotation or translation. We propose a new modular classification system based on several autoassociative multilayer perceptrons which allows the efficient incorporation of such knowledge. Results are reported on the NIST database of upper case handwritten letters and compared to other approaches to the invariance problem.
