The Web is based on numerous standards that together make up the surface of the Web: By knowing and supporting those standards, problems can be solved in well-known ways. This general design pattern on the Web applies to APIs in the very same way as it does to the human Web: By using an (evolving) set of standards, API developers benefit by not having to reinvent the wheel, and developers benefit by the same problem being solved in the same way across a variety of APIs. The evolving set of standards for Web APIs can be regarded as a set of building blocks or vocabularies for API design. Web Concepts is a site (webconcepts.info) and a repository (github.com/dret/webconcepts) that can be used to manage how within organizations these building blocks are used, thus helping to establish a Web API design culture. The main idea of Web Concepts is to promote reuse of existing standards and technologies, and to therefore make it easier for teams to understand which options are available generally speaking, and maybe which ones are popular choices within their organization.
