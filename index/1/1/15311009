Smart environments require to percept conditions of people. Current context-aware systems mainly model limited user situations, which constrains their coverage and effect in real world usage. This paper proposes an encyclopedic knowledge network to enable practical context inference in our daily life by: 1) expressing essential semantics of contextual concepts and relations into a well-informed relational network, and 2) exploiting relational semantics to infer various contexts simultaneously. The performance of the approach is validated in real challenging problems and compared with inference of human being.
