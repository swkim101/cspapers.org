We present and study the Contribution-Selection algorithm (CSA), a novel algorithm for feature selection. The algorithm is based on the Multiperturbation Shapley Analysis, a framework which relies on game theory to estimate usefulness. The algorithm iteratively estimates the usefulness of features and selects them accordingly, using either forward selection or backward elimination. Empirical comparison with several other existing feature selection methods shows that the backward eliminati-nation variant of CSA leads to the most accurate classification results on an array of datasets.
