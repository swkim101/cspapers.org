Now-a-days any large electronic system design invariably involves the support of automated facilities. The R and D laboratories of Societ√† Italiana Telecomunicazioni Siemens spa are currently developing such an automated facility oriented for manufacturing a telecommunication switching system called PROTEO, which is also being designed and developed here.
 Particular design aids for printed circuits; automated wiring, testing, production and diagnosis of printed circuit boards, testing and diagnosis of subsystems and generation of relevant documentation, have been implemented already. The next objective is to develop an integrated automation program (I.A.P.) with the help of a DATA-BASE and to review it for future procedural techniques.
