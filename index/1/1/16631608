This paper proposes a novel machine learning architecture, specifically designed for radio-frequency based gesture recognition. We focus on high-frequency (60]GHz), short-range radar based sensing, in particular Google's Soli sensor. The signal has unique properties such as resolving motion at a very fine level and allowing for segmentation in range and velocity spaces rather than image space. This enables recognition of new types of inputs but poses significant difficulties for the design of input recognition algorithms. The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting a rich set of dynamic gestures and can resolve small motions of fingers in fine detail. Our technique is based on an end-to-end trained combination of deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The algorithm achieves high recognition rates (avg 87%) on a challenging set of 11 dynamic gestures and generalizes well across 10 users. The proposed model runs on commodity hardware at 140 Hz (CPU only).
