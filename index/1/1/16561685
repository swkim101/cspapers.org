Recognition errors complicate the assessment of speech systems. This paper presents a new approach to modeling spoken language interaction protocols, based on finite Markov chains. An interaction protocol, prescribed by the interface design, defines a set of primitive transaction steps and the order of their execut ion. The efficiency of an interface depends on the interaction protocol as well as the cost of each different transaction step. Markov chains provide a simple and computationally eflicient method for modeling errorful systems. They allow for detailed comparisons between different interaction protocols and between different modalities. The method is illustrated by application to example protocols.
