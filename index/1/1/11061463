The editors believe that it is fitting that proceedings devoted to the use of computers in information storage and retrieval use automatic techniques to index the proceedings.

We took the next best approach, namely, to place in machine readable form the titles and authors of the papers that appear in these proceedings, and the citations that appear with each paper.
