This paper presents FlexiBend, an easily installable shape-sensing strip that enables interactivity of multi-part, deformable fabrications. The flexible sensor strip is composed of a dense linear array of strain gauges, therefore it has shape sensing capability. After installation, FlexiBend can simultaneously sense user inputs in different parts of a fabrication or even capture the geometry of a deformable fabrication.
