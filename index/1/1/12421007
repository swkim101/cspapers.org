In this paper we present a novel approach to the constrained scheduling problem, while addressing a more general class of constraints that arise from the timing requirements on real-time embedded controllers and from the implementation of mixed data-flow/event-driven real-time systems. We provide general necessary and sufficient conditions for scheduling under precedence constraints and derive sufficient conditions for two well-known scheduling policies. We define mathematical problems that provide optimum priority and deadline assignments, while ensuring both precedence constraints and systemâ€™s schedulability.We show how these problems can be relaxed to corresponding ILP formulations leveraging on available solvers.
