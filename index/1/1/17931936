How to improve the modeling efficiency and accuracy has become a burning problem. The popularization of recommendation technique in E-Commerce provide us new trajectories that can be used for addressing the problem. In this paper, we propose a graph-based workflow recommendation for improving business process modeling. The start point is so-called "workflow repository" including a set of already developed process models. Graph mining method is used to extract the process patterns from the repository. Based on graph edit distance (GED) [2], we calculate the distance between patterns and the partial business process, viewed as reference model, which is under modeling and select the candidate nodes with smaller distances for recommendation. The performance study show its feasibility for practical uses.
