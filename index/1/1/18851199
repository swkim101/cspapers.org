Fast computation of polynomials of 1 variable in the fields R and C of real and complex numbers is considered. The optimal schemes of computation with preconditioning (that is, the schemes involving the minimal number of arithmetic operations without counting preliminary treatment of coefficients) for evaluation in C are presented. The schemes which are close to optimal ones are presented for evaluation in R. The difference between the complexity of computation in R and in C is established. A new generalization of the problem is presented.
