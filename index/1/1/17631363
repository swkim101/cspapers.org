The performance of various memory configurations for parallel-pipelined computer which execute multiple instruction streams on multiple data streams is investigated.
 For a parallel-pipelined processor of order (s,p), which consists of p parallel processors each of which is a pipelined processor with s degrees of multiprogramming, there can be up to s p memory requests in each instruction cycle. The memory, which consists of N(&equil;2n) identical memory modules, is organized such that there are l(&equil;2i) lines and m(&equil;2nâˆ’i) modules per line, where each module is characterized by the address cycle (address hold time)and memory cycle of a and c time units respectively.
 The performance which is affected by the memory interference problem is evaluated as a function of the memory configuration, (l, m), the module characteristics (a, c) and the processor order (s, p). Design considerations are discussed and an example given to illustrate possible design options.
