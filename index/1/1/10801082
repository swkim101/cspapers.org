Network Centrality is one of the core concepts in network analysis, which ranks the importance of a node in a network. A considerably extensive range of centrality measures exist that serve the purpose of quantifying the importance of a node according to its application and domain. One such measure is the Betweenness Centrality (BC) which computes the importance of a node in terms of total number of shortest paths that pass through that node. However, these computations are very expensive and pose different challenges for large scale networks. With an attempt to deal with these challenges, our paper presents an approximate algorithm for BC maximization problem, which tries to find a set of nodes with largest BC. The core of our algorithm is the estimation technique, which is based on progressive sampling with early stopping conditions. The reduction in sample size results not only in small computations overhead, but also scales well with large networks. We experimentally evaluate our technique using different datasets to confirm the performance of the developed techniques.
