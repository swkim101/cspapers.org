The approach to program visualization in computer science instruction discussed here has two components: the graphic display of algorithms and the graphic display of their execution. Both types of display are based on the same hierarchical representation of an algorithm (in terms of Scandura FLOWforms, an enhancement and generalization of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams). The execution display is obtained by the addition of explicit display commands to the basic algorithm, but the execution display details can be largely suppressed when the algorithm itself is being displayed. Two major characteristics of this approach are the modularity and the easy modifiability of demonstration procedures. The hardware required is an IBM PC or AT or compatible.
