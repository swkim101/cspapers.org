Health and well-being of dogs, either domesticated pets or service animals, are major concerns that are taken seriously for ethical, emotional, and financial reasons. Welfare assessments in dogs rely on objective observations of both frequency and variability of individual behaviour traits, which is often difficult to obtain in a dog's everyday life. In this paper we have identified a set of activities, which are linked to behaviour traits that are relevant for a dog's wellbeing. We developed a collar-worn accelerometry platform that records dog behaviours in naturalistic environments. A statistical classification framework is used for recognising dog activities. In an experimental evaluation we analysed the naturalistic behaviour of 18 dogs and were able to recognise a total of 17 different activities with approximately 70% classification accuracy. The presented system is the first of its kind that allows for robust and detailed analysis of dog activities in naturalistic environments.
