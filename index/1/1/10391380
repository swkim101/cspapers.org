In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the efficiency of the Model-Based Review (MBR) method in an actual software design from the two points of view; cost and reviewability. The MBR method is a modeling procedure for the purpose of reviewing preliminary design specifications of web-based applications. We have collected process data in applying both of the MBR method and an ordinary review to a preliminary design of a developing web-based library system. Analyzing the collected process data, we quantitatively compare the efficiency of the MBR method and that of the ordinary review. As a result of this comparative analysis, we show that the MBR method is superior to the ordinary review in terms of not only reviewability but also cost through the experimental design process.
