Research has shown that affective effects on driving performance and safety are as dangerous as (or even more dangerous than) effects of the secondary tasks [11]. There has been some research on the use of speech-based systems for the intervention, but little research on the use of music has attempted to mitigate a driver's affective states while driving. The current paper identifies various taxonomies of the effects of music and explores plausible research variables, considerations, and practical application directions.
