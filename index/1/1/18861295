In this paper, we present the vision of the usage of an object-based video data storage format for similarity search. The efficient (fast) and effective (accurate) search in video streams is an ongoing and still unsolved problem. Using an object-based format of multimedia data, all the information that is needed to answer queries is already available in a machine accessible format. This way, the process of creating (video) descriptors as well as the similarity search becomes easier, because the data is already organized in a manner that allows fast access to specific information. To demonstrate the concept of similarity search process using the object-based 3D video format, we present experiments conducted on generated clouds of points (an abstraction of 3D video data).
