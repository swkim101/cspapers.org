We model the responses of cells in visual area V1 during natural vision. Our model consists of a classical energy mechanism whose output is divided by nonclassical gain control and texture contrast mechanisms. We apply this model to review movies, a stimulus sequence that replicates the stimulation a cell receives during free viewing of natural images. Data were collected from three cells using five different review movies, and the model was fit separately to the data from each movie. For the energy mechanism alone we find modest but significant correlations (rE = 0.41, 0.43, 0.59, 0.35) between model and data. These correlations are improved somewhat when we allow for suppressive surround effects (rE+G = 0.42, 0.56, 0.60, 0.37). In one case the inclusion of a delayed suppressive surround dramatically improves the fit to the data by modifying the time course of the model's response.
