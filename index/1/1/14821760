We formulate the content-based image indexing problem as a multi-dimensional nearest-neighbor search problem, and develop/implement an optimistic vantage-point tree algorithm that can dynamically adapt the indexed search process to the characteristics of given queries. Based on our performance study, the system typically only needs to touch less than 20 % of the index entries for well -behaved queries, i.e., when the query images are relatively close to their nearest neighbors in the database. We also report in this paper the results of extensive performance experiments, which characterise the impacts of various configuration and workload parameters on the performance of the proposed algorithm.
