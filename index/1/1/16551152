In recent years the popularity of microprocessors has increased to a point where there exists the need to effectively simulate a microprocessor in conjunction with other logic elements. The two major problems of simulating the microprocessor are the level of detail in the simulation and the method of implementation. A simulation model is developed that allows effective simulation at the chip level with the other logic elements.
