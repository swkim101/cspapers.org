We show that temporal logic and combinations of temporal logics and modal logics of knowledge can be effectively represented in artificial neural networks. We present a Translation Algorithm from temporal rules to neural networks, and show that the networks compute a fixed-point semantics of the rules. We also apply the translation to the muddy children puzzle, which has been used as a testbed for distributed multi-agent systems. We provide a complete solution to the puzzle with the use of simple neural networks, capable of reasoning about time and of knowledge acquisition through inductive learning.
