Through-Silicon Via (TSV) is a technology that enables vertical integration of silicon dies forming a single 3D-IC stack. In this paper, a practical model is proposed for the TSV assignment problem of the stacked-die 3D nets. We present the first work in the literature to prove that the general 3D-IC TSV assignment problem with more than two dies is NP-complete. An efficient heuristic algorithm that combines Shortest Path, Bipartite Matching, Min-cost Max-flow and Integer Linear Programming is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that our flow achieves good quality of results (within 98% of the optimal solution) with reasonable run-time compared to related works.
