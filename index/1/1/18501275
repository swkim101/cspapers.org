A real storage management algorithm called Adaptive Control of Page-frame Supply (ACPS) is described. ACPS employees three strategies: prediction of the demand for real page frames, page replacement based on the prediction, and working set control. Together, these strategies constitute the real page frame allocation method, and contribute to short and stable response times in conversational processing environments.
ACPS is experimentally applied to the VOS3 operating system. Evaluation of ACPS on a real machine shows that TSS response times are not affected too strongly by king-size jobs and ACPS is successful in avoiding paging delay and thrashing. ACPS prevents extreme shortages of real storage in almost all cases.
