This panel brings together coaches to discuss all aspects of the practice - how to become a coach, choosing a coach, and describing what is to be an (in) effective coach. A coach watches, provides feedback, and suggests subtle direction. The coach may be more - for example - an architect or team lead. The panelists will describe their positions and offer feedback. Panelists were asked to offer responses to three questions: How did YOU become a coach?What's the toughest thing you've had to do as a coach?What's your advice for teams looking for a coach?
