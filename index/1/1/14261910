In this paper, we propose a case-based architecture for a dialogue manager. The dialogue manager is one of the main components of the cognitive layer of an interface system for information-seeking processes. Information-seeking is a highly exploratory and navigational process and needs therefore elaborated interaction functionality. In our approach, this functionality will be provided by the dialogue manager operating on a set of case-based dialogue plans. In a casebased pkmning system anew plan will be generatedbyretrieving the plan which is most appropriate to theuser’sgoals and adapting it dynamically during the ongoing dialogue. We propose acase-basedarchitecture for two reasons. First, operating on old solutions provides a coherent framework which prevents the user from being ‘lost in hyperspace’. Second, it allows flexible adaptations, domain dependent ones, using perspectives on domain objeets, and domain independent ones, that change the sequence of dialogue steps.
