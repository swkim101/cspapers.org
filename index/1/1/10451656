We consider several cases of the point matching problem in which we are to find a transformation of a set of n points such that each transformed point lies in one of n given pairwisedisjoint “noise regions”. We prove upper and lower bounds on the number of possible matches, under a variety of types of transformations (rotations, translations, similarity, etc.) and noise regions (cmcles, squares, polygons, etc.). We also give efficient algorithms for computing the set of all possible matches, along with a corresponding transformation that realizes each match.
