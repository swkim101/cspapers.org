One attempt at explaining human inferencing is that of spreading activation, particularly in the structured connectionist paradigm. This has resulted in the building of systems with semantically nameable nodes which perform inferencing by examining the patterns of activation spread. In this paper we demonstrate that simple structured network inferencing can be performed by passing activation over the weights learned by a distributed algorithm. Thus, an account, is provided which explains a well-behaved relationship between structured and distributed connectionist approaches.
