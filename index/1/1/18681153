Fifty two statements of cognition and emotion wm gathered from computer users during breakdowns in understanding during interaction. They wem reduced by factor analysis to a set often themes. The themes show the extent of discomfort experienced during breakdowns. The themes now form the backbone of a checklist of cognition and emotion, short enough in length to be administered during interaction. This work forms a move towards understanding and ultimately alleviating discomfort felt during human-computer interaction.
