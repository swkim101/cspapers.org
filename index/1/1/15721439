In the field of service robotics, whole arm contact with an unstructured environment or human beings becomes a major issue. Therefore soft robots, which mean robots with passively (or mechanically) compliant joints, become more and more important. In this work we analyze what Cartesian stiffness at the tool center point one can achieve with a passively compliant, redundant robot with variable joint stiffness. We restrict this work to the special case of uncoupled joint stiffness only, as coupling of joint stiffness seems to be mechanically difficult to realize. Finally we discuss a Cartesian controller, which incorporates the compliance of the joints and ensures the correct stiffness behavior also for high displacements from the desired position.
