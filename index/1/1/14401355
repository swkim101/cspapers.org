This paper presents an anticipative robot kinematic limitation avoidance algorithm for collaborative robots. The main objective is to improve the performance and the intuitivity of the physical human-robot interaction. One obstacle to achieve this goal is the management of limitations such as joint position limitation, singularities and collisions with the environment. Indeed, in addition to performing a given principal task, human users must pay a close attention to the manipulator configuration in order to handle the kinematic limitations. The proposed anticipative algorithm aims at relieving the human user from having to deal with such limitations. The algorithm is first presented and detailed for each individual limitation of a planar RR serial robot. The framework developed to manage several limitations occurring simultaneously is then presented. Finally, experiments are performed in order to assess the performance of the algorithm.
