Biological neurons have a variety of intrinsic properties because of the large number of voltage dependent currents that control their activity. Neuromodulatory substances modify both the balance of conductances that determine intrinsic properties and the strength of synapses. These mechanisms alter circuit dynamics, and suggest that functional circuits exist only in the modulatory environment in which they operate.
