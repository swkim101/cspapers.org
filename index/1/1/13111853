In this paper, we are concerned with the design of intelligent magnetic bubble memories. It is our intent to explore ways of incorporating the novel bubble chip organizations and bubble movement operations in the design of such memories. In particular, we evaluate the improvements in performance of various file processing algorithms and memory organizations which can be achieved through their use. Retrieval times per word and per page are the parameters used to evaluate the different memory organizations. Performance of hierarchical memory systems using bubble memories are discussed. The unique features of magnetic bubble memories are used in designing algorithms for elementary file processing operations such as sorting and merging and for basic relational algebraic operations.
