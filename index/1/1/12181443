In this paper, we present Roleo, a web tool for visualizing the vector spaces generated by the evaluation of distributional memory (DM) models over thematic ﬁt judgements. A thematic ﬁt judgement is a rating of the selectional preference of a verb for an argument that ﬁlls a given thematic role. The DM approach to thematic ﬁt judgements involves the construction of a sub-space in which a prototypical role-ﬁller can be built for comparison to the noun being judged. We describe a publicly-accessible web tool that allows for querying and exploring these spaces as well as a technique for visualizing thematic ﬁt sub-spaces efﬁciently for web use.
