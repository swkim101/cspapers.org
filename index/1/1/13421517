An analysis was made of a set of design guidelines for expert systems. These guidelines relate problem characteristics to appropriate AI implementation techniques. The analysis indicates there are five general problem features that are important for the proper use of a wide variety of AI implementation techniques. By being aware of these problem features, knowledge engineers improve their chances of coming up with the right design for expert systems. Awareness of these problem features should also help knowledge engineers take full advantage of new AI techniques as they emerge.
