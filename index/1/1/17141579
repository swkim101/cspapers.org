Markov logic networks (MLNs) are a popular statistical relational learning formalism that combine Markov networks with first-order logic. Unfortunately, inference and maximum-likelihood learning with MLNs is highly intractable. For inference, this problem is addressed by lifted algorithms, which speed up inference by exploiting symmetries. State-of-the-art lifted algorithms give tractability guarantees for broad classes of MLNs and inference tasks. For learning, we showed in recent work how to use lifted inference techniques for efficient maximum-likelihood parameter learning. In this paper, we propose the first lifted structure learning algorithm that guarantees that the learned MLNs are liftable, and thus tractable for certain queries. Our work is among the first to apply the tractable learning paradigm to statistical relational models. Moreover, it is the first structure learning algorithm that exactly optimizes the likelihood of the MLN. An empirical evaluation on three realworld datasets shows that our algorithm learns accurate models, both in terms of likelihood and prediction quality. Furthermore, our tractable learner outperforms intractable models on prediction tasks suggesting that liftable models are a powerful hypothesis space, which may be sufficient for many standard learning problems.
