In every sport, playoffs and tournaments are used to select the best among a set of competing players or teams. In this paper we consider the optimal design of 6uch systems. We seek designs that are optimally efficient, in the sense that they minimize the number of rounds or the number of games needed to select the best player with a stated probabi1it.y. Our models reflect the fact that the better player in games between two players or teams does not always win. As a consequence, the problems we consider are not equivalent to choosing the smallest of n elements in the standard comparison model. We assume that there are n players. There is an initially unknown one-t+one correspondence between the set of players and the index set { 1.2,. . -, n}. The player corresponding to index j is called Player j. Player 1 is the best player in the following sense: in any game between Player 1 and Player j, Player 1 wins with probability plj, where plj > l/2; draws are not allowed. The goal is to determine the identity of Player 1 with probabi1it.y at least 1 A, where A is a given constant. The games are played in rounds where,
