Domain engineering is a field that has been emerging as a key component of any domainspecific reuse strategy. Domain engineering is a means of analysing and modelling a problem domain with a view to reusing the concepts of that domain across multiple software systems. There are domain analysis approaches currently available that are not based on object-oriented techniques, yet an object-oriented approach would seem to some to be the most suitable for domain engineering.
