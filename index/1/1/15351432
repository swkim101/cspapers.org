Traditional approaches to CS0 have emphasized either breadth, through an overview of computer science, or depth, through intensive programming. This paper describes an alternative teaching method that strikes a balance between these two approaches through the use of JavaScript and the World Wide Web. By taking advantage of JavaScript's simplicity and natural Web-based interfaces, the CS0 course described here is able to maintain a strong emphasis on programming and problem-solving, integrate programming skills with Web technology, and still provide reasonable breadth on general computer science topics. This balance between depth and breadth makes the course attractive to both non-majors and majors alike, providing a broad perspective of the field as well as a foundation for continuing studies in computer science.
