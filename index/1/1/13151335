Message passing algorithms have emerged as a powerful heuristic for addressing hard problems in a variety of applied fields. Interesting and successful examples can be found in domain as diverse as coding and communications, signal processing, artificial intelligence, game theory, high-dimensional statistics.
 At least four reasons can be found for this success: 1. They are widely applicable whenever the underlying problem has a 'local' structure with respect to a suitable graph; 2. They are easy to implement and have linear or next-to-linear complexity (within coding they are widely implemented in hardware); 4. They often subsume existing heuristics as special cases; 5. On some random instance distributions which are important in practice, they can be analyzed precisely and tuned to achieve near-optimal performances. Each of these five points can be argued through examples. It would be highly desirable to make sense of them (of any subset of them)in a consistent theory.
