Computer systems research spans sub-disciplines that include embedded and real-time systems, compilers, networking, and operating systems. Our contention is that a number of structural factors inhibit quality research. We highlight some of the factors we have encountered in our work and observed in published papers and propose solutions that could both increase the productivity of researchers and the quality of their output.
