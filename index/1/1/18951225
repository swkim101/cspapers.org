A lot of recent research has focused on methods of modeling Web users and on efficient ways to initialize and manage user models. In this paper, we present a new user modeling technique relying on a temporal, graph-based data model for semistructured information. Our technique can be used to filter WWW information and to make the Web experience personalized for the individual user. Moreover, such graph based data model also offers appropriate query languages, which allow user-defined queries either over the whole web site or over the personalized user site views.
