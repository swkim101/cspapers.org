This paper introduces the Field-Programmable Learning Array, a new paradigm for rapid prototyping of learning primitives and machine-learning algorithms in silicon. The FPLA is a mixed-signal counterpart to the all-digital Field-Programmable Gate Array in that it enables rapid prototyping of algorithms in hardware. Unlike the FPGA, the FPLA is targeted directly for machine learning by providing local, parallel, online analog learning using floating-gate MOS synapse transistors. We present a prototype FPLA chip comprising an array of reconfigurable computational blocks and local interconnect. We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by mapping several learning circuits onto the prototype chip.
