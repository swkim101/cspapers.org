Reading groups domain is a new domain for group recommenders. In this paper we propose a web based group recommender system which is called BoRGo: Book Recommender for Reading Groups, for reading groups domain. BoRGo uses a new information filtering technique which uses the difference between positive and negative feedbacks about a feature of a user profile and also presents an interface for after recommendation processes like achieving a consensus on the reading list.
