The paper is a discussion of the issues that arose in the design of an operating system for a distributed multiprocessor, Cm*. Medusa is an attempt to understand the effect on operating system structure of distributed hardware, and to produce a system that capitalizes on and reflects the underlying architecture. The resulting system combines several structural features that make it unique among existing operating systems.
