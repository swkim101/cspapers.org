This paper presents a simple programming logic LES, which is particularly well suited for reasoning about so-called expression languages, i.e. languages that incorporate imperative features into expressions rather than distinguishing between expressions and statements. An axiomatization of a simple programming language is presented using this formalism. It is shown that this axiomatization is relatively complete, roughly in the sense of [Coo 76].
