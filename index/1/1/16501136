In this paper, we build a sponsored search auction platform to simulate and analysis the auction result for auctioneers. We propose to use geometrically decreasing sequence to capture the click behavior of internet users. In our simulations, the results show that theoretical properties of the charging mechanisms are captured, and the proposed platform reflects the charging mechanism's property. Therefore, the auctioneer can use the proposed platform to simulate the auction and estimate the result in expectations.
