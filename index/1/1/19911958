Assignments in an upperlevel undergraduate programming languages course should require students to do more than write elementary programs in several languages. Assignments for this course should allow students to explore alternative programming language paradigms and require critical written evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses. Course assignments can help students develop their research skills by requiring students to make use of the professional literature and by providing them with experiences in designing experiments. This paper describes four assignments which require students to utilize these skills.
