One of the best-known problems in data mining is association rule mining. It requires very large computation and I/O traffic capacity, therefore several distributed and parallel association rule mining algorithms have been developed. However the association rule mining problem is NP complete, the execution time estimation of the algorithms can be very important, especially for load balancing or for capacity and resource planning. In this paper a novel execution time prediction method is introduced and evaluated on a PC cluster environment. The average relative error of this model is less than 10 percent.
