Verification of control systems is often done using extensive simulation. This gives the engineer useful qualitative information about the system performance. However, simulation cannot be used to rigorously prove stability and robustness of the system. Such properties can only be verified using mathematical analysis which for many realistic systems becomes rather involved. This paper presents the MATLAB toolbox IQCbeta. It provides a user friendly interface for advanced semi-automatic systems analysis
