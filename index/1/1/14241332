We consider the problem of visual tracking of regions of interest in a sequence of motion blurred images. Traditional methods couple tracking with deblurring in order to correctly account for the effects of motion blur. Such coupling is usually appropriate, but computationally wasteful when visual tracking is the lone objective. Instead of deblurring images, we propose to match regions by blurring them. The matching score for two image regions is governed by a cost function that only involves the region deformation parameters and two motion blur vectors. We present an efficient algorithm to minimize the proposed cost function and demonstrate it on sequences of real blurred images.
