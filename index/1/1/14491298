Independent Contact Regions allow a robust finger placement on the object, despite of potential errors in finger position. They are computed without considering the kinematics of the end-effector, and are usually applied to off-line grasp planners. This paper presents an approach to obtain Reachable Independent Contact Regions by including the hand kinematics in the computational loop. The regions are computed in a short time, which allows real-time applications in virtual grasping. Potential applications of the proposed approach include regrasp planning, and dual-hand manipulation of objects.
