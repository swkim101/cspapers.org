Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) is a subarea of machine learning which combines elements from statistical and probabilistic modeling with languages which support structured data representations. In this survey, we will: 1) provide an introduction to SRL, 2) describe some of the distinguishing characteristics of SRL systems, including relational feature construction and collective classification, 3) describe three SRL systems in detail, 4) discuss applications of SRL techniques to important data management problems such as entity resolution, selectivity estimation, and information integration, and 5) discuss connections between SRL methods and existing database research such as probabilistic databases.
