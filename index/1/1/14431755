In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the dynamic routing of a group of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) used for transporting goods in automatic warehouses. Our strategy allows to improve the efficiency of a fleet of AGVs in terms of delivery time and its computational burden is sufficiently small to be embedded in standard industrial traffic management system. The algorithm is validated in a small-scale automatic warehouse with real AGVs.
