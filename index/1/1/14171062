This paper describes a method of dogleg trust-region steps, or restricted Levenberg-Marquardt steps, based on a projection process onto the Krylov subspaces for neural networks nonlinear least squares problems. In particular, the linear conjugate gradient (CG) method works as the inner iterative algorithm for solving the linearized Gauss-Newton normal equation, whereas the outer nonlinear algorithm repeatedly takes so-called "Krylov-dogleg" steps, relying only on matrix-vector multiplication without explicitly forming the Jacobian matrix or the Gauss-Newton model Hessian. That is, our iterative dogleg algorithm can reduce both operational counts and memory space by a factor of O(n) (the number of parameters) in comparison with a direct linear-equation solver. This memory-less property is useful for large-scale problems.
