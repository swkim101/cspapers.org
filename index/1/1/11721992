An approach to requirements specification for embedded systems, based on constructing an executable model of the proposed system interacting with its environment, is proposed. The approach is explained, motivated, and related to data-oriented specification techniques. Portions of a specification language embodying it are introduced, and illustrated with an extended example in which the requirements for a process-control system are developed incrementally.
