This paper describes a novel methodology to automate the design of the interconnect distribution for multistage clock circuits. We introduce two key ideas. First, a hierarchical decomposition of the layout divides the problem into a set of local Steiner-wired latch clusters (to minimize and balance local capacitance) fed globally by a balanced binary tree (to maximize performance). Second, we recast the global clock distribution problem as a simultaneous optimization of clock topology, clock segment routing, wire sizing and buffering. The hierarchical decomposition reduces the problem complexity and allows use of more aggressive optimization techniques. Integration of the geometric and electrical optimizations likewise allows more aggressive performance goals. Experiments with an industrial design comprising over 16,000 latches demonstrate the efficiency of the approach: a complete clock distribution solution met a 200-MHz cycle time specification with only 310 ps of skew, met strict current density constraints, exhibited good delay matching across uniform wire width and device variations, and was completed in under 10 CPU hours.
