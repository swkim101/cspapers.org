A visual input is likely to play an important role in many future mechanical handling and inspection systems. This paper will describe one experimental implementation of a machine of this type; an automatic printed circuit board drilling machine in which a TV camera is used to view the board and a small computer is used to process the TV image. The computer controls the machine using only the information extracted from the picture.
