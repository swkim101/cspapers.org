The spectrum is formed according to how much more weight we give to the recent history than to the older history, and is referred to as the LRFU (Least Recently/Frequently Used) policy. Unlike many previous policies that use limited history to make block replacement decisions, the LRFU policy uses the complete reference history of blocks recorded during their cache residency. Nevertheless, the LRFU requires only a few words for each block to maintain such history. This paper also describes an implementation of the LRFU that again subsumes the LRU and LFU implementations. The LRFU policy is applied to buffer caching, and results from trace-driven simulations show that the LRFU performs better than previously known policies for the workloads we considered. This point is reinforced by results from our integration of the LRFU into the FreeBSD operating system.
