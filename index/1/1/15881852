This paper proposes the total protocol to determine the link structure of a human hand using optical motion capture data. The difficulty in capturing hand motion comes from the hand's relatively high degrees of freedom located in very small space. To deal with the problem caused by closeness between markers, the number of markers is reduced. The effect of reduced markers is compensated by simplifying the problem. The adverse effect of skin movement and the limited range of movement is avoided by regulating the calibration motion appropriately. A link estimation experiment is performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
