We introduce a new image-based visual navigation algorithm that allows the Cartesian velocity of a robot to be defined with respect to a set of visually observed features corresponding to previously unseen and unmapped world points. The technique is well suited to mobile robot tasks such as moving along a road or flying over the ground. We describe the algorithm in general form and present detailed simulation results for an aerial robot scenario using a spherical camera and a wide angle perspective camera, and present experimental results for a mobile ground robot.
