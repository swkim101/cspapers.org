Star, officially known as the Xerox 8010 Information System, is a workstation for professionals, providing a comprehensive set of capabilities for the office environment. The Star software consists of just over 250,000 lines of code. Its development required 93 work years over a 3.5 year period.
 The development of Star depended heavily on the use of powerful personal computers connected to a local-area network and on the use of the Mesa language and development environment. An Integration Service was introduced to speed up the building of Star and to relieve the programmers of many complex, but repetitive, tasks.
