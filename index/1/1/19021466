An experiment was conducted to determine which of several candidate user interfaces for panning is most usable and intuitive: panning by pushing the background, panning by pushing the view/window, and panning by touching the side of die display screen. Twelve subjects participated in the experiment, which consisted of three parts: 1) subjects were asked to suggest panning user interfaces that seemed natural to them, 2) subjects each used three different paiming user interfaces to perform a structured panning task, with experimenters recording their performance, and 3) subjects were asked which of the three panning mediods they preferred. One panning method, panning by pushing the background, emerged as superior in performance and user preference, and slightly better in intuitiveness than panning by touching the side of the screen. Panning by p u s ^g the view/window fared poorly relative to the ot^rs on all measures.
