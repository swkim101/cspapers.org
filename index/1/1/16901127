Interdependency analysis is the core of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). Major developed countries have been constructing simulation tools to analyze CIIP interdependency. This paper describes a domestic effort to construct such a simulator. An agent based approach was used to support adaptive decision making for both the attackers and defenders. The simulator employed a GIS interface for visual effects, and developed a modified IIM (Inoperability Input-Output Model) algorithm for computing cascading impacts. Vulnerable points in the protection can be identified through the simulation to support decision making and personnel training.
