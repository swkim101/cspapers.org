Recommender systems used in current online social platforms make recommendations by only considering how relevant an item is to a specific user but they ignore the fact that, thanks to mechanisms like sharing or re-posting across the underlying social network, an item recommended to a user i propagates through the network and can reach another user j without needing to be explicitly recommended to j too. Overlooking this fact may lead to an inefficient use of the limited recommendation slots. These slots can instead be exploited more profitably by avoiding unnecessary duplicates and recommending other equally relevant items. In this work we take a step towards rethinking recommender systems by exploiting the anticipated social-network information diffusion and withholding recommendation of items that are expected to reach a user through sharing/re-posting. We devise a novel recommender system, DifRec, by formulating the problem of maximizing the total user engagement as an allocation problem in a properly-defined neighborhoodness graph, i.e., a graph that models the conflicts of recommending an item to a user who will receive it anyway by social diffusion. We show that the problem is NP-hard and propose efficient heuristics to solve it. We assess the performance of our DifRec by involving real data from Tumblr platform. We obtain substantial improvements in overall user engagement (130%--190%) over the real recommender system embedded in Tumblr and over various existing recommender systems.
