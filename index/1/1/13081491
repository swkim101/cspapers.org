Previous research has suggested the permutation test as the theoretically optimal statistical significance test for IR evaluation, and advocated for the discontinuation of the Wilcoxon and sign tests. We present a large-scale study comprising nearly 60 million system comparisons showing that in practice the bootstrap, t-test and Wilcoxon test outperform the permutation test under different optimality criteria. We also show that actual error rates seem to be lower than the theoretically expected 5%, further confirming that we may actually be underestimating significance.
