A simple mathematical model for the large-scale circuitry of primary visual cortex is introduced. It is shown that a basic cortical architecture of recurrent local excitation and lateral inhibition can account quantitatively for such properties as orientation tuning. The model can also account for such local effects as cross-orientation suppression. It is also shown that nonlocal state-dependent coupling between similar orientation patches, when added to the model, can satisfactorily reproduce such effects as non-local iso--orientation suppression, and non-local cross-orientation enhancement. Following this an account is given of perceptual phenomena involving object segmentation, such as "popout", and the direct and indirect tilt illusions.
