We are concerned by data processing in both centralized and distributed environments. We claim that it is profitable and efficient to make the same effort to the design of the transactions system as we made to the design of the data system. To define such a system, we present in this paper two levels of transactions modeling. We discuss the impact of the proposed modeling upon concurrency and parallelism management.
