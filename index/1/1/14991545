The proposed PhD work approaches the problem of information flow and change on the Web. To model temporal dynamics both of the Web structure and its content, the author proposes to apply the framework of stochastic graph transformation systems. This framework is currently widely used in software engineering and model checking. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the framework will be performed during a case study of the short-term temporal behavior of economics news on selected English news websites and blogs over selected time period.
