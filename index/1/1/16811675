Bounded response time is an important requirement when rule-based expert systems are used in real-time applications. In the case the rule-based system cannot terminate in bounded time, we should detect the "culprit" conditions causing the non-termination to assist programmers in debugging. This paper describes a novel tool which analyzes OPS5 programs to achieve this goal. The first step is to verify that an OPS5 program can terminate in bounded time. A graphical representation of an OPS5 program is defined and evaluated. Once the termination of the OPS5 program is not expected, the "culprit" conditions are detected. These conditions are then used to correct the problem by adding extra rules to the original program.
