We prove that any depth–3 circuit with MOD m gates of unbounded fan-in on the lowest level, AND gates on the second, and a weighted threshold gate on the top needs either exponential size or exponential weights to compute the inner product of two vectors of length n over GF(2). More exactly we prove that log(wikf) = Q(n), where w is the sum of the absolute values of the weights, and &f is the maximum fan–in of the AND gates on level 2. Setting all weights to 1, we have got a trade-off between the numbers of the MOD m gates and the AND gates. By our knowledge, this is the first trade–off result involving hard-to–handle MOD m gates. In contrast, with n AND gates at the bottom and a single MOD 2 gate at the top one can compute the inner product function. The lower–bound proof does not use any monotonicity or uniformity assumptions, and all of our gates have unbounded fan–in. The key step in the proof is a random evaluation protocol of a circuit with MOD m gates.
