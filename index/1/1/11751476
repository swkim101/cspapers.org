Source code re-use has become an important problem in academia. The amount of code available makes necessary to develop systems supporting education that could address the problem of detection of source code re-use. We present the DeSoCoRe tool based on techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to detect source code re-use. DeSoCoRe compares two source codes at the level of methods or functions even when written in different programming languages. The system provides an understandable output to the human reviewer in order to help a teacher to decide whether a source code is re-used.
