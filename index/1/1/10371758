Many knowledge-based processes rely on XML-based office documents. Up to now, versioning and merging XML documents was a difficult and error-prone task, mostly done manually. The support by tools is still in its infancy. We have presented a novel approach to compare and merge XML documents in a reliable way using context fingerprints. In this demonstration, we show the application of our toolset to ODF documents using a new, simple, and user-friendly graphical user-interface.
