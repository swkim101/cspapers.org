We consider the mobile phone location tracking problem in indoor environments. We propose a hybrid approach for energy-efficient indoor mobile phone localization by combining two well-known techniques namely, pedestrian dead reckoning and WiFi fingerprinting. Our preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach shows that it achieves better location accuracy (median error around 2m) than either of the two techniques on which it is based.
