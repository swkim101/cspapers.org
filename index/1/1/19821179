In social media, user engagement is mediated by an online profile, through which our interactions with online social worlds are framed. By adapting and mediating the embodied acts of Identify Performance and Impression Management, the online profile informs socialization and self-identity. This research posits that the particular use case for maintaining an online profile creates an unprecedented, technology-driven form of human vigilance during intermittent use. A set of design principles is proposed in order to guide the design of more effective and sustainable interactions that support vigilance during cases of intermittent use. These principles can be generalized from social networking into numerous domains of HCI.
