THE DEPARTMENT The Human-Computer Interaction Department (HCID) is part of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, which is the central research and development organization of the Hewlett-Packard Company. The deparunent is composed of approximately thirty researchers from a variety of fields, including computer science, cognitive psychology, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, with experience levels ranging from recent graduates to twenty-plus years of academic and induslrial research. In addition to our permanent staff, we have opportunities for students, visitors (e.g., sabbaticals), and consultants. The theme of the group is the enhancement of computer useability and software development productivity in the areas of human-computer interfaces and computer-supported cooperative work. We explore the effective use of interface technologies to facilitate human collaboration in interactive environments, and are interested in supporting sustained interactions.
