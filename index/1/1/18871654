In this paper we present a study of a robotic system that consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a pair of manipulator arms (MMUAV), and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The envisioned application scenario includes autonomous packet transportation, where MMUAV is used for picking/placing packets, while both MMUAV and UGV can be used for packet transportation, with different energy consumption profiles. We propose a reactive method for decentralized task planning and coordination of robots using hierarchical task decomposition based on TÃ†MS framework. Our approach takes into account low-level motion-planning aspects of the system as well as high-level mission specification, making this a multi-layered system. For low-level planning we use sampling-based planner combined with obstacle-free trajectory generation. Methods are verified in simulations and on an experimental testbed, using 3D Robotics quadcopter and Pioneer 3DX mobile robots with the results showing stability and robustness of the presented methods.
