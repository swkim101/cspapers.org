In this paper a new step-wise approach to kinematic calibration of a 5-DOF Gantry-Tau parallel kinematic machine (PKM) is presented. The approach can be adapted to the modular design of the PKM and the calibration could easily perform part of the assembly instructions for the machine. By using measurements from a laser tracker and least-squares estimates of polynomial functions, a typical accuracy of about 20 micrometer was achieved for the base actuators. The remaining set of 30 general parameters for the hexapod link structure and spherical joint connections were successfully estimated using the Complex search-based evolutionary algorithm.
