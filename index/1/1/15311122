The purpose of this paper is to describe a sorting network of size 0(n log n) and depth 0(log n). A natural way of sorting is through consecutive halvings: determine the upper and lower halves of the set, proceed similarly within the halves, and so on. Unfortunately, while one can halve a set using only 0(n) comparisons, this cannot be done in less than log n (parallel) time, and it is known that a halving network needs (Â½)n log n comparisons. It is possible, however, to construct a network of 0(n) comparisons which halves in constant time with high accuracy. This procedure (&egr;-halving) and a derived procedure (&egr;-nearsort) are described below, and our sorting network will be centered around these elementary steps.
