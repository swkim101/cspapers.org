While the desire to support fast, ad hoc query processing for large data warehouses has motivated the recent introduction of many new indexing structures, with a few notable exceptions (namely, the LSM-Tree [4] and the Stepped Merge Method [1]) little attention has been given to developing new indexing schemes that allow fast insertions. Since additions to a large warehouse may number in the millions per day, indices that require a disk seek (or even a significant fraction of a seek) per insertion are not acceptable. In this paper, we offer an alternative to the B+-tree called the Y-tree for indexing huge warehouses having frequent insertions. The Y-tree is a new indexing structure supporting both point and range queries over a single attribute, with retrieval performance comparable to the B+-tree. For processing insertions, however, the Y-tree may exhibit a speedup of 100 times over batched insertions into a B+-tree.
