TSV-to-TSV coupling is a new parasitic element in 3D ICs and can become a significant source of signal integrity problem. Existing studies on its extraction, however, becomes highly inaccurate when handling more than two TSVs on full-chip scale. In this paper we investigate the multiple TSV-to-TSV coupling issue and propose an accurate model that can be efficiently used for full-chip extraction. Unlike the common belief that only the closest neighboring TSVs affect the victim, our study shows that non-neighboring aggressors also cause non-negligible impact. Based on this observation, we propose an effective method of reducing the overall coupling level in multiple TSV cases.
