Grid computations require global access to massive data stores. To meet this need, the GridNFS project aims to provide scalable, high-performance, transparent, and secure wide-area data management as well as a scalable and agile name space.
 While parallel file systems give high I/O throughput, they are highly specialized, have limited operating system and hardware platform support, and often lack strong security mechanisms. Remote data access tools such as NFS and GridFTP overcome some of these limitations, but fail to provide universal, transparent, and scalable remote data access.
 As part of GridNFS, this paper introduces Direct-pNFS, which builds on the NFSv4.1 protocol to meet a key challenge in accessing remote parallel file systems: high-performance and scalable data access without sacrificing transparency, security, orportability. Experiments with Direct-pNFS demonstrate I/O throughput that equals or out performs the exported parallel file system across a range of workloads.
