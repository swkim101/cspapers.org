In the course of a normal day, people effortlessly recall past events and episodes from their lives. A reasonable goal in the design of computer programs is to construct a memory with that same capability. To facilitate such retrieval of events from a computer memory, we must first specify a reasonable memory organization. We must then design updating and retrieval processes to build up and access that information. This paper will present such a theory, and will describe a computer program named CYRUS which implements the theory.
