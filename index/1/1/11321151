The authors are interested i n developing the position and heading measurement system for vehicle automation and car navigation. T h i s paper proposes the new method t o measure the position and heading of ground vehicle. ins ta l led r ig id ly on the vehicle and a l i ne of corner cubes placed on roadway side. By measuring the time or distance when a corner cubes are de tec ted , i t calculates the position and heading. Experimental resu l t for this proposed method shows tha t it is applicable fo r the ground vehicles' position and hea&ing qeasurement . The method uses laser beam transceivers
