We present the design and deployment results for PosNet - a large-scale, long-duration sensor network that gathers summary position and status information from mobile nodes. The mobile nodes have a fixed-sized memory buffer to which position data is added at a constant rate, and from which data is downloaded at a non-constant rate. We have developed a novel algorithm that performs online summarization of position data within the buffer, where the algorithm naturally accommodates data input and output rate mismatch, and also provides a delay-tolerant approach to data transport. The algorithm has been extensively tested in a large-scale long-duration cattle monitoring and control application.
