Computers are designed in stages. After the architectural definition of the system a block diagram is developed. From this the detail logic and the microprogram is developed in several steps, and the logic structure is mapped to a physical structure.
 This process consits essentially of transformations and expansions under constraints, leaving the desired function of the system being developed invariant.
 This paper analyzes the development process critically and covers methods with which the invariance of the function of the systems can be guranteed.
 Furthermore, a program systera is presented which was written as a tool to support the development of computers and which was used for the developraent of the model 125 of System /370. The Behavioral Language of this support-system will be presented in its major features.
