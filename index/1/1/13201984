Timing closure is the most critical phase of modern system-on-chip implementation: without timing closure, there is no tapeout. Timing closure is the end result of (i) years of methodology development, script development, signoff recipe development, etc.; (ii) months of block- and top-level final physical implementation; and (iii) a last set of manual noise and DRC fixes, with a final signoff analysis and physical verification. Over the past decade, key aspects of the underlying process and device technologies, modeling standards, EDA tooling, design methodology, and signoff criteria have changed the nature of timing closure. This paper surveys such recent evolutions in timing closure and notes directions for near-term future evolutions.
