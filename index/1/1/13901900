The Computation, Complexity, and Emergence honors seminar at UMBC is designed to introduce an interdisciplinary undergraduate audience to the principles of complex systems that permeate our world. The course goals are for students to understand how simple individual behaviors can lead to complex global behaviors and to be able to identify the sources and effects of complexity in natural and artificial systems. The course is designed to increase students' comfort and skill level in scientific writing, participating actively in written and oral discussions, and learning collaboratively in an interdisciplinary community. The paper describes the course and the innovative elements that lead to student engagement, then presents data from pre- and post-assessments about student attitudes and perceptions.
