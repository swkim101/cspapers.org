Several issues arise with management of content that is generated in developing regions. Some result from linguistic diversity (as in India and Africa), some result from content being available only in forms that are more difficult to computationally manipulate (e.g., handwriting, speech, and legacy digital text in nonstandard encodings), some result from underinvestment in language resources for the languages of these regions, and some result from increased contact between cultures that have different views regarding the proper use of information and information artifacts. Such issues warrant focused attention if we are to optimally leverage information and knowledge management to the advantage of populations in developing regions. That is the purpose of this workshop.
