Most existing methods for supervised tensor learning use only rank-one weight tensors in the linear model and cannot readily incorporate domain knowledge. In our framework, we obtain the weight tensor in a hierarchical way â€” we first approximate it by a low-rank tensor, and then estimate the low-rank approximation using the prior knowledge from various sources, e.g., different domain experts. This is motivated by wafer quality prediction in semiconductor manufacturing. Furthermore, we propose an effective algorithm named H-MOTE for solving this framework, which is guaranteed to converge. The time complexity of H-MOTE is linear with respect to the number of examples as well as the size of the weight tensor. Experimental results show the superiority of H-MOTE over state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real data sets.
