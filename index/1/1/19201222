However, few studies consider the negative impact of some of the influenced users.We propose a negative-aware influence maximization problem by considering users' negative impact. A novel algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Experiments on real-world datasets show the proposed algorithm can achieve 70% improvement on average in expected influence compared with rivals.
