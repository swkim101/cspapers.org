A simulated machine approach to an operating systems course project is described. The motivations for including the project in the course are delineated. The reasons for selecting the particular type of project are given. The fictitious hardware and the requirements for its simulation are presented. The conceptual issues are amplified. The methodology for a high level process oriented design for a multiprogrammed batch environment is delineated. The primitives to be used in the design are described and motivated. The issues to be addressed in the actual implementation of the paper design are explored. Possible extensions to the project are suggested. Student feedback is presented. Conclusions are drawn.
