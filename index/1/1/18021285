Modbat makes testing easier by providing a user-friendly modeling language to describe the behavior of systems, from such a model, test cases are generated and executed. Modbat's domain-specific language is based on Scala, its features include probabilistic and non-deterministic transitions, component models with inheritance, and exceptions. We demonstrate the versatility of Modbat by finding a confirmed defect in the currently latest version of Java, and by testing SAT solvers.
