Understanding crowd dynamics of large-scale events is crucial to deliver a pleasant experience for the participants. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid participatory sensing approach to capture large group dynamics. Specifically, our approach is based on distributing a large number of tiny, wearable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and few smartphones among the group members. We start by identifying the best configuration; in terms of transmit power and beaconing interval; for detecting BLE tags in indoor and outdoor environments. Then, as a case study, we deploy the system during the six main days of the Hajj pilgrimage in 2014, which is the world's largest annual religious gathering. We used the proposed hybrid participatory approach to collect the mobility data of pilgrim groups based on GPS location and co-occurring BLE tag detections. Our system provided up to 80% group-wise detectability in a single scan event. Moreover, 98% cumulative unique tags detectability is achieved in the whole event, leading to 0.74 million records. Analysis of the group dynamics revealed unexpected behavior and interesting findings. In particular, regional variations are found among different groups in the entry or exit times, duration of stay, and group cohesion; which are attributed to congestion, improper arrangements, or the nature of activities. Furthermore, we show sub-community clusters could be identified revealing clear biases based on the demographic characteristics. Based on this case study, we also give suggestions on using the proposed system for other large-scale events.
