Photographs play a central role in many types of informal storytelling. This paper describes an easy-to-use device that enables digital photos to be used in a manner similar to print photos for sharing personal stories. A portable form factor combined with a novel interface supports local sharing like a conventional photo album as well as recording of stories that can be sent to distant friends and relatives. User tests validate the design and reveal that people alternate between “photo-driven” and “story-driven” strategies when telling stories about their photos.
