We present two large studies and one case study that make a strong case for considering telephone operators as knowledge workers. We describe a quantitative analysis of the diversity of operators' knowledge work, and of how their knowledge work coordinates with the subtle resources contained within customers' requests. Operators engage in collaborative query refinement with customers, exhibiting a rich set of skilled performances. Earlier reports characterized the operators' role as an intermediary between customer and database. In contrast, we focus on operator's consultative work in which they use computer systems as one type of support for their primarily cognitive activities. Our results suggest that knowledge work may be a subtle feature of many jobs, not only those that are labeled as such. Our methodology may be useful for the analysis of other domains involving skilled workers.
