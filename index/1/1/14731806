Recently, we have received a growing number of reports that complain about poor and unstable internet connections at bus stops in metro Seoul. Careful analyses led us to conclude that Wi-Fi APs equipped on buses instigate the trouble. According to the ambitious free Wi-Fi expansion plan by the city of Seoul, public buses started to equip Wi-Fi APs. As buses with APs stop and go, they actualize intermittent connection opportunities to riders waiting at the bus stops. However, the connection durations are too short such that bus APs are a nuisance rather than a convenience. We collected the basic statistics such as AP inter-arrival and sojourn times and measured link level performance metrics. We observed the effect of frequent frame losses on the TCP congestion control and eventually on the TCP throughput. We also measured the performance of applications such as PLT (Page Load Time). The measurement results showed that passing APs are useful only for some applications in very limited situations while they are virtually useless and just irritations in many cases. We also discovered that poor Wi-Fi connections pervert MPTCP; MPTCP performs worse than the generic single path TCP over the LTE network. We expect that our results will be used as the reference data in redesigning Wi-Fi offloading mechanisms as well as in planning and deploying urban Wi-Fi networks.
