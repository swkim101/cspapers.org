With the advent of integrated circuitry, digital simulation has replaced physical fault insertion as the primary means for evaluating diagnostic tests. At Bell Laboratories, an improved version of the sequential analyzer was integrated into a data management system with a number of support programs. The system was used to evaluate the diagnostic program for a 32K core memory system under development for electronic switching system (ESS) applications. Important circuit design feedback was obtained through simulation early in the development cycle, making possible an unprecedented high level of switching system fault detection. Processing techniques were developed to select and order tests to obtain high diagnostic resolution with minimum vulnerability to inconsistencies.
