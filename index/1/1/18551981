The following paper is to present a test and reconfiguration strategy for fault-tolerant VLSI processor systems. This is accomplished with respect to the requirements imposed by the VLSI technology. The proposed concept is exemplified by a model composed of four microprogrammable processors each with a local memory. The test strategy of a gradually expanding hardcore is applied where the central hardcore consists of a small test unit of low complexity. This test unit enables each processor to diagnose autonomously its data path structure and its associated local memory. A particular reconfiguration scheme is proposed for these components. It is implemented at microprogram level. As a result, compared with other fault-tolerance techniques, system reliability is considerably improved.
