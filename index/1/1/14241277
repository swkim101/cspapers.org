This paper closely examines the performance analysis for unbuffered multipath multistage interconnection networks. A critical discussion of commonly used analysis is provided to identify a basic flaw in the model. A new analysis based on the grouping of alternate links is proposed as an alternative to rectify the error. The results based on the new analysis and extensive simulation are presented for three representative networks. The simulation study strongly supports the results of the new analysis.
