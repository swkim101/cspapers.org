WC consider a new approach to the algebraic set decomposition problem, by applying the idea of black boxes (introduced by Kaltofen and Trager[l]) for evaluating polynomials and rational functions, We obtain efficient Monte-Carlo algorithms for the algebraic set decomposition problem for the black box representation and for the sparse representation. WC demonstrate the usefulness of the black box representntion by showing that considerable information can be extracted from the black box representation ofan algebraic variety, As an application of the theory of self-testing of polynomials, we give an efficient and simple algorithm that checks the correctness of the black boxes output by the black box algorithm of Kaltofen and Trager[l] for factorization.
