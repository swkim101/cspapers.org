Europe, Australia, and North America face two similar challenges with respect to computing--there have not been enough students matriculating to keep up with demand and the lack of diversity remains an issue. To address these challenges, private and public resources have been allocated to educate primary and secondary students in computing. Previous meta-studies on these often segregated outreach efforts within the United States indicate that research on their impact remains spotty, short-term, and inconsistent, leaving a gap in the ability to evaluate their long-term impact. Building upon previous research focused in the U.S., this study examines similarities and differences in the results of 17 formal, peer-reviewed computing education research journals and conferences across Australia, Europe, and North America during 2009-2015. Results indicate that a lacuna exists in international research, paralleling results of the more narrowly focused study of U.S. venues. The paper further defines the major issues researchers face in conducting assessment studies for outreach and recommendations for addressing this gap.
