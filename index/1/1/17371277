We survey an experiment in distinguishing voice and fax customers in a long distance telephony network based on the customersâ€™ calling patterns. We highlight three elements of algorithmic interest. First, we indicate how the theory of I/O-efficient algorithms productively guided the design of our software, whereas other algorithmic formalisms were less useful. Next, we describe a hyperplane-separator heuristic we developed for this problem whose performance here is comparable to that of an established learning algorithm. Finally, we discuss some open problems whose solution would have direct practical value.
