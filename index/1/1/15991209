With the ever-increasing use of computers for storing large volumes of vital data, the problems involved in providing data security have been receiving very great attention from researchers. In this paper we try to investigate the various aspects of data security in a general-purpose Data Base Management System (DBMS). Data security concerns data manipulation which encompasses two phases : retrieval and access (read/write). Privacy protection is associated with the retrieval phase and integrity attached to the modification phase. In this paper, we detail both parts of data security and give an overview of the potential solutions to each feature.
