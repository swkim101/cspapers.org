In this paper, we systematically explore the widely held, anecdotal belief that mismanaged networks are responsible for a wide range of security incidents. Utilizing Internet-scale measurements of DNS resolvers, BGP routers, and SMTP, HTTP, and DNS-name servers, we find there are thousands of networks where a large fraction of network services are misconfigured. Combining global feeds of malicious activities including spam, phishing, malware, and scanning, we find a statistically significant correlation between networks that are mismanaged and networks that are responsible for maliciousness.
