As a key representation model of knowledge, ontology has been widely used in a lot of NLP related tasks, such as semantic parsing, information extraction and text mining etc. In this paper, we study the task of ontology matching, which concentrates on finding semantically related entities between different ontologies that describe the same domain, to solve the semantic heterogeneity problem. Previous works exploit different kinds of descriptions of an entity in ontology directly and separately to find the correspondences without considering the higher level correlations between the descriptions. Besides, the structural information of ontology havenâ€™t been utilized adequately for ontology matching. We propose in this paper an ontology matching approach, named ERSOM, which mainly includes an unsupervised representation learning method based on the deep neural networks to learn the general representation of the entities and an iterative similarity propagation method that takes advantage of more abundant structure information of the ontology to discover more mappings. The experimental results on the datasets from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI1) show that ERSOM achieves a competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art ontology matching systems. The OAEI is an international initiative organizing annual campaigns for evaluating ontology matching systems. All of the ontologies provided by OAEI are described in OWL-DL language, and like most of the other participates our ERSOM also manages the OWL ontology in its current version.
