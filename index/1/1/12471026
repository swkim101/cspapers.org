We provide a framework for 6 DOF pose estimation in seam-tracking applications using particle filtering. The particle filter algorithm developed incorporates measurements from both a 2 DOF laser seam tracker and the robot forward kinematics under an assumed external force. Special attention is paid to modeling of disturbances in the respective measurements, and methods are developed to assist the selection of sensor configurations for optimal estimation performance. The developed estimation algorithm and simulation environment are provided as an open-source, extendable package, written with an intended balance between readability and performance.
