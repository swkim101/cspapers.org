Smartphones have created a strong tie with human beings. It is likely to have plenty of smartphones in the same proximity. However, users are limited with the capabilities of a single device. In this work we propose ColPhone a framework that facilitates collaboration between smartdevices in the vicinity to share their resources providing users hardware upgrade for their devices. Further, we implemented an application (3D Story Teller) on top of ColPhone, and measured the impact of collaboration on smartphone's power consumption.
