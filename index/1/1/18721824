In the report, the authors present a unimodular loop transformation called rotation as a simple, systematic and elegant method for partitioning the iteration spaces of nested loops for execution on distributed memory multiprocessors. They define three parameters associated with each rotation which are used to choose the most appropriate rotation. These parameters are the parallelism factor, the load imbalance and the volume of communication. They present formal algebraic expressions for these parameters and discuss their relative significance in choosing a combined metric. They also present some comparisons with related work and discuss possible extensions and generalizations.
