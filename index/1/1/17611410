Algorithms have come to be recognized as the cornerstone of computing. Surprisingly, there has been little research or discussion of general techniques for designing algorithms. Though several such techniques have been identified, there are serious shortcomings in the existing taxonomy. The paper points out these shortcomings, reevaluates some of the techniques, and proposes a new, hierarchical classification scheme by grouping techniques according to their level of generality. A variety of examples from different areas of computing are used to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the taxonomy being proposed.
