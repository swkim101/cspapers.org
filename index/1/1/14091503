A new generation of knowledge/databases is emerging. These systems contain thousands of objects, densely interconnected and heterogeneously organized, entered from many sources, both human and automated. Such systems present tremendous challenges to their users, who must locate relevant information quickly and add new information effectively. Our research aims to understand and support the knowledge editing task. The HITS Knowledge Editor (HKE) is an interface that supports browsing and modifying the CYC knowledge base (Guha & Lenat 1990). HKE has been designed to be a collaborative interface, following a set of principles for sharing tasks between system and user. We describe these principles and illustrate how HKE provides resources built according to those principles that collaborate with its users on a variety of knowledge editing tasks.
