We describe the Digital Bookshelf (a projector and camera based system) that similar to a physical bookshelf is designed to present a set of books for decorating and self-expression purposes. Digital books in the bookshelf are presented based on meta information (e.g. by price, rating and cover color) to highlight adjacencies and to create a meaningful and aesthetic view. The system makes use of research in serendipity and multivariate statistics to allow the user to browse along flexible paths of adjacent books in a large collection of books. It allows the user to experience how subsets of books create different visual expressions and atmospheres when placed in the bookshelf.
