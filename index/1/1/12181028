During the past 10--15 years offline learning to rank has had a tremendous influence on information retrieval, both scientifically and in practice. Recently, as the limitations of offline learning to rank for information retrieval have become apparent, there is increased attention for online learning to rank methods for information retrieval in the community. Such methods learn from user interactions rather than from a set of labeled data that is fully available for training up front. Below we describe why we believe that the time is right for an intermediate-level tutorial on online learning to rank, the objectives of the proposed tutorial, its relevance, as well as more practical details, such as format, schedule and support materials.
