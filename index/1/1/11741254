Most of the work done in the area of static routing concentrates on minimizing the runtime of the whole schedule rather than minimizing the runtime of individual packets, using global parameters such as the congestion and dilation of a path collection. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the routing time of individual packets, using local parameters. In fact, we present the first nearly optimal, truly on-line routing protocols for the following problems: l Packet switching: Assume that a fixed collection of paths is given. For every path p in this collection, let cP denote the maximum number of paths that share an edge with p, and let d, denote the length of p. Find a schedule such that the routing time of a packet following a path p merely depends on c, and dP. l Virtual circuit switching: Assume that a fixed set of sessions is given. For every session i, packets are injected at a rate 7; to follow a predetermined path of length di. If the sum of rates of the sessions using an edge is sufficiently small, find a schedule such that the routing time of a packet from session i merely depends on Ti and di. We also consider dynamic versions of the two problems together with a wide range of (stochastical and adversarial) injection models.
