Mininet is a great prototyping tool which combines existing SDN-related software components (e.g., Open vSwitch, OpenFlow controllers, network namespaces, cgroups) into a framework, which can automatically set up and configure customized OpenFlow testbeds scaling up to hundreds of nodes. Standing on the shoulders of Mininet, we implement a similar prototyping system called ESCAPE, which can be used to develop and test various components of the service chaining architecture. Our framework incorporates Click for implementing Virtual Network Functions (VNF), NETCONF for managing Click-based VNFs and POX for taking care of traffic steering. We also add our extensible Orchestrator module, which can accommodate mapping algorithms from abstract service descriptions to deployed and running service chains.
