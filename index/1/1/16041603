Regular expression matching as the core packet inspection engine of network systems has long been striving to be both fast in matching speed (like DFA) and scalable in storage space (like NFA). Recently, ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) has been investigated as a promising way out, by implementing DFA using TCAM for regular express matching. In this paper, we present the first method for implementing NFA using TCAM. Through proper TCAM encoding, our method matches each input byte with one single TCAM lookup --- operating at precisely the same speed as DFA, while using a number of TCAM entries that can be close to NFA size. These properties make our method an important step along a new path --- TCAM-based NFA implementation --- towards the long-standing goal of fast and scalable regular expression matching.
