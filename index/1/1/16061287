Recently, there are an increasing number of developing wearable devices that intent to display various contents. As can be seen in sign languages and hand signals, hand gestures can express rich information with small motions, therefore, they are useful input for those devices. Especially, these gestures are less obtrusive actions than other actions such as speaking. It means that hand-gesture-based input interfaces are very suitable for public use, where a user can't use desktop devices such as a mouse or a keyboard. Although there are many studies on recognition of hand gestures, existing hand shape recognition methods have several problems to be applied for home automation. A wearable wrist contour sensor device has been proposed in previous studies. However discussions about how to design the protocols of hand gesture interface are insufficient. In this paper, we develop real time hand gesture interfaces of content browse for wearable or remote displays. Usability test using the developed interfaces reveals that pronation is to be assigned as a variable configurator and hand shape is to be assigned as an operation switcher.
