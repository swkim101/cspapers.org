A dynamic control method that outperforms existing local torque optimization techniques for kinematically redundant manipulators is proposed. The proposed method resolves redundancy at the acceleration level. The command acceleration is composed of two terms: the minimum-norm acceleration and the null-space acceleration, which is intermittently added to the minimum-norm acceleration according to a kinematic criterion to globally reduce excessively large torque requirements. In particular, both the generation and the control of null-space acceleration is based on the property of full row-rank minors of a Jacobian matrix, i.e., the aspect, which is a function of a manipulator's configuration. Numerical simulations illustrated good capability from the viewpoint of torque optimization and global stability.
