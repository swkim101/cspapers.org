With the widespread use of a smartphone, users tend to use their smartphone for a long period of time in unhealthy postures; bending forward the neck and watching the relatively small screen closely with concentration. If users keep such unhealthy postures for a long time, they are susceptible to musculoskeletal disorders and eye problems such as cervical disc and myopia, respectively. To prevent users from having these diseases, we propose a new methodology to monitor the posture of smartphone users with built-in sensors. The proposed mechanism estimates various values representing user postures like the tilt angle of the neck, viewing distance, and gaze condition of the user, by analyzing sensor data from a front-faced camera, 3-axis accelerometer, orientation sensor, or any combination thereof, and warns the user if estimated values are maintained within the abnormal range over the allowed time. Via the proposed mechanism, users are able to be aware of their unhealthy postures, and then try to correct their postures.
