The success of tablet computers, game consoles, and Smart TVs reflects the increased user demand for Internet-based services at home. The users in the home network can access value-added services offered directly by the network provider, such as IPTV. Likewise, they also use Over-TheTop (OTT) services like YouTube, Netflix, or online gaming and browse the web or download files. All these services have specific requirements with respect to the network resources which have to be fulfilled to ensure a good Qualityof-Experience (QoE) for the users. Furthermore, multiple users may concurrently access different services via the central Internet access point in the home network, the home gateway, cf. Figure 1. As stated by the Home Gateway Initiative (HGI) [1], the network at home and the broadband Internet access link may constitute a bottleneck. This may be due to the insufficient availability of broadband access, i.e., the network provider offers only smallband Internet access, or due to limitations within the home network, like the varying channel quality of the wireless networks. Traffic in todayâ€™s network structures is usually transmitted on a best effort basis. As a result, different services or applications with varying requirements and capabilities are treated equally on a per flow-basis, resulting in a unfairness in terms of QoE. Long lasting OS updates on a home computer may thus interfere with video streaming to a Smart TV which leads to video stallings and a degradation in the QoE of the user. In such a case, it is necessary to explicitly
