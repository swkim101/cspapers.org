Introduction. Several techniques have been described for pattern searching in compressed text [de Moura et al., 1998, Manber, 1997]. In these methods the compression regime is usually modified in some way to suit the needs of the searching process, and compression effectiveness compromised. Furthermore, the searching mechanism used is usually based upon linear-search regular expression pattern matching, meaning that it can be expensive to handle large files. Finally, the whole nature of the exact-match searching process means that a small misconception in the construction of the pattern to be searched can result in a belief that the information sought is not present when in fact it is. Nevill-Manning et al. [1997] describe PHIND, a phrase-browsing approach to searching, in which a user “explores” the collection, and narrows down their region of interest step by step until their information need is met. In this presentation we build upon this approach, and show how the RE-PAIR compression regime [Larsson and Moffat, 2000] naturally supports a similar browsing capability, and also is such that locations in the text at which target phrases appear can be quickly identified, decompressed, and returned to the user. And because by-products of the compression process are used by the browser, no explicit index is required.
