We introduce a novel algorithm for factorial learning, motivated by segmentation problems in computational vision, in which the underlying factors correspond to clusters of highly correlated input features. The algorithm derives from a new kind of competitive clustering model, in which the cluster generators compete to explain each feature of the data set and cooperate to explain each input example, rather than competing for examples and cooperating on features, as in traditional clustering algorithms. A natural extension of the algorithm recovers hierarchical models of data generated from multiple unknown categories, each with a different, multiple causal structure. Several simulations demonstrate the power of this approach.
