T w o of the factors that have mitigated against better management use of computers are the necessity to communicate wi th them in a special language and to specify the details of the processing required. Apart from the investment required in learning how to use computers, these factors lead to delays and neccessitate a significant, special effort whenever the manager has an unusual request. To try to overcome these limitations we decided to investigate the uti l i ty and feasibility of a computer-based managementsupport system that would allow the manager to phrase his requests in English and contain enough domain-specific knowledge to analyze them and respond to them. The investigation is described in detail in Malhotra ( 4 ] . This paper summarizes our methodology and main findings. Preliminary conversations wi th managers indicated that such a system should serve as a front-end to a corporate data base to support problem analysis and decision-making. It should provide facilities for data retrieval and manipulation as well as be able to answer questions about its contents and capabilities. The system should also provide facilities for building and using management models. If a software error occurs during the processing of a request the user should not be asked to take any special action. It should be trapped by the system and the user merely asked to rephrase his request.
