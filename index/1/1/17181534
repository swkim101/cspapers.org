In traditional computer science curricula, students view program implementation as the end product and not the means to obtaining some further result. All too often students complete an implementation at the last minute, perform a minimal amount of testing and call the assignment done! This paper discusses an approach we have taken in our courses to have students use and develop programs as part of a scientific inquiry. In addition to causing students to perform more thorough testing, our approach also improves empirical and critical thinking skills.
