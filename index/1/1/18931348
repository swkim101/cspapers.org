We suggest a generation task that integrates discourse-level referring expression generation and sentence-level surface realization. We present a data set of German articles annotated with deep syntax and referents, including some types of implicit referents. Our experiments compare several architectures varying the order of a set of trainable modules. The results suggest that a revision-based pipeline, with intermediate linearization, significantly outperforms standard pipelines or a parallel architecture.
