The need for the protocol conversion has been recognized with the proliferation of heterogeneous networks. From a formal viewpoint, we regard that problem as generating a protocol which satisfies the properties of the conversion. In this paper, we prove that, one can determine whether a converter exists, for some protocol classes, given protocols in the form of communicating finite automata, Moreover, we give a construction method for such a converter for those classes, and derive an upper bound of the computational complexity of the construction algorithm.
