The paper [2] argued that mathematical ideas play an important role in the computer science curriculum, and that Discrete Mathematics needs to be taught early in the computer science curriculum. In this follow-up paper, we present evidence that computer science curricula are drifting away from a fundamental commitment to theoretical and mathematical ideas. We propose some actions that can be taken to help reverse this drift.
