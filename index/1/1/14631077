In recent emerging marketplace, designs for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs) have received much attention due to the large impact on packaging and product cost. One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually-compatible control signals. Prior works utilize this addressing scheme by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging. However, merging control signals also introduces redundant actuations, which potentially cause a high power-consumption problem. Recent studies on PDMFBs have indicated that high power consumption not only decreases the product lifetime but also degrades the system reliability. Unfortunately, this power-aware design concern is still not readily available among current design automations of PDMFBs. To cope with these issues, we propose in this paper the first power-aware broadcast addressing for PDMFBs. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and power-consumption minimization into consideration, thereby achieving higher integration and better design performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
