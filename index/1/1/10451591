Prior research shows that people often engage in deception when sharing location. Privacy concerns, social surveillance and impression management are the primary drivers of these types of behaviors. One methodological question that arises in this research context is the problem of reliable measurement to study predictors of deceptive location disclosure from usage data. In this note, we propose a simple experience sampling method (ESM) approach that is useful for studying this phenomenon. We describe our ESM deployment and report the results of a long term, quantitative study of 204 foursquare users over 1 year. Results indicate that physical distance, tie strength and order of visibility on the foursquare feed are significant predictors (with moderate to high effect sizes) of deceptive location disclosure. We connect these findings to the rich tradition of location disclosure behavior research in ubiquitous computing.
