Topographic maps in primary areas of mammalian cerebral cortex reorganise as a result of behavioural training. The nature of this reorganisation seems consistent with the behaviour of competitive neural networks, as has been demonstrated in the past by computer simulation. We model tactile training on the hand representation in primate somatosensory cortex, using the Neural Field Theory of Amari and his colleagues. Expressions for changes in both receptive field size and magnification factor are derived, which are consistent with owl monkey experiments and make a prediction which goes beyond them.
