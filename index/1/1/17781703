The goal of the proposed tool multi Searcher is to answer this research question: can we expect people to be able to get information from text in languages they can not read or understand? The proposed tool multi Searcher provides users with interactive contextual information that describes the translation in the user's own language so that the user has a certain degree of confidence about the translation. Therefore, the user is considered as an integral part of the retrieval process. The tool provides possibilities to interactively select relevant terms from contextual information in order to improve the translation and thus improve the cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) process.
