This paper presents a course in the design and implementation of computer games, offered as an upper-division computer science course at Colby College during the winter semester, 1999. The paper describes the material, topics, and projects included in the course. More generally, I argue that this course provides an ideal environment for students to integrate a wide base of computer knowledge and skills. The paper supports this argument by presenting the variety of computer science concepts covered in the course, as well as pointing out potential areas of variation in future courses, depending on the tastes and priorities of the instructor.
