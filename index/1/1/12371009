Thirteen selected Ph.D students who are currently working on dissertation research in human-computer interaction met for two days prior to the CHI+GI'87 Conference in a Doctoral Consortium. The consortium was designed to provide these students with an opportunity to exchange ideas on their dissertation research and to build a cohort group of colleagues. Of particular interest for the participants was the opportunity to compare research questions, paradigms and techniques, and the consortium encourages interdisciplinary dialogue. The students who were selected for participation represented thirteen different departments in ten academic institutions in North America and Europe. They came from a variety of disciplinary interests including psychology , computing science, management science, industrial engineering , languages and literature, and sociology. The research methods evident in the various projects included field studies, laboratory experiments, model development and evaluation, and design of prototype systems. The CHI+GI'87 Doctoral Consortium was organized around four sessions of related dissertation topics. In addition , an introductory session allowed the faculty to describe their backgrounds and current research interests, and a concluding session discussed the various research methods and issues which emerged during the consortium. The model with which Bonnie John is working predicts response times by modelling the algorithms people use to perform skilled cognitive tasks. Richard Catrambone up-plies production rule models to characterize and evaluate principles for the design of effective user manuals. Deborah K.rawczak focusses on how properties of an interface can affect the learning strategies that people use to acquire a conceptual model. Maung Sein examines the features of different conceptual models and how they are influenced by characteristics of individual users.
