Two distinct extensions of temporal logic has been recently advocated in the literature. The first extension is the addition of <italic>fixpoint</italic> operators that enable the logic to make assertions about arbitrary regular events. The second extension is the addition of <italic>past</italic> temporal connectives that enables the logic to refer directly to the history of the computation. Both extensions are motivated by the desire to adapt temporal logic to <italic>modular</italic>, i.e., compositional, verification (as opposed to global verification). We introduce and study here the logic <italic>μTL</italic>, which is the extension of temporal logic by fixpoint operators and past temporal connectives. We extend the automata-theoretic paradigm to <italic>μTL</italic>. That is, we show how, given an <italic>μTL</italic> formula @@@@, we can produce a finite-state Büchi automaton <italic>A</italic>@@@@, whose size is at most exponentially bigger than the size of @@@@, such that <italic>A</italic>@@@@ accepts precisely the computations that satisfy @@@@. The result has immediate applications, e.g., an optimal decision procedure and a model-checking algorithm for <italic>μTL</italic>.
