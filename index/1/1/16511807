In this paper, we present the integration and preliminary evaluation of a novel Insertable Robotic Effectors Platform (IREP) for Single Port Access Surgery (SPAS). The unique design of the IREP includes planar parallel mechanisms, continuum snake-like arms, wire-actuated wrists, and passive flexible components. While this design has advantages, it presents challenges in terms of modeling, control, and telemanipulation. The complete master-slave resolved-rates telemanipulation framework of the IREP along with its actuation compensation is presented. Experimental evaluation of the capabilities of this new surgical system include bi-manual exchange of rings, pick-and-place tasks, suture passing and knot tying. Results show that the IREP meets the minimal workspace and dexterity requirements specified for laparoscopic surgery, it allows for dual-arm operations such as tool exchange and knot tying in confined spaces. Although it was possible to tie a surgeon's knot with minimal training, suture passing was difficult due to the limited axial rotation of the distal wrists.
