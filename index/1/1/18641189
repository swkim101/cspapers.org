The selection of indexing terms for representing documents is a key decision that limits how effective subsequent retrieval can be. Often stemming algorithms are used to normalize surface forms, and thereby address the problem of not finding documents that contain words related to query terms through infectional or derivational morphology. However, rule-based stemmers are not available for every language and it is unclear which methods for coping with morphology are most effective. In this paper we investigate an assortment of techniques for representing text and compare these approaches using data sets in eighteen languages and five different writing systems. We find character n-gram tokenization to be highly effective. In half of the languages examined n-grams outperform unnormalized words by more than 25%; in highly infective languages relative improvements over 50% are obtained. In languages with less morphological richness the choice of tokenization is not as critical and rule-based stemming can be an attractive option, if available. We also conducted an experiment to uncover the source of n-gram power and a causal relationship between the morphological complexity of a language and n-gram effectiveness was demonstrated.
