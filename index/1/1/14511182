It is commonly agreed that Web traffic follows the Zipf-like distribution, which is an analytical foundation for improving Web access performance by client-server based proxy caching systems on the Internet. However, some recent studies have observed non-Zipf-like distributions of Internet media traffic in different content delivery systems. Due to the variety of media delivery systems and the diversity of media content, existing studies on media traffic are largely workload specific, and the observed access patterns are often different from or even conflict with each other. For Web media systems, study [3] reports that the access pattern of streaming media is Zipf-like in a university campus network, while study [2] finds that it is not Zipf-like in an enterprise media server. For VoD media systems, study [1] finds that it is not Zipf-like in a multicast-based Media-on-Demand server of a campus network, while study [9] reports it is Zipf-like in a large VoD streaming system of an ISP. For P2P media systems, study [4] reports that the access pattern of media workload in KaZaa system collected in a campus network is not Zipf-like, while study [5] reports that it is Zipf-like in another campus network. For live streaming media systems, study [8] reports it is Zipf-like while study [6] reports it is not Zipf-like. A number of models have been proposed to explain the observed media access patterns, such as the generalized Zipf-like model [7], “fetch-at-most-once” model [4], and two-mode Zipf model [6]. However, each of these models can only explain a very limited scope of measurement results. A general model of Internet media access patterns is highly desirable for traffic engineering on the Internet and is critical to design, benchmark, and evaluate Internet media delivery systems. In this study, we have analyzed a wide variety of media workloads on the Internet. The workloads were collected from both the client side and the server side in Web, VoD, P2P, and live streaming environments between 1998 and 2006, where the media content is delivered via Web/P2P downloading or unicast/multicast streaming. The duration of these workloads ranges from a few days to more than two years and the user population ranges from several thousands to more than one hundred thousand. The number of client requests
