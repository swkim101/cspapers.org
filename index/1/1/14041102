A dynamically microprogrammable processor called MATHILDA is described. MATHILDA has been designed to be used as a tool in emulator and processor design research. It has a very general microinstruction sequencing scheme, sophisticated masking and shifting capability, high speed local storage, a 64-bit wide main data path, a horizontally encoded microinstruction, and other facilities which make it reasonably well suited for this purpose. This paper presents a brief overview of the MATHILDA system, and some of the concepts in more detail.
