The Space Environment Laboratory in Boulder has collaborated with the University of Colorado to construct a small expert system for solar flare forecasting, called THEO. It performed as well as a skilled human forecaster. We have constructed TheoNet, a three-layer back-propagation connectionist network that learns to forecast flares as well as THEO does. TheoNet's success suggests that a connectionist network can perform the task of knowledge engineering automatically. A study of the internal representations constructed by the network may give insights to the "microstructure" of reasoning processes in the human brain.
