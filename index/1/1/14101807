The problem of authentication of mutually suspicious parties is one that is becoming more and more important with the proliferation of distributed systems. In this paper we construct a protocol in which users can verify whether they have matching credentials without revealing their credentials to each other unless there is a match. Thk protocol requires a trusted third party, but does not require it to be available to the users except when they sign up for the system. Thus it is useful in situations in which a trusted third party exists, but is not available to all users at all times.
