One of the challenges in the automatic generation of referring expressions is to identify a set of domain entities coherently, that is, from the same conceptual perspective. We describe and evaluate an algorithm that generates a conceptually coherent description of a target set. The design of the algorithm is motivated by the results of psycholinguistic experiments.
