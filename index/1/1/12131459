Recent electronic document editors and hypertext systems allow users to create customized user interfaces by adding user-pressable buttons to on-screen documents. Positioning these buttons is easy because users are already tlamlliar with the use of document editors. Unfortunately, the resulting user interfaces often ex!st only in stand-alone document systems, making it hard to integrate them with other applications. Furthermore, because buttons are usually treated as special document objects, they cannot take advan~age of document editor formatting and layout capabilities to create thenappearance This paper describes the EmbeddedButtons architecture, which makes ~asy to integrate buttons into documents and to use the resulting documents for a variety of user interface types. EmbeddedButtons allows arbitrary document elements to behave as buttons. Documents can be linked to application windows to serve as application control panels. Buttons can store and display application state to serve as mode indicators. New button classes, editors, and apphcations can be added dynamically
