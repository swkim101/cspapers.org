Identifying and targeting visitors on an e-commerce website with personalized content in real-time is extremely important to marketers. Although such targeting exists today, it is based on demographic attributes of the visitors. We show that dynamic visitor attributes extracted from their click-stream provide much better predictive capabilities of visitor intent. In this demonstration, we showcase an interactive real-time user interface for marketers to visualize and target visitor segments. Our dashboard not only provides the marketers understanding of their visitor click patterns, but also lets them target individual or group of visitors with offers and promotions.
