This paper focuses on generating referring expressions capable of serving multiple communicative goals. The components of a referring expression are divided into a referring part and a non-referring part. Two rules for the content determination and construction of the non-referring part are given, which are realised in an embedding algorithm. The significant aspect of our approach is that it intends to generate the non-referring part given the restrictions imposed by the referring part, whose realisation is, on the other hand, affected by the non-referring part.
