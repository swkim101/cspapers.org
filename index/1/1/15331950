A fully distributed operating system transaction facility with fine-grain record level synchronization is described. Multiple member processes, remote resource access, dynamic process migration, and orderly interaction with concurrent non-transaction activities are all supported, An unusual logging strategy, based on shadow pages but supporting logical level locking, is used. This choice is justified on the basis of ease of implementation and performance analysis. The design and implementation is done in the context of Locus, a high performance distributed Unix operating system for local area networks.
