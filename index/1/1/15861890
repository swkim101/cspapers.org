1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Chekuri, Hasan & Motwani [2] study the following problem tha t arises in the optimization of SQL queries for parallel machines: An operator graph G = (V, E) is a graph with positive integer weights on the nodes and edges. The nodes in V = { 1 , 2 , . . . , n } are called operators and represent atomic units of execution. The (pipelining) edges in E represent parallel constraints, i.e., all operators run in parallel. The positive integer weight ti of operator i represents the cost of executing this operator . The positive integer weight cij of an edge [i, j] 6 E represents the remote communication between the two incident operators. Moreover, there are p processors available on which the operators are to be processed. A schedule assigns operators to processors. More precisely, a schedule partitions the operator set V into p sets V1, . . . , l lp where set Vk is allocated to the kth processor. Since edge weights represent the cost of communication, this cost is saved if adjacent operators share a processor. With this, the load Lk o n the kth processor is the cost for executing all operators "-pel;ra@win.l:ue.nl. Department of Mathematics and Computing Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O.

The goal is to find a schedule tha t minimizes the response time. The smallest possible response t ime is denoted by L*. Chekuri, Hasan & Motwani [2] motivate this scheduling model of opera tor graphs by the fact tha t communication is a significant component of the cost of processing a query in parallel (cf. Gray [5], De Witt & Gray [3]). Scheduling of opera tor graphs is an NP-ha rd problem, even if all communicat ion costs are zero: This special case is the classical NP-ha rd makespan minimization on parallel identical processors; cf. Garey & Johnson [4]. If an optimization problem is NP-hard , one usually looks for a polynomial t ime p-approximation algori thm that returns near-optimal solutions with cost at most a factor p above the optimal cost; here p > 1 is some fixed real number that is called the worst case performance guarantee of the approximation algorithm. A family of (1 + c)-approximation algorithms over all > 0 with polynomial running times is called a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS). Hasin & Motwani [6] develop polynomial t ime approximation algorithms with constant worst case guarantees for the special cases where the operator graph G is a path or a star. Chekuri, Hasan & Motwani [2] s tudy the special case were the operator graph G is a tree and derive a polynomial time 2.87-approximation algorithm. C o n t r i b u t i o n o f t h i s p a p e r . We derive three main results on scheduling of operator graphs. (1) We design a polynomial t ime approximation scheme for the case where the operator graph is a tree, i.e., for the special case that has been considered by Chekuri, Hasan & Motwani [2]. (2) We describe a polynomial t ime algor i thm that decides for general operator graphs, whether a response time of five t ime units can be reached. (3) Finally, for general opera tor graphs deciding whether a response time of six t ime units can be reached, is an N P hard problem. As a simple (but not straightforward)
