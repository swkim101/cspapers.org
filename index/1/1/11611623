We present methods for safe and correct programming for concurrent threads in Java. The methods are based on the principles of Concurrent Sequential Processes (CSP). We demonstrate the use of tools which provide the structure of CSP within Java to avoid some of the pitfalls of multithreaded programming using monitors, the primitive synchronization tool in Java. Several examples illustrate the use of these tools.
