The aim of the ObNet model is to provide a framework for the design, development, maintenance and run-time support of large, long-lived, highly configurable systems for which the integration of different programming paradigms and environments plays a major role. The model defines some basic mechanisms which can be used in developing specialized software engineering environments for specific application domains. A system is a network of (multi-representation) objects; different specialized environments are different views over the network. Objects could be typed and are manipulated via methods; both types and methods are in turn objects. The concept of dependency between objects is supported and specialized to represent versions, instances, conversions and collections.
