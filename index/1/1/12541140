A novel design approach of planar antennas is proposed for ultra-wideband applications. The basic concepts and requirements for the design have given and the idea of separation of the patches is analyzed to explain the influence of each patch of the antenna structure on its characteristics. The antennas have been implemented on the substrate Teflon with permittivity of εr = 2.3 and thickness of h = 1 mm. The overall dimension of the final design is 20×30 mm, the antenna operates in the frequency bands of 3.5–10.85 GHz with a band notch of 5–6 GHz to avoid the narrow-band interference from WLAN services. The characteristics of the antenna have been measured by the equipment Microwave Test Set IFR 6203B to test the design.
