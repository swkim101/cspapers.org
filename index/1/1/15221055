Many applications for robotic systems require the ability to handle moving objects. A method for providing a robot with real-time visual processing of moving objects is presented. By appropriately isolating the tracking task. It is possible to reduce the tracking problem to two dimensional pattern recognition. Numerous objects (potentially moving randomly) can be tracked while identifying one object at a time. The tracking ability can also be used to provide a robot with visual feed-back (in real-time) for hand-eye coordination.
