Modern software-intensive systems are expected to adapt, often while the system is executing, to changing requirements, failures, and new operational contexts. This paper describes an approach to dynamic system adaptation that utilizes plan-based and architecture-based mechanisms. Our approach utilizes an architecture description language (ADL) and a planning-as-model-checking technology to enable dynamic replanning. The ability to automatically generate adaptation plans based solely on ADL models and an application problem description simplifies the specification and use of adaptation mechanisms for system architects. The approach uses a three-layer architecture that, while similar to previous work, provides several significant improvements. We apply our approach within the context of a mobile robotics case study.
