Gibbs & Hill (G&H) has been a proponent, developer, and user of Design Automation (DA) techniques for over fifteen years. Progression has been steady and significant, beginning with the use of relatively simple batch computer programs for the solution of specific engineering problems to the current broad application of state-of-the-art hardware and software including interactive graphics and data base management systems. This progress has been matched by acceptance, and at G&H DA is considered a normal and viable mode of operation rather than an alternate method subject to doubts by management, clients, and personnel. The Design Automation objective is an on-line, integrated data base approach to all aspects and phases of our work, ranging from conceptual design to construction management. The cornerstone of the Design Automation system is CADAEsm (Computer Aided Design and Engineering) which is an Interactive graphics system that is used to produce design drawings, including both dimensional and nondimensional. The G&H Design Automation system is developed, refined, and maintained by a dedicated staff of DA professionals.
