Left-to-right (LR) decoding (Watanabe et al., 2006) is promising decoding algorithm for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero) that visits input spans in arbitrary order producing the output translation in left to right order. This leads to far fewer language model calls, but while LR decoding is more efficient than CKY decoding, it is unable to capture some hierarchical phrase alignments reachable using CKY decoding and suffers from lower translation quality as a result. This paper introduces two improvements to LR decoding that make it comparable in translation quality to CKY-based Hiero.
