We describe a unique liquid handling platform, based on a Tecan EVO, specifically designed for the preparation of analytic calibrators and quality control samples according to the requirements of the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The platform utilizes a combination of off-the-shelf software (Tecan Gemini 4.2) and custom-programmed SPIKE 1.0. The system convinces with robust and reproducibly quality and a very easy, intuitive user interface. All security requirements as per FDA 21CFRpart 11 were considered, when programming the software bundle.
