This paper is concerned with efficient execution of a pipeline of data processing operations on very large images obtained from confocal microscopy instruments. We describe parallel, out-of-core algorithms for each operation in this pipeline. One of the challenging steps in the pipeline is the warping operation using inverse mapping based methods. We propose and investigate a set of algorithms to handle the warping computations on storage clusters. Our experimental results show that the proposed approaches are scalable both in terms of number of processors and the size of images
