The guidelines presented here are based on experience gained during several years of designing and implementing large interactive CAD programs on many large scale T/S Computers. These include: circuit, system, logic, and optical analysis programs which are operating on IBM-360/67, CDC-6400, DEC PDP-10, XDS Sigma-7 and Univac-1108 T/S Systems.
 Apart from the development and debugging effort involved in making large programs (4000 to 12000 FORTRAN statements) operational, the re-coding and maintenance effort required to transfer a working program from one computer to another may be disproportionately costly unless special design precautions are observed from the very beginning.
 This paper presents some rules for planning and specific solutions for reducing the programming effort. When followed, not only will the amount of code generated be significantly reduced, but compatibility among computer installations will be guaranteed.
