The Suitware project was established to explore methods and tools for the design of adaptive user interfaces. The name Suitware was created as a synonym for "software which suits the users needs". The poster introduces some basic ideas and the overall research goals of the project. As a result of preparatory work, a taxonomy of adaptive user interfaces (AUI) is presented.
