In this paper we consider the problem of efficiently checking integrity constraints. Since parallelism is a promising strategy for improving efficiency in database systems we ap ply parallelism to integrity constraint checking. In a first step we compile the constraints into an extended relational algebra. The extensions of the algebra are due to the complexity of the integrity constraints which come from a real application. The algebraic expressions are input to a parallel constraint engine Pace. We use dataflow-driven, setoriented constraint execution. Horizontal and vertical parallelism is srtpported through data distribution and pipelining between extended relational algebra operators. Pace has been implemented on a KSR1-8 MIMD-multiprocessor system with virtual shared-memory. Finally, measurements performed with a parallel main-memory database demonstrate the processing costs that can be achieved by parallel integrity constraint evaluation.
