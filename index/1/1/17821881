The programming language concepts which ought to be presented in the comparative programming languages course (either graduate or undergraduate) are all covered by choosing C++, Java, Perl, and Python as the languages to be compared. These include dynamic typing, object orientation, multiple inheritance, interpreters and compilers, keyword and default parameters, generics, operator overloading, complex numbers, universal hierarchies, exceptions, and garbage collection. We describe such a course, which we have given.
