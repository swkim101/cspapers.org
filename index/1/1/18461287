We present a multi-perspective video "multiplayer" designed to organize social video aggregated from online sites like YouTube. Our system automatically time-aligns videos using audio fingerprinting, thus bringing them into a unified temporal frame. The interface utilizes social metadata to visually aid navigation and cue users to more interesting portions of an event. We provide details about the visual and interaction design rationale of the multiplayer.
