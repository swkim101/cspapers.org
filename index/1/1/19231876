Moreover, some of these methods rely on fiducial landmarks to provide defined face parts. In this paper, we propose a cascade network that simultaneously learns to localize face regions specific to attributes and performs attribute classification without alignment. First, a weakly-supervised face region localization network is designed to automatically detect regions (or parts) specific to attributes. Then multiple part-based networks and a whole-image-based network are separately constructed and combined together by the region switch layer and attribute relation layer for final attribute classification. A multi-net learning method and hint-based model compression is further proposed to get an effective localization model and a compact classification model, respectively. Our approach achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on unaligned CelebA dataset, reducing the classification error by 30.9%.
