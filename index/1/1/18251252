For using industrial robots in applications where the robot physically interacts with the environment, such as assembly, force control is usually needed. A force sensor may, however, be expensive and add mass to the system. An alternative is therefore to estimate the external force using the motor torques. This paper considers the problem of force estimation for the case when the robot is not moving, where the Coulomb friction constitutes a fundamental difficulty. A dithering feedforward torque is used to decrease the Coulomb friction uncertainty, and hence improve the force estimation accuracy when the robot is not moving. The method is validated experimentally through an implementation on an industrial robot. A lead-through scenario is also presented.
