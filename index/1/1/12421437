Standardized lifecycle model which adopts a sort of methodology, a set of related disciplined practices and techniques is called paradigm. For all factory members to cooperate in project activities through one or definite numbers of well defined common paradigm is essentially important in order to start development of the environment. The agreement about using the environment should be made before it is developed, by all factory members: managers, administrative staffs, financial staff, engineers, programmers, quality assurance staffs and site preparation staffs. Without this consensus based establishment of the paradigm, it is difficult to develop good interfaces between users and the environment.
