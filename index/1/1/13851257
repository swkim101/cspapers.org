We have been funded by the National Science Foundation [6] to investigate the feasibility of distributing large software engineering projects across multiple universities at remote locations. This paper reports on the use of web services to make such inter-university cooperation feasible. The TRavel Itinerary Planner (TRIP), a year long project, was implemented at three universities: Appalachian State University, North Carolina A&T, and DePaul University. After discussing our methodology based on web services we describe the inter-university cooperation that was achieved on this project. We then describe problems encountered and their solutions and conclude with a brief description of a different project that we will develop during the 2006-2007 academic year.
