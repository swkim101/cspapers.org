Scholarships and financial aids in modern universities are the basic administrative plans to ensure and promote the completion of academic training and studies for students. Traditional grants allocation procedures are based on manual determination, which costs lots of human resources. In this paper, we investigate an assistance model for helping improve the scheme of granting. We first collect students information from multi-modal channels, including their behaviors of campus consumption, internet usage, daily trajectory together with their enrollment information. The approval status and amount of funds granted are converted as labels. We propose the College Student Scholarships and Subsidies Granting (CS3G) approach to address the concrete problem. CS3G approach overcomes 3 obstacles, i.e., complicated multi-label influences, private modal information protection and difficulties in label collection. In detail, based on the facts that scholarships mainly depend on academic achievements, subsidies granting is generally based on students financial hardships as well as credits, and there are implicit influences among scholarships and subsidies, the CS3G approach handles types of interactions between multiple labels, it is notable that data from different modalities are collected by different divisions of a university, privacy protection is considered in CS3G, i.e., no interaction between features from different modalities in the model training phase. Besides, due to the confidentiality of the concrete types/amounts of granting, only a portion of labels is collected in this application, CS3G is trained in a semi-supervised style. Empirical investigations show good generalization ability of CS3G on benchmark datasets, and a real assessment of a university also validates the power of our approach for tackling this type of problem well.
