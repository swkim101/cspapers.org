The deep web is very large and diverse and queries evaluated against the deep web can provide great value. While there have been attempts at accessing the data in the deep web, these are clever "one-of'' systems and techniques. In this paper, we describe an ongoing research of a generic structured query model that can be used against the deep web. Using this query model, the contributions of a community of researchers can be combined freely, leading to a system that can be improved incrementally each time someone develops a specific novel technique to improve a particular operator.
