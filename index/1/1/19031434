The behavior of systems of systems (SoS) emerges only fully during operation and is hard to predict. SoS thus need to be monitored at runtime to detect deviations from important requirements. However, existing approaches for checking runtime behavior and performance characteristics are limited with respect to the kinds of checks and the types of technologies supported, which impedes their use in industrial SoS. In this tool demonstration paper we describe the ReMinds tool suite for runtime monitoring of SoS developed in response to industrial monitoring scenarios. ReMinds provides comprehensive tool support for instrumenting systems, extracting events and data at runtime, defining constraints to check expected behavior and properties, and visualizing constraint violations to facilitate diagnosis.
