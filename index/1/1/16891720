We propose a novel method for robotic exploration that evaluates paths that minimize both the joint path and map entropy per meter traveled. The method uses Pose SLAM to update the path estimate, and grows an RRT* tree to generate the set of candidate paths. This action selection mechanism contrasts with previous approaches in which the action set was built heuristically from a sparse set of candidate actions. The technique favorably compares against the classical frontier-based exploration and other Active Pose SLAM methods in simulations in a common publicly available dataset.
