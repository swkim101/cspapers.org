Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is considered the best solution to develop distributed applications that compose existing services to provide new added-value services for their users. However, we claim that the fully potential of SOA is still to be reached and it is our belief that this is caused by the same tools used to build service orchestrations. To overcome this situation we are developing a new declarative language for service orchestration, enhanced with an innovative runtime system which simplifies the development of flexible and robust service compositions.
