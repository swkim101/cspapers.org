A hybrid and contextual radial basis function network/hidden Markov model off-line handwritten word recognition system is presented. The task assigned to the radial basis function networks is the estimation of emission probabilities associated to Markov states. The model is contextual because the estimation of emission probabilities takes into account the left context of the current image segment as represented by its predecessor in the sequence. The new system does not outperform the previous system without context but acts differently.
