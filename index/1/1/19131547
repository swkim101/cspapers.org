In this paper, we propose to learn a visual feature dictionary that has semantically meaningful atoms. Such a dictionary is learned via joint dictionary learning for the visual domain and the attribute domain, while enforcing the same sparse coding for both dictionaries. Our novel attribute aware formulation provides an algorithmic solution to the domain shift/hubness problem in ZSL. Upon learning the joint dictionaries, images from unseen classes can be mapped into the attribute space by finding the attribute aware joint sparse representation using solely the visual data. We demonstrate that our approach provides superior or comparable performance to that of the state of the art on benchmark datasets.
