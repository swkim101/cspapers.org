Existing methods for synthesis of speedindependent circuits under unbounded delay model have difficulties in combining the generality of formal approach with the practicality of the implementation architectures used at the logic level. This paper presents a characteristic property of the state graph specification, called Monotonous Cover requirement, implying its hazard-free implementation within the standard structure of a two-level SOP logic and a row of latches. The overall synthesis procedure ensures satisfiability of this condition by applying the generalised state assignment approach.
