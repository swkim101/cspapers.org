This paper proposes a weakly- and self-supervised deep convolutional neural network (WSSDCNN) for contentaware image retargeting. Our network takes a source image and a target aspect ratio, and then directly outpues a retargeted image. Retargeting is performed through a shift reap, which is a pixet-wise mapping from the source to the target grid. Our method implicitly learns an attention map, which leads to r content-aware shift map for image retargeting. As a result, discriminative parts in an image are preserved, while background regions are adjusted seamlessly. In the training phase, pairs of an image and its image-level annotation are used to compute content and structure tosses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for a retargeting application with insightful analyses.
