An improved vapor phase process for chlorosulfonation of polyethylene, particularly in a fluidized bed, is accomplished by treating a mixture of powdered polyethylene, and finely divided inorganic compounds having a dielectric constant of greater than about 40 and specific conductivity greater than 10-13 to less than 10-1 ( OMEGA -1 cm-1), such as titanium dioxide, with chlorine and sulfur dioxide, optionally under actinic light, at an initial temperature from about 20 DEG C. to about 70 DEG C. and raising the temperature of the reaction to at least about the crystalline melting point of the polyethylene and continuing the reaction until the polyethylene contains about 25 to 45 weight percent bound chlorine and 0.5 to 3 weight percent sulfur to provide improved vulcanizable elastomers. In the fluidized bed process, improvement is obtained in bed mixing and heat transfer, with minimum polymer deposition on reactor walls and polymer agglomeration, essentially eliminating channeling and bed breakdown.
