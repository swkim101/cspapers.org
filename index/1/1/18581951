Independent control of several, untethered microrobots remains a significant challenge. Although progress has been made in controlling multiple robots at scales below 100 mm, motion is dependent on external energy sources for propulsion and is often not fully decoupled. Here, we develop a method to dynamically pattern light at a resolution of 1 Î¼m2 per pixel in a closed loop real-time system using a digital micromirror device (DMD) system. We test the system on microbiorobots - bacteria-coated microplates - and demonstrate that we can selectively stimulate pre-defined regions of bioactuators. We verify previously developed dynamic models as a step toward developing individually addressable, self-propelled microrobots.
