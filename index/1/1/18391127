In this paper, we propose an annotation scheme for the manual annotation of tense and aspect in natural language corpora, as well as an implementation using GraphAnno, a configurable tool for manual multilevel annotation. The annotation scheme is based on Klein’s (1994) theory of tense and aspect, arguably the most widely accepted theory in this domain (cf. also Klein and Li 2009). One of the most important features of Klein’s theory is that in addition to the time span during which a situation obtains (the ‘time of situation’/TSit), it makes use of the concept of ‘Topic Time’ (TT), which is related to, but different from, Reichenbach’s (1947) reference point ‘R’ (cf. Derczynski and Gaizauskas 2013). Given that the resulting annotations cannot be mapped one-to-one to words or constituents, and as they are partially retrieved from the context, a semantic layer of annotation is needed, in addition to the structural one. The multi-level approach advocated here also allows us to annotate temporal relations across sentences. Section 2 provides some background on GraphAnno. Some ontological prerequisites of the annotation of tense and aspect are established in Section 3, and the concept of ‘Topic Time’ is introduced. Sections 4 and 5 demonstrate the annotation of temporal relations within and beyond the sentence, respectively. Section 6 describes the query language of GraphAnno, and Section 7 contains an outlook.
