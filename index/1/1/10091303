We settle the 1-pass space complexity of (1 ± ε)-approximating the <i>L</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> norm, for real <i>p</i> with 1 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 2, of a length-<i>n</i> vector updated in a length-<i>m</i> stream with updates to its coordinates. We assume the updates are integers in the range [--<i>M, M</i>]. In particular, we show the space required is Θ(ε<sup>-2</sup> log(<i>mM</i>) + log log(<i>ns</i>)) bits. Our result also holds for 0 < <i>p</i> < 1; although <i>L</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> is not a norm in this case, it remains a well-defined function. Our upper bound improves upon previous algorithms of [Indyk, JACM '06] and [Li, SODA '08]. This improvement comes from showing an improved derandomization of the <i>L</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> sketch of Indyk by using <i>k</i>-wise independence for small <i>k</i>, as opposed to using the heavy hammer of a generic pseudorandom generator against space-bounded computation such as Nisan's PRG. Our lower bound improves upon previous work of [Alon-Matias-Szegedy, JCSS '99] and [Woodruff, SODA '04], and is based on showing a direct sum property for the 1-way communication of the gap-Hamming problem.
