In this paper new grasp quality measures considering both object dynamics and pose uncertainty are proposed. Dynamics of the object is incorporated into our grasping simulation to capture the change of its pose and contact points during grasping. Pose uncertainty is considered by running multiple simulations starting from slightly different initial poses sampled from a probability distribution model. A simple robotic grasping strategy is simulated and the quality score of the resulting grasp is evaluated from the simulation result. The effectiveness of the new quality measures on predicting the actual grasp success rate is shown through a real robot experiment.
