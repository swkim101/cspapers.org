This is a case study about a commercial software design and development process. The highly successful product contained some usability problems that were apparent from a usability perspective, but were to be delayed in the upcoming release. A Lotus Notes database was used to record usability issues, UI design recommendations, and decision rationale. This database was the key strategy that helped convince the team to make changes. The processes and UI design solutions described are not new; rather this design briefing focuses on how they were deployed to effect change that wouldn't have happened otherwise. "Before" and "After" screen shots illustrate this success story.
