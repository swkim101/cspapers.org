Given an arbitrary but fixed integer r -&-ge; 3. We show that testing r-variate polynomials with integer coefficients for irreducibility is m-reducible in polynomial time of the total degree and the largest coefficient length to testing bivariate polynomials for irreducibility. Factoring r-variate polynomials into irreducibles is polynomial time Turing-reducible to completely factoring bivariate polynomials.
