The general model and simulation algorithms for bibliographic retrieval systems presented in an earlier paper are expanded. The new model integrates the physical as well as the logical and semantic elements of these systems. A modified algorithm is developed for the simulation of user relevance judgments, and is validated, by means of recall-precision curves and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of recall, for two test collections. Other approaches to goodness-of-fit testing are suggested.
