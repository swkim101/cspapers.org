Biological inspiration has produced some successful solutions for estimation of self motion from visual information. This paper describes the advantages of egomotion estimation on a spherical image plane with respect to translational and rotational motion decoupling. The paper presents a novel 6 DoF egomotion estimation method for spherical cameras based on the image interpolation algorithm. The method was evaluated using a prototype hemispherical camera designed to mimic the optical properties of an insect compound eye. A dedicated optical flow gantry was used to generate precise three-dimensional trajectories for comparisons to the motion estimated by the hemispherical sensor. The sensor exhibited correct decoupling of translational and rotational motion in four axes, with a local position error of 150mm over an average trajectory length of 1.5m.
