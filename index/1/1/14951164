In noncontact cell manipulation with optical tweezers, we need to use microtools to avoid damages to the cells by direct laser irradiation. When we manipulate complex structures such as microtools, a multi-beam optical tweezers which can manipulate multiple objects is suitable; however manipulation speed or trapping number are not so good. Therefore, we developed an integrated optical tweezers by using time-shared scanning method for high speed manipulation and generalized phase contrast method for a lot of trapping. Then, we proposed cell manipulation method which suits for the integrated optical tweezers and then we designed the shape of microtools made of SU-8. A new fabrication method of SU-8 microtools was proposed to improve productivity. At last, we made the experiment system and the effectiveness of proposed methods was confirmed.
