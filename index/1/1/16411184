Gelfond and Zhang recently proposed a new stable model semantics based on Vicious Circle Principle in order to improve the interpretation of logic programs with aggregates. A detailed complexity analysis of coherence testing and cautious reasoning under the new semantics highlighted similarities and differences versus mainstream stable model semantics for aggregates, which eventually led to the design of compilation techniques for implementing the new semantics on top of existing ASP solvers.
