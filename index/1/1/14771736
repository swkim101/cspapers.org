Although a large amount of theoretical work has been performed in the analysis of the pure working set replacement algorithm, little has been done applying these results to the approximations that have been implemented. This paper presents a general technique for the analysis of these implementations by analytic methods. Extensive simulations are reported which validate the analytic model and show significant simplifications that can be made with little loss of accuracy. The problem of choosing memory policy parameter values is examined and related in a simple way to the choice of a working set window size.
