Conceptual Indexing is a way to produce only one index for many multilingual documents. Inter-Media conceptual indexing promotes the use of common concepts between two media in order to use a single index for several media. In this paper we explore such an advance indexing point of view. We show the benefit of an automatic conceptual indexing for texts and its extension for text and image documents. Tests are conducted on the multilingual image and text medical document corpus of the CLEF initiative, where we obtain best results on text in 2005 and 2006, and show promising results on images, and best results for the combination of image and text.
