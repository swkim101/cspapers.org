We propose topology design of power distribution nets using a novel method for capturing the temporal characteristics of sink currents - the current compatibility graph. This graph carries information necessary for net area optimization. We propose a new algorithm for simultaneous topology design and wire sizing that can handle large designs. Our techniques result in significant area improvements on benchmark instances.
