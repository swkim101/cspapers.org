This paper presents a shared control approach for motion compensation in robotic beating heart surgery. Motion compensation consists of three main tasks; motion synchronization, image stabilization and shared control. The paper discusses a unifying framework under which the three tasks combine seamlessly. In this work, the planar 1-manifold case is considered, where a strip-wise affine map is performed to achieve image stabilization onto a canonical space, where shared control emerges naturally. A prototype teleoperation system is also described, implementing the algorithms. Experiments were performed with medically trained users, and the positive effect of motion compensation is analyzed.
