From 2013 to 2014, a fairly standard CS2 course was changed to a dynamic classroom using clicker questions and OpenDSA textbook (embedded animations with animated and multiple choice questions allowing instructor review of results). Through these changes, class time focused on conceptual ideas and discussion rather than the mechanics of data structures. The clicker questions were used to engage students by strategically asking questions that differentiated between correct ideas and common misconceptions. To assess these changes, surveys of central CS2013 topics were given to students in 2013 (before the changes) and in 2014 and 2015 (after the changes) where the course is offered each spring. Additionally, the drop rate and knowledge from assignments and exams were examined. The analysis showed that after the first year students showed greater learning gains and substantial decline in drop rate (57% to 27%) but found the course less valuable (class time, discussions and readings). In the second year there was a drop in learning gains, an even greater reduction in drop rate (12%) but students now found the course time more valuable than the first year. These results are attributed to regularly informing students in the third year to the reasons for the new methodologies and the fact that a greater diversity of students completed the course each year. The author hopes to engage others in a discussion of their experiences about interactive courses, and how clicker questions can be constructed to engage and educate our students.
