The security of operations within a wireless sensor network requires the protection of messages exchanged between the sensor nodes. To achieve the security aims and prevent a WSN from being compromised by an adversary. Key management is a security technical in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In the remainder of this paper, we propose a new key pre-distribution scheme that was based on the modification of the initialization phase to return the safer scheme. The proposed scheme of analysis ensures resilience against nodes capture attack.
