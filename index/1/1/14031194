It is shown how to efficiently construct a small probability space on n binary random variables such that for every subset, its parity is either zero or one with “almost” equal probability. They are called $\epsilon $-biased random variables. The number of random bits needed to generate the random variables is $O(\log n + \log \frac{1}{\epsilon })$. Thus, if $\epsilon $ is polynomially small, then the size of the sample space is also polynomial. Random variables that are $\epsilon $-biased can be used to construct “almost” k-wise independent random variables where $\epsilon $ is a function of k.These probability spaces have various applications: l. Derandomization of algorithms: Many randomized algorithms that require only k-wise independence of their random bits (where k is bounded by $O(\log n)$), can be derandomized by using $\epsilon $-biased random variables. 2. Reducing the number of random bits required by certain randomized algorithms, e.g., verification of matrix multiplication. 3. Exhaustive tes...
