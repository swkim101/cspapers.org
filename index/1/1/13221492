This paper presents an overview of our research on accounting for robot pose uncertainty in area coverage applications. In the vast majority of existing literature on robotics area coverage, the location uncertainty of the robot is not considered. An uncertain robot pose results in an uncertain sensor swath, which in turn creates uncertainty about the achieved coverage. Here, we present a general framework where pose estimates are mapped through the coverage sensor model to obtain a probability of coverage over the discretized workspace. This probabilistic representation can then be used to adaptively plan paths for coverage based on an entropy reduction formulation. This framework is particularly well-suited to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) performing seabed surveying operations. The AUV position estimate diverges from the actual AUV position while submerged due to the lack of a global position reference. This discrepancy can result in parts of the seabed being missed, which is unacceptable in safety-critical missions such as mine countermeasures. The proposed information-based path planning approach is able to guarantee area coverage even in the case of severe AUV position estimate drift. In-water experiments with an AUV show the effectiveness of the method.
