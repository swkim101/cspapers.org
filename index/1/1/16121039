Large scale, long-term, distributed mapping is a core challenge to modern field robotics. Using the sensory output of multiple robots and fusing it in an efficient way enables the creation of globally accurate and consistent metric maps. To combine data from multiple agents into a global map, most existing approaches use a central entity that collects and manages the information from all agents. Often, the raw sensor data of one robot needs to be made available to processing algorithms on other agents due to the lack of computational resources on that robot. Unfortunately, network latency and low bandwidth in the field limit the generality of such an approach and make multi-robot map building a tedious task. In this paper, we present a distributed and decentralized back-end for concurrent and consistent robotic mapping. We propose a set of novel approaches that reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the effectiveness of inter-robot communication for distributed mapping. Instead of locking access to the map during operations, we define a version control system which allows concurrent and consistent access to the map data. Updates to the map are then shared asynchronously with agents which previously registered notifications. A technique for data lookup is provided by state-of-the-art algorithms from distributed computing. We validate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
