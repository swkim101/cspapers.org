Many steps are involved in completing a Bayesian statistical analysis. Some are skilled tasks requiring the expertise of a professional, others are purely mechanical. The former include such tasks as choice of model, specification of the prior distribution and interpretation of the posterior distribution; the latter include such things as the arithmetic necessary to combine the prior distribution with the data to produce the posterior distribution and to produce probability statements from that distribution. Unfortunately, it is all too often the case that the arithmetic gets in the way of the professional's decision-making responsibilities by breaking concentration and line of thought; and at times the sheer bulk of computation precludes the use of advanced techniques by the unaided researcher. What is required is a monitoring system that does all of the arithmetic and, even further, sees to it that all of the steps in the analysis are performed correctly and in their proper sequence. Also, within an instructional process, it can be very useful to have a system that helps a student learn by guiding his steps through a valid statistical analysis even if he doesn't yet fully understand what he is doing. For these and other reasons, a system of Computer-Assisted Data Analysis (CADA) was developed at the University of Iowa (Novick, 1971, 1973). Further investigation into available computer technology coupled with expansion of the theoretical base on which the original system rested resulted in the refinement and expansion of the available programs and the construction of a monitor to facilitate their use.
