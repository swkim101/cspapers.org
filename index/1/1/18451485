We propose a root stemmer for the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) language in an attempt to enhance the performance of Arabic Information Retrieval (AIR). The new Simple Arabic Stemmer (SAS) is based on the Quran morphology, since the Quran was a key source for the derivation of Arabic morphological rules. The stemmer is developed by decomposing all of the Quran words and studying their internal morphological structure including the roots, the patterns, and the affixes employed in the generation process. We were able to construct a relatively small lexicon capable of finding the root for most of the MSA vocabulary. Using the TREC corpus and queries, we test our approach against two well-known root stemmers, Khoja and Sebawai. The results show that SAS gives an improvement in terms of precision.
