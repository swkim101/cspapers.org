Computing research has made remarkable advances, but there's much more to be accomplished. The next few decades of advances should be even more significant, and even more interesting, than the past few.
 The National Science Foundation has created the Computing Community Consortium to engage computing researchers in an ongoing process of visioning - of imagining what we might contribute to the world, in terms that we and the world might both appreciate.
 This process is just beginning, and I'd like to take this opportunity to engage you. I will review the progress that our field has made, and I'll present a number of "grand challenge" problems that we should be prepared to tackle in the coming decade. I'll invite your contributions.
