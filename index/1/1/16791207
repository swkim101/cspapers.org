Content-based publish-subscribe systems are an emerging paradigm for building a range of distributed applications. A specific problem in content-based systems is the secure distribution of events to clients subscribing to those events. In content-based systems, every event can potentially have a different set of interested subscribers. To provide confidentiality guarantee, we would like to encrypt messages so that only interested subscribers can read the message. In the worst case, for n clients, there can be 2n subgroups, and each event can go to a potentially different subgroup. A major problem is managing subgroup keys so that the number of encryptions required per event can be kept low. We first show the difficulties in applying existing group key management techniques to addressing the problem. We then propose and compare a number of approaches to reduce the number of encryptions and to increase message throughput. We present analytical analysis of described algorithms as well as simulation results.
