Syrus is courseware designed with the goal of helping students better understand logical sentences involving quantifiers. Syrus uses template-guided mutation of "seed" formulas to generate candidate practice problems, and third-party theorem-provers to automatically determine the truth value of each. It provides students with a virtually unlimited supply of unique and relevant practice problems and provides immediate feedback on each problem. Results of an empirical study of its efficacy are reported.
