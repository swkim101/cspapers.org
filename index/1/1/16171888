This paper presents a new model to overcome the occlusion problems coming from wide baseline multiple camera stereo. Rather than explicitly modeling occlusions in the matching cost function, it detects occlusions in the depth map obtained from regular efficient stereo matching algorithms. Occlusions are detected as inconsistencies of the depth map by computing the visibility of the map as it is reprojected into each camera. Our approach has the particularity of not discriminating between occluders and occludees. The matching cost function is modified according to the detected occlusions by removing the offending cameras from the computation of the matching cost. The algorithm gradually modifies the matching cost function according to the history of inconsistencies in the depth map, until convergence. While two graph-theoretic stereo algorithms are used in our experiments, our framework is general enough to be applied to many others. The validity of our framework is demonstrated using real imagery with different baselines.
