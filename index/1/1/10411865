We define and evaluate two policies (NA-policy, A-policy) for parallel execution of program tree structures. Via a probabilistic model we analytically determine, for each policy, the Laplace-Stieltjes transform for the tree processing time distribution. The acceleration of the program execution time achieved when adding processors to a single processor environment, is computed and plotted for each policy.
