The purpose of defining a methodology for evaluating software development environments is to add a degree of rigor and standardization to the process in much the same way as benchmark test suites do for evaluating certain hardware and software. The methodology developed at the Software Engineering Institute is user-oriented, comprehensive, repeatable, extensible, and partly environment independent. It has been used to evaluate several Ada environments so that they may be compared objectively according to the same criteria.
The methodology is based on the underlying activities of software engineering since it focuses on the support of key software lifecycle activities rather than on adherence to a pre-existing tool taxonomy. The following paragraphs briefly describe the steps of each of the six phases of the methodology. The first three phases are independent of any particular environment and the last three are repeated for each environment evaluated.
