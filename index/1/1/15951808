The Circle and the Reuleaux Triangle are two extreme examples of a class of convex figures called Orbiforms. An orbiform is a convex figure of constant width. In this paper we present two linear-time ruler and compass constructions of orbiforms of a simple polygon (i.e. convex figures of constant width that circumscribe a simple polygon). The width of the orblform, in both constructions, equals the diameter of the simple polygon and is hence minimum. The constructions are based on a generahzation of convexity in the plane to a form of circular convexity which we call rconvexity.
