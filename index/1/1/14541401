Soon, the world. will need far more truly large databases then any of us ever imagined; yet, ironically, without a lot of care, VLDB’s,as we know them today may be left along the wayside. The way in which we think about, design and build enormous databases will have to completely change if we are to participate in this revolution. By now everybody, including database people, realizes that the computer world is going through not one but two revolutionary changes. First, of course, there’s the wh+e imiact of personal computers, commodity hardwar& and ever increasing speed and capacity. Second, there’s the impact of the internet i put them together,. and the impact is. explosive. This paper deals with the particular impact of this changing world scene on the ckepts behind and implementation of very large databases. By the time we’re done, the meanings of “very”, “large” and “datab&e” will be pret& different than it is today.
