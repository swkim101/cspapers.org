With the dramatic reduction in cost of central processors in recent years, the peripheral devices occupy an ever larger share in terms of cost of a minicomputer system. Sharing the expensive components among users is a time honored way of increasing utilization and hence reducing the cost of unit operation. This paper presents the results of a simulation of sharing an output device, such as the printer, by more than one processor under different workload conditions.
