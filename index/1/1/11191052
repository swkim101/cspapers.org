A system has been constructed by which we can design recognition logics by trial & error, exchanging information with a computer. If the extracted features fit the experience of a man as regards his recognition of characters the system is useful, because it displays the intuitive information corresponding to demand, permits us to revise the logics on-line, and evaluates the logics immediately. The system consists of a NEAC 2200/200 digital computer and a graphic CRT display. The system program called CADOCR is acompanied with a recognition program of scheme arbitrarily chosen. In order to test the validity of this system, the sequential logics for recognizing handprinted numerals were designed.
