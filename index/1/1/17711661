Multi-label classification refers to learning tasks with each instance belonging to one or more classes simultaneously. It arose from real-world applications such as information retrieval, text categorization and functional genomics. Currently, most of the multi-label learning methods use the strategy called binary relevance, which constructs a classifier for each unique label by grouping data into positives (examples with this label) and negatives (examples without this label). With binary relevance, an example with multiple labels is considered as a positive data for each label it belongs to. For some classes, this data point may behave like an outlier confusing classifiers, especially in the cases of well-separated classes. In this paper, we first introduce a new strategy called soft relevance, where each multi-label example is assigned a relevance score to the labels it belongs to. This soft relevance is then employed in a voting function used in a k nearest neighbor classifier. Furthermore, a voting-margin ratio is introduced to the k nearest neighbor classifier for better performance. We compare the proposed method to other multi-label learning methods over three multi-label datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective way to multi-label learning.
