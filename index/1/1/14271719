In this paper we propose and evaluate an approach to DBMS memory management that addresses multiclass workloads with per-class response time goals. It operates by monitoring perclass database reference frequencies as well as the state of the system relative to the goals of each class; the information that it gathers is used to help existing memory allocation and page replacement mechanisms avoid making decisions that may jcopardize performance goals.
