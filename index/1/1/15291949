The motivat ion for our work is the observation that Web pages on a part icular topic are often linked to other pages on the same topic. We model and analyze the problem of how to improve the classification of Web pages ( that is, determining the topic of the page) by using link information. In our setting, an initial classifter examines the text of a Web page and assigns to it some classification, possibly mistaken. We investigate how to reduce the error probabili ty using the observation above, 'thus building an improved classifier. We present a theoretical framework for this problem based on a r andom graph model and suggest two linear t ime algorithms, based on similar methods that have been proven effective in the setting of error-correcting codes. We provide simulation results to verify our analysis and to compare the performance of our suggested
