The objective of this research is to develop and integrate tools for the design of partially replicated distributed database systems. Many existing tools are inappropriate for designing large-scale distributed databases due to their large computational requirements. Our goal is to develop tools that solve the design problems reasonably quickly, typically by using heuristic algorithms that provide approximate or near-optimal solutions.
In developing this design methodology, we assume that information regarding the types of user requests and their rates of arrival into the system is known a priori. The methodology assumes a general model for transaction execution. In this paper we discuss three aspects of the design methodology: the data allocation problem, the use of a static load-balancing scheme in coordination with the allocation scheme, and the design evaluation and review step. Our methodology employs iterative design techniques using performance evaluation as a means to iterate.
