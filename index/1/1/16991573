This paper presents a methodology for: assessing the degree of diagnosability of a system, i.e. given a set of sensors, which faults can be discriminated? and; characterising and determining the minimal additional sensors which guarantee a specified degree of diagnosability. This method has been applied to several subsystems of a Ge neral Electric Frame 6 gas turbine owned by a major UK utility.
