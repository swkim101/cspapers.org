Previous metric learning approaches are only able to learn the metric based on single concatenated multivariate feature representation. However, for many real world problems with multiple feature representation such as image categorization, the model trained by previous approaches will degrade because of sparsity brought by significant dimension growth and uncontrolled influence from each feature channel. In this paper, we propose an efficient distance metric learning model which adapts Distance Metric Learning on multiple feature representations. The aim is to learn the Mahalanobis matrices for each independent feature and their non-sparse lp-norm weight coefficients simultaneously by maximizing the margin of the overall learned distance metric among the pairs from the same class and the distance of pairs from different classes. We further extend this method to nonlinear kernel learning and category specific metric learning, which demonstrate the applicability of using many existing kernels for image data and exploring the hierarchical semantic structures for large scale image datasets. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the promising power of our method.
