Understanding variability is essential to allow the configuration of software systems to diverse requirements. Variability-aware program analysis techniques have been proposed for analyzing the space of program variants. Such techniques are highly beneficial, e.g., to determine the potential impact of changes during maintenance. This paper presents an interprocedural and configuration-aware change impact analysis (CIA) approach for determining possibly impacted products when changing source code of a product family. The approach further supports engineers, who are adapting specific product variants after an initial pre-configuration. The approach can be adapted to work with different variability mechanism, it provides more precise results than existing CIA approaches, and it can be implemented using standard control flow and data flow analysis. Using an industrial product line we report evaluation results on the benefit and performance of the approach.
