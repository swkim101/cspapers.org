Statistical and scientifi computing applications exhibit characteristics that are finahmentally different fmm classical database system application domains. The CROSS-DB data model presented in this paper is optimized for use in such applications by providing advanced data mo&lling methods and application-oriented query fmilities, thus providing afiamework for optimized alzta nuuuzgement procedures. CROSS-DB (which stands for Classifiation-oriented Redundancy-based Optimization of Statistical and Scientific DataBases) is based on a multidi-menswnal data view. The model differs j?om other approaches by o~ering two complementary rnecha-nisrnsfor structuring qualifying information, classification and feature description. Using these ntecha-nisms results in a normalized, low-dimensional data-base schema which ensures both modelling uniqueness and understo.mhbility while providing enhanced modelling$exibility.
