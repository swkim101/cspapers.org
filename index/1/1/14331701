This paper presents a robust spectral based 6 Degrees Of Freedoms (DOF) registration method for 3D data which is in addition capable to determine the scaling of the registered object. The principle is based on decoupling 3D rotation from 3D translation by a corresponding resampling process of the spectral magnitude using a 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a SO(3) Fourier transform and an integrated Mellin transform for a scale determination. The registration is then subsequently carried out, first the registration of rotation is done, in a second step the scale is determined and finally the translation is calculated. Results are presented with generated test series on public available data and data recorded with Laser Range Finders (LRF). Furthermore one example of a scan pair recorded under realistic conditions showing the robustness of this method is given.
