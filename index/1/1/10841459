I have shown that the presence of difficult query aspects that are revealed only implicitly (e.g. exploration, opposition, achievements, cooperation, risks) can be improved by taking advantage of the known presence of other, easier to verify query aspects. The approach proceeds by mining a large external corpus and results in substantial improvements in re-ranking the subset of the top retrieved documents.
