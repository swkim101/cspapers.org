This lecture will provide an overview of the field of asynchronous VLSI, and show how formal methods have played a critical role in the design of complex asynchronous systems. In particular, I will talk about program transformations and their application to asynchronous VLSI, as well as describe a simple language that I developed to describe these circuits and aid in their validation.
