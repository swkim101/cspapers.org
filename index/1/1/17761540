Knowledgeandmanagement donotﬁtprimafacie. Managementaims at goal-oriented action while in many sciences, especially inthe humanities, knowledge and the creation of knowledge have adiscursive nature. This process of knowledge creation, interpret-ing and discussing selected observed or postulated phenomena, isleading to some progress but hard to control. It is important torecognize that the process needs a tight interplay between commu-nicative acts and the organization of knowledge. Furthermore, thiscan only happen in the context of certain media combinations. Thekey ability of computer science to re-combine digital media justi-ﬁes why computer science deals with digital media management.The key point is simple: it is impossible to develop and debateconcepts separately from the media through which they are com-municated. This appears to argue strongly against the possibilityof purely abstract conceptual modeling or ontology building, with-out explicit consideration how these ontologies are captured andcommunicated via media.The ﬁrst aspect of our conceptual framework are three knowl-edgeoperationsonmediacalledtranscription,localizationand(re-)addressing developed in the context of studying media operationsfrom a cultural sciences perspective [2] which has applications incooperativeknowledgemanagement(KM)[3].
