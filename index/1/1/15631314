Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based summarization methods have been widely adopted recently because of their state-of-the-art performance. This paper proposes two new modifications in this framework for update summarization. Our key idea is to use discriminative models with a set of features to measure both the salience and the novelty of words and sentences. First, these features are used in a supervised model to predict the weights of the concepts used in the ILP model. Second, we generate preliminary sentence candidates in the ILP model and then rerank them using sentence level features. We evaluate our method on different TAC update summarization data sets, and the results show that our system performs competitively compared to the best TAC systems based on the ROUGE evaluation metric.
