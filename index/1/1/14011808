IOTA is a prototype of an Information Retrieval System which can manage a corpus made of highly structured, full text documents. The first version presented here has intelligent capabilities related to heuristic pattern matching procedures for processing natural language queries, which involve an automatically built thesaurus. The paper emphazises the overall principles of query processing and gives hints about the underlying techniques used while constructing the thesaurus and automatically indexing highly structured documents.
