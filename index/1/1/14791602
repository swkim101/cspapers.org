The two main purposes of this paper are: 1) to discuss four commonly-used grading methods (which we shall call methods A, B, C, and D) employed with programming assignments and 2) to present by way of recommendation two experimental methods (which we shall call methods X and Y) which support our thesis that positive prevention of cheating on programming assignments through the use of an appropriately-designed grading method is far more effective than the other approaches in general use.
