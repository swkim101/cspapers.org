We consider the design of multicast networks when both edges and nodes are selfish agents with private values. Given a network with a distinguished node (root) and clients at other nodes, the problem is to select a set of users for service and construct a multicast tree T connecting these users to the root. Clients are willing to pay some maximum amount of money ui for receiving the service and agents owning edges charge a minimum cost ce for participating. The multicaster’s task is to charge a fee fi ≤ ui from the clients selected to receive service, and pay agents owning the edges used, a fee fe ≥ ce, so as to maximize profit, π = P i fi − P e fe, from the transaction. Our objective is to construct a polynomial time, strategy-proof mechanism, that achieves approximately the maximum achieveable profit. The design of multicast networks in a game-theoretic setting has received a lot of attention recently. Prior to our work, researchers (see [4, 7] and references therein) have only studied a simpler problem, in which edge costs are known to the multicaster. The objectives for this problem have been two-fold: to recover the cost of constructing the network T from the nodes (Budget balance: P i∈T fi ≥ P e∈T fe), and to maximize the surplus (Efficiency φ = P i∈T ui − P e∈T ce). It is well known that the two objectives cannot be met simultaneously [7, 3]. In order to obtain an approximation to profit, a mechanism should be both budget balanced and approximately efficient.
