A robotic assembly task is usually implemented as a sequence of simple motions, and the transitions between the motions are made when some events occur. These events can usually be detected with thresholds on some signal, but faster response is possible by detecting the transient on that signal. This paper considers the problem of detecting these transients. A force-controlled assembly task is used as an experimental case, and transients in measured force/torque data are considered. A systematic approach to train machine-learning based classifiers is presented. The classifiers are further implemented in the assembly task, resulting in a 15%reduction of the total assembly time.
