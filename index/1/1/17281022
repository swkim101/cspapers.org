Log files from adaptive Exploratory Learning Environments can contain prohibitively large quantities of data for visualisation and analysis. Moreover, it is hard to know in advance what data is required for analytical purposes. Using a microworld for secondary algebra as a case study, we discuss how students' interaction data can be transformed into a data warehouse in order to allow its visualisation and exploration using online analytical processing (OLAP) tools. We also present some additional, more targeted, visualisations of the students' interaction data. We demonstrate the possibilities that these visualisations provide for exploratory data analysis, enabling confirmation or contradiction of expectations that pedagogical experts may have about the system and ultimately providing both empirical evidence and insights for its further development.
