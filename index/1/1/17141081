Statistical circuit simulation is exhibiting increasing importance for circuit design under process variations. Existing approaches cannot efficiently analyze the failure probability for circuits with a large number of variation, nor handle problems with multiple disjoint failure regions. The proposed rare event microscope (REscope) first reduces the problem dimension by pruning the parameters with little contribution to circuit failure. Furthermore, we applied a nonlinear classifier which is capable of identifying multiple disjoint failure regions. In REscope, only likely-to-fail samples are simulated then matched to a generalized pareto distribution. On a 108-dimension charge pump circuit in PLL design, REscope outperforms the importance sampling and achieves more than 2 orders of magnitude speedup compared to Monte Carlo. Moreover, it accurately estimates failure rate, while the importance sampling totally fails because failure regions are not correctly captured.
