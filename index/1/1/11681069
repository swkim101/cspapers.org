The problem of building test collections is central to the development of information retrieval systems such as search engines. Starting with a few relevant "nuggets" of information manually extracted from existing TREC corpora, we implement and test a methodology that finds and correctly assesses the vast majority of relevant documents found by TREC assessors - as well as up to four times more additional relevant documents. Our methodology produces highly accurate test collections that hold the promise of addressing the issues of scalability, reusability, and applicability.
