We propose a new neural network structure that is compatible with silicon technology and has built-in learning capability. The thrust of this network work is a new synapse function. The synapses have the feature that the learning parameter is embodied in the thresholds of MOSFET devices and is local in character. The network is shown to be capable of learning by example as well as exhibiting the desirable features of the Hopfield type networks.
