With the rapid increase in complexity of software systems and applications, it becomes necessary to develop tools to simplify the incorporation of self-managing features into applications. The use of object and component technologies, together with a policy system which externalizes business logic from an application, plays an important role in enabling systems with greater manageability and variability. In this presentation, we will show an approach to build policy based applications with much greater flexibility, expressiveness and reusability . The key concept in this approach is the separation of business logic expressed as policy or rules into its various sub-components and these sub-components are dynamically configurable.
