The need for interoperability among databases has increased dramatically with the proliferation of readily available DBMS and application software. Even within a single organization, data from disparate relational databases must be integrated. A framework for interoperability in a federated system of relational databases should be inherently relational, so that it can use existing techniques for query evaluation and optimization where possible and retain the key features of SQL, such as a modest complexity and ease of query formulation. Our contribution is a logspace relational algebra, the Meta-Algebra (MA), for data/metadata integration among relational databases containing semantically similar information in schematically disparate formats. The MA is a simple yet powerful extension of the classical relational algebra (RA). The MA has a natural declarative counterpart, the Meta-Query Language (MQL), which we briefly describe. We state a result showing MQL and the MA are computationally equivalent, which enables us to algebratize MQL queries in fundamentally the same way as ordinary SQL queries. This algebratization in turn enables us to use MA equivalences to facilitate the application of known query optimization techniques to MQL query evaluation.
