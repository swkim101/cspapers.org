Morphological analysis must take into account the spelling-change processes of a language as well as its possible configurations of stems, affixes, and inflectional markings. The computational difficulty of the task can be clarified by investigating specific models of morphological processing. The use of finite-state machinery in the "two-level" model by Kimmo Koskenniemi gives it the appearance of computational efficiency, but closer examination shows the model does not guarantee efficient processing. Reductions of the satisfiability problem show that finding the proper lexical/surface correspondence in a two-level generation or recognition problem can be computationally difficult. The difficulty increases if unrestricted deletions (null characters) are allowed.
