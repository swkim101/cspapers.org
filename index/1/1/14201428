With the explosive growth of online social networks, it is now well understood that social information is highly helpful to recommender systems. Social recommendation methods are capable of battling the critical cold-start issue, and thus can greatly improve prediction accuracy. The main intuition is that through trust and influence, users are more likely to develop affinity toward items consumed by their social ties. Despite considerable work in social recommendation, little attention has been paid to the important distinctions between strong and weak ties, two well-documented notions in social sciences. In this work, we study the effects of distinguishing strong and weak ties in social recommendation. We use neighbourhood overlap to approximate tie strength and extend the popular Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model to incorporate the distinction of strong and weak ties. We present an EM-based algorithm that simultaneously classifies strong and weak ties in a social network w.r.t. optimal recommendation accuracy and learns latent feature vectors for all users and all items. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise ranking methods in a variety of accuracy metrics.
