While online social networks (OSN) present unprecedented opportunities for sharing information and multimedia content among users, they raise major privacy issues as users could often access personal or confidential data of other users. Most social networks provide some basic access control policies, which however seem to be very limited given the diversity of user relationships in the current social networks (e.g. friend, acquaintance, son) as well as the needs of social network users who might want to express sophisticated access control policies (e.g. invite all children of my colleagues to my child's birthday party). In this demonstration proposal, we present Primates a privacy management system for social networks. Primates allows users to specify access control rules for their resources and enforces access control over all shared resources. The set of users who are allowed to access a given resource is defined by a set of constraints on the paths connecting the owner of a resource to its requester in the social graph. We demonstrate the accuracy of our access control model and the scalability of our system.
