While user attribute extraction on social media has received considerable attention, existing approaches, mostly supervised, encounter great difficulty in obtaining gold standard data and are therefore limited to predicting unary predicates (e.g., gender). In this paper, we present a weaklysupervised approach to user profile extraction from Twitter. Users’ profiles from social media websites such as Facebook or Google Plus are used as a distant source of supervision for extraction of their attributes from user-generated text. In addition to traditional linguistic features used in distant supervision for information extraction, our approach also takes into account network information, a unique opportunity offered by social media. We test our algorithm on three attribute domains: spouse, education and job; experimental results demonstrate our approach is able to make accurate predictions for users’ attributes based on their tweets. 1
