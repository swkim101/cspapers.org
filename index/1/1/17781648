A well-known result of Tarjan (cf. [lo]) states that a program of up to rt UNION and m FIND instructions can be executed in O(n + m.cy(m, n)) time on a collection of n elements, where cr(m, n) denotes the functional inverse of Ackermann’s function. In this paper we develop a new approach to the problem and prove that the time for the kth FIND can be limited to O(a(K, n)) worst case, while the total time for the program of UNION’s and m FIND’s remains bounded by O(n + m.a(m,n)). The technique is part of a family of algorithms that can achieve various trade-offs in cost for the individual instructions. The new algorithm is important in all setmanipulation problems that require frequent FIND’s. Because cr(m,n) is 2 3 in all practical cases, the new algorithms guarantee that FIND’s are essentially O(1) worst case, within the optimal time-bound for the UNION-FIND problem as a whole. The algorithms run on a pointer machine and do not use any form of path compression. +This research was partiaIIy supported by the ESPRIT II Basic Research Actions Program of the EC under contract No. 3075 (project ALCOM). *Department of Computer Science, University of Utrecht, P-0.
