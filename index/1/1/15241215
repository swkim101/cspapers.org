In this paper we consider online learning in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) with changing cost sequences under full and bandit-information. We propose to view this problem as an instance of online linear optimization. We propose two methods for this problem: MD2 (mirror descent with approximate projections) and the continuous exponential weights algorithm with Dikin walks. We provide a rigorous complexity analysis of these techniques, while providing near-optimal regret-bounds (in particular, we take into account the computational costs of performing approximate projections in MD2). In the case of full-information feedback, our results complement existing ones. In the case of bandit-information feedback we consider the online stochastic shortest path problem, a special case of the above MDP problems, and manage to improve the existing results by removing the previous restrictive assumption that the state-visitation probabilities are uniformly bounded away from zero under all policies.
