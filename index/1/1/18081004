This paper describes a programming language, 2.PAK, whose main aim is to provide a set of primitives suitable for Artificial Intelligence applications. In addition, 2.PAK tries to incorporate principles obtained from research into programming languages in general. The main features of the language include a data base composed of directed labelled graphs, hierarchical and heterarchical control structures, backtracking primitives (applicable to either control structure), and a generalized form of pattern matching.
