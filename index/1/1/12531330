The optimization of supply chain distribution network need to consider many factors, especially useful information derived from distributors. In this paper, We consider a supply chain consisting of two layers, they are one manufacture and many distributors. Each distributor has full knowledge about his own value-added cost structure. The problem is to design the optimal distribution network for the manufacture. The approach of Network DEA is used to evaluate distributorsâ€™ relative validity and finish the filtration of distributors, and through these results the process of distributor selection is completed. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is given.
