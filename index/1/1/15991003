The need for combined task and motion planning in robotics is well understood. Solutions to this problem have typically relied on special purpose, integrated implementations of task planning and motion planning algorithms. We propose a new approach that uses off-the-shelf task planners and motion planners and makes no assumptions about their implementation. Doing so enables our approach to directly build on, and benefit from, the vast literature and latest advances in task planning and motion planning. It uses a novel representational abstraction and requires only that failures in computing a motion plan for a high-level action be identifiable and expressible in the form of logical predicates at the task level. We evaluate the approach and illustrate its robustness through a number of experiments using a state-of-the-art robotics simulator and a PR2 robot. These experiments show the system accomplishing a diverse set of challenging tasks such as taking advantage of a tray when laying out a table for dinner and picking objects from cluttered environments where other objects need to be re-arranged before the target object can be reached.
