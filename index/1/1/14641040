We study the possibility of reducing some special cases of circumscription to logic programming. The description of a given circumscriptive theory T can be sometimes transformed into a logic program II, so that, by running II, we can determine whether a given ground literal is provable in T. The method is applicable, in particular, to some formalizations of tree-structured inheritance systems with exceptions.
