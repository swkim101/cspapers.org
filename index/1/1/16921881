The current generation of protocol architectures, such as TCP/IP or the ISO suite, seem successful at meeting the demands of todays networks. However, a number of new requirements have been proposed for the networks of tomorrow, and some innovation in protocol structuring may be necessary. In this paper, we review some key requirements for tomorrow's networks, and propose some architectural principles to structure a new generation of protocols. In particular, this paper identifies two new design principles, Application Level Framing and Integrated Layer Processing. Additionally, it identifies the presentation layer as a key aspect of overall protocol performance.
