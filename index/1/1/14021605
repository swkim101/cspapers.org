The perfonnance of dedicated VLSI neural processing hardware depends critically on the design of the implemented algorithms. We have previously proposed an algorithm for acoustic transient classification [1]. Having implemented and demonstrated this algorithm in a mixed-mode architecture, we now investigate variants on the algorithm, using time and frequency channel differencing, input and output nonnalization, and schemes to binarize and train the template values, with the goal of achieving optimal classification perfonnance for the chosen hardware.
