Theideaof ARCHITECTURE ADAPTIVE ALCORITHMSWZIS introduced in order to reduce porting overhead in parallel algorithms. The AAA presents a way for algorithms to adapt themselves to the computer system on which they are running without the assistance of the application programmer. For the development of these algorithms it is, nevertheless, necessary to obtain reliable and reproducible execution time information. A good method for achieving these results is to simulate the hardware. In this paper a new simulator (the Machine Independent Simulation System for PVMJ) is presented and its usefulness for this type of application is investigated.
