Since debugging is a time-consuming activity, automated program repair tools such as GenProg have garnered interest. A recent study revealed that the majority of GenProg repairs avoid bugs simply by deleting functionality. We found that SPR, a state-of-the-art repair tool proposed in 2015, still deletes functionality in their many "plausible" repairs. Unlike generate-and-validate systems such as GenProg and SPR, semantic analysis based repair techniques synthesize a repair based on semantic information of the program. While such semantics-based repair methods show promise in terms of quality of generated repairs, their scalability has been a concern so far. In this paper, we present Angelix, a novel semantics-based repair method that scales up to programs of similar size as are handled by search-based repair tools such as GenProg and SPR. This shows that Angelix is more scalable than previously proposed semantics based repair methods such as SemFix and DirectFix. Furthermore, our repair method can repair multiple buggy locations that are dependent on each other. Such repairs are hard to achieve using SPR and GenProg. In our experiments, Angelix generated repairs from large-scale real-world software such as wireshark and php, and these generated repairs include multi-location repairs. We also report our experience in automatically repairing the well-known Heartbleed vulnerability.
