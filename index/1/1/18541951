We present Air Finger, a novel technique that enables controlling CD ratio by finger height above the touch sur-face for multi-scale navigation tasks. Extending previous research on virtual touch, Air Finger divides the space above surface into two layers and associates the high, medium and low CD ratios to the touch surface, the lower air and the higher air respectively. Users can fluidly switch between the three navigation scales by lifting and pressing the finger. Air Finger enables multi-scale navigation control using one hand
