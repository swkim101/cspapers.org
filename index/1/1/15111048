INTRODUCTION Letting users speak commands to the systems they are interacting with has been tried in various domains. Examples include a range of computer applications, as well as more narrowly defined domains such as aircraft systems. Using speech to control computers has never caught on in a big way, however, and in aircraft it has been limited to a few special applications. Why? Isn’t it appealing to be able to simply say “justify” when doing word processing (instead of having to give that command through pressing a command key or making a selection from a menu)? Doesn’t it make a lot of sense to let a pilot concentrate her/his attention on the main job of flying instead of fumbling for the radio and manually setting it to the new frequency?
