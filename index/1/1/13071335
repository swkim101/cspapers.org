For haptic devices, compensation of the robot's gravity is a frequent strategy with the aim to reduce interaction forces between robot and human in zero-impedance control. However, a closer look at the composition of these interaction forces may reveal that the net effect of uncompensated gravitational components of the robot actually reduces interaction forces during dynamic movements, because inertial and gravitational components at least partially compensate each other. This is the case in lower extremity exoskeletons, where less user force is necessary to swing the robot's leg when gravity helps. Here, we go one step further by shaping optimal passive dynamics for arbitrary haptic devices. The proposed method of Generalized Elasticies uses conservative force fields to improve haptic transparency for certain movements types. In an example realization, these force fields are generated by elasticities spanning multiple joints. Practical experiments with the Lokomat lower extremity exoskeleton show the success of the proposed method in terms of reduced interaction torques and more physiological user motion compared to gravity compensation.
