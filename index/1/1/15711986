Sponsored search is a major revenue source for search companies. Web searchers can issue any queries, while advertisement keywords are limited. Query rewriting technique effectively matches user queries with relevant advertisement keywords, thus increases the amount of web advertisements available. The match relevance is critical for clicks. In this study, we aim to improve query rewriting relevance. For this purpose, we use an active learning algorithm called Transductive Experimental Design to select the most informative samples to train the query rewriting relevance model. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves model accuracy and rewriting relevance.
