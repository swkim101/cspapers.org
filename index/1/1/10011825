This paper provides an overview of the Watson project and a report on its current status and direction. Watson is a National Science Foundation sponsored project (DUE 92543 17) aimed at creating computerbased laboratory experiences for introducing many of the basic concepts in computing to both majors and non-majors. We have developed and implemented eight prototype Watson laboratories which are currently being used in our introductory computer science course. Activities include: applications (spreadsheets and databases), algorithms (data structures and graphics), programming languages (imperative and functional), architecture (combinational logic), and theory (finite state automata). The goal of this project is to develop a diverse collection of 12 to 15 laboratory experiences that will present major concepts in computing to a wide variety of students in an accessible way and to encourage the development of critical thinking skills in these students by emphasizing problem solving in challenging, but limited, domains.
