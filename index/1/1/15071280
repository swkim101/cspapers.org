We present an overview of the Coupled Layered Architecture for Robotic Autonomy. CLARAty develops a framework for generic and reusable robotic components that can be adapted to a number of heterogeneous robot platforms. It also provides a framework that will simplify the integration of new technologies and enable the comparison of various elements. CLARAty consists of two distinct layers: a functional layer and a decision layer. The functional layer defines the various abstractions of the system and adapts the abstract components to real or simulated devices. It provides a framework and the algorithms for low- and mid-level autonomy. The decision layer provides the system's high-level autonomy, which reasons about global resources and mission constraints. The decision layer accesses information from the functional layer at multiple levels of granularity. We also present some of the challenges in developing interoperable software for various rover platforms.
