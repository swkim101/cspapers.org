The concept of nested transactions offers more decomposable execution units and finer grained control over recovery and concurrency as compared to 'flat' transactions. To exploit these advantages, especially transaction recovery has to be refined and adjusted to the requirements of the control structure.
In this paper, we investigate transaction recovery for nested transactions. Therefore, a model for nested transaction is introduced allowing for synchronous and asynchronous transaction invocation as well as single call and conversational interfaces. For the resulting four parameter combinations, the properties and dependencies of transaction recovery are explored if a transaction is 'unit of recovery' and if savepoints within transactions are used to gain finer recovery units.
