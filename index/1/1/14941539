Recently, a number of papers have shown that for many domains, using multiple heuristics in independent searches performs better than combining them into a single heuristic. Furthermore, using a large number of "weak" heuristics could potentially eliminate the need for the careful design of a few. The standard approach to distribute computation in these multi-heuristic searches is to rotate through the heuristics in a round-robin fashion. However, this strategy can be inefficient especially in the case when only a few of the heuristics are leading to progress. In this paper, we present two principled methods to adaptively distribute computation time among the different searches of the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm. The first method, Meta-A*, constructs and searches a meta-graph, which represents the problem of finding the best heuristic as the problem of minimizing the total number of expansions. The second treats the scheduling of searches with different heuristics as a multi-armed bandit problem. It applies Dynamic Thompson Sampling (DTS) to keep track of what searches are making progress the most and continuously recomputes the schedule of searches based on this information. We provide a theoretical analysis and compare our new strategies with the round-robin method on a 12-DOF full-body motion planning problem and on sliding tile puzzle problems. In these experiments, we used up to 20 heuristics and observed a several times speedup without loss in solution quality.
