Computer networking is now an established technology, and its applications amy be expected to proliferate rapidly. As a result, the design of future operating systems should be influenced by the requirements of networking.
 The design of entirely-new operating systems for widely-used CPU's is a rather uncommon event, however; more often, it is necessary to add a network interface to an existing operating system. The consequent host software development can be a major undertaking, particularly for operating systems on large-scale CPU's. It is useful to examine the requirements for interfacing existing systems to current networks [3, 4].
 This paper describes the design of host software extensions which allow a large-scale machine running a widely-used operating system to provide service to the ARPANET. This software has enabled the host, an IBM 360/91 at UCLA, to provide production computing services to ARPANET users since 1971 [1]. The machine was physically linked to the UCLA IMP in January 1971, and user-level protocols became operational 8 months later.
