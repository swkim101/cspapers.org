We present a new hierarchical Bayesian model for unsupervised topic segmentation. This new model integrates a point-wise boundary sampling algorithm used in Bayesian segmentation into a structured topic model that can capture a simple hierarchical topic structure latent in documents. We develop an MCMC inference algorithm to split/merge segment(s). Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous unsupervised segmentation methods using only lexical information on Choiâ€™s datasets and two meeting transcripts and has performance comparable to those previous methods on two written datasets.
