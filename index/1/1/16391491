The use of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can offer cost effective solutions for gathering data on urban traffic, vehicle velocity, parking, etc. These applications demand real-time image acquisition and computational intensive processing in order to collect relevant information. We present our hardware and software solution for detecting moving objects and evaluating their velocity based on line sensor technology which guarantees fast processing, low storage and bandwidth requirements.
