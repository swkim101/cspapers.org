This paper addresses the problem of robust takeoff and landing control of a quadrotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). During the critical flight phases of takeoff and landing the vehicle dynamics change according to the possible existence of contact with the ground. To model the vehicle during the overall maneuver a hybrid automaton is used where each state corresponds to a different dynamic behavior exhibited by the UAV. The original takeoff and landing problems are then addressed as a problem of tracking suitable reference signals in order to achieve the desired transitions between different hybrid states of the automaton. Both reference trajectories and feedback control laws are derived to explicitly account for measurement noise and uncertainties, in both the environment and in the vehicle dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
