This paper describes Smartpig, an algorithm for the iterative mosaicking of images of a planar surface using a unique parameterization which decomposes inter-image projective warps into camera intrinsics, fronto-parallel projections, and inter-image similarities. The constraints resulting from the inter-image alignments within an image set are stored in an undirected graph structure allowing efficient optimization of image projections on the plane. Camera pose is also directly recoverable from the graph, making Smartpig a feasible solution to the problem of simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM). Smartpig is demonstrated on a set of 144 high resolution aerial images and evaluated with a number of metrics against ground control.
