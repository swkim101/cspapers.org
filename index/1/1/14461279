We describe the design and implementation of SenseMaker, an interface for information exploration across heterogeneous sources. We also discuss lessons learned from a pilot study of the system. Our focus throughout is on how SenseMaker supports the context-driven evolution of a user's interests. SenseMaker makes it easier for the user to: (1) examine the current context, and (2) progress from one context to the next. SenseMaker works by approximating the current context as the current collection of accumulated information references. Users examine their current context by experimenting iteratively with different organizing dimensions and levels of granularity for the current collec tion's display. They progress from one context to another by building upon, taking away from, or replacing the current collection. They can also return to previous contexts and continue exploring from there.
