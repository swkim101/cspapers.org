Marking up queries with annotations such as part-of-speech tags, capitalization, and segmentation, is an important part of many approaches to query processing and understanding. Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing annotation tools that are commonly trained on full-length documents. To address this challenge, we view the query as an explicit representation of a latent information need, which allows us to use pseudo-relevance feedback, and to leverage additional information from the document corpus, in order to improve the quality of query annotation.
