A design automation system is described which has certain features that make it particularly well suited to the automation and analysis of entire digital systems; including hardware, firmware and software. The code includes facilities for automated synthesis, simulation and documentation. The languages, called LINDA and MODEL, and their processing algorithms are described.Examples of computer architecture studies which have been conducted using LINDA and MODEL are also presented. These include development of an associative processor and investigations related to a logic-in-memory architecture. It is stressed that reliance on the appropriate design automation procedures have expedited the work and reduced the cost of research by eliminating the implementation phase as a necessary prerequisite to the study of machine concepts.
