We formalize the problem of maintaining views of graphs. These are graphs induced by the contraction of vertex subsets that are defined by associated hierarchies. We provide data structures that allow applications to refine and coarsen such views interactively and efficiently, in time linear in the number of changes induced by any exploration operation. The problem is motivated by applications in graph visualization.
