Currently, fault management in Web Services orchestrating multiple suppliers relies on a local analysis, that does not span across individual services, thus limiting the effectiveness of recovery strategies. We propose to address this limitation by employing Model-Based Diagnosis to enhance fault analysis. In our approach, a Diagnostic Web Service is added to the set of Web Services providing the overall service, and acts as a supervisor of their execution, by identifying anomalies and explaining them in terms of faults to be repaired.
