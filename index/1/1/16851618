ProvinciaSense is a proof-of-concept of the integration of both static and mobile sensor nodes with ProvinciaWiFi, a network which currently hosts more than 1100 WiFi Access Points (APs) serving Rome and other 120 cities with about 4.5 millions of citizens. The simple and cost effective integration of sensor nodes with a big number of ProvinciaWiFi APs will allow us to deploy one among the biggest available testbeds for wireless sensor networks and to support the implementation of effective smart cities services.
