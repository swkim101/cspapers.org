A new event-based two degree-of-freedom control method for micro-/nanoscale systems based on differential flatness is presented. Compared with traditional time-based feedback control, the proposed method shows great potential in dealing with measurement noise and unexpected disturbances. Instead of using time to drive the planner, we determine the reference trajectory with an intelligent event directly derived from measurement Therefore, the proposed method inherits the advantages of both feedback and feedforward. Applications to drug delivery demonstrate the promising robustness of this approach.
