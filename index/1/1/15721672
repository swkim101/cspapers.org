We present a prototyping toolkit for creating touch sensitive prototypes from everyday objects without needing special skills such as code writing or designing circuits. This toolkit consists of an acoustic based touch sensor module that captures the resonant properties of objects, software modules including one that recognizes how an object is touched by using machine learning, and plugins for visual programming environments such as Scratch and Max/MSP. As a result, our toolkit enables users to easily configure the response of touches using a wide variety of visual or audio responses. We believe that our toolkit expands the creativity of a non-specialist, such as children and media artists.
