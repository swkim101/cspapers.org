Conventionally creativity is often conceived as an aptitude to be discovered in an individual that cannot be mathematically measured. But the concept of creative thinking as a divergence from a standard "norm" is used in creativity research for the purpose of assessing creativity and is also linked to non-traditional or creative processes that lead to unique and divergent artifacts [1,2]. Using Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA)[3], the divergence between implemented computational thinking patterns in a student-created game, and that game's tutorial "norm" is calculated as an indicator of creativity. Through a case study of one teacher using three unique learning conditions, CTPA's computed divergence is explored as a valid measurement of creativity in these student games.
