An interactive system has been developed that facilitates closer interaction by a designer in the design process through the use of shaded color three-dimensional computer graphics to display appropriate design data. The use of traditional computer animation techniques allows for more efficient analysis of time dependent data, and advanced interactive methods of storing and retrieving spatial data offers help in displaying and evaluating the objects being designed. The system is planned to interface with an existing computer-aided design project that emphasizes the structural analysis phase of the design process. The fundamental goal of the project was to incorporate color graphics into the design system while maintaining a high degree of user interaction. Descriptions are included of the operating system environment and the necessary supporting software and hardware components. Modules of the display system are discussed and sample images are presented with examples of user interaction.
