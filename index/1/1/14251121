A less conservative condition for robust D-stability of linear systems with polytopic uncertainties is proposed. The robust D-stability can be easily attested by means of a feasibility test of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) involving only the vertices of the polytope. It is shown that the proposed condition include a lot of conditions published recently as particular cases. To the best of authors' knowledge, the present result is the least conservative in comparison with other conditions currently available in the field of robust D-stability analysis for polytopic uncertain systems
