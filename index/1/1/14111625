We describe the architecture and programming abstractions of PARDIS, a system based on ideas underlying the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). PARDIS provides a distributed environment in which objects representing data-parallel computation, as well as non-parallel objects present in parallel programs, can interact across platforms and software systems. Each of these objects represents a small, encapsulated application that can be used as a building block in the construction of distributed metaapplications. We will present examples of building such metaapplications with PARDIS, and show their performance in distributed systems combining the computational power of different multi-processor architectures.
