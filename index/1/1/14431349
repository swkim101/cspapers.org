Three text editors were studied using the editor evaluation methodology developed by Roberts and Moran [3, 4]. The results are presented as an extension of the studies by Roberts and Moran, with comparisons to the editors they studied earlier. In addition, supplementary measurements were taken that suggest minor flaws in the Roberts and Moran methodology. Further problems with the methodology are discussed, with an eye toward improving the methodology for future use. Although three significant problems with the methodology are reported, the problems are interesting primarily as lessons for the design of future evaluation methodologies. The Roberts and Moran methodology remains largely useful for the purposes for which it was designed.
