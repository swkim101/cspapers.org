It is well-known that, left to themselves, people will choose passwords that can be rather readily guessed. If this is done, they are usually vulnerable to an attack based on copying the content of messages forming part of an authentication protocol and experimenting, e.g. with a dictionary, offline. The most usual counter to this threat is to require people to use passwords which are obscure, or even to insist on the system choosing their passwords for them. In this paper we show alternatively how to construct an authentication protocol in which offline experimentation is impracticable; any attack based on experiment must involve the real authentication server and is thus open to detection by the server noticing multiple attempts.
