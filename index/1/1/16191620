Computer science is an experimental science, in the same sense that biology or physics are experimental sciences. Nonetheless, lab exercises for CS1 and CS2 courses are almost never formal “experiments” as the term would be understood in any other science. This paper describes our experiences using formal experiments in CS1 and 2 laboratories. Such exercises are extremely valuable, in part because they help students relate abstract concepts to concrete programs, but more importantly because they lead students into new areas of computing, and even new forms of learning.
