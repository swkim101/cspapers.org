The use of specialization hierarchies in model-based vision systems may cause problems with uniformity in representation and efficiency. The concept of a discrimination graph is introduced. Such a graph facilitates the representation of hypothetical and ambiguous interpretations in a uniform and efficient way. We describe the implementation of Mapsee-3, a sketch map interpretation program that uses discrimination graphs in combination with a hierarchical constraint propagation algorithm.
