Two shape from shading problems are considered, one involving an image of a plane and the other an image of a hemisphere. The former is shown to be ambiguous because it can be generated by an infinite number of ruled surfaces. The latter, in contrast, is shown to have only the hemisphere and its reversal as solutions, although some subregions of the image are shown to be infinitely ambiguous.
