We propose a new jamming attack model from spatial perspective: given k jammers, how does the attacker minimize the pair-wise connectivity among the nodes in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)? We call this problem k-Jammer Deployment Problem (k-JDP). First, we prove that the decision version of k-JDP is NP-complete even in the ideal situation where the attacker has full knowledge of topology information. Second, we propose a mathematical formulation based on Integer Programming (IP) model which yields an optimal solution. Third, we present a heuristic algorithm HAJDP, and compare it with the IP model. Numerical results show that HAJDP is computationally efficient.
