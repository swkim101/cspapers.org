In heterogeneous MPSoCs, memory interference between the CPU and realtime cores is a critical impediment to system performance. Previous memory schedulers adopt the classic two-tier queuing system, but unfortunately the use of two-tier queuing deteriorates the QoS of scheduling policies. In this paper, we propose the Single-Tier Virtual Queuing (STVQ) memory controller for efficacious QoS-aware scheduling. The STVQ memory controller maintains single-tier transaction queues and employs separable allocation for transaction scheduling with high scalability. A multi-source realtime scheduling algorithm is further presented. The STVQ controller achieves up to 13.9% less CPU IPC slowdown than previous schedulers with no frame rate penalty on realtime cores.
