Static analysis of systems allows to discover errors at design time and to avoid run-time error detection techniques that negatively impact performance of the systems. In this paper, we present the consent operator, which allows (i) to capture errors resulting from incorrect composition of software components, (ii) to test conformance of behavior descriptions and (iii) to analyze whether conditions of a correct dynamic update are satisfied.
