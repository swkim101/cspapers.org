This paper presents a fault tolerant approach for a coaxial octorotor regarding rotor failures. A complete architecture including error detection, fault isolation and system recovery is presented. The diagnosis system is designed with a nonlinear observer to generate residuals and an inference model to evaluate them and isolate the faulty motor. Once the motor failure is diagnosed, a recovery algorithm is applied. It uses the built-in hardware redundancy of the octorotor and compensates the loss of the failing motor by controlling its dual to keep a stable flight that allows the multirotor to continue its mission. This architecture is validated on real flights.
