The dynamic load balancing strategies for parallel association rule mining are proposed under heterogeneous PC cluster environment. PC cluster is recently regarded as one of the most promising platforms for heavy data intensive applications, such as decision support query processing and data mining. The development period of PC hardware is becoming extremely short, which results in heterogeneous system, where the clock cycle of CPU, the performance/capacity of disk drives, etc are di erent among component PC's. Heterogeneity is inevitable. Basically, current algorithms assume the homogeneity. Thus if we naively apply them to heterogeneous system, its performance is far below expectation. We need some new methodologies to handle heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the new dynamic load balancing methods for association rule mining, which works under heterogeneous system. Two strategies, called candidate migration and transaction migration are proposed. Initially rst one is invoked. When the load imbalance cannot be resolved with the rst method, the second one is employed, which is costly but more e ective for strong imbalance. We have implemented them on the PC cluster system with two di erent types of PCs: one with Pentium Pro, the other one with Pentium II.
