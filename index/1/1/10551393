Val iant [1] introduced the notion of a family of 19computable polynomials as those mul t ivar ia te polynomials of polynomial ly-bounded degree and straight-l ine computat ion length. He raised the question of whether pcomputable families would be closed under natural mathemat ica l operations and showed tha t this is true for taking repeated part ial derivatives in a single variable, whereas by taking repeated part ial derivatives in many variables one can obtain the general permanent from a polynomial-sized formula.
