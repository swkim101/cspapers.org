Ubiquitous Computing poses new challenges for the software engineering community. The T-Engine platform consisting of standard real-time kernel, T-Kernel, running on the standard hardware with networking facility creates broad application opportunities based on the collaboration of cutting edge microelectronics, software and embedded system technologies. However, to realize the true potential of such a system in a ubiquitous computing environment, we need to overcome software engineering issues among many hurdles we encounter. We describe such issues and the future challenges inherent in the ubiquitous computing based on our experience of using Ubiquitous Communicator terminal that is based on T-Engine.
