Network tomography techniques can infer the logical topology of network without the cooperation of nodes.Multiple source network tomography can obtain more information about the topology detail and the link performance than single source network tomography. How to differ from each other between the six 2-by-2 structures is the core technique of the multiple source network tomography.This paper proposed a 2-by-2 components identification methodology based on the bidirectional measurements and a logical topologies emerging algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of methodology is validated by the simulation results.
