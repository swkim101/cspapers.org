The ability to cap peak power consumption is a desirable feature in modern data centers for energy budgeting, cost management, and efficient power delivery. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a traditional control knob in the tradeoff between server power and performance. Multi-core processors and the parallel applications that take advantage of them introduce new possibilities for control, wherein workload threads are packed onto a variable number of cores and idle cores enter low-power sleep states. This paper proposes Pack & Cap, a control technique designed to make optimal DVFS and thread packing control decisions in order to maximize performance within a power budget. In order to capture the workload dependence of the performance-power Pareto frontier, a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) classifier is built using a large volume of performance counter, temperature, and power characterization data. When queried during runtime, the classifier is capable of accurately selecting the optimal operating point. We implement and validate this method on a real quad-core system running the PARSEC parallel benchmark suite. When varying the power budget during runtime, Pack & Cap meets power constraints 82% of the time even in the absence of a power measuring device. The addition of thread packing to DVFS as a control knob increases the range of feasible power constraints by an average of 21% when compared to DVFS alone and reduces workload energy consumption by an average of 51.6% compared to existing control techniques that achieve the same power range.
