A database specification consists of static and temporal constraints and a set of database operation descriptions. A database iS viewed as a dynamic object and a sequence of database states constitutes an evolution of the database. A formal method for verifying database specifications is proposed. The method checks if the static constraints are consistent, analyses the database operation descriptions with respect to the static constraints to ensure that each operation can ever be executed, and finally, it verifies that each permissible sequence of operations satisfies all the temporal constraints.
