This paper presents slope traversal experiments with slip compensation control for lunar/planetary exploration rovers. On loose soil, wheels of the rover easily slip even when the rover travels with relatively low velocity. Because of the slip, following an arbitrary path on loose soil becomes a difficult task for the rover, and also, the slip will increase when the rover traverses a slope. To cope with the slip issue, the authors previously proposed path following control strategy taking wheel slippages into account. Through numerical simulations in the previous work, it has been confirmed that the proposed control effectively compensates and reduces the slip motions of the rover, and then, the rover can follow a given path. In order to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control for practical application, slope traversal experiments using a four-wheeled rover test bed are addressed in this paper. The control performance of the slip compensation is compared to that of no slip control based on motion traces of the rover in side slope traversal case. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed control is verified by quantitative evaluations of distance and orientation errors.
