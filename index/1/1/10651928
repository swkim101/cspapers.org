Page-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) is a popular way to support a coherent shared address space programming model on these clusters. Previous research has identied several key bottlenecks in the communication, protocol and application layers of a software SVM system that are not so signi cant in more mainstream, hardware-coherent multiprocessors. A key question for the communication layer is how much and what kind of hardware support is particularly valuable in improving the performance of such systems. This paper examines a popular form of hardware support|namely, support for automatic, hardware propagation of writes to remote memories|discussing new design issues and evaluating performance in the context of emerging clusters. Since much of the performance di erence is due to di erences in contention e ects in various parts of the system, performance is examined through very detailed simulation, utilizing the deep visibility into the simulated system to analyze the causes of observed e ects.
