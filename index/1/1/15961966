Context is an important factor for domestic service robots to consider when interpreting their environments to perform tasks. In people's homes, rooms are laid out in a specific arrangement to enable comfortable and efficient living; for example, the living room is central to the house, and the dining room is adjacent to the kitchen. The identity of the objects in a room are a strong cue for determining that room's purpose. This paper will present a planner for an autonomous mobile robot system which uses room connectivity topology and object understanding as context for an object search task in a domestic environment.
