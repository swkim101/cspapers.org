The work presents the standing stabilization of a compliant humanoid robot against external force disturbances and variations of the terrain inclination. The novel contribution is the proposed control scheme which consists of three strategies named compliance control in the transversal plane, body attitude control, and potential energy control, all combined with the intrinsic passive compliance in the robot. The physical compliant elements of the robot are exploited to react at the first instance of the impact while the active compliance control is applied to further absorb the impact and dissipate the elastic energy stored in springs preventing the high rate of spring recoil. The body attitude controller meanwhile regulates the spin angular momentum to provide more agile reactions by changing body inclination. The potential energy control module constrains the robot center of mass (COM) in a virtual slope to convert the excessive kinetic energy into potential energy to prevent falling. Experiments were carried out with the proposed balance stabilization control demonstrating superior balance performance. The compliant humanoid was capable of recovering from external force disturbances and moderate or even abrupt variations of the terrain inclination. Experimental data such as the impulse forces, real COM, center of pressure (COP) and the spring elastic energy are presented and analyzed.
