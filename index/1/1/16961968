Cleveland State University is an urban university, with the Department of Computer and Information Science residing in the College of Business Administration. The major objective of the department's curriculum is to educate students for productive roles in industry, primarily in the development and implementation of business information systems. Several years ago, critical comments from both the business community and the students themselves gave strong indication that the courses in systems analysis and design were not fulfilling this objective. Not only were the courses not teaching state of the art techniques, they tended to vary in content considerably from quarter to quarter, depending on the instructor.
 The subject “systems analysis and design” covers a wide variety of material, far too much to be dealt with comprehensively in any reasonable time span. It was felt that the objectives for the courses could best be met by concentrating on structured analysis and design methodologies (particularly as they applied to the development of business information systems for computers), and by establishing well-defined syllabi for the courses. The material was divided into two courses, the first covering analysis and the second covering design.
