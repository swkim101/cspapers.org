This paper describes a proof of concept for introducing iPods and iPodLinux into a one-semester introductory undergraduate operating systems course. iPodLinux is a version of the Linux operating system modified to run on iPods. We added a project to our course in which the students modified the iPodLinux kernel, and we supplemented lectures by discussing specifics of the Linux implementation as they relate to general operating systems concepts. We feel the course was much improved by these additions, with no substantive omission of regular material. Student response was very enthusiastic, and we feel the new material enhanced their course experience by providing a component that was empowering and helped to further improve their knowledge and skills.
