IBM® DB2® 9 is a truly hybrid commercial database system that combines XML and relational data. It provides native support for XML storage and indexing, and query evaluation support for XQuery. By building a hybrid system, the designers of DB2 9 were able to use the existing SQL query evaluation and optimization techniques to develop similar methods for XQuery. However, SQL and XQuery are sufficiently different that new optimization techniques can and are being developed in the new XQuery domain. This paper describes a few such techniques, all based on static rewrites of XQuery expressions.
