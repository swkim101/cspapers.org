In this paper, we provide a system that takes start and end points as the input, and will automatically connect to the Google Maps with Street View to achieve the route planned result and scenery along the route. Finally, it will generate a smooth scenic video from the starting point to the destination, which combines the Google Maps to provide better route recognition to users. The users can watch and interact with the video as if they are driving a car through the planned route. Our system is fully automatic but still provides interaction mechanisms for the users to walk around in the scenic video.
