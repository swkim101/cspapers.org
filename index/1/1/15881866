Performance evaluation, using both analytical and simulation models, of circuit switching baseline networks is presented. Two configurations of the baseline networks, single and dual, are evaluated. In each configuration, two different conflict resolution strategies, drop and hold, are tried to see the performance difference. Our analytical models are based on a more realistic assumption. New analyses are given and are verified by simulation results. In single network configuration, it is shown that the drop strategy is better than the hold strategy in the case that the data transfer time is longer than 10 cycles under a high request rate. In the dual network configuration, five different communication strategies are investigated and the optimum performance level is shown to be dependent on the length of the data transfer time.
