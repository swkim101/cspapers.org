Recent advances in hardware architectures, particularly multicore and manycore systems, implicitly require programmers to write concurrent programs. However, writing correct and efficient concurrent programs is challenging. We envision a system where the concurrent programs can be self-adaptive when executing on different hardware. We have developed two different tuning policies, which enable users' programs to adjust their level of concurrency at compile-time and run-time respectively.
