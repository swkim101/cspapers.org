To bridge the gap between insufficiency of existing proximity authentication solutions and the increasing demand of high security guarantee for access control systems, we develope a WISP-based access control system combing electronic and mechanical authentication methods. In our authentication, encryption complexity is changeable and trusted users can share privileges with each other. During experiments, our system has achieved 95% authentication accuracy rate with up to 3 different users.
