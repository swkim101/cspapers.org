Object-oriented software development practices are being rapidly adopted within increasingly complex systems, including reactive, real-time and concurrent system applications. While data modeling is performed very well under current object-oriented development practices, behavioral modeling necessary to capture critical information in real-time, reactive, and concurrent systems is often lacking. Addressing this deficiency, we offer an approach for modeling and analyzing concurrent object-oriented software designs through the use of behavioral design patterns, allowing us to map stereotyped UML objects to colored Petri net (CPN) representations in the form of reusable templates. The resulting CPNs are then used to model and analyze behavioral properties of the software architecture, applying the results of the analysis to the original software design.
