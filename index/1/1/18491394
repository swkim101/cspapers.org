The effects of general global documentation, detailed step-by-step documentation, and combined global and detailed documentation were examined for high, medium, and low experienced students. The 198 students in this study used a word-processing program to complete two problems during a two-hour session. Results from univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that both general time measures for reading documentation and completing problems as well as the student users' reactions to the documentation, the program, and the computer system were affected by either the type of documentation, the level of experience, or both of these factors.
