Our Internet-based project is developing two courses to demonstrate the viability of a virtual classroom environment where the on-line student can interact both with the instructor and "virtual classmates." Other course components include a hyperlinked textbook and laboratory experiences that stress learning-by-doing. We use Java on both the server side and the client side to support the classroom interaction and the laboratory activities. This paper illustrates some of the particular software technologies used. We discuss problems encountered, solutions found, and the ongoing development of materials.
