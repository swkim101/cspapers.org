The commissioning of sensors and actuators within a building is often carried out by an operator who manually gathers and later inserts configuration data into the building management system. Data sets collected can easily reach hundreds which makes this manual process a slow complex operation which in turn is prone to errors. In this paper, we present a client-server architecture for a simple web based commissioning application, based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), that allows an operator to easily discover and browse through newly installed devices in order to perform commissioning configurations onsite.
