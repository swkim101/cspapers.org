In this extended abstract, we present several new layouts for the shuffle-exchange graph, including one which requires only 0(n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>/log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>n) area. The optimal layout is described and analyzed in section 3. The analysis is heavily dependent on several combinatorial results which we state in section 2 and prove in the appendix. The other layouts are described in section 4. Although these layouts are not asymptotically optimal (most require 0(n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>/log<supscrpt>3/2</supscrpt>n) area), the theory behind their development is interesting and may eventually lead to good practical layouts as well as other asymptotically optimal layouts.
