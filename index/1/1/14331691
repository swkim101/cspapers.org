While shopping websites provide rich customer support through their adaptiveness, static paper-based leaflets are still one of the most important advertising mechanisms for retailers even in todays digital world. With their physical qualities, they create a higher emotional connection and with that more positive memories for brands and retailers. In this paper, we investigate two concepts for Augmented Reality advertising for such leaflets to bridge the digital divide. One of them is following a Guerrilla marketing approach, which allows users to easily compare products of different retailers. The second concept investigates different strategies for visualizing cross-selling recommendations inside the leaflets. We report on initial user feedback and discuss ideas for future work in the field of Augmented Reality advertising.
