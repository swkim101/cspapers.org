For the SC|06 analytics challenge, we demonstrate an end-to-end solution for processing data produced by high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics so biological hypotheses can be explored. This approach is based on a tool called the Bioinformatics Resource Manager (BRM) which will interact with high-performance architecture and experimental data sources to provide high-throughput analytics to a specific experimental dataset. Peptide identification was achieved by a high-performance code, Polygraph, which has been shown to scale well beyond 1000 processors. Visual analytics applications such as PQuad, Cytoscape, or others may be used to visualize protein identities in the context of pathways using data from public repositories such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The end result was that a user can go from experimental spectra to pathway data in a single workflow reducing time-to-solution for analyzing biological data from weeks to minutes.
