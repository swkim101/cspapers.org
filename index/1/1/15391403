Nowadays, multicarrier transmission technique, e.g., optical OFDM, receives quite intense attention in the optical communications and networking field due to its potential to provide dispersion compensation. Adaptive modulation level is commonly and naturally employed in relation to multicarrier transmission, provided (sub)channel state information is available. The modulation level adaptation is usually done by a bitloading mechanism. In our work, given some modulation formats that are to be used, we attempt to reduce the computational complexity order of the bitloading algorithm from the one that has been presented in the literature. The bitloading algorithm is applied to a multicarrier multimode PON.
