We propose an interactive model, RuleViz, for visualizing the entire process of knowledge discovery and data mining. The model consists of ve components according to the main ingredients of the knowledge discovery process: original data visualization, visual data reduction, visual data preprocess, visual rule discovery, and rule visualization. The RuleViz model for visualizing the process of knowledge discovery is introduced and each component is discussed. Two aspects are emphasized, human-machine interaction and process visualization. The interaction helps the KDD system navigate through the enormous search spaces and recognize the intentions of the user, and the visualization of the KDD process helps users gain better insight into the multidimensional data, understand the intermediate results, and interpret the discovered patterns. According to the RuleViz model, we implement an interactive system, CViz, which exploits \parallel coordinates" technique to visualize the process of rule induction. The original data is visualized on the parallel coordinates, and can be interactively reduced both horizontally and vertically. Three approaches for discretizing numerical attributes are provided in the visual data preprocessing. CViz learns classi cation rules on the basis of a rule induction algorithm and presents the result as the algorithm proceeds. The discovered rules are nally visualized on the parallel coordinates with each rule being displayed as a directed \polygon", and the rule accuracy and quality are used to render the \polygons" and control the choice of rules to be displayed to avoid clutter. The CViz system has been experimented with the UCI data sets and synthesis data sets, and the results demonstrate that the RuleViz model and the implemented visualization system are useful and helpful for understanding the process of knowledge discovery and interpreting the nal results.
