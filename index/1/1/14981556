We present and discuss stream size and lifetime distributions for web and non-web TCP traffic on a campus OC12 link at UC San Diego. The distributions are stable over long periods, and show that on this link only 3% of the streams last longer than one minute, and that only about 0.5% of them are bigger than 100 kBytes. Although there are large streams (elephants) on this link, the bulk of its traffic is composed of many small streams (mice).
