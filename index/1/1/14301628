This paper describes two custom architectures tailored to a speech recognition beam search algorithm. Both architectures have been simulated using real data and the results of the simulation are presented. The paper also describes the design process of the custom architectures and presents a number of ideas on the automatic design of custom systems for data dependent computations.
