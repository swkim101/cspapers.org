In physical Human-Robot Interaction, the basic problem of fast detection and safe robot reaction to unexpected collisions has been addressed successfully on advanced research robots that are torque controlled, possibly equipped with joint torque sensors, and for which an accurate dynamic model is available. In this paper, an end-user approach to collision detection and reaction is presented for an industrial manipulator having a closed control architecture and no additional sensors. The proposed detection and reaction schemes have minimal requirements: only the outer joint velocity reference to the robot manufacturer's controller is used, together with the available measurements of motor currents and joint positions. No a priori information on the robot dynamic model and existing low-level joint controllers is strictly needed. A suitable on-line processing of the motor currents allows to distinguish between accidental collisions and intended human-robot contacts, so as to switch the robot to a collaboration mode when needed. Two examples of reaction schemes for collaboration are presented, with the user pushing/pulling the robot at any point of its structure (e.g., for manual guidance) or with a compliant-like robot behavior in response to forces applied by the human. The actual performance of the methods is illustrated through experiments on a KUKA KR5 manipulator.
