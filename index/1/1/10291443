Fusing data from multiple sensors on-board a mobile platform can significantly augment its state estimation abilities and enable autonomous traversals of different domains by adapting to changing signal availabilities. However, due to the need for accurate calibration and initialization of the sensor ensemble as well as coping with erroneous measurements that are acquired at different rates with various delays, multi-sensor fusion still remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach for agile aerial vehicles that allows for measurement validation and seamless switching between sensors based on statistical signal quality analysis. Moreover, it is capable of self-initialization of its extrinsic sensor states. These initialized states are maintained in the framework such that the system can continuously self-calibrate. We implement this framework on-board a small aerial vehicle and demonstrate the effectiveness of the above capabilities on real data. As an example, we fuse GPS data, ultra-wideband (UWB) range measurements, visual pose estimates, and IMU data. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is able to seamlessly filter and switch between different sensors modalities during run time.
