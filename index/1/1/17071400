In this paper, we present a new gridless three layer channel router (MISER) based on an integrated approach to routing and compaction. MISER partitions the input net-list into several sub net-lists called levels and forms a level graph. This level graph is used to guide the routing and compaction process. Compaction is done immediately after each level is routed. Experimental results show that our algorithm usually performs 5-10% better than existing three layer channel routing algorithms.
