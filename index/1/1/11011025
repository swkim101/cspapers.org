In this poster, we present a model of the flow of information among bioinformatics resources in the context of a specific scientific problem. Combining task analysis with traditional, qualitative research, we determined the extent to which the bioinformatics analysis process could be automated. The model represents a semi-automated process, involving fourteen distinct data processing steps, and forms the framework for an interface to bioinformatics information.
