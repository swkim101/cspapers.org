Communication complexity has become a central complexity model. In that model, we count the amount of communication bits needed between two parties in order to solve certain computational problems. We show that for certain communication complexity problems quantum communication protocols are exponentially faster than classical ones. More explicitly, we give an example for a communication complexity relation (or promise problem) P such that:
