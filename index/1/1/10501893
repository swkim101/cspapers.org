Welcome to the 29th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS), June 8-11, 2015 at Newport Beach, CA. ICS is well known as the premier technical forum where researchers present their latest results and share with colleagues their perspectives on the state-of-the-art in the field of high-performance computing systems. ICS 2015 continues the strong tradition of excellent technical presentations, motivating keynote addresses, and a few carefully selected workshops and tutorials. This year the conference is held in the beautiful city of Newport Beach, CA, which offers ten miles of extraordinary fishing, swimming, surfing, and aquatic sports activities. Newport Beach is an intimate seaside oasis that will tempt you with its elegance, modern shopping and stunning residential landscape. We welcome you to ICS 2015, and hope that you will be able to stay over and enjoy what the city offers. 
 
This year's program contains 40 technical papers. We would like to thank the authors of the 160 paper submissions from 27 countries, and regret that we could not accept more papers. We also want to thank the 50 members of the program committee for their hard work in producing nearly 500 paper reviews, deliberating through the review rebuttal process, and participating in a program committee meeting held at Houston, TX that resulted in the selection of this excellent set of papers. 
 
This volume represents some of the most exciting current research in high-performance computing, including big data and large-scale systems, heterogeneous systems, GPU optimizations, algorithms and applications, green computing, emerging technologies, and much more. We are fortunate to have three visionary keynote speakers this year, and the abstracts for their talks are also included in this volume.
