We propose a new I/O architecture for MPP systems that is based on coherent distributed shared-memory architecture and dedicated I/O networks. This architecture is for fulfilling fundamental requirements for MPP I/O subsystems, i.e., (1) scalability, (2) flexibility, (3) availability and (4) protection. The proposed I/O architecture is implemented in a massively parallel computer JUMP-l. JUMP-l has a scalable disk l/O subsystem which consists of several I/O units connected via fast serial links called Serial â€˜lkansparent Asynchronous First-in First-out Link (STAFF-Link). We evaluate the parallel I/O performance of the JUMP-l via simulation.
