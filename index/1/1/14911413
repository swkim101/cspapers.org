In this study, we propose a leg-robot with a Compact MR Fluid Clutch (CMRFC) to realize haptic control of abnormal spastic movements of brain-injured patients. This system can be used in the practical training for trainees of physical therapy. Additionally, we will study to figure out the physiological mechanism of spastic movements of human with the process to simulate patient-like spastic motion by this robot. In this paper, basic structure and mechanism of the leg-robot with CMRFC are explained. Finally, experimental results of some kinds of haptic control for spastic movements are described.
