This paper presents a technique for modeling and analyzing the performance of software for an MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data) computer. The models can be used as an alternative to experimentation for the evaluation of various algorithms and different degrees of parallelism. They can also be used to study the tradeoffs involved in increasing the amount of parallel computation at the expense of increased overhead for synchronization and communication. The detection and alleviation of performance bottlenecks is facilitated.
