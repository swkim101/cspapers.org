 
 We propose VecLP, a novel Internet Video recommendation system working for Live TV Programs in this paper. Given little information on the live TV programs, our proposed VecLP system can effectively collect necessary information on both the programs and the subscribers as well as a large volume of related online videos, and then recommend the relevant Internet videos to the subscribers. For that, the key frames are firstly detected from the live TV programs, and then visual and textual features are extracted from these frames to enhance the understanding of the TV broadcasts. Furthermore, by utilizing the subscribers' profiles and their social relationships, a user preference model is constructed, which greatly improves the diversity of the recommendations in our system. The subscriber's browsing history is also recorded and used to make a further personalized recommendation. This work also illustrates how our proposed VecLP system makes it happen. Finally, we dispose some sort of new recommendation strategies in use at the system to meet special needs from diverse live TV programs and throw light upon how to fuse these strategies.
