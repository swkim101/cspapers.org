This paper describes a novel probabilistic approach to incorporating odometric information into appearance-based SLAM systems, without performing metric map construction or calculating relative feature geometry. The proposed system, dubbed Continuous Appearance-based Trajectory SLAM (CAT-SLAM), represents location as a probability distribution along a trajectory, and represents appearance continuously over the trajectory rather than at discrete locations. The distribution is evaluated using a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter, which weights particles based on local appearance and odometric similarity and explicitly models both the likelihood of revisiting previous locations and visiting new locations. A modified resampling scheme counters particle deprivation and allows loop closure updates to be performed in constant time regardless of map size. We compare the performance of CAT-SLAM to FAB-MAP (an appearance-only SLAM algorithm) in an outdoor environment, demonstrating a threefold increase in the number of correct loop closures detected by CAT-SLAM.
