The input gait motion data is normalized and re-scaled and then fed to the reservoir neurons. A reservoir of 200 sigmoid units randomly connected with a given connectivity and normalized by a given spectral radius is used to represent and process the input data. Two output sigmoid units gather the data from the reservoir units only (no direct input connection). No feedback connections link the output units to the reservoir.
