The BEA WebLogic Platform product suite consists of WebLogic Server, WebLogic Workshop, WebLogic Integration, WebLogic Portal, and Liquid Data for WebLogic. W3C standards including XML, XML Schema, and the emerging XML query language XQuery play important roles in several of these products. This industrial presentation will discuss the increasingly central role of XML in the middle tier of enterprise IT architectures and cover some of the key XML technologies that the BEA WebLogic Platform provides for creating enterprise applications in today's IT world. We focus in particular on how XQuery fits into this picture, both for today's WebLogic Platform 8.1 and going forward in terms of the Platform roadmap.
