The Department of Defense has a comprehensive program of coordinated R & D initiatives to improve software engineering tools and methods. One thrust of the program is to automate significant aspects of the software development and maintenance process. Another thrust is to increase the availability of software tools and to institutionalize the exchange of the best tools and techniques throughout DoD.
