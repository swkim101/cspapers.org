Wall-climbing robot research is increasingly popular for cleaning, painting, and repairing high-rise buildings. In this study, a compliant wall-climbing robotic platform for various curvatures is presented. In order to adapt to flat and curved surfaces with a single configuration, the robotic platform uses a compliance mechanism with eight legs. A parallel four-bar linkage connects the inner frame to the outer frame, and walking locomotion is achieved by an another four-bar linkage with a single DC motor. The robot's footpads use a dry adhesive system, and the robot is small and lightweight. Experimental results reveal that the robotic platform can climb on various curved surfaces with a radius of curvature between 50 mm and infinity in the vertical direction. The platform could be used for cleaning high-rise buildings and solar panels with different curvature.
