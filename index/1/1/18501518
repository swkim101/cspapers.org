The Hidden Information State (HIS) Dialogue System is the first trainable and scalable implementation of a spoken dialog system based on the Partially-Observable Markov-Decision-Process (POMDP) model of dialogue. The system responds to n-best output from the speech recogniser, maintains multiple concurrent dialogue state hypotheses, and provides a visual display showing how competing hypotheses are ranked. The demo is a prototype application for the Tourist Information Domain and achieved a task completion rate of over 90% in a recent user study.
