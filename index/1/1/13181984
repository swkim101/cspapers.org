Collaborative group exams, including two-stage exams, have received increased attention in other disciplines after studies have shown their value for student learning. In computer science, prior work has shown students may value two-stage exams, but their impact on student learning in computing is unknown. In this randomized, crossover study, student learning on four topics during two-stage midterm exams is examined. Specifically, students are randomly selected to answer questions on a topic either working in groups or individually during the exam. On a quiz two weeks later, those who worked in groups statistically significantly outperform those who worked individually. The metric of performance comparison is normalized learning gain. These are short term gains, however, as the benefit is no longer apparent by the final exam. This is the first study to use controlled experiments to examine the value of the group stage of two-stage exams in computing.
