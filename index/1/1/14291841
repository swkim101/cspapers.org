Faced with growing knowledge management needs, enterprises are increasingly realizing the importance of seamlessly integrating critical business information distributed across both structured and unstructured data sources. In existing information integration solutions, the application needs to formulate the SQL logic to retrieve the needed structured data on one hand, and identify a set of keywords to retrieve the related unstructured data on the other. This paper proposes a novel approach wherein the application specifies its information needs using only a SQL query on the structured data, and this query is automatically ``translated'' into a set of keywords that can be used to retrieve relevant unstructured data. We describe the techniques used for obtaining these keywords from (i) the query result, and (ii) additional related information in the underlying database. We further show that these techniques achieve high accuracy with very reasonable overheads.
