TheWEBSOM is a method developed originally at Helsinki University of Technology for analyzing and visualizing large document collections [1, 4]. In the WEBSOM method, the self-organizing map algorithm [3] is used to automatically organize collections of documents on a map to enable easy exploration and search of the collection. Map regions that are close to each other contain similar documents. The main objectives in developing the WEBSOM method has been to o er a method for exploring text collections that is di erent from the queryresult approach, enabling the user to get an overall view to the document collection. Moreover, there are no principled limits on the type of text material that the method can handle.
