In this paper we study the complexity of the Linear Ranking problem: given a loop, described by linear constraints over a finite set of integer variables, is there a linear ranking function for this loop? While existence of such a function implies termination, this problem is not equivalent to termination. When the variables range over the rationals or reals, the Linear Ranking problem is known to be PTIME decidable. However, when they range over the integers, whether for single-path or multipath loops, the complexity of the Linear Ranking problem has not yet been determined. We show that it is coNP-complete. However, we point out some special cases of importance of PTIME complexity. We also present complete algorithms for synthesizing linear ranking functions, both for the general case and the special PTIME cases.
