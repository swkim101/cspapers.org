In Distributed Control Systems (DCS) the distribution of sensor data needs to be optimized in order to reduce the client process redundancy, i.e.: same sensor data processing in different clients. This paper presents an implementation of Embedded Networked Sensors as Smart Resources that allows to access to high-level information abstracting the user from low level mechanisms. The distributed services provided by Smart Resources implement self-aware adaptation mechanisms in order to suit the performance to the context. Information integrity must be also ensured during this adaptation. The Smart Resource implementation is based on a RGBD sensor. Through a set of experiments is evaluated the performance of the reconfiguration and adaptation mechanisms and detailed the influence of the data integrity according to the provided service.
