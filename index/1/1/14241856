In this paper, we deal with the stability and tracking control problem of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of the modeling error and disturbance uncertainty. The flight tracking control system combines classical proportional-derivative (PD) like term with robust and adaptive control term. Lyapunov method is used to design and show the asymptotic behavior of the linear and angular states of the vehicle. In contrast with other existing adaptive backstepping design, the proposed design is very simple and easy to implement as it does not require multiple design steps without using augmented signals and known bound of the uncertainty. Various experimental results on quadrotor UAV system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design for real-time application.
