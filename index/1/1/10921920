Today many large systems exist which have had many designers, have been patched up over the years, were designed for a different type of user than current users, and were once (but no longer) state of the art. The Deep Space Network at Jet Propulsion Laboratory is such a system. In Australia, Spain, and California, operators of the system use inflexible, incompatible routines to route data to Pasadena. Worker motivation and accuracy have to remain high for the system to work. In an attempt to develop redesign guidelines, users were queried regarding their attitudes and difficulties with the system. Interface alternatives were isolated and incorporated into a prototype for assessing the impact of the alternatives on user behavior. The resulting guidelines form a user-oriented, experience-based basis for continuing system evolution.
