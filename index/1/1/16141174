In this paper we discuss how the Vector Space Model of Information Retrieval can be used in a new way by combining connectionist ideas about distributed representations with the concept of propositional structure (semantic case structure) derived from mainstream Natural Language Understanding research. We show how distributed representations may be used to capture both amorphous concept representations and propositional structures and we discuss a prototype Information Retrieval system, PELICAN, which has been constructed in order to experiment with these ideaa.
