We have built a multidatabase system to support a financial application that stores historical data used by traders to identify trends in the market. The application has an update rate (append-only) of 500 inserts per second and also has sub-second response requirements for queries. A typical query requests between 100-1000 records. In this paper we define the characteristics of the application, the multidatabase system we used to support the applications and the extensions we made in t.he application to achieve the required functionality and performance.
