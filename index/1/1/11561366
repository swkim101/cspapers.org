In this work we present a novel technique to rescore fragments in the Data-Oriented Translation model based on their contribution to translation accuracy. We describe three new rescoring methods, and present the initial results of a pilot experiment on a small subset of the Europarl corpus. This work is a proof-of-concept, and is the first step in directly optimizing translation decisions solely on the hypothesized accuracy of potential translations resulting from those decisions.
