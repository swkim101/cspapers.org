Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are modeling languages that are customized for a specific context or project. DSLs allow for fast and precise modeling because the language features and constructs can be precisely tailored based on the needs of the modeling effort. There exist highly customizable model-editing tools that can be easily configured to support DSLs defined by end-users (e.g., system architects, engineers, and analysts). However, to leverage models created using these tools for automated analysis, simulation, and code generation, end-users must build custom analysis tools and code generators. In contrast to model editors, the implementation and maintenance of these analysis and code generation tools can be tedious and hampers the utility of DSLs. In this paper, we posit that analysis and code generation tools for DSLs are, in fact, isomorphic to model editing tools. The implication of this insight is that model editors, analysis tools, and code generators can be treated as analogs conceptually and architecturally, and highly customizable analysis and code generation tools for DSLs can be built using the same approach that has already proven successful for the construction of DSL model editors.
