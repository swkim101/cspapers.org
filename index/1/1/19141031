The organization of computer science education as an interdisciplinary program is described. First, various possible relationships among disciplines are traced, and the features of interdisciplinarity are explained. Next, a specific interdisciplinary program in computer science is introduced, including experiences with the administration and operation of the program. An appraisal of the interdisciplinary approach to computer science education follows. The advantages are significant: a lower cost program, a more adaptive program, and one that is better able to treat the interfaces of computer science with other areas. Such a favorable report suggests that the interdisciplinary approach merits consideration, especially by colleges which want to offer a computer science degree but have limited funds.
