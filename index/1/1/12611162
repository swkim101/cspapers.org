This paper deals with the development of a vision-based controller for robot-assisted medical applications. It concerns the use of shearlet coefficients in case of ultrasounds (US) images as visual signal inputs and the design of the associated interaction matrix. The proposed controller was validated in both simulation and on an experimental test bench which consists of a robotic arm holding an US probe in contact with a realistic abdominal phantom. Also, the proposed control scheme was compared to the photometry-based visual servoing approach in order to evaluate its efficiency in different conditions of use (nominal and unfavorable conditions).
