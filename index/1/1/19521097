1 Background Montana State University (MSU) was required to change from quarters to semesters beginning in autumn 1991. The Computer Science Department took the opportunity to completely revise the introductory course sequence required of all majors and minors. It had been felt for some time that a more integrated curriculum was necessary, one that would weave important subject areas â€”such as discrete math, data structures, and algorithms-into a cohesive unit. It had also been recognized that a breadth-first approach that introduced students to the major subject areas of the discipline (e.g., compilers, data bases, operating systems, etc.) would be superior to the existing curriculum. Strong encouragement for such change appeared in two widely-referenced reports published during this period. " Computing as a Discipline " (often called the " Denning Report ") [Denning et al. 1989], and Computing Curricula 1991 [Tucker 1991]. The " breadth-first " models proposed there greatly influenced the design of our new curriculum. The brevity of the required format for this paper makes a detailed discussion of the new curriculum impossible.
