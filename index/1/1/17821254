In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling the connectivity of a network of mobile agents under local topology constraints and proximity-limited communication. The inverse iteration algorithm for spectral analysis is formulated in a distributed manner to allow each agent to estimate a component of global network connectivity, improving on the convergence rate issues of previous approaches. Potential-based controls drive the agents to maximize connectivity under local degree constraints, maintain established links to guarantee connectivity, and avoid collisions. To achieve constraint satisfaction we exploit a switched model of interaction that regulates link addition through symmetric, repulsive potentials between constraint violators, enforcing discernment in communication through spatial organization. Simulations of connectivity estimation as well as agent aggregation and leader-following applications demonstrate the ability of our proposed methods to generate connectivity maximizing, constraint-aware self organization.
