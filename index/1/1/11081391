The design of software is a complex process requiring the software designer to simultaneously perform a variety of activities. These include the exploration and analysis of design alternatives, the consideration and reuse of previous solutions, the management of design goals, dependencies, and partial solutions, and the recording of design decisions. Very few software development environments provide all these aspects of design support. The IDeA system is a prototypical design environment that was developed to demonstrate that a single environment could integrate many different support aspects. The objective of such an environment is to relieve the designer from the more mundane and mechanical aspects of design, and thus permit him to devote his energies to the more difficult and intel- lectually challenging aspects of design. This paper describes the IDeA environment and the aspects of design support that it provides.
