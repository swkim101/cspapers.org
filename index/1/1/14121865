A new special purpose processor, named MN8614, has been developed for the high speed execution of binary image transformations. The processor carrys out the processing based on a new extension of the DDA algorithm to reduce the number of multiplications required for image processing. In addition, a machine instruction set has been developed which makes optimal use of the new method. The processor is fabricated on a single LSI chip with 16-bit data paths. Although the basic chip design is the same as that used in the construction of a general purpose microprocessor, the processing speed of MN8614 proves to be more than 30 times faster.
