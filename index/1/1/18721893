Algebraic access graphs model the logical connectivity of database implementations. They supercede the string model of DIAM, eliminating the typed string concept and replacing it with digraphs disciplined by relational algebra. Navigations over algebraic access graphs are well defined, and it is possible to compute the information resolved by a navigation in the form of a relational algebraic expression.
