In this paper we introduce the language Golog+HTNTI for specifying control using procedural and HTN-based constructs together with deadlines and time restrictions. Our language starts with features from GOLOG and HTN and extends them so that we can deal with actions with duration by being able to specify time intervals between the start (or end) of an action (or a program) and the start (or end) of another action (or program). We then discuss an off-line interpreter based on the answer set planning paradigm such that the answer sets of the logic program have a one to one correspondence with the traces of the Golog+HTNTI specification.
