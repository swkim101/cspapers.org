This challenge focuses on the use of semantic representation methods to support Visual Question Answering: given a large image collection, find a set of images matching natural language queries. The task supports advancing the state-of-the-art in Visual Question Answering by focusing on methods which explore the interplay between contemporary machine learning techniques, semantic representation and reasoning mechanisms.
