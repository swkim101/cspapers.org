Light field depth estimation is an essential part of many light field applications. Numerous algorithms have been developed using various light field characteristics. However, conventional methods fail when handling noisy scene with occlusion. To remedy this problem, we present a light field depth estimation method which is more robust to occlusion and less sensitive to noise. Novel data costs using angular entropy metric and adaptive defocus response are introduced. Integration of both data costs improves the occlusion and noise invariant capability significantly. Cost volume filtering and graph cut optimization are utilized to improve the accuracy of the depth map. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is robust and achieves high quality depth maps in various scenes. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art light field depth estimation methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluation.
