This paper focuses on a kinematic redundancy resolution of bimanual robotic system for a machining task as a part of factory automation. Inspired by a study of human bimanual action, called Guiard's principles, a cost function is proposed by using task-compatibility indices. An acceleration-level redundancy resolution is provided via optimization of the cost function in order to reflect the role of human arm movement: one arm performs coarse motion, and the other fine motion. A dynamic simulation with two 6 degrees-of-freedom robots shows the effectiveness of the proposed idea.
