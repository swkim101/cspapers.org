We study the video recommendation problem based on a large amount of user viewing logs instead of explicit ratings. As viewing records are implicitly suggest user preferences, existing matrix factorization methods fail to generate discriminative recommendations based on such one-class positive samples. We propose a scalable approach called separating-plane matrix factorization (SPMF) to make effective recommendations based on positive implicit feedback, with a learning complexity that is comparable to traditional matrix factorization. With extensive offline evaluation in Tencent Data Warehouse (TDW) based on a large amount of data, we show that our approach outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods. We also deployed our system in the QQ Browser App of Tencent and performed online A/B testing with real users. Results suggest that our approach increased the video click through rate by $23% over implicit-feedback collaborative filtering (IFCF), a scheme available in Apache Spark's MLlib.
