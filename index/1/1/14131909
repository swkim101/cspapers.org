We introduce a novel high-speed user-level communication and synchronization scheme \Memory-Based Communication Facilities (MBCF)" for a general-purpose system with an o(cid:11)-the-shelf communication-hardware. This mechanism is protected and virtualized as completely as memory so that it can be used not only in parallel systems but also in distributed systems. The MBCF realizes the direct remote-memory-accesses in user-task-spaces and o(cid:11)ers programmers and compilers a wide variety of functions and a large shared-memory space. In this paper we (cid:12)rst explain outlines and features of the MBCF, and present the high-speed implementation techniques for the MBCF. Then this paper describes varieties of the MBCF functions and introduces two novel memory-based mechanism: the Memory-Based FIFO and the Memory-Based Signal. Next we show that the MBCF is more (cid:13)exible and less expensive than the message-passing-style system-interfaces for communication or generalized active messages. Finally we show performance evaluations on the real MBCF implementation using 100BASE-TX Ethernet.
