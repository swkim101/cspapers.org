Needle insertion treatments require accurate placement of the needle tip into the target cancer. However, it is difficult to insert the needle accurately because of cancer displacement caused by organ deformation. Therefore, a path planning using numerical simulation to analyze the deformation of the organ is important for accurate needle insertion. The problem in developing a planning method is that puncture conditions, such as the force applied to the needle, is difficult to be decided deterministically, because the experimental data of puncture conditions have variations. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a novel planning method to decide the robust paths of straight needle insertion for various puncture points. The basic idea of this planning method is to consider the puncture condition probabilistic and to evaluate the expected value of needle placement accuracy. First, a probability-based puncture condition was introduced, and then the expected value of needle placement accuracy was defined. Next, the optimization method was developed to search the insertion path in a way that minimizes the expected values of needle placement accuracy. Then, a numerical simulation and evaluation of the planning method was conducted, using a liver-shaped 2D model. Furthermore, an in-vitro experiment was carried out to measure needle placement accuracy from the optimized path. Experimental results show that the planning method realizes needle insertion with a mean accuracy of 1.5 mm.
