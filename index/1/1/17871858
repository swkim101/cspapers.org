Named entity recognition (NER) systems trained on newswire perform very badly when tested on Twitter. Signals that were reliable in copy-edited text disappear almost entirely in Twitterâ€™s informal chatter, requiring the construction of specialized models. Using wellunderstood techniques, we set out to improve Twitter NER performance when given a small set of annotated training tweets. To leverage unlabeled tweets, we build Brown clusters and word vectors, enabling generalizations across distributionally similar words. To leverage annotated newswire data, we employ an importance weighting scheme. Taken all together, we establish a new state-of-the-art on two common test sets. Though it is wellknown that word representations are useful for NER, supporting experiments have thus far focused on newswire data. We emphasize the effectiveness of representations on Twitter NER, and demonstrate that their inclusion can improve performance by up to 20 F1.
