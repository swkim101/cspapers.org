This paper presents an electronic system that extracts the periodicity of a sound. It uses three analogue VLSI building blocks: a silicon cochlea, two inner-hair-cell circuits and two spiking neuron chips. The silicon cochlea consists of a cascade of filters. Because of the delay between two outputs from the silicon cochlea, spike trains created at these outputs are synchronous only for a narrow range of periodicities. In contrast to traditional bandpass filters, where an increase in selectivity has to be traded off against a decrease in response time, the proposed system responds quickly, independent of selectivity.
