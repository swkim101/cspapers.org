Existing pseudo-relevance feedback methods typically perform averaging over the top-retrieved documents, but ignore an important statistical dimension: the risk or variance associated with either the individual document models, or their combination. Treating the baseline feedback method as a black box, and the output feedback model as a random variable, we estimate a posterior distribution for the feed-back model by resampling a given query's top-retrieved documents, using the posterior mean or mode as the enhanced feedback model. We then perform model combination over several enhanced models, each based on a slightly modified query sampled from the original query. We find that resampling documents helps increase individual feedback model precision by removing noise terms, while sampling from the query improves robustness (worst-case performance) by emphasizing terms related to multiple query aspects. The result is a meta-feedback algorithm that is both more robust and more precise than the original strong baseline method.
