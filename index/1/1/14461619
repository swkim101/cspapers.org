One of the main technologies of cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization allows Virtual Machines (VMs) to share physical resources simultaneously resulting in higher utilization of hardware resources and lower infrastructure costs. With the proliferation of VMs, the importance of virtual switches (vSwitches) comes to the forefront. The concept of network virtualization is connecting VMs using virtual switches. The virtual switches are responsible for the packet switching between VMs. A virtual switch can be designed and implemented by software or hardware. In this paper, the virtual environment we implement is a Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and we connect the VMs with Open vSwitch. The purpose with factorial design is effective to discern the impact and the extent of system workload on the performance of applications running on the VMs. We also measure and analyze the performance and overhead of different virtual switch deployment topologies.
