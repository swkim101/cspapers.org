When the entire dataset is large, even if the amount of the data modification is fairly small, the computational cost for re-training the model would be prohibitively large. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called the optimal solution bounding (OSB), for monitoring such a data modification effect on the optimal model by efficiently evaluating (without actually re-training) it. The proposed method provides bounds on the unknown optimal model with the cost proportional only to the size of the data modification.
