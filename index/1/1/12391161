Described is an implemented system working from Design Automation logic files for testing very dense printed circuit boards with multi-pin TTL integrated circuit packages. Essential objectives sought were economy in test generation, ease and economy in diagnostics and a high degree of confidence in the tested boards. The objectives have been achieved by testing the assembled boards in small functional blocks using 1000 simultaneous probe contacts with the signal nets.
