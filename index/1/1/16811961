This paper describes a technique for maintaining data integrity that can be implemented using capabilities typically found in existing file systems. Integrity is a property of a total collection of data. It cannot be maintained simply by using reliable primitives for reading and writing single unitsâ€”the relations between the units are important also. The technique suggested in this paper ensures that data integrity will not be lost as a result of simultaneous access or as a result of crashes at inopportune times. The approach is attractive because of its relative simplicity and its modest demands on the underlying file system. The paper gives a detailed description of how consistent, atomic transactions can be implemented by client processes communicating with one or more file server computers. The discussion covers file structure, basic client operations, crash recovery, and includes an informal correctness proof.
