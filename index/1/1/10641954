This paper addresses the problem of spatio-temporal alignment of multiple video sequences. We identify and tackle a novel scenario of this problem referred to as Nonoverlapping Sequences (NOS). NOS are captured by multiple freely panning handheld cameras whose field of views (FOV) might have no direct spatial overlap. With the popularity of mobile sensors, NOS rise when multiple cooperative users capture a public event to create a panoramic video, or when consolidating multiple footages of an incident into a single video. To tackle this novel scenario, we first spatially align the sequences by reconstructing the background of each sequence and registering these backgrounds, even if the backgrounds are not overlapping. Given the spatial alignment, we temporally synchronize the sequences, such that the trajectories of moving objects (e.g., cars or pedestrians) are consistent across sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in this novel and challenging scenario, quantitatively and qualitatively.
