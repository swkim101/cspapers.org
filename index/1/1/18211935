This paper describes a concurrent process manager that has been developed for the Modula-2 programming language. Using this software, students can gain practical experience in designing and implementing concurrent programs using processes, semaphores, and message links. The use of abstraction in describing the process manager is advocated, and a variety of concurrent programming exercises are presented.
