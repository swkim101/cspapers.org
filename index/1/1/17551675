This paper defines the need for an Industrial Advisory Council for a Computer Science Department and describes how such a Council can benefit the Department in its construction and updating of curriculum, in faculty and student development, in its relationship with the college or university administration and in its work with industry recruiters and management. The paper gives the details of a working Industrial Advisory Council and explains how the Council has actually helped with the items listed above.
The Council described functioned for three years while the author was Head of the Department at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. The author now has a new position at Western Illinois University and the paper describes the formation of a new Council at that University.
