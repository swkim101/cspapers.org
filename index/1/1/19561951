Robotic lawn-mowers are required to stay within a predefined working area, otherwise they may drive into a pond or on the street. This turns navigation and path planning into safety critical components. If we consider using SLAM techniques in that context, we must be able to provide safety guarantees in the presence of sensor/actuator noise and featureless areas in the environment. In this paper, we tackle the problem of planning a path that maximizes robot safety while navigating inside the working area and under the constraints of limited computing resources and cheap sensors. Our approach uses a map of the environment to estimate localizability at all locations, and it uses these estimates to search for a path from start to goal in belief space using an extended heuristic search algorithm. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it on simulation data recorded on eight different gardens, as well as on a real robot. The experiments presented in this paper show that our approach leads to short computation times and short paths while maximizing robot safety under certain assumptions.
