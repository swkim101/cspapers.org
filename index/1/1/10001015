The use of Data Base Management Systems as a teaching tool in Data Management classes is described. Several alternate student-use DBMS are evaluated including GPLAN, IDBS, WAND, and DL/S. DL/S, developed at Temple University, is a limited subset of IMS designed for classroom use. However, the limitations do not prevent the student from learning how to interface with a DBMS during the implementation of a course project. An overview of the DL/S data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) is presented along with a discussion of its implementation and associated limitations.
