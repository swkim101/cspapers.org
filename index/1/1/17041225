This paper proposes a time-stamped cross-coupled control (TSCCC) algorithm to deal with the asynchronous sampling and network-induced delays in networked computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It uses time-stamps to estimate the network-induced delays from the sampling instants of different axes to the controller node. The network-induced delays are considered for accurately estimating the contour error in real-time. Furthermore, a networked CNC simulation system based on TrueTime toolbox is constructed, on which the proposed TSCCC algorithm is compared with the cross-coupled control (CCC) algorithm. Simulation results on two DC servomotors show that the TSCCC algorithm achieves better contour accuracy than the CCC algorithm.
