Images are a communication medium, hence objects of a linguistic nature having a form and a content. The form of an image is the image appearance and is understood as depicting a scene, the image content. The relationship between the form of an image and its content is established through a process of interpretation, capturing the meaning of the image form. Any information need on images can, and indeed has to, be seen as addressing either the image form, or its content, or the relationship between them. Consequently, any general, domain independent image retrieval facility should be based on a model supporting all these aspects of images. An image retrieval model, based on classical logic, is proposed which fulfllls this basic requirement.
