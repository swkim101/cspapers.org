This paper presents a new strategy for capturing a free floating satellite initially having angular momentum. The main focus is on the base attitude before, during and after the catch. We use a joint space orthogonal decomposition procedure involving the so-called reaction null space during the pre-impact and post-impact phases. The idea of preloading bias momentum in a space robot system is discussed. Furthermore, we show that if proper post impact control is utilized the base deviation can be minimized.
