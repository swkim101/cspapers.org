Three different types of classifiers were investigatedin the context of a text categorization problem in the medical domain: the automatic assignment of ICD9 codes to dictated inpatient discharge summaries. K-nearest-neighbor, relevance feedback, and Bayesian independence classifiers were applied individually and in combination. A coknbination of different classifiers produced better results than any single type of classifier. For this specific medical categorization problem, new query formulation and weighting meth-ods used in the k-nearest-neighbor classifier improved performance.
