We present a transmission power control scheme for RPL, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power lossy network [9], that controls the routing topology to achieve load balancing in a low-power multihop wireless network. We show that higher-than-required transmission power results in congestion and load balancing problems under heavy traffic, and transmission power cannot be optimized for reliable packet delivery when equal power is used by all nodes. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive and non-uniform transmission power controlled RPL, called PC-RPL, that significantly improves the end-to-end packet delivery performance compared to the standard RPL.
