In the visual cortex of the monkey the horizontal organization of the preferred orientations of orientation-selective cells follows two opposing rules: 1) neighbors tend to have similar orientation preferences, and 2) many different orientations are observed in a local region. Several orientation models which satisfy these constraints are found to differ in the spacing and the topological index of their singularities. Using the rate of orientation change as a measure, the models are compared to published experimental results.
