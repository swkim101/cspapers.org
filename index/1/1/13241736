In the Web, linked data is growing rapidly due to its potential to facilitate data retrieval and data integration. At the same time, relational database systems store a vast amount of data published on the Web. Current linked data in the Web is mainly read only. It allows for integration, navigation, and consultations in large structured datasets, but it still lacks a general concept for reading and writing. This paper proposes a specification, entitled Semantic Data Services (SDS), for RESTful Web services that provide data access. To provide linked data read-write capacity, SDS proposes a mechanism for integrity checking that is analogous to that used in relational databases. SDS implements the Semantic Restful Interface (SERIN) specification. SERIN uses annotations on classes in an ontology, describing the semantic web services that are available to manipulate data. This work extends SERIN specification adding annotations to allow the adoption of data access integrity constraints.
