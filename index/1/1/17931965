Because the user interface in a relatonal data base management system may be decoupled from the storage representation of data, novel, powerful and efficient integrity control schemes are possible. This paper indicates the mechanism being implemented in one relational system to prevent integrity violations which can result from improper updates by a process. Basically each interaction with the data is immediately modified at the query language level to one guaranteed to have no integrity violations. Also, a similar modification technique is indicated to support the use of "views," i.e. relations which are not physically present in the data base but are defined in terms of ones that are.
