Control education laboratories are an important issue for graduate/undergraduate students. ARTIST is designed to provide an efficient, remote and distributed control lab. By using Matlab and Simulink users can easily test their control algorithms on real plants through an Internet connection. Safety and performance of control experiments are guaranteed by using a real-time operating system and an appropriate supervisor algorithm automatically embedded in the user control laws. Budget constraints are satisfied by choosing open-source operating systems and standard low cost equipment
