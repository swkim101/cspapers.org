RTP (Real-Time Performers) is a software architecture capturing reflection mechanisms to support the dynamics of software real-time systems. Dynamics may comprise both behavioural and temporal issues. RTP relies on a strict separation of concerns between computational entities, alignment entities, and strategies activating both computational and alignments activities. This paper focuses on one of the features of RTP architecture: the dynamical change of components behaviour. The RTP component is based on a reflective framework supporting run-time changes inspired by the Strategy Pattern and state machine concepts.
