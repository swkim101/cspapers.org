This paper considers the suitability and efficiency of a highly parallel computer, the ICL Distributed Array Processor (DAP), for document clustering. Algorithms are described for the implementation of the single-pass and reallocation clustering methods on the DAP and on a conventional mainframe computer. These methods are used to classify the Cranfield, Vaswani and UKCIS document test collections. The results suggest that the parallel architecture of the DAP is not well suited to the variable-length records which characterise bibliographic data.
