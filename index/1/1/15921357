However, in many real-world scenarios, this assumption may not hold. As a result, the constructed feature mapping may not be precisely due to the bias issue of the correspondences in the target or (and) source domain(s). In this case, a classifier trained on the labeled transformed-source-domain data may not be useful for the target domain. In this paper, we present a new transfer learning framework called Hybrid Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (HHTL), which allows the corresponding instances across domains to be biased in either the source or target domain. Specifically, we propose a deep learning approach to learn a feature mapping between cross-domain heterogeneous features as well as a better feature representation for mapped data to reduce the bias issue caused by the cross-domain correspondences. Extensive experiments on several multilingual sentiment classification tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with some baseline methods.
