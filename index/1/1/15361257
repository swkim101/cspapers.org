This paper proposes a new method for occupancy map building using a mixture of Gaussian processes. We consider occupancy maps as a binary classification problem of positions being occupied or not, and apply Gaussian processes. Particularly, since the computational complexity of Gaussian processes grows as O(n3), where n is the number of data points, we divide the training data into small subsets and apply a mixture of Gaussian processes. The procedure of our map building method consists of three steps. First, we cluster acquired data by grouping laser hit points on the same line into the same cluster. Then, we build local occupancy maps by using Gaussian processes with clustered data. Finally, local occupancy maps are merged into one by using a mixture of Gaussian processes. Simulation results will be compared with previous researches and provided demonstrating the benefits of the approach.
