Besides usability, visual appearance also plays an important role in influencing users' attitudes towards the mobile shopping apps. This article presents a pilot study that explores users' and designers' preferences for mobile shopping app user interfaces (UIs). The study consisted of two phases. (1) Eliciting participants' perception of UIs similarity by sorting, using DISTATIS and cluster analysis, the UIs similarity perceptual space was identified. (2) Eliciting participants' overall preference by rating. The results identified three typical UIs and the distribution of ideal preference UIs for users and designers. Last, users and designers' differences in the UI preference were discussed.
