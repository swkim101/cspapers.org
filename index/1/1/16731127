This paper introduces a parallel global and detailed wire router for message passing parallel computers. A new cooperative relation between global and detailed routers is introduced to improve the successful routing ratio. The actual numbers of available tracks (capacity), which could be used to route the nets, are calculated during detailed routing to be used at global routing. 100 % successful routing ratio of MCM benchmarks has been obtained. This router consists of two phases with two different ways of grid assignment to decrease the communication cost. Each phase consists of cooperative global and detailed routing processes. The first phase is aimed for routing short nets using few messages. Remaining nets are routed in the second phase. In the first phase, we divide the routing area into square partitions and assign one partition to each processor. Then, we rotate these square partitions to route all short nets around the boundaries. In the second phase, the routing area is divided into slices, one or more slices are assigned to each processor. Dividing routing area into slices while routing long nets decreases the communication cost and increases the parallelism bet ween nets.
