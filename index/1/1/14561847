This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a Fault Detection, Identification and Recovery (FDIR) system intended for multi-UAV applications. The system exploits the information provided by internal position, attitude and visual sensors onboard the UAVs of the fleet for detecting faults in the measurements of the position and attitude sensors of any of the member vehicles. Considering the observations provided by two or more UAVs in a cooperative way, it is possible to identify the source of the fault, but also implement a Cooperative Virtual Sensor (CVS) which provides a redundant position and velocity estimation of the faulty UAV that can be used for replacing its internal sensor. The vision-based FDIR system has been validated experimentally with quadrotors in an indoor testbed. In particular, fault detection and identification has been evaluated injecting a fault pattern offline on the position measurements, while the CVS has been applied in real time for the recovery phase.
