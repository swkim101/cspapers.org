Support for temporal data continues to be a requirement posed by many applications. We show that a complex object data model is an appropriate means for handling temporal data. Firstly, we describe the main features of temporal databases in terms of time sequences, valid time, etc. We then explain the mapping of time sequences onto recursively structured complex objects. Operations on temporal data are easily transformed into complex object operations. To cope with the huge storage requirements arising from temporal databases, we integrate the concept of storing logical differences into our approach. Here, we exploit the extensibility of the underlying complex objectâ€™s database system PRIMA. Finally, we briefly sketch a further improvement to guarantee fast access to the present data by storing them apart from the historical data without loosing the connection between both.
