A Data Management System (DMS) for VLSI design is presented that supports hierarchical decomposition, multiple levels of abstraction, concurrency control and design evolution. Our contribution is original in that we employ semantic data modeling techniques to derive a simple, yet powerful, data schema that represents the logical organization of VLSI design data. The resulting DMS provides an open framework for the integration of design tools and relieves the designer of the burden of organizing his design data.
