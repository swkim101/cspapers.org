Optimization of the interaction distance between qubits to map a quantum circuit into one-dimensional quantum architectures is addressed. The problem is formulated as the Minimum Linear Arrangement (MinLA) problem. To achieve this, an interaction graph is constructed for a given circuit, and multiple instances of the MinLA problem for selected subcircuits of the initial circuit are formulated and solved. In addition, a lookahead technique is applied to improve the cost of the proposed solution which examines different subcircuit candidates. Experiments on quantum circuits for quantum Fourier transform and reversible benchmarks show the effectiveness of the approach.
