This paper presents an integrated intelligent control architecture for mobile robots consisting of an intelligent hybrid robot controller and sensor network with microprocessors, RF components, and a group of sensors, to perform a distributed sensing and information transmission using wireless links. In the proposed sensor network, though each sensor node has a limited capability and a simple signal-processing engine, a group of sensor nodes can perform a various tasks through coordinated information sharing and wireless communication in a large working area. Using the capability of network attached shared memory (NAEM), we show the effective sensor network model that can be applied to situation awareness and navigation of mobile robot in which the robot has to be coordinated effectively to perform given task in real time.
