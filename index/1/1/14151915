Automatic summarization of open domain spoken dialogues is a new research area. This paper introduces the task, the challenges involved, and presents an approach to obtain automatic extract summaries for multi-party dialogues of four different genres, without any restriction on domain. We address the following issues which are intrinsic to spoken dialogue summarization and typically can be ignored when summarizing written text such as newswire data: (i) detection and removal of speech disfluencies; (ii) detection and insertion of sentence boundaries; (iii) detection and linking of cross-speaker information units (question-answer pairs). A global system evaluation using a corpus of 23 relevance annotated dialogues containing 80 topical segments shows that for the two more informal genres, our summarization system using dialogue specific components significantly outperforms a baseline using TFIDF term weighting with maximum marginal relevance ranking (MMR).
