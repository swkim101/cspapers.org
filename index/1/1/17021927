The twin-rotor multiple input multiple output system (TRMS) developed by Feedback Instruments Limited [1] consists of two axes corresponding to yaw and pitch angles commonly found in an aerial vehicle. The system can be used as a generic platform for testing MIMO controllers. This paper presents a robust control approach to stabilize the TRMS in a desired posture based on the dynamic model provided by the manufacturer. It is well known that the model is too complex in structure to be used for controller design. In the robust control approach proposed in the paper, it is approximated by a simplified model and the approximation error is compensated by a sliding mode control. In addition, the effect of the quality of the system state feedback on the controller's performance is discussed and a way to improve it is implemented. Experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the approach.
