We present waveSense, a low power hand gestures recogni- tion system suitable for mobile and wearable devices. A novel Selective Volumetric Illumination (SVI) approach using off-the-shelf infrared (IR) emitters and non-focused IR sensors were introduced to achieve the power efficiency. Our current implementation consumes 8.65mW while sensing hand gestures within 60cm radius from the sensors. In this demo, we introduce the concept and the theoretical background of waveSense, details of the prototype implementation, and application possibilities.
