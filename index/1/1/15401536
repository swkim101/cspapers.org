The integration of generative and aspect-oriented techniques is not a trivial task. This paper describes our experience in the definition of an aspect-oriented generative approach for the context of multi-agent systems. Our generative approach is composed of: (i) a domain-specific language called Agent-DSL, which allows to model crosscutting and non-crosscuting agent features; (ii) an aspect-oriented architecture that models a family of software agents; and (iii) a code generator that maps abstractions of the Agent-DSL to specific compositions of objects and aspects in specific implementations of agent architectures. The use of aspect-oriented techniques in the definition of our generative approach brought benefits to the modeling and code generation of crosscutting features since early design stages.
