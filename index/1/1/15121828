The Experimental Polyprocessor System (EPOS) is described. It is a new computer system based on the concept of the polyprocessor and is intended to obtain a high degree of extensibility, cost/performance, adaptability and reliability. EPOS is composed of computing modules, input/output modules, and shared memory modules which are connected by multiple independent common buses. Modules and system buses can be added or deleted freely to provide a high degree of extensibility. The computing module is using a 7000-gate LSI computing element PULCE and provides extensive support for user and dynamic microprogramming. The input/output modules and the computing modules are connected equally to the system buses, and the same addressing mechanism is applied to them.
