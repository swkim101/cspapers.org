PAC is an interactive system for experimenting with scenarios of agents, where the agents are modelled as having both cognition and personality, as well as a physical realisation. The aim of the system is to provide an environment where scenarios can quickly and easily be built up, varying aspects of agent personality (or emotions) and agent cognition (plans and beliefs). This will allow us to experiment with different combinations of agents in different worlds. We can then investigate the effect of various parameters on emergent behaviour of the agent system.
