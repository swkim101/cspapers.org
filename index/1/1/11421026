Many of the security vulnerabilities common in today's software can be prevented with standard secure coding practices. Computer science students who will become the developers of that software need to learn about those practices so they can prevent such vulnerabilities. Many computing programs are addressing this need through additional lectures, elective courses, or more holistic approaches to integrate security across curriculums. We are exploring a complementary approach, integrating secure coding education into the IDE to provide a learning opportunity in the context of writing code. In this paper, we report on two field studies using an IDE tool in an advanced Web programming course. Our results indicate that the tool can increase students' awareness and knowledge of secure programming, but to be most effective, instructors may need to incentivize its use through in-class methods and careful timing of its introduction.
