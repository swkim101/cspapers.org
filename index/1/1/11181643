A variety of aspects of command names have been studied, such as suggestiveness, memorability, and the use of icons. A single framework for these disparate studies is desirable, and it is proposed that the concept of featural analysis prevalent in linguistics and psycholinguistics be adopted as an approach to command name design. Examples of the breadth of application of this approach are given for the naming issues of suggestiveness, learning and memory, congruence and hierarchicalness, universal commands, the relationships of names to the command language syntax, and the use of non-words as names.
