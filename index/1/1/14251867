In Constraint Programming, the recently introduced bi-objective Pareto constraint allows one to solve bi-objective combinatorial optimization problems exactly. Using this constraint, every non-dominated solution is collected in a single tree-search while pruning sub-trees that cannot lead to a non-dominated solution. This paper introduces a simpler and more efficient filtering algorithm for the bi-objective Pareto constraint. The efficiency of this algorithm is experimentally confirmed on classical bi-objective benchmarks.
