Word subject domains have been widely used to improve the performance of word sense disambiguation algorithms. However, comparatively little effort has been devoted so far to the disambiguation of word subject domains. The few existing approaches have focused on the development of algorithms specific to word domain disambiguation. In this paper we explore an alternative approach where word domain disambiguation is achieved via word sense disambiguation. Our study shows that this approach yields very strong results, suggesting that word domain disambiguation can be addressed in terms of word sense disambiguation with no need for special purpose algorithms.
