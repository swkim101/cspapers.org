A domain independent technique for generalizing a broad class of explanations is described. This method is compared and contrasted with other approaches to generalizing explanations, including an abstract version of the algorithm used in the STRIPS system and the EBG technique recently developed by Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli. We have tested this generalization technique on a number examples in different domains, and present detailed descriptions of several of these.
