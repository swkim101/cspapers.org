Battery management system has attracted mounting research attention recently, within which cell equalization plays a key role. Although many research and practices have been devoted to developing system-level structure of cell equalizers, there are still substantial opportunities for performance improvement yet to investigate. This paper proposes a novel architecture for battery cell equalization, referred to as modularized global equalizer. The mathematical model is developed to emulate the equalization dynamics by considering both charging/discharging and energy loss. Analytical formulas are derived to evaluate the performance of the global equalizer. The proposed method is also compared with the state-of-the-art structures in terms of equalization speed and energy loss.
