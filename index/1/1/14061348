Although symmetric ciphers may provide strong computational security, a key leakage makes the encrypted data vulnerable. In a distributed storage environment, reinforcement of data protection consists of dispersing data over multiple servers in a way that no information can be obtained from data fragments until a defined threshold of them has been collected. A secure fragmentation is usually enabled by secret sharing, information dispersal algorithms or data shredding. However, these solutions suffer from various limitations, like additional storage requirement or performance burden. This poster presents a novel flexible keyless fragmentation scheme, balancing memory use and performance with security. It could be applied in many different contexts, such as dispersal of outsourced data over one or multiple clouds or in resource-restrained environments like sensor networks. The scheme has been implemented in JAVA and Matlab. Preliminary analysis shows good performance and data protection.
