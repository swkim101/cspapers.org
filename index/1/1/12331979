This paper presents noisy-channel based Korean preprocessor system, which corrects word spacing and typographical errors. The proposed algorithm corrects both errors simultaneously. Using Eojeol transition pattern dictionary and statistical data such as Eumjeol n-gram and Jaso transition probabilities, the algorithm minimizes the usage of huge word dictionaries.
