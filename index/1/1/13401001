TPC Benchmarkâ„¢ C (TPC-C) is the modern standard for measuring OLTP performance. Running TPC-C, Tandem demonstrated a massively parallel configuration of 112 CPUs which achieved ten times higher performance than any other system previously measured (and today is still better by a factor of five). This result qualifies as the largest industry-standard benchmark ever run.This paper briefly describes how the benchmark was configured and the results which were obtained.
