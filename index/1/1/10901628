The dynamic nature of JavaScript web applications has given rise to the possibility of privacy violating information flows. We present an empirical study of the prevalence of such flows on a large number of popular websites. We have (1) designed an expressive, fine-grained information flow policy language that allows us to specify and detect different kinds of privacy-violating flows in JavaScript code,(2) implemented a new rewriting-based JavaScript information flow engine within the Chrome browser, and (3) used the enhanced browser to conduct a large-scale empirical study over the Alexa global top 50,000 websites of four privacy-violating flows: cookie stealing, location hijacking, history sniffing, and behavior tracking. Our survey shows that several popular sites, including Alexa global top-100 sites, use privacy-violating flows to exfiltrate information about users' browsing behavior. Our findings show that steps must be taken to mitigate the privacy threat from covert flows in browsers.
