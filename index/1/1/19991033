THE LABORATORY The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (I-ICIL) was established in 1984 at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, TX, to: • Perform applied research examining user interaction with complex computer systems; • Apply the results of this research to the design of spacecraft computer-based workstations and HCIs; and • Serve as a resource in the discipline of humancomputer interaction to support ongoing programs. The HCIL is one of five R&D laboratories within the Crew Interface Analysis Section of the Man-Systems Division in the Space & Life Sciences Directorate.
