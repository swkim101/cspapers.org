Question retrieval aims to increase the accessibility of the community Question Answer (cQA) archives and has attracted increasing research interests recently. In this paper, we present a novel method for improving the question retrieval performance by investigating the question term selection and weighting as well as reranking results. Different from previous work, we propose a hierarchical question classification method with a sparse regularization to mimc user's question labeling in cQAs. Based on the hierarchical classification, we explore the local context of the question for term selection and reranking results and then integrating them into our proposed general question retrieval framework. The experimental results on a Yahoo! Answers dataset show the effectiveness of our method as compared to existing general question retrieval models and some state-of-the-art methods of utilizing category information for question retrieval.
