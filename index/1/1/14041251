This paper analyzes the trade-offs in architecting stacked DRAM either as part of main memory or as a hardware-managed cache. Using stacked DRAM as part of main memory increases the effective capacity, but obtaining high performance from such a system requires Operating System (OS) support to migrate data at a page-granularity. Using stacked DRAM as a hardware cache has the advantages of being transparent to the OS and perform data management at a line-granularity but suffers from reduced main memory capacity. This is because the stacked DRAM cache is not part of the memory address space. Ideally, we want the stacked DRAM to contribute towards capacity of main memory, and still maintain the hardware-based fine-granularity of a cache. We propose CAMEO, a hardware-based Cache-like Memory Organization that not only makes stacked DRAM visible as part of the memory address space but also exploits data locality on a fine-grained basis. CAMEO retains recently accessed data lines in stacked DRAM and swaps out the victim line to off chip memory. Since CAMEO can change the physical location of a line dynamically, we propose a low overhead Line Location Table (LLT) that tracks the physical location of all data lines. We also propose an accurate Line Location Predictor (LLP) to avoid the serialization of the LLT look-up and memory access. We evaluate a system that has 4GB stacked memory and 12GB off-chip memory. Using stacked DRAM as a cache improves performance by 50%, using as part of main memory improves performance by 33%, whereas CAMEO improves performance by 78%. Our proposed design is very close to an idealized memory system that uses the 4GB stacked DRAM as a hardware-managed cache and also increases the main memory capacity by an additional 4GB.
