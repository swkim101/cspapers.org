First-order logic (FO) over words is shown to be equiexpressive with FO equipped with a restricted set of numerical predicates, namely the order, a binary predicate MSB<inf>0</inf>, and the finite-degree predicates: FO[A<inf>RB</inf>] = FO[≤, MSB<inf>0</inf>, F<inf>IN</inf>]. The Crane Beach Property (CBP), introduced more than a decade ago, is true of a logic if all the expressible languages admitting a neutral letter are regular. Although it is known that FO[A<inf>RB</inf>] does not have the CBP, it is shown here that the (strong form of the) CBP holds for both FO[≤, F<inf>IN</inf>] and FO[≤, MSB<inf>0</inf>]. Thus FO[≤, F<inf>IN</inf>] exhibits a form of locality and the CBP, and can still express a wide variety of languages, while being one simple predicate away from the expressive power of FO[A<inf>RB</inf>]. The counting ability of FO[≤, F<inf>IN</inf>] is studied as an application.
