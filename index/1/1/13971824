We present the first results of a project called LOOP, on formal methods for the object-oriented language Java. It aims at verification of program properties, with support of modern tools. We use our own front-end tool (which is still partly under construction) for translating Java classes into higher order logic, and a back-end theorem prover (namely PVS, developed at SRI) for reasoning. In several examples we demonstrate how non-trivial properties of Java programs and classes can be proven following this two-step approach.
