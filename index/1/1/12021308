Based on spatiotemporal properties of neighborhood and mobile properties of nodes in the networks, we propose Selective Reference Mechanism to trade off between the delay and overhead of neighbor discovery in low-duty-cycle WSNs. Extensive simulation and test-bed experiment confirm our theoretical analysis, showing as much as 35.4% increase in discovery probability, 38.6% reduction in discovery delay and 27.7% reduction in total energy consumption.
