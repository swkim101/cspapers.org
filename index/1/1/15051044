A electrolytic method and its associated apparatus for in situ recovery of coal products. With this method, the recoverable coal is in physical contact with a series of two or more positive electrodes while it is isolated from a single negative electrode by an electrolytic solution. The negative electrode and positive electrode are in boreholes which are drilled and are configured in the earth such that the positive electrodes may surround the single negative electrode. An electrolyte is placed in the center borehole with the negative electrode inserted in the liquid but insulated and positioned so as not to touch the coal in the side of the borehole. All of the positive electrodes in the adjacent boreholes are serially electrically connected to each other and to the positive terminal of an electrical potential difference source. The negative electrode is connected to the negative terminal of the same power source to initiate an electrolytic reaction in the coal-bearing earth. Coal products formed by this reaction may be periodically or continuously recovered and the extracted electrolyte replaced by a fresh electrolyte.
