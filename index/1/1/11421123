Advanced and effective collaborative filtering methods based on explicit feedback assume that unknown ratings do not follow the same model as the observed ones not missing at random). In this work, we build on this assumption, and introduce a novel dynamic matrix factorization framework that allows to set an explicit prior on unknown values. When new ratings, users, or items enter the system, we can update the factorization in time independent of the size of data (number of users, items and ratings). Hence, we can quickly recommend items even to very recent users. We test our methods on three large datasets, including two very sparse ones, in static and dynamic conditions. In each case, we outrank state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods that do not use a prior on unknown ratings.
