An interference cancellation algorithm (ICA) for both Fourier- and wavelet-based OFDM is proposed. In this study we investigated both an ideal case as well as a non-ideal case of our system. In the ideal case we assume the reference signal is an unwanted sinusoidal signal (the input to our ICA algorithm). In the non-ideal case, we assume the received OFDM signal is contaminated with sinusoidal interference. Simulation results performed at a SNR of 5dB resulted in an error measurement of 0.01812 for wavelet-OFDM and an error of approximately 0.03277 for Fourier-OFDM for the ideal case and for the non-ideal case an error of 0.01817 was measured for wavelet-based OFDM and 0.03167 for Fourier-based OFDM. This indicates that the proposed ICA exhibits outstanding performance since the results obtained in both cases are almost the same. The wavelet-based OFDM outperformed the Fourier-based OFDM in both cases.
