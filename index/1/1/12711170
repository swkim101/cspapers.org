Logic programming is a mathematical formalism capable of expressing certain classes of problems in a non-procedural manner. Furthermore, logic programs do not presuppose a von Neumann computer architecture and are therefore inherently well suited to parallel computations. In this paper we consider a data-driven model for interpreting logic programs and investigate the architectural requirements necessary to support its implementation. It will be shown that the model is capable of exploiting the capabilities of highly-parallel dataflow architectures.
