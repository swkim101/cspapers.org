Progress has been made in computational implementation of speech production based on physiological data. An inverse dynamics model of the speech articulator's musculo-skeletal system, which is the mapping from articulator trajectories to electromyographic (EMG) signals, was modeled using the acquired forward dynamics model and temporal (smoothness of EMG activation) and range constraints. This inverse dynamics model allows the use of a faster speech motor control scheme, which can be applied to phoneme-to-speech synthesis via musclo-skeletal system dynamics, or to future use in speech recognition. The forward acoustic model, which is the mapping from articulator trajectories to the acoustic parameters, was improved by adding velocity and voicing information inputs to distinguish acoustic parameter differences caused by changes in source characteristics.
