Context-aware services, especially when made available 
to mobile devices, constitute an interesting but very challenging 
domain. It poses fundamental problems for both 
requirements engineering, software architecture, and their 
relationship. We propose a novel, reflection-based framework 
for requirements engineering for this class of applications. 
The framework addresses the key difficulties in this 
field, such as changing context and changing requirements. 
We report preliminary work on this framework and suggest 
future directions.
