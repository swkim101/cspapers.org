Capacitive touch screens are widely used in various products. Touch screens have an advantage that an input system and output system can be integrated into a single module. We consider this advantage could make it possible to realize a new universal interface for both human-to-machine (H2M) and machine-to-machine (M2M). For a M2M interface, some sort of method to simulate finger touching is needed. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to interact with a touch screen using two electrical approaches. Our proposal is effective in automating touch screen operations, modality conversion device for people with disabilities, and so on. We assembled a prototype to confirm the principle to control a touch screen with the electrical methods. We believe that our proposal will complement the weakness of touch screens and expand their possibility.
