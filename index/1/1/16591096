The benefits of general-purpose local networks are discussed and the requirements that such networks need to satisfy are defined. A generic network architectural model is described and the major design parameters identified. The role of the local network is to provide network transparency for a multiplicity of computer devices. How well this role is performed is a function of the protocol design and implementation.
 MITRE's Cablenet is one of several experimental cable-bus networks employing coaxial cable as a shared wideband transmission medium, and using microprocessor based interface units. This paper presents a protocol architecture design based on local network characteristics and the extensive computational capabilities expected from the next generation of microprocessors. We have designed a Flexible Transport Protocol which allows our cable-bus access node to assume a wide range of characteristics; these characteristics can be chosen judiciously to fulfil the needs of a wide spectrum of subscribers.
