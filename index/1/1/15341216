Residential Internet connections are susceptible to weather-caused outages: Lightning and wind cause local power failures, direct lightning strikes destroy equipment, and water in the atmosphere degrades satellite links. Outages caused by severe events such as fires and undersea cable cuts are often reported upon by operators and studied by researchers. In contrast, outages cause by ordinary weather are typically limited in scope, and because of their small scale, there has not been comparable effort to understand how weather affects everyday last-mile Internet connectivity. We design and deploy a measurement tool called ThunderPing that measures the connectivity of residential Inter- net hosts before, during, and after forecast periods of severe weather. ThunderPing uses weather alerts from the US National Weather Service to choose a set of residential host addresses to ping from several vantage points on the Internet. We then process this ping data to determine when hosts lose connectivity, completely or partially, and categorize whether these failures occur during periods of severe weather or when the skies are clear. In our preliminary results, we find that compared to clear weather, failures are four times as likely during thunderstorms and two times as likely during rain. We also find that the duration of weather induced outages is relatively small for a satellite provider we focused on.
