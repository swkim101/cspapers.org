This paper studies the routing dynamics of malicious networks. We characterize the routing behavior of malicious networks on both short and long timescales. We find that malicious networks more consistently advertise prefixes with short durations and long inter- arrival times; over longer timescales, we find that malicious ASes connect with more upstream providers than legitimate ASes, and they also change upstream providers more frequently.
