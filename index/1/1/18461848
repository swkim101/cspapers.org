The FPGA world recently experienced significant changes with the introduction of new Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) embedding high-end microprocessors and programmable logic on the same integrated circuit. The architecture of these SoCs can be exploited to offer an unprecedented level of monitoring of the memory accesses of running software components, a key element of performance, safety and security analysis. This paper presents the hardware / software implementation of such a memory tracing tool on one of these SoCs. It also proposes example applications in the security field and two attacks --- a pass-phrase retrieval and an access control bypass --- to demonstrate the power of hardware-assisted memory tracing.
