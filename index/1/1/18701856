Recent years have seen much growing attention on RFID security. However, little work has been performed to address the security issues in the context of supply chain management, which is exactly the major field for RFID applications. Existing RFID solutions cannot be applied directly in this field because of a set of special RFID security requirements to be addressed for supply chain management. The major contribution of this paper is to identify the unique set of security requirements in supply chains and to propose a practical design of RFID communication protocols that satisfy the security requirements.
