Experience has shown that a microkernel, a small operating system core which supports modular extensions, is flexible, efficient, and robust [1]. The microkernel structure is the central design element of next generation operating systems. Traditional undergraduate operating systems courses, however, do not discuss this design strategy in any depth (if at all). In this paper, we propose a submodule on microkernel technology and indicate how this information can be, and should be, included in an operating system course. We first give an overview of the fundamentals of microkernel design. We then argue why the study of microkernels ought to be included in an undergraduate operating system course. Finally, we present an organization of topics for the proposed course submodule on microkernel technology.
