Freebase is a large-scale open-world database where users collaboratively create and structure content over an open platform. Keyword queries over Freebase are notoriously ambiguous due to the size and the complexity of the dataset. To this end, novel techniques are required to enable naive users to express their informational needs and retrieve the desired data. FreeQ offers users an interactive interface for incremental query construction over a large-scale dataset, so that the users can find desired information quickly and accurately.
