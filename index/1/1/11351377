OSSIE is an open source SDR project created for education and research. When used as a teaching example, OSSIE provides lessons about open source and systems development. It is also an ideal platform for a variety of projects, from capstone studies to theses. A series of labs introduces new users to the software and quickly illustrate key SDR concepts and practices. Included components and waveforms provide excellent examples and allow for the simple creation of new waveform applications. The waveform workshop allows SDR developers to concentrate on the signal processing aspects of OSSIE software development by automatically generating code necessary for interfacing with the OSSIE Core Framework. Finally, the Core Framework provides an ideal platform for SDR and signal processing research.
