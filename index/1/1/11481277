Routing loops are caused by inconsistencies in the routing state of the network. Although undesirable from this aspect, they can provide insight into the routing dynamics that caused them. In this work we present a methodology that utilizes a priori knowledge of loops to study the correlation between routing loops and routing events that could have caused them. We apply our technique to associate route changes with packet loops detected in actual traffic traces collected from the Sprint Backbone. Our study shows that a strong correlation exists between loops and changes in the BGP routing state while the link state protocols ISIS is seldom responsible for such events. Our analysis also identifies factors that influence the distribution of loop path lengths as well as the effectiveness of our detection techniques.
