This article accompanies a video that presents a bimanual haptic device composed of two DLR/KUKA Light-Weight Robot (LWR) arms. The LWRs have similar dimensions to human arms, and can be operated in torque and position control mode at an update rate of 1 kHz. The two robots are mounted behind the user, such that the intersecting workspace of the robots and the human arms becomes maximal. In order to enhance user interaction, various hand interfaces and additional tactile feedback devices can be used together with the robots. The presented system is equipped with a thorough safety architecture that assures safe operation for human and robot. Additionally, sophisticated control strategies improve performance and guarantee stability. The introduced haptic system is well suited for versatile applications in remote and virtual environments, especially for large unscaled movements.
