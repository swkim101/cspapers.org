We introduce MAD7, a tool that rapidly simulates many-core memory architectures at a functional level. MAD7 focuses on tracking access patterns and data spatial localities rather than enforcing any precise on-chip arbitration protocols. Although not cycle accurate by nature, it provides useful insights when comparing different memory architectures under real-world workloads. Potential cache access and on-chip network usage bottlenecks can be easily spotted visually thanks to figures generated by our tool. MAD7 simulations are multi-threaded and are typically up to two orders of magnitude faster than those of a fully cycle accurate simulator.
