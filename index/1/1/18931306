It has been known that using different representations of either queries or documents, or different retrieval techniques retrieves different sets of documents. Recent work suggests that significant improvements in retrieval performance can be achieved by combining multiple representations or multiple retrieval techniques. In this paper we propose a simple method for retrieving different documents within a single query representation, a single document representation and a single retrieval technique. We classify the types of documents, and describe the properties of weighting schemes. Then, we explain that different properties of weighting schemes may retrieve different types of documents. Experimental results show that significant improvements can be obtained by combining the retrieval results from different properties of weighting schemes.
