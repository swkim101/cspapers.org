Synthesis of behaviour models from software development artifacts such as scenario-based descriptions or requirements specifications not only helps significantly reduce the effort of model construction, but also provides a bridge between approaches geared toward requirements analysis and those geared towards reasoning about system design at the architectural level. However, the models favoured by existing synthesis approaches are not sufficiently expressive to describe both universal constraints provided by requirements and existential statements provided by scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis technique that constructs behaviour models in the form of modal transition systems (MTS) from a combination of safety properties and scenarios. MTSs distinguish required, possible and proscribed behaviour, and their elaboration not only guarantees the preservation of the properties and scenarios used for synthesis but also supports further elicitation of new requirements.
