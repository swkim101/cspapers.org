Robots using cellular-like redundant binary actuators could outmatch modern robotic systems in terms of reliability, force-to-weight ratio and cost. This paper presents a robust control scheme that is designed to meet the challenges encountered by such robots, i.e., discrete actuator inputs, complex system modeling and cross-coupling between actuators. In the proposed scheme, a desired vectorial system output, such as a position or a force, is commanded by recruiting actuators based on their influence vectors on the output. No analytical model of the system is needed, influence vectors are identified experimentally by sequentially activating each actuators. Experimental results on a four-degrees-of-freedom binary manipulator with twenty actuators confirm the method effectiveness, for position and motion control, and its ability to tolerate massive perturbations and up to 50% actuator failures.
