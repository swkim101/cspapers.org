This paper provides a unifying mathematical framework for orders of magnitude models used in Qualitative Physics. An axiomatic of the qualitative equality is provided and a general algebraic structure called qualitative algebra is defined. It is shown that the usual model (+,-,0,?) and the extended model recently introduced by Dubois and Prade are particular cases in the class of models that are generated from a partition of the real line. Any of these models can be structured as qualitative algebra. On the other hand, we characterize those qualitative algebras that are isomorphous, in a qualitative sense. Besides, it is shown that all these models can be embedded into one another as qualitative subalgebras.
