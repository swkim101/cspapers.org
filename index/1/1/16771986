This paper reports the error specifications and error analysis for a new cooperatively controlled ENT microsurgery robot. The new robot is designed for three specific ENT surgeries, endonasal skull base surgery, transoral laryngeal surgery, and cochlear implant surgery. The design requirements for the robot resolution, accuracy, stiffness, and repeatability for these surgery types are discussed and analyzed, and the required robot parameters are calculated. The mechanical design of the robot is then analyzed and shown to fulfill these requirements in the case where it is in its home configuration. The analysis is then extended to cover the robot's whole workspace.
