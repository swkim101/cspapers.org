Multistage interconnection networks are studied via a detailed simulation model. The model contains several assumptions that improve accuracy over previous studies. Performance resutts for both throughput and latencies are given, and previously-used simplifying assumptions are evaluated to determine their effect on final results. We show that accurate modeling of memory reference streams (srnde one vectors versus random references) has a relatively small effect on performance, although it is not completely insignificant. On the other hand, we show that accurate modeling of network fanout is important. That is, vector supereomputers will have more memory banks than processors, and therefore need to fan out from the processors to the memory. The characteristics of this fanout are an important performance feature. We also re-enforce previously published results which show that for vector reference patterns, switches with internal buffering perform much better than switches with input and output buffering, only. Perhaps the most interesting results involve the feedback loop from processor registers, through the memory, and back to the registers. This feedback can lead to instabilities and oscillations in the network which cause reduced network efficiency and unexpected network behavior. For exampIe, using more vector registers can, under some circumstances, reduce overall performance.
