This paper starts from the observation that multiple top performing pedestrian detectors can be modelled by using an intermediate layer filtering low-level features in combination with a boosted decision forest. Based on this observation we propose a unifying framework and experimentally explore different filter families. We report extensive results enabling a systematic analysis. Using filtered channel features we obtain top performance on the challenging Caltech and KITTI datasets, while using only HOG+LUV as low-level features. When adding optical flow features we further improve detection quality and report the best known results on the Caltech dataset, reaching 93% recall at 1 FPPI.
