We present a new technique, which we call socket overloading, that we apply for off-path attacks on DNS. Socket overloading consists of short, low-rate, bursts of inbound packets, sent by off-path attacker to a victim host. Socket overloading exploits the priority assigned by the kernel to hardware interrupts, and enables an off-path attacker to illicit a side-channel on client hosts, which can be applied to circumvent source port and name server randomisation. Both port and name server randomisation are popular and standardised defenses, recommended in [RFC5452], against attacks by off-path adversaries. We show how to apply socket overloading for DNS cache poisoning and name server pinning against popular systems that support algorithms recommended in [RFC6056] and [RFC4097] respectively. Our socket overloading technique may be of independent interest, and can be applied against other protocols for different attacks.
