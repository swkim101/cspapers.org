The questions before this panel presuppose a distinction between parsing and interpretation. There are two other simple and obvious distinctions that I think are necessary for a reasonable discussion of the issues. First, we must clearly distinguish between the static specification of a process and its dynamic execution. Second, we must clearly distinguish two purposes that a natural language processing system might serve: one legitimate goal of a system is to perform some practical task efficiently and well, while a second goal is to assist in developing a scientific understanding of the cognitive operations that underlie human language processing. I will refer to parsers primarily oriented towards the former goal as Practical Parsers (PP) and refer to the others as Performance Model Parsers (PMP). With these distinctions in mind, let me now turn to the questions at hand.
