The Computer Science Department at Winona State University revised its curriculum to include an interdisciplinary approach adapted to the study of computer science. The new curriculum consists of a traditional Computer Science option and an Applied Computer Science option consisting of four separate tracks, namely: bioinformatics, computer information systems, geographic information technology, and human computer interaction. This paper describes the design strategy and implementation plan as well as the content of our multi-track Applied Computer Science curriculum.
