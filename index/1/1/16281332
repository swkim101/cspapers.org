In this paper, we introduce U-MAP, a new system for schema mapping generation. U-MAP builds upon and extends existing schema mapping techniques. However, it mitigates some key problems in this area, which have not been previously addressed. The key tenet of U-MAP is to exploit the usage information extracted from the query logs associated with the schemas being mapped. We describe our experience in applying our proposed system to realistic datasets from the retail and life sciences domains. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of U-MAP compared to traditional approaches.
