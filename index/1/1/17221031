A humanoid robot can be viewed as a constrained dynamic system with constraints imposed by manipulation tasks, locomotion tasks, and the environment. This paper focuses on dealing with constraints in the upper-body of humanoid robots for manipulation tasks that involve coordinated motion of two arms. Inspired by research on human bimanual actions in the biomechanics area, we have developed the Extended-Cooperative-Task-Space (ECTS) representation that efficiently describes various coordinated motion tasks performed by a humanoid robot. Furthermore, we present a general whole-body control framework as an optimal controller based on Gauss's principle of least constraint. We show that all the constraints imposed on a humanoid system can be handled in a unified manner. The proposed framework is verified by numerical simulations on a Hubo II+ humanoid robot model.
