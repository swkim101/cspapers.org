Current data design methodologies tend to generate a single design for an application, neglecting many other possible designs. This is partly because user requirements have to be expressed in semantic models which are too closely coupled to the data design. Failure to recognize the variety of designs which can represent the same facts also hampers other data administration functions which depend on adequate data documentation. Such functions include application planning, redundancy management, and information center services. And there are even implications for the design of high-level interfaces to diverse data.
