This paper describes a navigation method for a mobile robot by attentive observation. A 3D scene description is constructed with the constrained Delaunay triangulation and a path to a given destination is determined from the description. If any reliable path is not found, the unknown image region on the most promising path is observed attentively. The newly obtained data is integrated to the original description and a path is searched for in the new description. The experimental results are shown.<<ETX>>
