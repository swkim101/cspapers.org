This paper presents a multi-perspective (i.e., four camera views) multi-modal (i.e., thermal infrared and color) video based system for robust and real-time 3D tracking of important body parts.The multi-perspective characteristics of the system provides 3Dtrajectory of the body parts, while the multi-modal characteristics of the system provides robustness and reliability of feature detection and tracking. The application context for this research is that of intelligent vehicles and driver assistance systems. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed system.
