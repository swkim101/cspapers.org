Emulated networks enable educators, researchers, and operators to conduct realistic network scenarios on commodity hardware. However each network device must be configured, typically in a low-level syntax. This time-consuming and error-prone process limits scalability and discourages repeated experimentation. This demonstration will show a platform to automate emulated network configuration and measurement, making large-scale network experimentation accessible.
