Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is used in indoor positioning for measuring object distance to the base station. However, acquiring accurate RSSI values is challenging because wireless interference factors, such as multipath decline interference, make RSSI values of the same object fluctuate over time. Therefore, instead of a single RSSI, RSSI acquisition will collect a set of RSSI values from which the most moderate RSSI is derived. For this purpose, we propose an Enhanced Gaussian Mixture Model (EGMM) to derive a more precise RSSI for improving indoor positioning accuracy. EGMM enhances Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by applying Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the best K value for GMM to divide RSSI values into K sets representing signals from different paths. Then, EGMM identifies the most appropriate set of RSSI values to derive a more precise RSSI and thus improves the accuracy of indoor positioning. Our EGMM solution performs well in an open indoor space. The experiment is conducted with iBeacon devices, and the average error distance of EGMM is about 64% of those generated by existing Gaussian filtering. The average positioning error of EGMM is about 0.48 meter, which is adequate to indoor positioning accuracy.
