In this paper the authors introduce the conformal geometric algebra in the field of visually guided robotics. As opposite to the standard projective geometry, we can deal simultaneously with incidence algebra operations and conformal transformations. As a result this framework appears promising for dealing with kinematics, dynamics and projective geometry problems without the need to abandon the mathematical system (as current approaches). Using this framework the authors compute the inverse kinematics of a robot arm and a pan-tilt unit and solve a problem of visually guided grasping.
