This paper proposes a modeling method for generic serial-chain compliant robotic manipulators. It is based on graph theory and port-Hamiltonian systems, which allows a modular approach to the interconnection of rigid bodies with compliant actuators by means of kinematic pairs. This modularity allows a very simple and straight-forward change in a manipulator's actuator morphology. An example of a two degree of freedom planar manipulator shows that this modeling method is more suitable for modeling changes in actuator placement than traditional Euler-Lagrange models.
