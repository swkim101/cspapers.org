In response to recent studies on enrollment trends and our own assessment results, we have significantly modified our Computer Science major to include not only a traditional major in computer science but also to include concentrations in Business Information Systems and Graphic Design and Implementation. As we are a small liberal arts college with three faculty members and a small budget, we have partnered with other disciplines on campus to provide options for our majors to apply concepts and principles of computer science to other areas. We present here our plans of study for the three concentrations, our rationale for making these additions, and favorable responses from students, faculty, and administration.
