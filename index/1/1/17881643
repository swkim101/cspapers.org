This paper discusses a process automation package developed by Technical Operations, Inc. to produce certain types of engineering drawings and associated data. The package described is fully operational and is being marketed to industrial concerns in the electronics group throughout the country. The principal component of the package is a computer program which enables low cost plotting equipment to produce high quality electrical/electronic engineering drawings.
 Specifically, the system is capable of producing a broad range of drawings including electronic schematic diagrams, logic diagrams, and cabling or interconnection diagrams. Accurate engineering parts lists and parts counts can also be printed out as a by-product by simply scanning the input data. Since this parts data is generated from the same code as the drawings, it corresponds uniquely to the information on the drawing.
