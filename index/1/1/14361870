The reliable assessment of affective reactions to stimuli is paramount in a variety of scientific fields, including HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). Variation of emotional states over time, however, warrants the need for quick measurements of emotions. To address it, new tools for quick assessments of affective states have been developed. In this work, we explore the CAAT (Circumplex Affective Assessment Tool), an instrument with a unique design in the scope of affect assessment -- a graphical control element -- that makes it amenable to seamless integration in user interfaces. We briefly describe the CAAT and present a multi-dimensional evaluation that evidences the tool's viability. We have assessed its test-retest reliability, construct validity and quickness of use, by collecting data through an unsupervised, web-based user study. Results show high test-retest reliability, evidence the tool's construct validity and confirm its quickness of use, making it a good fit for longitudinal studies and systems requiring quick assessments of emotional reactions.
