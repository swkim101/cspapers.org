In this paper, we propose a reranking model to improve the aspect-level performance in the biomedical domain. This model iteratively computes the maximum hidden aspect for every retrieved passage and then reranks these passages from aspect subsets. The experimental results show the improvements of the aspect-level performance up to 27.14% for 2006 Genomics topics and 27.09% for 2007 Genomics topics.
