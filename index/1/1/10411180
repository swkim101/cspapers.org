A method is proposed which accomplishes a whole task consisting of plural subtasks by coordinating multiple behaviors acquired by a vision-based reinforcement learning. First, individual behaviors which achieve the corresponding subtasks are independently acquired by Q-learning, a widely used reinforcement learning method. Each learned behavior can be represented by an action-value function in terms of state of the environment and robot action. Next, three kinds of coordinations of multiple behaviors are considered; simple summation of different action-value functions, switching action-value functions according to situations, and learning with previously obtained action-value functions as initial values of a new action-value function. A task of shooting a ball into the goal avoiding collisions with an enemy is examined. The task can be decomposed into a ball shooting subtask and a collision avoiding subtask. These subtasks should be accomplished simultaneously, but they are not independent of each other.<<ETX>>
