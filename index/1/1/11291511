In recent years, query processing has become more complex as data sources are frequently replicated and data are periodically processed and embedded within several data sources simultaneously. These trends have necessitated the optimization of techniques for query processing in order to exploit these new alternatives. Accordingly, this paper introduces an improved query optimization technique, which is capable of assessing query plans that use both current and obsolescent data. In particular, we provide a cost model by which the trade-offs of using obsolescent materialized views can be evaluated and we also discuss the method's applicability to contemporary query optimization techniques.
