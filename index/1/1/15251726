We present the object-oriented multi-tier application framework OMS Java which is independent of the underlying database management system (DBMS). We detail the storage management component and sketch which part of the framework has to be extended when introducing a new DBMS. We compare versions of OMS Java using the persistent storage engine ObjectStore PSE Pro for Java, the object-oriented DBMS Objectivity/DB, the object-relational DBMS Oracle and the proprietary DBMS Berkley DB.
