Taking the multiclass and binary classification for example, we focus on learning multiple binary classifiers from a single multiclass classifier, where each of binary classifier is responsible for a certain class. This actually derives from some realistic problems, such as identifying the suspect based on a comprehensive face recognition system. By treating the already-trained multiclass classifier as the teacher, and multiple binary classifiers as the students, we propose a gated support vector machine (gSVM) as a solution. A series of gSVMs are learned with the help of single teacher multiclass classifier. The teacher's help is two-fold; first, the teacher's score provides the gated values for students' decision; second, the teacher can guide the students to accommodate training examples with different difficulty degrees. Extensive experiments on real datasets validate its effectiveness.
