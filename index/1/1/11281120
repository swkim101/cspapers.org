To better meet users' underlying navigational requirement, search engines like Baidu has developed general recommendation engine and provided related entities on the right side of the search engine results page(SERP). However, users' behavior have not been well investigated after the association of individual queries in search engine. To better understand users' navigational activities, we propose a new method to map users' behavior to an association graph and make graph analysis. Interesting properties like clustering and assortativity are found in this association graph. This study provides a new perspective on research of semantic network and users' navigational behavior on SERP.
