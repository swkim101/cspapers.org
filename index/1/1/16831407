The inherent asymmetry of read and write speeds of flash memory poses great challenges for buffer management design. Most of existing flash-based buffer management policies adopt disk-oriented strategies by giving a specific priority to dirty pages, while not fully exploiting the characteristics of the flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel buffer replacement algorithm named FOR, which stands for Flash-based Operation-aware buffer Replacement. The core idea of FOR is based on novel operation-aware page weight determination for buffer replacement. The weight metric not only measures the locality of read/write operations on a page, but also takes the cost difference of read/write operations into account. We further develop an efficient implementation FOR+ with the time complexity of O(1) for each operation. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark traces demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy, which yields better performance compared with some state-of-the-art flash-based buffer management policies.
