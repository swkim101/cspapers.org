The paper discusses the configuration process in a sale support system aimed at helping a customer of a virtual store to assembly the right complex product containing the subcomponents that he/she chose and meeting her/his requirements. Because of the interaction of the customer with the system during the configuration process, we define a lazy configurator able to configure only the portion of the complex product which is directly related to the customerâ€™s requirements. We define also some focusing mechanisms able to use the constraints in order to reduce the search space during the configuration.
