EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange, a method of transporting all types of information, such as purchase orders, invoices, payments and even graphics, to another party electronically. XML is a meta-language that allows users to define markup for their documents using tags. This paper first introduces the XML applications in our country and the defects of this method. Then puts forward a new XML resolution that combines EDI and XML technology together. At the end of this paper, the characters of this new method and an instance based on the new method are given to support its correctness.
