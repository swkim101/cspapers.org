This paper discusses computer automation, computer-aided design, and computer-aided production as applied to creating artwork from electronic design. The purpose is to establish distinctions among the three automated techniques and the equipment necessary to implement them. The conclusion is a recommended approach to justifying the cost and characteristics of the equipment.
 A simple design is followed through its artwork stages as is done without computer aids, then as done with various computer aids. Finally, a technique for selecting and cost justifying the optimum computer-aided system is presented.
 Throughout the paper, terms are defined. These definitions are not necessarily industry standards but are given for clarity while in context. It is the intent that one should be able to determine whether he has purchased or is in the process of purchasing an expensive toy or an extremely valuable tool that will make his operation less costly, more productive and hence more profitable. If this determination is made, the concept of computer-aided design will have been looked upon in its proper perspective and never again confused with the concept of computer-aided production!
