The system interconnect is often the performance bottleneck in SMP computers. Although modern SMPs include event counters on processors and interconnects, these provide limited information about the interaction of processors vying for shared resources. Additionally, transaction sources and addresses are not readily available, making analysis of access patterns and data locality difficult. Enhanced system interconnect instrumentation is required to extract this information. This paper describes instrumentation implemented for monitoring the system interconnect on Sun Fireâ„¢ servers. The instrumentation supports sophisticated programmable filtering of event counters, allowing us to construct histograms of system interconnect activity, and a FIFO to capture trace sequences. Our implementation results in a very small hardware footprint, making it appropriate for inclusion in commodity hardware. We also describe a sampling of software tools and results based on this infrastructure. Applications have included performance profiling, architectural studies, and hardware bringup and debugging.
