Platform independence means that a user interface can be specified and created using a particular combination of hardware, operating system, and windowing environmen~ that single specification can then be recompiled without intervention (ideally) to run on an entirely heterogeneous combination/platform. This is a remarkable feat even considering alone the differences among windowing environments (Motif, Windows, Macintosh), operating systems (various Unix, DOS, Macintosh), or hardware (Sun, HP, DEC, IBM PC/compatible, Macintosh).
