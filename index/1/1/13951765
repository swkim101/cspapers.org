This paper represents a beginning development of a parallel truth maintenance system to interact with a parallel inference engine. We present a solution which performs status assignments in parallel to belief nodes in the Reason Maintenance System (RMS) presented by [Doyle, 1979], [Doyle, 1983]. We examine a previously described algorithm by [Petrie, 1986] which fails to correctly detect termination of the status assignments. Under Petrie's algorithm, termination may go undetected and in certain circumstances (namely the existence of an unsatisfiable circularity) a false detection may occur. We present an algorithm that corrects these problems.
