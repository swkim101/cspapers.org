Our new macro expander for Racket builds on a novel approach to hygiene. Instead of basing macro expansion on variable renamings that are mediated by expansion history, our new expander tracks binding through a set of scopes that an identifier acquires from both binding forms and macro expansions. The resulting model of macro expansion is simpler and more uniform than one based on renaming, and it is sufficiently compatible with Racket's old expander to be practical.
