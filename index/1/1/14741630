This paper presents an approach to automatic acquisition of the argument-predicate relations from a semantically annotated corpus. We use SALSA, a German newspaper corpus manually annotated with role-semantic information based on frame semantics. Since the relatively small size of SALSA does not allow to estimate the semantic relatedness in the extracted argument-predicate pairs, we use a larger corpus for ranking. Two experiments have been performed in order to evaluate the proposed approach. In the first experiment we compare automatically extracted argument-predicate relations with the gold standard formed from associations provided by human subjects. In the second experiment we calculate correlation between automatic relatedness measure and human ranking of the extracted relations.
