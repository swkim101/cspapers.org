Recently, there has been progress in proving lower bounds for certain restricted models of Boolean computations. In particular, by the so-called method of approximations, exponential lower bounds have been obtained for monotone complexity [RazSSb, RazS5a, AES5, ABS7, TarS9, AndS7] and for bounded-depth circuits over several bases [RazS7, SmoS7, Pats61 (an informal account of the method can be found in [RazSG, BSSS]). The most interesting question about approximations is, doubtless, how useful can they be for arbitrary circuits. This question can be made quite precise because the method of approximations is easy to formalize (actually this was done already in [RazS5b]). In the present paper we prove some results clarifying the situation. It turns out that the answer to the question we are interested in depends very much on whether we allow auxiliary variables or not. First we prove that lower bounds which could be obtained by the method of approximations never exceed O(non) where n is the to-
