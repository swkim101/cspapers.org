In this paper, we present a flexible simulation environment for the performance evaluation of flash-aware algorithms, which is called Flash-DBSim. The main purpose of Flash-DBSim is to provide a configurable virtual flash disk for upper systems, such as file system and DBMS, so that the algorithms in those systems can be easily evaluated on different types of flash disks. Moreover, it also offers a prototyping environment for those algorithms inside flash disk, e.g. the algorithms for garbage collection or wear-leveling. After an overview of the general features of Flash-DBSim, we discuss the architecture of Flash-DBSim. And finally, a case study of Flash-DBSim's demonstration is presented.
