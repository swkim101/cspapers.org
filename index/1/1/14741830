A new algorithm is presented for avoiding system deadlocks. Because its performance has little dependence on the number of lockable resources, it is particularly well suited to use in data base systems which may have millions of individually lockable records. A further advantage is that both exclusive and shared locking are accommodated. The algorithm is presented in some detail and its performance and functional characteristics discussed.
