In this paper, the problem of sharing resources (slots of an up-link TDMA frame) among real-time heterogeneous variable bit rate (VBR) applications with diverse quality of service (&OS) requirements is addressed. The QoS requirements for each application is defined in terms of a maximum tolerable packet delay and dropping probability; a packet is dropped if it experiences excess delay. The region of achievable QoS vectors which is central to the call admission problem is established for policies that are work-conserving and satisfy the earliest due date (EDD) service criterion (WC-EDD policies); such policies are known to optimize the overall system performance. In addition to the determination of the region of achievable QoS vectors, this study leads also to the construction of scheduling policies which deliver any performance in the region established for WC-EDD policies. Finally, an upper bound on the region of QoS vectors that can be achieved under any policy (not limited to the WCEDD policies) is determined.
