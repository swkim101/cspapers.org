We present a novel method for retrieval and classification of 3D building models that is tailored to the specific requirements of architects. In contrast to common approaches our algorithm relies on the interior spatial arrangement of rooms instead of exterior geometric shape. We first represent the internal topological building structure by a Room Connectivity Graph (RCG). To enable fast and efficient retrieval and classification with RCGs, we transform the structured graph representation into a vector-based one by introducing a new concept of subgraph embeddings. We provide comprehensive experiments showing that the introduced subgraph embeddings yield superior performance compared to state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches.
