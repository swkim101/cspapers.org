This paper addresses economic and management issues in software engineering. It outlines a research 
agenda aimed at improving the economic return on software investments, based on a better 
understanding of the relationships between the costs, benefits and risks associated with system 
requirements and the way in which the software is designed, developed, acquired and delivered.
