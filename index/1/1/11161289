This paper describes the development of a horizontal-plane dynamic running robot based on a reduced order locomotion model, the Lateral-Leg Spring (LLS) model. Contributions include the development of a scaled, actuated, distributed mass simulation of the model, control approaches to compensate for physical and motor limitations, and the design and fabrication of bipedal running robot that instantiates the horizontal plane dynamics of the LLS model.
