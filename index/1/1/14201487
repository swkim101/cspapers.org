Multicoloring allows the possibility of a high degree of parallelism and/or vectorization. However, multicoloring, as opposed to the natural ordering, may have a deleterious effect on the rate of convergence of an iterative method. Although the rate of convergence of the SOR iteration does not seem to suffer by multicoloring (and may even be enhanced), the same is not true for preconditioning the conjugate gradient method by SSOR. In particular, if c = 2 (red/black) it is known (Harrar and Ortega 119881) that the optimum relaxation factor is o = 1 for any number of SSOR preconditioning steps, in the sense of reducing the condition number. Experiments reported in Harrar and Ortega [19891 on a three-dimensional Poisson-type equation show that the number of iterations using red/black SSOR with o = 1 as the preconditioner is considerably higher than natural order SSOR with optimum w > 1. This is consistent with similar experiments reported by Adams [1982], Ashcraft and Grimes [1988], Elman and Agron
