At the core of video games are complex interactions leading to emergent behaviors. This complexity creates difficulties architecting components, predicting their behaviors and testing the results. The Workshop on Games and Software Engineering (GAS 2011) provides an opportunity for software engineering researchers and practitioners who work with games to come together and discuss how these two areas can be intertwined.
