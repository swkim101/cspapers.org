In this work, we offer a novel system, MicroStation (μStation) that allows ubiquitous data broadcasting applications using the FM radio on mobile devices such as smartphones. μStation includes two key modules to enable data broadcasting based on existing mobile FM radio hardware. Channel Selector assigns different FM channels to neighboring μStation broadcasters to avoid collision and guides μStation listeners to find their broadcasting of interest. Data Codec realizes bit-level communication between mobile devices through existing FM radio hardware. We describe an implementation of μStation on the Nokia N900 smartphone, and provide low-level APIs and services to support application development. We also demonstrate two representative applications: Facebook-FM and Sync-Flash. These applications demonstrate the capability of μStation to readily enable a new class of ubiquitous data broadcasting applications on mobile devices.
