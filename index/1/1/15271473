A set of constraints for motion planning whilst maintaining contact between a robot and a passive object is considered. It is demonstrated that a set of kinematic limits for the trajectory can be determined based upon the available force range and system response to perturbations. The proposed constraints are discretised and reformulated for a 2-D nonholonomic robot before being utilised by a modied uid based motion planner capable of kinematic parameter control. The eect of the constraints and the performance of the motion planner is demonstrated on a dribbling scenario for soccer playing robots. The results show the exibility and eectiveness of the constraints in generating a suitable trajectory and the capability of the developed motion planner to observe the determined constraints.
