S3 is the prototype of a database system supporting the management and similarity retrieval of industrial CAD parts. The major goal of the system is to reduce the cost for developing and producing new parts by maximizing the reuse of existing parts. S3 supports the following three types of similarity queries: query by example (of an existing part in the database), query by sketch and thematic similarity query. S3 is an object-oriented system offering an adequate graphical user interface. On top of providing various state-of-the-art algorithms and index structures for geometry-based similarity retrieval, it is an excellent testbed for developing and testing new similarity algorithms and index structures.
