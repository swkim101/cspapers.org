This paper evaluates the benefit of deleting fillers (e.g. you know, like) early in parsing conversational speech. Readability studies have shown that disfluencies (fillers and speech repairs) may be deleted from transcripts without compromising meaning (Jones et al., 2003), and deleting repairs prior to parsing has been shown to improve its accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). We explore whether this strategy of early deletion is also beneficial with regard to fillers. Reported experiments measure the effect of early deletion under in-domain and out-of-domain parser training conditions using a state-of-the-art parser (Charniak, 2000). While early deletion is found to yield only modest benefit for in-domain parsing, significant improvement is achieved for out-of-domain adaptation. This suggests a potentially broader role for disfluency modeling in adapting text-based tools for processing conversational speech.
