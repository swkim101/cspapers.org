This paper describes an approach towards teaching problem solving in an introductory service course using the FORTRAN programming language. The course is centered around s set of problems which are used to illustrate a problem solving methodology. Three pedogogical tools (data table, flow diagram, and program system chart) are used to provide a framework for algorithm development. Two control structures (the Block IF decision structured and WHILE loop) have been added to the FORTRAN language to facilitate the implementation of algorithms.
