People who are busy generally have to manage a great variety of tasks. But sometimes, they fall behind in minor tasks and gradually, even without them noticing, a huge backlog piles up, far beyond the person's capacity to complete them well and on time. We proposed a task-management system that predicts a user's future state on the basis of the user's lifelog and plans, using a simple linear regression model. We implemented the system using a smartphone and estimated its usefulness with a user test. As a result, the users of our system saw their future diaries and tried to alter their current daily activities.
