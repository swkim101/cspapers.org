This paper presents "BetterAuth", an authentication protocol for Web applications. Its design is based on the experiences of two decades with the Web. BetterAuth addresses existing attacks on Web authentication, ranging from network attacks to Cross-site Request Forgery up to Phishing. Furthermore, the protocol can be realized completely in standard JavaScript. This allows Web applications an early adoption, even in a situation with limited browser support.
