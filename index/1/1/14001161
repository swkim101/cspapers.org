Three dimensional integration complements semiconductor scaling; it enables a higher integration density as well as heterogeneous technology integration. Using 3D chip stacking, it is possible to extend the number of functions per 3D chip well beyond the near-term capabilities of traditional scaling. The 3D strata may be realized using advanced CMOS technology nodes but may also exploit a wide variety of device technologies to optimize system performance.
