In this paper, we propose a real-time 3D hand pose estimation algorithm using the randomized decision forest framework. Our algorithm takes a depth image as input and generates a set of skeletal joints as output. Previous decision forest-based methods often give labels to all points in a point cloud at a very early stage and vote for the joint locations. By contrast, our algorithm only tracks a set of more flexible virtual landmark points, named segmentation index points (SIPs), before reaching the final decision at a leaf node. Roughly speaking, a SIP represents the centroid of a subset of skeletal joints, which are to be located at the leaves of the branch expanded from the SIP. Inspired by recent latent regression forest-based hand pose estimation framework (Tang et al. 2014), we integrate SIP into the framework with several important improvements: First, we devise a new forest growing strategy, whose decision is made using a randomized feature guided by SIPs. Second, we speed-up the training procedure since only SIPs, not the skeletal joints, are estimated at non-leaf nodes. Third, the experimental results on public benchmark datasets show clearly the advantage of the proposed algorithm over previous state-of-the-art methods, and our algorithm runs at 55.5 fps on a normal CPU without parallelism.
