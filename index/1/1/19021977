Although a great deal of work on modeling reliability of data communications systems has been done, there are important problems with current models which do not seem to be adequately appreciated, much less solved. Two important problems of this nature are discussed: 1) finding adequate techniques for computing reliabilities of systems with dependent communications line failures (which are the dominant cause of system failures in important classes of systems), and 2) developing adequate techniques for handling systems with tremendously variable reliability parameters (since parameters such as line failure rates typically vary by three or four orders of magnitude for different communication lines). Motivations for considering these to be important problems are given and the results of initial rough models which include the effects are discussed.
