An underwater glider named ROUGHIE (Research Oriented Underwater Glider for Hands-on Investigative Engineering) is designed and manufactured to provide a test platform and framework for experimental underwater automation. This paper presents an efficient multi-level motion controller that can be used to enhance underwater glider control systems or easily modified for additional sensing, computing, or other requirements for advanced automation design testing. The ultimate goal is to have a fleet of modular and inexpensive test platforms for addressing the issues that currently limit the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Producing a low-cost vehicle with maneuvering capabilities and a straightforward expansion path will permit easy experimentation and testing of different approaches to improve underwater automation.
