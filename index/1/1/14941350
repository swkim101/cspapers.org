Traditional recommendation algorithms often select products with the highest predicted ratings to recommend. However, earlier research in economics and marketing indicates that a consumer usually makes purchase decision(s) based on the product's marginal net utility (i.e., the marginal utility minus the product price). Utility is defined as the satisfaction or pleasure user u gets when purchasing the corresponding product. A rational consumer chooses the product to purchase in order to maximize the total net utility. In contrast to the predicted rating, the marginal utility of a product depends on the user's purchase history and changes over time. According to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, many products have the decreasing marginal utility with the increase of purchase count, such as cell phones, computers, and so on. Users are not likely to purchase the same or similar product again in a short time if they already purchased it before. On the other hand, some products, such as pet food, baby diapers, would be purchased again and again. To better match users' purchase decisions in the real world, this paper explores how to recommend products with the highest marginal net utility in e-commerce sites. Inspired by the Cobb-Douglas utility function in consumer behavior theory, we propose a novel utility-based recommendation framework. The framework can be utilized to revamp a family of existing recommendation algorithms. To demonstrate the idea, we use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an example and revamp it with the framework. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on an e-commerce (shop.com) data set. The new algorithm significantly improves the base algorithm, largely due to its ability to recommend both products that are new to the user and products that the user is likely to re-purchase.
