A hybrid functional electrical stimulation (FES)/orthosis system is being developed which combines two channels of (surface-electrode-based) electrical stimulation with a computer-controlled orthosis for the purpose of restoring gait to spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals (albeit with a stability aid, such as a walker). The orthosis is an energetically passive, controllable device which 1) unidirectionally couples hip to knee flexion; 2) aids hip and knee flexion with a spring assist; and 3) incorporates sensors and modulated friction brakes, which are used in conjunction with electrical stimulation for the feedback control of joint (and therefore limb) trajectories. This paper describes the hybrid FES approach and the design of the joint coupled orthosis. A dynamic simulation of an SCI individual using the hybrid approach is described, and results from the simulation are presented that indicate the promise of the JCO approach.
