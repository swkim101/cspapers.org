We describe an original method that automatically finds specific topics in a large collection of texts. Each topic is first identified as a specific cluster of texts and then represented as a virtual concept, which is a weighted mixture of words. Our intention is to employ these virtual concepts in document indexing.In this paper we show some preliminary experimental results and discuss directions of future work.
