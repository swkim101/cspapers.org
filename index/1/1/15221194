Making assumptions limits the depth of inference chains and reduces the potential for complex interactions, but assumptions that are made implicitly can blind the reasoner to important inferences and interactions. A self-education aid makes students aware of their assumptions by demonstrating how these assumptions might be violated. DECIDER is a self-education aid for history that tracks student assumptions using political models and illustrates possible violations using dramatic stories and video sequences from real historical cases.
