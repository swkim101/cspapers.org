This paper describes a method for recovering appearance of inner slices of translucent objects. The outer appearance of translucent objects is a summation of the appearance of slices at all depths, where each slice is blurred by depth-dependent point spread functions (PSFs). By exploiting the difference of low-pass characteristics of depth-dependent PSFs, we develop a multi-frequency illumination method for obtaining the appearance of individual inner slices using a coaxial projector-camera setup. Specifically, by measuring the target object with varying the spatial frequency of checker patterns emitted from a projector, our method recovers inner slices via a simple linear solution method. We quantitatively evaluate accuracy of the proposed method by simulations and show qualitative recovery results using real-world scenes.
