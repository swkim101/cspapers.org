We present techniques for computing small space representations of massive data streams. These are inspired by traditional wavelet-based approximations that consist of specific linear projections of the underlying data. We present general “sketch” based methods for capturing various linear projections of the data and use them to provide pointwise and rangesum estimation of data streams. These methods use small amounts of space and per-item time while streaming through the data, and provide accurate representation as our experiments with real data streams show.
