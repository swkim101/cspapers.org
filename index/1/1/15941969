We propose a framework for mobile advertising covering Value-Added Services where an ad-database is maintained on the device and both selection and display are dictated by the device. Advantages over existing mobile marketing are that ads are more timely, viable on a variety of use cases, can be both location-sensitive and personalized with minimal privacy concerns, and provide an obvious means for subsidizing users' service costs. We construct a suitable selection algorithm and evaluate its execution, accuracy and scalability. We show that ad-serving can be done under the processing constraints imposed by mobiles, which may lead to improvements in mobile marketing effectiveness.
