In a large-scale disaster in which many persons are injured at the same time, triage has been introduced. Triage is a method that temporarily delays the treatment of people with mild to moderate injuries and symptoms and gives priority to those in a critical condition. In the process of multiple triage, more specific information is needed in the second triage compared to the first to accurately prioritize the persons injuries and state. To solve this problem we proposed and constructed a touch-based interface for managing information inserted during second triage. A touch-based tablet interface is introduced to specify wound areas and gestures for wound types. The information is shared wirelessly with all emergency personnel, giving medics shared, data-centric, visibility of overall triage status for the first time. The evaluation experiment shows that this proposed system enables to reduce input errors, speed up injured person care, and facilitate information sharing between medics efficiently. As a result, we believe that many more injured persons can and will be saved.
