Due to the explosive growth of the Internet online reviews, we can easily collect a large amount of labeled reviews from different domains. But only some of them are beneficial for training a desired target-domain sentiment classifier. Therefore, it is important for us to identify those samples that are the most relevant to the target domain and use them as training data. To address this problem, a novel approach, based on instance selection and instance weighting via PU learning, is proposed. PU learning is used at first to learn an in-target-domain selector, which assigns an in-target-domain probability to each sample in the training set. For instance selection, the samples with higher in-target-domain probability are used as training data; For instance weighting, the calibrated in-target-domain probabilities are used as sampling weights for training an instance-weighted naive Bayes model, based on the principle of maximum weighted likelihood estimation. The experimental results prove the necessity and effectiveness of the approach, especially when the size of training data is large. It is also proved that the larger the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the training and test data is, the more effective the proposed approach will be.
