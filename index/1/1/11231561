Core decomposition has proven to be a useful primitive for a wide range of graph analyses. One of its most appealing features is that, unlike other notions of dense subgraphs, it can be computed linearly in the size of the input graph. In this paper we provide an analogous tool for uncertain graphs, i.e., graphs whose edges are assigned a probability of existence. The fact that core decomposition can be computed efficiently in deterministic graphs does not guarantee efficiency in uncertain graphs, where even the simplest graph operations may become computationally intensive. Here we show that core decomposition of uncertain graphs can be carried out efficiently as well. We extensively evaluate our definitions and methods on a number of real-world datasets and applications, such as influence maximization and task-driven team formation.
