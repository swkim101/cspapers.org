—The most widely used secure Internet communication standard TLS (Transport Layer Security) has an optional client certiﬁcate authentication feature that in theory has signiﬁcant security advantages over HTML form-based password authentication. In this paper we discuss practical security and usability issues related to TLS client certiﬁcate authentication stemming from the server-side and browser implementations. In particular, we analyze Apache’s mod_ssl implementation on the server side and the most popular browsers – Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer on the client side. We complement our paper with a measurement study performed in Estonia where TLS client certiﬁcate authentication is widely used. We present our recommendations to improve the security and usability of TLS client certiﬁcate authentication.
