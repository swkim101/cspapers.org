There are several approaches to formalizing knowledge. The concept of knowledge is often introduced by a special operator whose properties are defined by a number of axioms. A situation is then modelled by using this operator in problem-specific axioms. This article presents a different approach - a first-order logical model which does not use any new operators. The properties of knowledge should follow from the problem-specific axioms only. The advantages are that the model is simpler and requires fewer axioms. The formalization of a problem can almost directly be used as a computer program which produces the solutions.
