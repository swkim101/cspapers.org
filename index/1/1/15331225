Asserting whether two devices are in close proximity is very important to many smartphone assisted security systems. For example, the smartphone based two-factor authentication usually requires the smartphone to stay in close proximity to the other device during authentication. However, relay attacks pose a serious threat to existing approaches for proximity assertions. In this paper, we present a novel near field assertion system that restricts the distance between the two devices to the scale of several centimeters. Our system explores acoustic communications and can prevent relay attacks. The generated assertion is a confidential binary sequence known only to the two devices. Our system is fully automated and light-weight, as demonstrated by extensive evaluations on a prototype.
