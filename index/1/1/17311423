This study mainly explored how to use WSN (Wireless Sensors Network) such as ZigBee wireless communication modules and Bluetooth modules to be implemented in the livelihood intelligent energy-saving system in which an active and intelligent energy-saving and its relative environmental detecting and sensor modules were validly constructed to accomplish proceeding to energy-saving mechanism. This research apply new technology to build up active & intelligent energy-saving system focus on system operation instead of materials or components, with those auto-detect mechanism and auto-judged back-end agent software, then deliver feedback control signals through bi-direction wireless communication interface, this system can effectively achieve the goal of energy-saving. Not only did this study construct hybrid WSN communication mechanism with 2.4GHz ZigBee and Bluetooth, in which BT was used to design the interface between end-device sensors such as temperature, luminance, CO2, number of persons, humidity etc. while ZigBee was designed as the communication mechanism between middle-way and server computer, to dynamically collect running parameters in power consumption space, but also some practical energy-saving methods were constructed in different environment to verify the efficiently of the system. Eventually, the experimental outcomes were proved to be entirely successful and some placements and suggestions were recommended to the future research as well as to the government departments.
