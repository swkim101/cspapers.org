The 5G communication ear is approaching and the first service is expected to roll out by 2020. In the coming up 5G communication systems other than the traditional requirements for higher bandwidth for mobile communication, the massive connections and ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements are the new challenges to the 5G communication systems. Fog computing is considered a good solution to address the demand for massive connections and low-latency applications by pushing some computing or processing tasks from the cloud servers to the Fog nodes, or close to the mobile edge. A Fog node can be viewed as a reduced capability of a cloud server and/or integrated with a small cell for handling the telecommunication services. In this study, a Fog node system software is developed on an Arm 64-bit server grade SoC known as Green server. Several potential applications such as smart parking, smart home surveillance, and smart retail and delivery services are under investigation on such a system to demonstrate the requirements for massive connections and low latency can be met on the Fog computing node system environment.
