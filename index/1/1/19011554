In this paper we shall describe a program (MECHO), written in Prolog[14], which solves a wide range of mechanics problems from statements in both predicate calculus and English. Mecho uses the technique of meta-level inference to control search in natural language understanding, common sense inference, model formation and algebraic manipulation. We argue that this is a powerful technique for controlling search while retaining the modularity of declarative knowledge representations.
