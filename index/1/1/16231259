A Computer Aided Design (CAD) system for bipolar logic LSI based on master-slice method, has been developed.
 During every phase of designing LSI, various errors are prone to occur. These errors are mostly detected after having actually manufacturing the LSI.
 The main purpose of this CAD system is as follows:
 1. Error-free design.
 2. Lower design cost.
 3. Shorter design cycles.
 This paper mainly describes two systems, one for correction patterns of interconnected terminals and the other for design verification of corrected patterns.
