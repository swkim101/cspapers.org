Web extraction systems attempt to use the immense amount of unlabeled text in the Web in order to create large lists of entities and relations. Unlike traditional IE methods, the Web extraction systems do not label every mention of the target entity or relation, instead focusing on extracting as many different instances as possible while keeping the precision of the resulting list reasonably high. URES is a Web relation extraction system that learns powerful extraction patterns from unlabeled text, using short descriptions of the target relations and their attributes. The performance of URES is further enhanced by classifying its output instances using the properties of the extracted patterns. The features we use for classification and the trained classification model are independent from the target relation, which we demonstrate in a series of experiments. In this paper we show how the introduction of a simple rule based NER can boost the performance of URES on a variety of relations. We also compare the performance of URES to the performance of the state-of-the-art KnowItAll system, and to the performance of its pattern learning component, which uses a simpler and less powerful pattern language than URES.
