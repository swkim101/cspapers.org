A common issue in deformable object detection is finding a good way to position the parts. This issue is even more outspoken when considering detection and pose estimation for 3D objects, where parts should be placed in a three-dimensional space. Some methods extract the 3D shape of the object from 3D CAD models. This limits their applicability to categories for which such models are available. Others represent the object with a predefined and simple shape (e.g. a cuboid). This extends the applicability of the model, but in many cases the pre-defined shape is too simple to properly represent the object in 3D. In this paper we propose a new method for the detection and pose estimation of 3D objects, that does not use any 3D CAD model or other 3D information. Starting from a simple and general 3D shape, we learn in a weakly supervised manner the 3D part locations that best fit the training data. As this method builds on a iterative estimation of the part locations, we introduce several speedups to make the method fast enough for practical experiments. We evaluate our model for the detection and pose estimation of faces and cars. Our method obtains results comparable with the state of the art, it is faster than most of the other approaches and does not need any additional 3D information.
