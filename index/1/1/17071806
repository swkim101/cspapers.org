Being able to write correctly is a valuable asset for future CS professionals and an important learning tool, but teaching to write is difficult both for professors and students. Part of this difficulty is that writing is taught using unverifiable concepts such as style, and is significantly based on intuition. In this paper we present an engineering approach to writing, in which engineering principles are used to teach and assess writing. The results are as good, and much better in some cases, and teaching and learning become easier.
