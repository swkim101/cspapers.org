Blog/news search engines are very important channels to reach information about the real-time happenings. In this paper, we study the popular queries collected over one year period and compare their search results returned by a blog search engine (i.e., Technorati) and a news search engine (i.e., Google News). We observed that the numbers of hits returned by the two search engines for the same set of queries were highly correlated, suggesting that blogs often provide commentary to current events reported in news. As many popular queries are related to some events, we further observed a high cohesiveness among the returned search results for these queries.
