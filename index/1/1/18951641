A rule-based object/task modelling approach is proposed which is characterized by specifying object behaviors and domain rules in terms of object-oriented logic programming, and specifying tasks and meta-rules in terms of network-oriented formalism. In addition the concepts of associations, virtual objects, multiple level integrity control and net expressions are introduced. The object-oriented logic programming system is extended for supporting the semantic modelling, and an explicit control knowledge representation mechanism is developed. This approach may be viewed as a step to the integration of object-oriented programming, logic programming, semantic modelling and event modelling, and to the combination of forward chaining and backward chaining techniques. Therefore, it can provide complementary benefits in deductive query support, integrity control, explicit control knowledge representation and intelligent user interface, and enhance the flexibility and extendibility of knowledge based systems to accommodate applications in multiple domains, towards a generalized, rule-based management of data, action and operational schemes. This approach is being designed and partially implemented on top of System C [Chen 85b] on a VAX computer.
