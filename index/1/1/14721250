We study Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) where robots have to be allocated dynamically to tasks. The task schedule is unknown in advance. We approach the problem by using mobile robots and sensor network collaboratively. Sensor network computes task assignments and then guides the robots to tasks efficiently. Moreover, we suggest a solution to the MRTA problem which requires groups of robots to be formed. In addition, we discuss practical aspects in implementing algorithms on physical system. We study a particular experimental scenario, emergency handling, as an experimental substrate. In our experimental scenario, events in the environment trigger alarms. An alarm is spatially focused, but has temporal extent (i.e. it remains on until it is turned off by a robot). Alarms are detected by nodes in the static network. The task of the team of robots is to turn off the alarms by notionally responding to the emergency signaled by each alarm. This is done by a robot navigating to the location of the alarm which causes
