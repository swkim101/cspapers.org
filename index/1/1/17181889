We have developed representations and analysis methods for electrical circuits in a deductive system called DUCK. Circuitsare represented as conjunctions of logical predicates. Circuit analysis is done as an iteration of proofs which determine the basic structures in the circuit. Electrical constraints for the circuit are produced from the results of the proofs. The constraints are then solved using propagation methods.
