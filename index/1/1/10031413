This paper introduces a new two-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator producing two translations in the vertical plane. One drawback of existing robots built to realize those dof is their lack of rigidity along the transversal axis, another one being their limited ability to provide very high acceleration. Indeed, these architectures cannot be lightweight and stiff at the same time. The proposed architecture is a spatial mechanism which guarantees a good stiffness along the transversal axis. This parallel architecture is composed by two actuated kinematic chains, and two passive chains built in the transversal plane. The key feature of this robot comes from the passive chains which are coupled for creating a kinematic constraint: the platform stays in one plane. A stiffness analysis shows that the robot can be lighter and stiffer than a classical 2 dof mechanism. A prototype of this robot is presented and preliminary tests show that accelerations above 40 g can be achieved while keeping a low tracking error.
