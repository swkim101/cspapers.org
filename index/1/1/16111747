We present a practical 3D reconstruction method to obtain a high-quality dense depth map from narrow-baseline image sequences captured by commercial digital cameras, such as DSLRs or mobile phones. Depth estimation from small motion has gained interest as a means of various photographic editing, but important limitations present themselves in the form of depth uncertainty due to a narrow baseline and rolling shutter. To address these problems, we introduce a novel 3D reconstruction method from narrow-baseline image sequences that effectively handles the effects of a rolling shutter that occur from most of commercial digital cameras. Additionally, we present a depth propagation method to fill in the holes associated with the unknown pixels based on our novel geometric guidance model. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our new algorithm consistently generates better 3D depth maps than those by the state-of-the-art method.
