We seek to automatically estimate typical durations for events and habits described in Twitter tweets. A corpus of more than 14 million tweets containing temporal duration information was collected. These tweets were classified as to their habituality status using a bootstrapped, decision tree. For each verb lemma, associated duration information was collected for episodic and habitual uses of the verb. Summary statistics for 483 verb lemmas and their typical habit and episode durations has been compiled and made available. This automatically generated duration information is broadly comparable to hand-annotation.
