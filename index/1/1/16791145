This paper describes three programs which perform connectivity rule check, logic gate recognition for logic simulation and circuit connectivity comparison. These programs have been developed for verifying circuit connectivity extracted from mask artwork. Powerful algorithms are used in these programs, including a heuristic graph comparison algorithm, to realize highly practical verification aids. Through the combined use of these programs, more cost-effective verification is possible.
