The synergy of phone sensors (microphone, camera, GPS, etc.), wireless capability, and ever-increasing device density can lead to novel people-centric applications. Unlike traditional sensor networks, the next generation networks may be participatory, interactive, and in the scale of human users. Millions of global data points can be organized on a visual platform, queried, and sophistically answered through human participation. Recent years have witnessed the isolated impacts of distributed knowledge sharing (Wikipedia), social networks, sensor networks, and mobile communication. We believe that significant more impact is latent in their convergence, that can to be drawn out through innovations in applications. This demonstration, called Micro-Blog, is a first step towards this goal.
