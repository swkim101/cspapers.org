Translation of proper names is generally recognized as a signiﬁcant problem in many multi-lingual text and speech processing applications. Even when large bilingual lexicons used for machine translation (MT) and cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) provide signiﬁcant coverage of the words encountered in the text, a signiﬁcant portion of the tokens not covered by such lexicons are proper names (cf e.g. [3]). For CLIR applications in particular, proper names and technical terms are particularly important, as they carry some of the more distinctive information in a query. In IR systems where users provide very short queries (e.g. 2-3 words), their importance grows even further. Proper names are amenable to a speech-inspired translation approach. When writing a foreign name in ones native language, one tries to preserve the way it sounds. i.e. one uses an orthographic representation which, when “read aloud” by a native speaker of the language sounds as it would when spoken by a speaker of the foreign language — a process referred to as transliteration . If mechanisms were available (a) to render, say, an English name in its phonemic form, and (b) to convert this phonemic string into the or-thography of, say, Mandarin Chinese, then one would have a mechanism for transliterating English names using Chinese characters. The ﬁrst part has been addressed extensively in the automatic text-to-speech synthesis literature. This paper describes a statistical approach for the second part. Several
