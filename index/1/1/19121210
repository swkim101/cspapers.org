Despite important progress in the area of intelligent systems, most such systems still lack commonsense knowledge that appears crucial for enabling smarter, more human-like decisions. In this paper, we present a system based on a series of algorithms to distill Ô¨Åne-grained disambiguated commonsense knowledge from massive amounts of text. Our WebChild 2.0 knowledge base is one of the largest commonsense knowledge bases available, describing over 2 million disambiguated concepts and activities, connected by over 18 million assertions.
