Object segmentation and classification is an important and difficult task in robotic vision. The task is complicated even further when the different objects are partially or completely occluded. Allowing a robot to take measurements from varying points of view can help in alleviating or completely removing occlusions. A robot equipped with an RGB-D sensor has the capability of searching for new and better points of view to facilitate object recognition. In this work, a motion control algorithm is designed and implemented on a mobile robot to facilitate object classification in RGB-D data of clustered objects.
