Modern buildings include an indoor climate control system, installed and operated to maintain a comfortable environment for the building occupants. However, these climate control systems consume a significant amount of energy due to an inefficient control algorithm. Improving energy efficiency is critical to reducing energy consumption, costs, and the emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, we present INPRESS: Indoor Climate Prediction and Evaluation System for Energy Efficiency using Sensor Networks. INPRESS uses meteorological weather data and the indoor climate conditions collected by sensor nodes to evaluate and improve the energy efficient climate control of an indoor space.
