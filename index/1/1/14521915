Patent search tasks are difficult and challenging, often requiring expert patent analysts to spend hours, even days, sourcing relevant information. To aid them in this process, analysts use Information Retrieval systems and tools to cope with their retrieval tasks.

In this poster, we report a subset of the findings of a survey of patent analysts conducted to elicit their search requirements.
