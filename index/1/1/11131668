The appearance of objects in the real world is related to the complex ways they reflect the light impinging on them from the light source present. Different materials reflect l ight in various ways, but one thing common to most materials is the fact that they are neither totally matte nor total ly mirror-l ike; it is a combination of these two modes of reflection that governs the appearance of most objects. In short, it is the sum of diffuse and specular reflections that determines the total reflection of light off surfaces. Based on this statement, we observe that a shift in color occurs under some conditions, which leads to the development of an algorithm designed to identify the color changes which are due to specular reflection. The motivation behind the quest for highlights originates in two opposing properties highlights possess. On one hand, highlights in images provide important information which can be used to determine shape, size, or curvature of objects [1,2,3,9]. On the other hand, highlights cause numerous problems for algorithms which require correspondence between consecutive images, such as stereo or motion algorithms [6,8].
