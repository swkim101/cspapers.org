This paper tackles the problem of collecting reliable human assessments. We show that knowing multiple scores for each example instead of a single score results in a more reliable estimation of a system quality. To reduce the cost of collecting these multiple ratings, we propose to use matrix completion techniques to predict some scores knowing only scores of other judges and some common ratings. Even if prediction performance is pretty low, decisions made using the predicted score proved to be more reliable than decision based on a single rating of each example.
