We present a control strategy that permits a fixed wing UAV to visually track a ground target. A pursuit-evasion strategy aims at optimizing the visibility of the pursuer UAV after having predicted the best action for the evading target. This is achieved by using two iterative methods that optimise various mission based criteria: obstacle avoidance and visibility maximisation for the UAV and stealthy motions for the target.
