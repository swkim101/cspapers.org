This paper describes the motivation, design, implementation, and some preliminary performance characteristics of BIGMAC II, a macro definition capability for creating language enhancers and translators. BIGMAC II enables the user to specify transformations through STREX, a FORTRAN-like language, which enables the specification of macros which are then used to interpretively alter incoming programs. BIGMAC II is specially adapted to the processing of FORTRAN programs. This paper shows how it can be used as a deprocedurizer (or flattener), a dialect-to-dialect translator, a portability and version control aid, and a device for creating language enhancements as sophisticated as new control structures and abstract data types.
