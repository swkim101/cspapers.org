Location games model competitive placement of services such as fast-food chains, product positioning, as well as political competition. We consider a two-player, sequential location game, with n stages. At each stage, players 1 and 2 choose locations from a feasible set in sequence. After all moves are made, consumers each purchase one unit of the good from the closest location, breaking ties uniformly at random. Since player 1 has a natural first-mover disadvantage here (player 2 can obtain a payoff of half the total market just by replicating player 1’s moves), we examine her worst-case payoff. When the number of stages is known to both players we show that (i) if the feasible locations form a finite set in R, player 1 must obtain at least 1 d+1 in the single-move game, and there exist games in which player 1 obtains no more than 1 d+1 ; (ii) in the original Hotelling game (uniformly distributed consumers on the unit interval), player 1 obtains 1 2 even in the multiple stage game, using a strategy which is oblivious of player 2’s locations. However, player 1’s worst-case payoff suffers if she does not know the number of moves, but player 2 does. In the Hotelling game, where the number of stages is either 1 or 2, player 1’s payoff falls to 5 12 . If she has no information at all about n, we provide a lower bound for her worst-case payoff: it must equal at least half the payoff of the single-stage game. ∗School of Computer Science, E-mail: shuchi@cs.cmu.edu. †Graduate School of Industrial Administration, E-mail: urajan@andrew.cmu.edu. ‡Graduate School of Industrial Administration, E-mail: ravi@cmu.edu. §Graduate School of Industrial Administration, E-mail: asinha@andrew.cmu.edu.
