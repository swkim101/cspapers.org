This paper presents a framework, Orthrus, that can accommodate multiple collective-I/O implementations, each optimized for some performance aspects, and dynamically select the best performing one accordingly to current workload and system performance bottleneck. We have implemented Orthrus in the ROMIO library. Our experimental results with representative MPI-IO benchmarks show that Orthrus can significantly improve the performance of collective I/O under various workloads and system scenarios.
