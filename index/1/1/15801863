Events are the fundamental abstractions to study the dynamic world. We believe that the next generation of web (i.e. event-web), will focus on interconnections between events as they occur across space and time [3]. In fact we argue that the real value of large volumes of microblog data being created daily lies in its inherent spatio-temporality, and its correlation with the real-world events. In this context, we studied the structural properties of a corpus of 5,835,237 Twitter microblogs, and found it to exhibit Power laws across space and time, much like those exhibited by events in multiple domains. The properties studied over microblogs on different topics can be applied to study relationships between related events, as well as data organization for event-based, real-time, and location-aware applications.
