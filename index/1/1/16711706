This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art in multibeam antennas, as particularly applicable to data communications satellites, and analyzes a new configuration to meet such specific needs over the U.S. during the 1980's. Three basic forms of multibeam antennas are describedâ€”those providing space diversity, polarization diversity and variable-shaped beams. The use of lenses, reflectors and phased arrays in various multiheam configurations is described. Hardware developments in the field which are surveyed include both waveguide and TEM lenses, and an off- set fed reflector for INTELSAT V.
