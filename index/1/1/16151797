We describe a problem solver that met nonchronological backtracking in situations involving tradeoffs. The novel aspect of the problem solver is it ability to weigh advantages and disadvantages of alternatives at choke points. Whenever untenable situations arise, this information is available to the backtracker to determine the most appropriate backtracking point. By endowing the backtracker with access to domain-specific knowledge, a highly contextual approach to reasoning in dependency directed backtracking situations can be achieved.
