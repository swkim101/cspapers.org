A cluster of small cooperative robots capable of executing measurement and manipulation tasks is being developed within the scope of a European project. The robots are autonomous and have an overall dimension in the order of 1 cm/sup 3/. In this paper we present the concept of the robots, along with possible locomotion modules based on piezoelectric stick-slip actuators. Tools can be added to the robot for different measurements and manipulations. The integration of an AFM probe on the robot has been realized as a high resolution sensor for localization purposes and for measurements. First experimental results are shown.
