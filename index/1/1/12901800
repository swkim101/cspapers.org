In one form or another, the phenomena associated with "meaning transfer" have become central issues in a lot of recent work on semantics. Speaking very roughly, we can partition approaches to the phenomenon along two dimensions, which yield four basic points of departure. In the first two, people have considered transfer in basically semantic or linguistic terms. Some have concentrated on what we might call the paradigmatic aspects of transfer, focusing on the productive lexical processes that map semantic features into features --- for example, the "grinding" rule that applies to turn the names of animals into mass terms denoting their meat or fur. This the approach that's involved in most recent work on "regular polysemy," "systematic polysemy," and the like, for example by Apresjan, Ostler and Atkins, Briscoe and Copestake, Nunberg and Zaenen, Wilensky, Kilgarriff and a number of other people. Other people have emphasized the syncategorematic aspects of transfer; that is, the ways meaning shifts and specifications are coerced in the course of semantic composition. This is an approach that hass been developed in particular by James Pustejovsky and his collaborators, building on earlier work on type shifting.
