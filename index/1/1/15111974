The ability of rovers to localize themselves on a global reference is of high importance for the evolution of future robotic space exploration activities. This is why ESA has funded a research through the Network/Partnering Initiative (NPI) to conceptualize and develop methods concerning the global self-localization of rovers. The approach followed in our NPI activity is the one of the distinctive landmarks, or Regions of Interest (ROIs). In this scenario the rover is fed with the location and properties of all the ROIs in a predefined area, e.g. the uncertainty ellipse of its landing, as captured by means of satellite imagery. The rover detects ROIs utilizing its onboard sensors and then matches these constellations with the ones that had been fed to it initially. The paper in hand presents the methods utilized, in the context of global self localization under the aforementioned NPI activity, to match sparse networks of semantic ROIs among rover and orbital imagery. The matching method has been tested on real experimental data as well as on simulated ones so as to assess the performance optimally.
