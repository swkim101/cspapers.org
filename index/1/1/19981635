Students in science and engineering are poorly served by most general-purpose CS-1 courses, which rarely discuss scientific problems or applications. At the same time, fewer and fewer computer science students are exposed to scientific ideas or thinking in any of their introductory courses. This divide hurts both sides: scientists and engineers must struggle later in their careers to pick up the computing skills and mindset they need to cope with increasingly computational disciplines, while CS graduates lack the background knowledge needed to work in “relevant” domains ranging from health care to climate modeling. The aim of this panel is to explore what each community thinks it and its students need, and to discuss what is being done to meet those needs at leading institutions. Topics will include:
