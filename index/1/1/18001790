A modular analogue neuro-chip set with on-chip learning capability is developed for active noise canceling. The analogue neuro-chip set incorporates the error backpropagation learning rule for practical applications, and allows pin-to-pin interconnections for multi-chip boards. The developed neuro-board demonstrated active noise canceling without any digital signal processor. Multi-path fading of acoustic channels, random noise, and nonlinear distortion of the loud speaker are compensated by the adaptive learning circuits of the neuro-chips. Experimental results are reported for cancellation of car noise in real time.
