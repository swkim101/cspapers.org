The 3DCGiRAM is a 3D-graphic accelerator designed for photo-realistic image synthesis. The 3DCGiRAM is equipped with graphics processing units that perform ray-object intersection calculations and intensity calculations for rays traced over a 3D virtual object space. It also has a hardwareaccelerated 3D line generator, which effectively finds objects in a grid space that are likely to intersect traced rays. In this paper, we present the architecture of the 3DCGiRAM for interactive ray tracing and discuss its performance based on the experimental results obtained through rendering a raytraced walk-through animation. The experimental results show that the 3DCGiRAM with small on-chip caches running at 333MHz will be able to have a potential to synthesize a ray-traced walk-through animation at a rate of 10 frames per second.
