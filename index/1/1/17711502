This paper addresses the task of change analysis of correlated multi-sensor systems. The goal of change analysis is to compute the anomaly score of each sensor when we know that the system has some potential difference from a reference state. Examples include validating the proper performance of various car sensors in the automobile industry. We solve this problem based on a neighborhood preservation principle - If the system is working normally, the neighborhood graph of each sensor is almost invariant against the fluctuations of experimental conditions. Here a neighborhood graph is defined based on the correlation between sensor signals. With the notion of stochastic neighborhood, our method is capable of robustly computing the anomaly score of each sensor under conditions that are hard to be detected by other naive methods.
