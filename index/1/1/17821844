Difficult and intriguing information retrieval (IR) problems derive from what I call complementary but disjoint (CBD) structures within the literature of science. Complementary refers to the relationship between two separate scientific arguments which, when combined, yield important inferences and insights not apparent in the separate arguments. Corresponding to the two arguments are two complementary literatures. Each literature (ideally) is the “complete” set of articles that contain the argument in question. Disjoint literatures have no articles in common, do not cite or mention each other, and are not co-cited. If two complementary literatures are also disjoint, the possibility is worth investigating that the combined arguments and the inferences to which they lead might not be made explicit anywhere within the published record of science. The ever-increasing fragmentation of science into mutually-isolated specialties probably assures a limitless supply and combinatorial growth of implicit connections, some of which may be unknown solutions to important problems. These solutions are worth seeking. I have previously analyzed and reported three examples of CBD literature pairs, each of which led to a novel and plausible medical hypothesis that appeared to merit testing [1-5]. The universe of published medical literature, not a selected subset, was the target of a process that depended not only on extensive use of online information services but also on reading the text of many hundreds of medical articles. My claim that novel inferences can bc drawn from CBD literatures requires clarification. CBD literatures of course can never attain their ideal state of complclencss as specified in the definition, but they are presumed to approach as near to completion as attainable with a diligent search of the literature, On that basis, one can smkc a
