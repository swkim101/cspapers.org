Aiming to apply soft actuators in driving a walking robot, the design, fabrication and locomotion of a bio-inspired printable hexapod robot are studied. The robot mimics the insect's design and walking posture by driving six legs with alternating tripod gait which provides its locomotive adaptability on flat terrains. The versatile movements of the robot's leg are achieved by using soft and multiple degree-of-freedom actuators. The actuators are made by dielectric elastomers with a simple mechanism based on antagonistic configuration. By using 3D printing method, the actuator can be embedded into the frame of the robot and a control system is developed. Finally, the robot's locomotion is successfully demonstrated with variable speeds and stride lengths.
