AVANCE1 is an integrated application development and run-time system. It provides facilities for programming with shared and persistent objects, transactions and processes. The architecture is designed with decentralization in mind by having a large object identifier space and a remote procedure call interface to objects. Emphasis in this paper is on the programming language PAL and its relation with the underlying virtual machine.
