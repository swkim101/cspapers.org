As a result of a large-scale invasion of expert sys-tems (ES) in almost all areas of human life, a ma-jor problem related to their quality and reliability wasidentified. This paper presents a possible solution tothis problem which consists of extending the function-ality of expert systems with a built-in quality assur-ance facility to allow the ES developer constantly tokeep track of the most important structural and func-tional characteristics of the model.
