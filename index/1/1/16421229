The most recent report of the Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001) suggests that updated curricula must reflect the broadening nature of our discipline. Two areas that are included in the strawman draft of CC2001 are software engineering (SE) and human-computer interaction (HC). While the first inclination might be to incorporate these minimal HC concepts in a traditional SE course, we propose a different approach. This paper outlines a project oriented HC course in which we are able to emphasize SE in the context of HC concepts. We include an overview of course content that illustrates our approach.
