Currently, none of the existing online social networks (OSNs) enables its users to make new friends without revealing their private information. This leaves the users in a vulnerable position when searching for new friends. We propose a solution which enables a user to compute her profile similarity with another user in a privacy-preserving way. Our solution is designed for a realistic OSN environment, where a pair of users is unlikely to be online at the same time.
