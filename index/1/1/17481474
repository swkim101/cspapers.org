Currently, the Internet provides access to a very large number and wide variety of information sources (e.g., textual databases, sites containing technical reports, directory listings), and systems to access these sources (e.g., World Wide Web, Gopher, WAIS). The challenge is to provide easy, efficient, robust and secure access to this information and other kinds (e.g., relational and object oriented databases). This aim of this panel is to explore whether there are any new technical problems, relevant to the Database field, that need to be solved in order to realize such global information systems. In particular, we debate whether existing techniques from database systems (e.g., multidatabases and distributed databases) can be applied or straigtitforwardly extended to global information systems. Furthermore, we attempt to establish realistic goals for database technologies in global information systems. Some of the specific issues discussed are the following:
