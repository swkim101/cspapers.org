Reactive agents are suitable for representing physical resources in manufacturing control systems. An important challenge of agent-based manufacturing control systems is to develop formal and structured approaches to support their specification and verification. This paper proposes a logic-based approach, by generalising that of model checking multiagent systems, for the reconfigurability of reactive multiagent systems. Two reconfigurability scenarios are studied, for the resulting system being a monolithic system or an individual module, and their computational complexity results are given.
