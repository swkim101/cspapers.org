Result diversification has gained a lot of attention as a way to answer ambiguous queries and to tackle the redundancy problem in the results. In the last decade, diversification has been applied on or integrated into the process of PageRank- or eigenvector-based methods that run on various graphs, including social networks, collaboration networks in academia, web and product co-purchasing graphs. For these applications, the diversification problem is usually addressed as a bicriteria objective optimization problem of relevance and diversity. However, such an approach is questionable since a query-oblivious diversification algorithm that recommends most of its results without even considering the query may perform the best on these commonly used measures. In this paper, we show the deficiencies of popular evaluation techniques of diversification methods, and investigate multiple relevance and diversity measures to understand whether they have any correlations. Next, we propose a novel measure called expanded relevance which combines both relevance and diversity into a single function in order to measure the coverage of the relevant part of the graph. We also present a new greedy diversification algorithm called BestCoverage, which optimizes the expanded relevance of the result set with (1-1/e)-approximation. With a rigorous experimentation on graphs from various applications, we show that the proposed method is efficient and effective for many use cases.
