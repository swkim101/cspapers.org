Developing analytical applications for IoT based on sensor signal processing tends to be complicated as applications are executed as sequence of steps comprising of multiple alternative algorithms, including suitable feature extraction modules depending on the goal of the application. Experience shows that developers spend considerable time and effort in performing feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. In this paper we propose a framework based on a relevant case study which allows developers to drag and drop algorithms to create a workflow chain, automatically select the most relevant signal features for the particular analytic application using a training data set to generate a model and deploy the model for use. The method reduces the effort and cost of development which is deemed highly important for the analytics industry.
