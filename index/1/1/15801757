In recent years, there has been a lot of research effort in the periodic push model where the server repetitively disseminates information without explicit request. We call the broadcast model supporting backchannel as hybrid broadcast. In this paper, we devise a new transaction processing algorithm called O-PreH, which is based on the notion of  pre-reordering. If one or more conflicts for mobile transactions are found from server's periodic invalidation report, conflict orders are determined not to violate the consistency( pre-reordering) and then the remaining operations have to be executed pessimistically.
