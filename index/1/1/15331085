Conceptual graphs are very useful for representing structured knowledge. However, existing formulations of fuzzy conceptual graphs are not suitable for matching images of natural scenes. This paper presents a new variation of fuzzy conceptual graphs that is more suited to image matching. This variant differentiates between a model graph that describes a known scene and an image graph which describes an input image. A new measurement is defined to measure how well a model graph matches an image graph. A fuzzy graph matching algorithm is developed based on error-tolerant subgraph isomorphism. Test results show that the matching algorithm gives very good results for matching images to predefined scene models.
