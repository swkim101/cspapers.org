A system is described for acquiring a context-sensitive, phrase structure grammar which is applied by a best-path, bottom-up, deterministic parser. The grammar was based on English news stories and a high degree of success in parsing in reported. Overall, this research concludes that CSG is a computationally and conceptually tractable approach to the construction of phrase structure grammar for news story text.
