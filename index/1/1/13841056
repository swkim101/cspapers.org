Existing domain adversarial adaptation methods based on single domain discriminator only align the source and target data distributions without exploiting the complex multimode structures. In this paper, we present a multi-adversarial domain adaptation (MADA) approach, which captures multimode structures to enable fine-grained alignment of different data distributions based on multiple domain discriminators. The adaptation can be achieved by stochastic gradient descent with the gradients computed by back-propagation in linear-time. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation datasets.
