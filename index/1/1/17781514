Rather than rely on fully unsupervised topic models, we use existing aggregated survey data to inform the inferred topics, a class of topic model supervision referred to as collective supervision. We introduce and explore a variety of topic model variants and provide an empirical analysis, with conclusions of the most effective models for this task.
