The purported advantages of an object-oriented approach to software development are widely documented. From an educational standpoint, one of the most usefid benefits is that the model of cooperating objects is intuitively close to human experience and expectation. Object-Oriented Technology (OOT) also offers a fresh perspective on the long-sought grail of software reuse, and it encourages a development trajectory in which upper level abstractions must be properly addressed before detailed implementation is broached. Of course, some experience with the method places these promises into a realistic context, and reveals that there is still no mechanical path to good software design. Many decisions remain informed judgments based primarily on previous contact with similar situations. Nevertheless, in the judgement of the authors, 00T provides a superior organizational framework for managing the complexity of the software development process.
