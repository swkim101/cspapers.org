In CMOS circuits, glitches account for a sizeable part of the total power consumption. In this paper, we present a fast and memory efficient power estimation technique for CMOS circuits which estimates the power consumed due to the glitches. Our technique is based on the notion of tagged transition waveforms. In particular, we approximate the correlation between transition waveforms for two signal lines by the correlation between the steady state values of these lines. We obtain an order of magnitude speed up over an exact method with an average error of only 1%.
