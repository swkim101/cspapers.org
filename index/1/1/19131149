Viewers on these platforms are able to follow multiple streams of live events simultaneously, while engaging discussions with friends. However, existing approaches for selecting live streaming channels still focus on satisfying individual preferences of users, without considering the need to accommodate real-time social interactions among viewers and to diversify the content of streams. In this paper, therefore, we formulate a new Social-aware Diverse and Preferred Live Streaming Channel Query (SDSQ) that jointly selects a set of diverse and preferred live streaming channels and a group of socially tight viewers. We prove that SDSQ is NP-hard and inapproximable within any factor, and design SDSSel, a 2-approximation algorithm with a guaranteed error bound. We perform a user study on Twitch with 432 participants to validate the need of SDSQ and the usefulness of SDSSel. We also conduct large-scale experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several baselines in terms of solution quality and efficiency.
