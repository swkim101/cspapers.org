Described in this paper is the use of a commercially available Interactive Graphics System for electronic design, drafting and documentation. The system is used starting from a rough schematic and ending with a tested, manufactured printed circuit board.
 Discussed in the paper are major aspects and quantitative results obtained in a range of computer aided tasks. These range from initial P.C. design and prototyping to final production, documentation and testing as performed in a relatively small engineering department. The turnkey system employed is Computervision's Designer TM System, with output to Computer Automation's Capable TM printed circuit board tester.
 Major uses of the system include its use in a novel way at the prototyping stage to produce P.C. prototype circuit boards. Others include the use of its integral minicomputer based P.C. board routing programs supplemented by interactive graphics as well as the use of a series of computer based design verification features both for checking physical constraints and for ensuring data integrity and consistency within the entire documentation package. These verifications eliminate many forms of manual checking. Actual examples are presented.
