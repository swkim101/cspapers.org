We consider wireless downlink data channels where the transmission power of each base station is time-shared between a dynamic number of active users as in CDMA/HDR systems. We derive analytical results relating user performance, in terms of blocking probability and data throughput, to cell size and traffic density. These results are used to address a number of practically interesting issues, including the trade-off between cell coverage and cell capacity and the choice of efficient scheduling and admission control schemes.
