In this paper, with the help of knowledge base, we build and formulate a semantic space to connect the source and target languages, and apply it to the sequence-to-sequence framework to pro-pose a Knowledge-Based Semantic Em-bedding (KBSE) method. In our KB-SE method, the source sentence is Ô¨Årstly mapped into a knowledge based semantic space, and the target sentence is generated using a recurrent neural network with the internal meaning preserved. Experiments are conducted on two translation tasks, the electric business data and movie data, and the results show that our proposed method can achieve outstanding performance, compared with both the traditional SMT methods and the existing encoder-decoder models.
