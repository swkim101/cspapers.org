Time-to-event outcomes based data can be modelled using survival regression methods which can predict these outcomes in different censored data applications in diverse fields such as engineering, economics and healthcare. Predictive models are built by inferring from the censored variable in time-to-event data, which differentiates them from other regression methods. Censoring is represented as a binary indicator variable and machine learning methods have been tuned to account for the censored attribute. Active learning from censored data using survival regression methods can make the model query a domain expert for the time-to-event label of the sampled instances. This offers higher advantages in the healthcare domain where a domain expert can interactively refine the model with his feedback. With this motivation, we address this problem by providing an active learning based survival model which uses a novel model discriminative gradient based sampling scheme. We evaluate this framework on electronic health records (EHR), publicly available survival and synthetic censored datasets of varying diversity. Experimental evaluation against state of the art survival regression methods indicates the higher discriminative ability of the proposed approach. We also present the sampling results for the proposed approach in an active learning setting which indicate better learning rates in comparison to other sampling strategies.
