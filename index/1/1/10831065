The emerging technology of object oriented programming is just beginning to be introduced into the computer science curriculum. In most schools, it will be introduced first at the more advanced levels, prior to inclusion in introductory courses, even though the object oriented paradigm may be more suitable for teaching basic computer science concepts.
This paper contains the experiences gained teaching a seminar on object oriented programming to a small group of mixed graduate and undergraduate students at a school with no doctoral program. The successes and difficulties faced by both students and instructor are explored.
