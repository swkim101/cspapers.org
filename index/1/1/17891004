A new approach to analyze simplicial complexes in Euclidean 3-space R3 is described. First, methods from topology are used to analyze triangulated 3-manifolds in R3. Then it is shown that these methods can in fact be applied to arbitrary simplicial complexes in R3 after (simulating) the process of thickening a complex to a 3-manifold homotopic to it. As a consequence considerable structural information about the complex can be determined and certain d~crete problems solved as well. For example, it is shown how to determine the homology groups, as well as concrete representations of their generators, for a given complex K. Further, given a l-cycle or 2-cycle in K it is shown how to express th~ cycle in terms of the generators of a homology group, which solves the problem of classifying cycles up to their homology class. An application is to the classification of simplicial maps up to their actions on homology groups. Recent developments in analyzing molecular structures through a dual simplicial complex, called Delaunay complex, haa further enhanced the need for computin structural information about simplicial complexes in 5 R . This paper develops basic techniques to manipulate and analyze structures of complexes in R3.
