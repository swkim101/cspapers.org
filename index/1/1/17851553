In this paper, we address the problem of gait generation for bipedal robots. We cast the determination of a Center of Mass (CoM) reference trajectory for a given Zero Moment Point (ZMP) desired behaviour as a stable inversion problem for non-minimum phase systems and obtain an analytical solution for any given ZMP trajectory. Our method exploits results from our previous research, in which we derived a family of bounded CoM trajectories associated to a given desired ZMP trajectory.
