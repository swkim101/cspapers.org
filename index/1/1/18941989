Resource provisioning, the task of planning sufficient amounts of resources to meet service level agreements, has become an important management task in emerging cloud computing services. In this paper, we present a stochastic modeling approach to guide the resource provisioning task for future service clouds as the demand grows large. We focus on on-demand services and consider service availability as the key quality of service constraint. A specific scenario under consideration is when resources can be measured in base instances. We develop an asymptotic provisioning methodology that utilizes tight performance bounds for the Erlang loss system to determine the minimum capacity levels that meet the service availability requirements. We show that our provisioning solutions are not only asymptotically exact but also provide better QoS guarantees at all load conditions.
