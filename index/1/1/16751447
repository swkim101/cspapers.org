A famous theorem of I. Fa`ry states that any planar graph can be drawn in the plane so that all edges are straight-line segments and no two edges cross. The <italic>angular resolution</italic> of such a drawing is the minimum angle subtended by any pair of incident edges. The <italic>angular resolution</italic> of a planar graph is the maximum angular resolution over all such planar straight-line drawings of the graph. In a recent paper by Formann et al., <italic>Drawing graphs in the plane with high resolution</italic>, Symp. on Found. of Comp. Sci. (1990), the following question is posed: does there exist a constant <italic>r(d)</italic> > 0 such that every planar graph of maximum degree <italic>d</italic> has angular resolution ≥ <italic>r(d)</italic>? We answer this   question in the affirmative by showing that any planar graph of maximum degree <italic>d</italic> has angular resolution at least α<supscrpt><italic>d</italic></supscrpt> radians where 0 < α < 1 is a constant. In an effort to assess whether or not this lower bound is existentially tight (up to constant α), we analyze a very natural linear program that bounds the angular resolution of any fixed planar graph <italic>G</italic> from &OHgr;(1/<italic>d</italic>), although currently, we are unable to settle this issue for general planar graphs. For the class of outerplanar graphs with triangulated interior and maximum degree <italic>d</italic>, although currently, we are unable to settle this issue for general planar graphs. For the class of outerplanar graphs with   triangulated interior and maximum degree <italic>d</italic>, we show not only that &OHgr;(1/<italic>d</italic>) is lower bound on angular resolution, but in fact, this angular resolution can be achieved in a planar straight-line drawing where all interior faces are <italic>similar</italic> isosceles triangles. Additional results are contained in the full paper.
