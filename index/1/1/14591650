This paper introduces Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) for text classi(cid:12)-cation. While regular Support Vector Machines (SVMs) try to induce a general decision function for a learning task, Transduc-tive Support Vector Machines take into account a particular test set and try to minimize misclassi(cid:12)cations of just those particular examples. The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are well suited for text classi(cid:12)cation. These theoretical (cid:12)ndings are supported by experiments on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive methods, espe-ciallyfor smalltraining sets, cutting the number of labeled training examples down to a twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes an algorithm for training TSVMs e(cid:14)-ciently, handling 10,000 examples and more.
