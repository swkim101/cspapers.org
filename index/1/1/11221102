With significant price drops of large LCD panels public displays are "painting" the urban landscape. Connected over the Internet they constitute a novel communication medium - a network of open pubic displays. One of the challenges with such a novel communication medium is integrating it with existing user communicative ecology -- current information and communication technologies that are already well established and highly used by the general population, e.g., Facebook and Instagram. As one of the most popular activities on these networks is photo sharing a possible solution for integrating networked public displays could be in allowing users to use it as both input and output device for images, i.e., allowing them to a) post situated snapshots onto Facebook through an on-display camera and b) show images on the screens taken through Instagram. In order to replicate what is happening with the images online comments and likes posted about images are also shown on the screen. In this demo we show two applications: 1) Moment Machine -- a public display application that allows taking situated snapshots through on-display camera and posting them to Facebook; and 2) Moments Gallery -- a public display application that shows images, comments, and likes for photos submitted through Instagram and Facebook.
