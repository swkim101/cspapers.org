This paper describes discriminative language modeling for a large vocabulary speech recognition task. We contrast two parameter estimation methods: the perceptron algorithm, and a method based on conditional random fields (CRFs). The models are encoded as deterministic weighted finite state automata, and are applied by intersecting the automata with word-lattices that are the output from a baseline recognizer. The perceptron algorithm has the benefit of automatically selecting a relatively small feature set in just a couple of passes over the training data. However, using the feature set output from the perceptron algorithm (initialized with their weights), CRF training provides an additional 0.5% reduction in word error rate, for a total 1.8% absolute reduction from the baseline of 39.2%.
