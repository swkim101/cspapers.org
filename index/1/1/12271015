This paper presents an overview of some open research problems in the representation of emotion on computers. The issues discussed arise in the context of a broad, albeit shallow, emotion reasoning platform based originally on the ideas of Ortony, Clore, and Collins(Ortony, Clore, & Collins 1988). In addressing these problems we hope to (1) correct and expand our content theory of emotion, and pseudo personality, which underlies all aspects of the research; (2) answer feasibility questions regarding a usable representation of the emotion domain in the computer, and (3) build agents capable of emotional interaction with users. A brief description of a semantics-based AI program, the Affective Reasoner, and its recent multi-media extensions is given. Issues pertaining to affective user modeling, an expert system on emotion eliciting situations, the building of a sympathetic computer, models of relationship, personality in games, and the motivation behind the study of emotion on computers are discussed. References to the current literature and recent workshops are made.
