Traditional ad hoc retrieval models do not take into account the closeness or proximity of terms. Document scores in these models are primarily based on the occurrences or non-occurrences of query-terms considered independently of each other. Intuitively, documents in which query-terms occur closer together should be ranked higher than documents in which the query-terms appear far apart. This paper outlines several term-term proximity measures and develops an intuitive framework in which they can be used to fully model the proximity of all query-terms for a particular topic. As useful proximity functions may be constructed from many proximity measures, we use a learning approach to combine proximity measures to develop a useful proximity function in the framework. An evaluation of the best proximity functions show that there is a significant improvement over the baseline ad hoc retrieval model and over other more recent methods that employ the use of single proximity measures.
