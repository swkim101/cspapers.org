This paper describes the query language of the Genealogical Information System (GENISYS) which provides users with a high level, relational-like view of their data combined with the ability to reference attributes in associated relations by specifying paths from source relations to target relations. The emphasis in the presentation is on the use and implementation of the link selectors used for specifying paths between relations. Link selectors allow users a convenient mechanism for formulating multiple relation queries which are often complex in other query languages.
