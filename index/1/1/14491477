The transition of visual-odometry technology from research demonstrators to commercial applications naturally raises the question: “what is the optimal camera for vision-based motion estimation?” This question is crucial as the choice of camera has a tremendous impact on the robustness and accuracy of the employed visual odometry algorithm. While many properties of a camera (e.g. resolution, frame-rate, global-shutter/rolling-shutter) could be considered, in this work we focus on evaluating the impact of the camera field-of-view (FoV) and optics (i.e., fisheye or catadioptric) on the quality of the motion estimate. Since the motion-estimation performance depends highly on the geometry of the scene and the motion of the camera, we analyze two common operational environments in mobile robotics: an urban environment and an indoor scene. To confirm the theoretical observations, we implement a state-of-the-art VO pipeline that works with large FoV fisheye and catadioptric cameras. We evaluate the proposed VO pipeline in both synthetic and real experiments. The experiments point out that it is advantageous to use a large FoV camera (e.g., fisheye or catadioptric) for indoor scenes and a smaller FoV for urban canyon environments.
