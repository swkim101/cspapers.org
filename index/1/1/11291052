This paper presents an approach for pixel-wise object segmentation for road scenes based on the integration of a color image and an aligned 3D point cloud. In light of the advantage of range information in object discovery, we first produce initial object hypotheses by clustering the sparse 3D point cloud. The image pixels registered to the clustered 3D points are taken as samples to learn each object's prior knowledge. The priors are represented by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of color and 3D location information only, requiring no high-level features. We further formulate the segmentation problem within a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework, which incorporates the learned prior models, together with hard constraints placed on the registered pixels and pairwise spatial constraints to achieve final results. Our algorithm is validated on the challenging KITTI dataset which contains diverse complicated road scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show the superiority of our algorithm.
