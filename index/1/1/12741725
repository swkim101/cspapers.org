The Web is based on a browsing paradigm that makes it difficult to retrieve and integrate data from multiple sites. Today, the only way to achieve this integration is by building specialized applications, which are time-consuming to develop and difficult to maintain. We are addressing this problem by creating the technology and tools for rapidly constructing information mediators that extract, query, and integrate data from web sources. The resulting system, called Ariadne, makes it feasible to rapidly build information mediators that access existing web sources.
