Parsing with categorial grammars often leads to problems such as proliferating lexical ambiguity, spurious parses and overgeneration. This paper presents a parser for French developed on an unification based categorial grammar (FG) which avoids these problems. This parser is a bottom-up chart parser augmented with a heuristic eliminating spurious parses. The unicity and completeness of parsing are proved.
