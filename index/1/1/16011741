It discusses knowledge management techniques that have been developed for and applied to discovered knowledge. It points out special considerations resulting from the regulatory environment as well as general lessons applicable to all organizations that may come to rely on KDD as an integral part of their business operations. It describes our modifications to accepted KDD processes that are needed to account for the longterm use of KDD as part of a dynamic business environment.
