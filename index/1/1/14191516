Expressions are presented for RPS reconnect delays in three basic cases: single path, multiple path with static reconnect, multiple path with dynamic reconnect. The assumption of homogeneous reconnects, which is introduced in the analysis, is shown to be implicit in many prior analyses. This assumption simplifies the resulting equations, but more general equations are also presented for the case where homogeneous reconnects are not assumed. These general results have not appeared previously. This paper also uses the assumption of constrained independence to derive a result for static reconnect which has only been derived previously using the maximum entropy principle. In the case of dynamic reconnect, constrained independence yields an entirely new closed form result. In addition to being a consistent extension of the static reconnect case, this new result is the only closed form expression for dynamic reconnect that yields a correct solution in certain saturated cases. Constrained independence can provide a useful alternative assumption in many other cases where complete independence is known to be only approximately correct.
