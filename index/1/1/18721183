Computing the similarity between unstructured records is a fundamental function in multiple applications. Approximate string matching and full text retrieval techniques do not show the best performance when applied directly, since the information are limited in unstructured records of short record length. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic correlation-based similarity measure. Rather than simply conducting the exact matching tokens of two records, our similarity evaluation enriches the information of records by considering the correlations of tokens. We define the probabilistic correlation between tokens as the probability that these tokens appear in the same records. Then we compute the weight of tokens and discover the correlations of records based on the probabilistic correlations of tokens. Finally, we present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
