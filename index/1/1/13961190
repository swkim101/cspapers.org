The SmartPointer system provides a paradigm for utilizing multiple light-weight client endpoints in a real-time scientific visualization infrastructure. Together, the client and server infrastructure form a new type of data portal for scientific computing. The clients can be used to personalize data for the needs of the individual scientist. This personalization of a shared dataset is designed to allow multiple scientists, each with their laptops or iPaqs to explore the dataset from different angles and with different personalized filters. As an example, iPaq clients can display 2D derived data functions which can be used to dynamically update and annotate the shared data space, which might be visualized separately on a large immersive display such as a CAVE. Measurements are presented for such a system, built upon the ECho middleware system developed at Georgia Tech.
