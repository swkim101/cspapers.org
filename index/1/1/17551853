In this paper we present a purely semantic view on non-monotonic reasoning. We follow the direction pointed in [16] and claim that any nonmonotonic logic can be viewed as a result of transforming some base standard logic by a selection strategy defined on models. The generalized theory of model preference is shortly outlined here together with its use in modeling non-monotonic beliefs.
