We describe ESTRELLA a multimedia object oriented data model developed by MATRA. This model is based upon objects, classes (organized in a lattice) and functions (allow to dynamically implement operations on data and new data types). The valid states of the data base are described by a set of integrity constraints. We propose a document model capable to manage structured documents and to index them with a superimposed codes method. We present as well the associated data manipulation language with a navigational interface and content search operators
