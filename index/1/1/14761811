The global wave of ICT development has become a strong driving force in almost every aspect of human endeavor. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is fast gaining a prominent place in the global marketing matrix. The volume of transactions that are carried out over the internet globally is extremely huge. It is estimated that in the next decade, e-commerce activities would be a major source of foreign exchange, and a key indicator of national development. Developing countries, especially in Africa, tend to lack the infrastructural, economic, and socio-political framework for the development of electronic-commerce in comparison to developed countries. This study investigates the level of development of e-commerce in Botswana, an African country with a good level of e-readiness. The results of the study show that e-commerce development in Botswana is still at the level of intensity, whereby ICT is utilized in most aspects of human endeavor, while most organizations have a low adoption of e-commerce. A cluster analysis of the surveyed organizations shows that only 44% performed well on the e-commerce indicators.
