There has been little work that explores cryptographic temporal constraints, especially for data sharing in cloud computing. In this paper, we present a temporal attribute-based encryption (TABE) scheme to implement temporal constraints for data access control in clouds. This scheme has a constant size for ciphertext, private-key, and a nearly linear-time complexity. In addition, we implement a prototype system to evaluate our proposed approach. Our experimental results not only validate the effectiveness of our scheme and algorithms, but also show our scheme has better performance for integer comparison than BSW's bitwise comparison scheme.
