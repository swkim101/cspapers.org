In this paper, a routing protocol with (end-to-end) QoS support is proposed by giving routing access to bandwidth information. Topology-transparent scheduling (TTS) is chosen as the medium access control (MAC) in both the control and data channels. Based on the information collected in the control channel, bandwidth estimation and reservation at individual nodes are developed to efficiently utilize the data channel resources provided by TTS. The performance of using TTS as the MAC to design a QoS routing protocol is demonstrated through simulations.
