A representation and processing scheme for temporal (time-based) information is presented. Previous computer science approaches to temporal information processing are analyzed. Linguistic analysis of tense, aspect and temporal adverbials provide motivation for an automated general temporal understanding system. A synthetic approach is proposed, combining possible-worlds branching time theory with inertia futures, elements of Montague Grammar, a four-valued logic and the interval semantics time model. Key portions of the model are implemented and demonstrated in a PASCAL program.
