Most of the current software reliability analysis approaches are geared to traditional desktop software systems, which are relatively stable and static throughout their execution. In this paper, we present a framework targeted at mobile computing domain that addresses the uncertainties associated with the reliability analysis in this setting. Moreover, the framework's architecture-centric reliability estimates are leveraged to improve the runtime reliability of the system through dynamic architectural reconfiguration.
