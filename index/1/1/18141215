Owing to the popularity of the PDF format and the continued exploitation of Adobe Reader, the detection of malicious PDFs remains a concern. All existing detection techniques rely on the PDF parser to a certain extent, while the complexity of the PDF format leaves an abundant space for parser confusion. To quantify the difference between these parsers and Adobe Reader, we create a reference JavaScript extractor by directly tapping into Adobe Reader at locations identified through a mostly automatic binary analysis technique. By comparing the output of this reference extractor against that of several opensource JavaScript extractors on a large data set obtained from VirusTotal, we are able to identify hundreds of samples which existing extractors fail to extract JavaScript from. By analyzing these samples we are able to identify several weaknesses in each of these extractors. Based on these lessons, we apply several obfuscations on a malicious PDF sample, which can successfully evade all the malware detectors tested. We call this evasion technique a PDF parser confusion attack. Lastly, we demonstrate that the reference JavaScript extractor improves the accuracy of existing JavaScript-based classifiers and how it can be used to mitigate these parser limitations in a real-world setting.
