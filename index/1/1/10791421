The purpose of this study is to reduce the gap between the requirement analysis and analysis phases of developing multi-agent systems. We utilize KAOS, one of the goal-oriented analysis methodologies, as a requirement analysis method, and propose a model translation into an analysis model for simple and effective development of multi-agent systems.
