Relational database systems do not effectively support complex queries containing quantifiers (quantified queries) that are increasingly becoming important in decision support applications. Generalized quantifiers provide an effective way of expressing such queries naturally. In this paper, we consider the problem of processing quantified queries within the generalized quantifier framework. We demonstrate that current relational systems are ill-equipped, both at the language and at the query processing level, to deal with such queries. We also provide insights into the intrinsic difficulties associated with processing such queries. We then describe the implementation of a quantified query processor, Q2P, that is based on multidimensional and boolean matrix structures. We provide results of performance experiments run on Q2P that demonstrate superior performance on quantified queries. Our results indicate that it is feasible to augment relational systems with query subsystems like Q2P for significant performance benefits for quantified queries in decision support applications.
