Reflection on daily work practices can support informal learning and continuous improvement of work practices. This dissertation aims at supporting reflection by employing sensors and corresponding data visualizations to make employees ask the right questions about their work. Two tools have been developed and initial studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of psychophysiological sensors and proximity sensing for employees in the healthcare domain. The main contribution of this work is the connection of reflective learning and wearable sensors with the goal to persuade employees to reflect. The resulting tools will be evaluated in real work settings.
