An enroute air traffic control (ATC) simulation has provided the basis for research into the marriage of discrete simulation and artificial intelligence techniques. A program which simulates, using real world data, the movement of aircraft in an ATC environment forms a robot's world model. Using a production system to respond to events in the simulated world, the robot is able to look ahead and form a plan of instructions which guarantees safe, expedient aircraft transit. A distinction is made between the real world, where pilots can make mistakes, change their minds, etc., and an idealized plan-ahead world which the robot uses; the overall simulation alternates between updating the real world and planning in the idealized one to investigate the robot's ability to plan in the face of uncertainty.
