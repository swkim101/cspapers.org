Kalman filter is introduced into the neuro-fuzzy deducing system (NFDS) operation to attenuate disturbances in measurement data. Both of Lidar and infrared radar data sets will be engaged into data fusion, because there will exist defective data points within both of which owing to the respectively distinct running mechanism. Data confidence estimator of NFDS derived from contextual information (CI) theory; command center (CC) and yaw-pitch-distance information fusion algorithms, within whose running process both radar data sets are filtered and fed into specified system to extract confidence degree of radar sensors.
