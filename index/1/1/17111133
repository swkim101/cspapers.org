In this paper we propose a system capable of teaching humanoid robots new skills in real-time. The system aims to simplify the robot control and to provide a natural and intuitive interaction between the human and the robot. The key element of the system is exploitation of the human sensorimotor learning ability where a human demonstrator learns how to operate a robot in the same fashion as humans adapt to various everyday tasks. Another key aspect of the proposed system is that the robot learns the task simultaneously while the human is operating the robot. This enables the control of the robot to be gradually transferred from the human to the robot during the demonstration. The control is transferred based on the accuracy of the imitated task. We demonstrated our approach using an experiment where a human demonstrator taught a humanoid robot how to maintain the postural stability in the presence of the perturbations. To provide the appropriate feedback information of the robot's postural stability to the human sensorimotor system, we utilized a custom-built haptic interface. To absorb the demonstrated skill by the robot, we used Locally Weighted Projection Regression machine learning method. A novel approach was implemented to gradually transfer the control responsibility from the human to the incrementally built autonomous robot controller.
