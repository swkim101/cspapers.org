Recent advances show that it is possible to reuse the legacy binary code to bridge the semantic gap in virtual machine introspection (VMI). However, existing such VMI solutions often have high performance overhead (up to hundreds of times slowdown), which significantly hinders their practicality especially for cloud providers who wish to perform real-time monitoring of the virtual machine states. As such, this paper presents HYBRIDBRIDGE, a new system that uses an efficient decoupled execution and training memoization approach to automatically bridge the semantic gap. The key idea is to combine the strengths of both offline training based approach and online kernel data redirection based approach, with a novel training data memoization and fall back mechanism at hypervisor layer that decouples the expensive Taint Analysis Engine (TAE) from the execution of hardware-based virtualization and moves the TAE to softwarebased virtualization. The experimental results show that HYBRIDBRIDGE substantially improves the performance overhead of existing binary code reuse based VMI solutions with at least one order of magnitude for many of the tested benchmark tools including ps, netstat, and lsmod.
