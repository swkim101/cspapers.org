A large proportion of computer-supported tasks—such as design exploration, decision analysis, data presentation, and many kinds of retrieval—can be characterised as user-driven processing of a body of data in search of an outcome that satisfies the user. Clearly such tasks can never be automated fully, but few existing tools offer support for mechanising more than the simplest repetitive aspects of the search. Reconnaissance facilities, in which the computer produces summary reports from exploration in directions suggested by the user, can save the user time and effort by revealing which areas are the most deserving of detailed investigation. The time users are prepared to spend on searching will be more effectively used, improving the likelihood of finding solutions that really meet their needs rather than merely being the first to appear satisfactory. This note describes an implemented example of reconnaissance, based on the parallel coordinates presentation technique.
