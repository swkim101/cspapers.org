Real-world networks, such as the World Wide Web and online social networks, are very large and are evolving rapidly. Thus tracking personalized PageRank in such evolving networks is an important challenge in network analysis and graph mining. In this paper, we propose an efficient online algorithm for tracking personalized PageRank in an evolving network. The proposed algorithm tracks personalized PageRank accurately (i.e., within a given accuracy ε > 0). Moreover it can update the personalized PageRank scores in amortized O(1/ε) iterations for each graph modification. In addition, when m edges are randomly and sequentially inserted, the total number of iterations is expected to be O(log m/ε). We evaluated our algorithm in real-world networks. In average case, for each edge insertion and deletion, our algorithm updated the personalized PageRank in 3us in a web graph with 105M vertices and 3.7B edges, and 20ms in a social network with 42M vertices and 1.5B edges. By comparing existing state-of-the-arts algorithms, our algorithm is 2--290 times faster with an equal accuracy.
