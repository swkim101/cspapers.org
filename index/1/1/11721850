Effort and cost estimation is crucial in software management. Estimation of software size plays a key role in the estimation. Line of Code (LOC) is still a commonly used software size measure. Despite the fact that software sizing is well recognized as an important problem for more than two decades, there is still much problem in existing methods. Conceptual data model is widely used in the requirements analysis for information systems. It is also not difficult to construct conceptual data models in the early stage of developing information systems. Much characteristic of an information system is actually reflected from its conceptual data model. We explore into the use of conceptual data model for estimating LOC. This paper proposes a novel method for estimating LOC for an information system from its conceptual data model through the use of multiple linear regression model. We have validated the method through collecting samples from both the industry and open-source systems.
