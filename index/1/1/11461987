In-station Wi-Fi AP deployment provides opportunistic Wi-Fi access in underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. But such vehicular network faces the obstacle of limited connection time from the MS on the train to the BS at the station. Therefore, maximizing the throughput during the tens of second intervals becomes crucial to overcome such hindrance. To achieve the goal, we propose Accelerometer-Assisted Rate Adaptation (AARA) to divide the motion of the train into four phases; each adopts a specific rate adaptation mechanism. The experiments show that the average throughput of AARA outperforms that of the conventional scheme.
