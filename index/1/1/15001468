This paper documents a study of the real-time Wikipedia edit stream containing over 6 million edits on 1.5 million English Wikipedia articles, during 2015. We focus on answering questions related to identification and use of information cascades between Wikipedia articles, based on author editing activity. Our findings show that by constructing information cascades between Wikipedia articles using editing activity, we are able to construct an alternative linking structure in comparison to the embedded links within a Wikipedia page. This alternative article hyperlink structure was found to be relevant in topic, and timely in relation to external global events (e.g., political activity). Based on our analysis, we contextualise the findings against areas of interest such as events detection, vandalism, edit wars, and editing behaviour.
