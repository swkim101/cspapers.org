Peculiarity rules are a new type of interesting rules which can be discovered by searching the relevance among peculiar data. A main task of mining peculiarity rules is the identification of peculiarity. Traditional methods of finding peculiar data are attribute-based approaches. This paper extends peculiarity oriented mining to relational peculiarity oriented mining. Peculiar data are identified on record level, and peculiar rules are mined and explained in a relational mining framework. The results from preliminary experiments show that relational peculiarity oriented mining is very effective.
