We conduct a pilot study for task-oriented evaluation of Multiword Expression (MWE) in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We propose two different integration strategies for MWE in SMT, which take advantage of different degrees of MWE semantic compositionality and yield complementary improvements in SMT quality on a large-scale translation task.
