Logistic regression (LR) for classification is the workhorse in industry, where a set of predefined classes is required. The model, however, fails to work in the case where the class labels are not known in advance, a problem we term label-drift classification. Label-drift classification problem naturally occurs in many applications, especially in the context of streaming settings where the incoming data may contain samples categorized with new classes that have not been previously seen. Additionally, in the wave of big data, traditional LR methods may fail due to their expense of running time. In this paper, we introduce a novel variant of LR, namely one-pass logistic regression (OLR) to offer a principled treatment for label-drift and large-scale classifications. To handle largescale classification for big data, we further extend our OLR to a distributed setting for parallelization, termed sparkling OLR (Spark-OLR). We demonstrate the scalability of our proposed methods on large-scale datasets with more than one hundred million data points. The experimental results show that the predictive performances of our methods are comparable orbetter than those of state-of-the-art baselines whilst the executiontime is much faster at an order of magnitude. In addition, the OLR and Spark-OLR are invariant to data shuffling and have no hyperparameter to tune that significantly benefits data practitioners and overcomes the curse of big data cross-validationto select optimal hyperparameters.
