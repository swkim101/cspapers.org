David B. Shmoys* We consider the problem of scheduling unrelated parallel machines with costs. Each job is to be processed by exactly one machine; processing job j on machine i requires time pi, and incurs a cost of cij. There are two optimization criteria: minimizing the makespan of the schedule, i.e., the maximum job completion time; and minimizing the total cost. Our main result is as follows. There is a polynomialtime algorithm that, given values C and T, finds a schedule of cost at most C and makespan at most 2T, if there exists a schedule of cost C and makespan T. We also extend this result to a variant of the problem where, instead of a fixed processing time p;j, there is a range of possible processing times for each machine-job pair, and the cost linearly increases as the processing time decreases. Finally, we show that these results imply a polynomial-time 2approximation algorithm to minimize a weighted sum of the cost and the makespan.
