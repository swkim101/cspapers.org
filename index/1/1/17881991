We extend the Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) formalism in order to handle semiringbased constraint systems. This allows us to perform in the same language both constraint solving and optimization. In fact, constraint systems based on semirings are able to model both classical constraint solving and more sophisticated features like uncertainty, probability, fuzzyness, and optimization. We then provide this class of languages with three equivalent semantics: model-theoretic, fixpoint, and proof-theoretic, in the style of CLP programs.
