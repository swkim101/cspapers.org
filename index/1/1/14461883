We propose an efficient distributed method for answering regular path queries (RPQs) on large-scale RDF graphs using partial evaluation. In local computation, we devise a dynamic programming approach to evaluate local and partial answers of an RPQ on each computing site in parallel. In the assembly phase, an automata-based algorithm is proposed to assemble the partial answers of the RPQ into the final results. The experiments on benchmark RDF graphs show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art message passing methods by up to an order of magnitude.
