Private data matching between the data sets of two potentially distrusted parties has a wide range of applications. However, existing solutions have substantial weaknesses and do not meet the needs of many practical application scenarios. In particular, practical private data matching applications often require discouraging the matching parties from spoofing their private inputs. In this paper, we address this challenge by forcing the matching parties to "escrow" the data they use for matching to an auditorial agent, and in the "after-the-fact" period, they undertake the liability to attest the genuineness of the escrowed data.
