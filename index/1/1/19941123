One of many ongoing programs supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) is Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). This is because there is widespread belief that active research experience is one of the most effective ways of attracting undergraduates into careers in mathematics, science, and engineering. NSF is particularly interested in increasing the participation in research of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities.
