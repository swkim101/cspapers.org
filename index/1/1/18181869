The slotted ring protocol which is evaluated in this paper is suitable for use at very large transmission rates. In terms of modelling it is a multiple cyclic server system. A few approximative analytical models of this protocol are presented and evaluated vs the simulation in this paper. The cyclic server model shows to be the most accurate and usable over a wide range of parameters. A performance analysis based on this model is presented.
