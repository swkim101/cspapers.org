How do we know when we have a well formed inheritance scheme? What are the criteria that we can use to judge? These are important questions that we must consider. For most people, inheritance is a rather new design discipline, and its implementation in C++ allows ample opportunity to create both good and bad examples of its use. In this paper we explore how the design criteria for inheritance is both similar to, and different from, conventional design considerations. We also discuss a set of anomalies that should be removed from proposed C++ inheritance schemes [1], which can be used to judge whether inheritance constructs are well formed or not.
