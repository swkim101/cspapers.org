While agents have their initial inclination, they may interact and influence each other, and therefore modify their preferences, until hopefully they reach a stable state and declare their final inclination. At that point, a voting rule is used to aggregate the agentsâ€™ preferences and generate the collective decision. Recent work has modeled the influence phenomenon in the case of voting over a single issue. Here we generalize this model to account for preferences over combinatorially structured domains including several issues. We propose a way to model influence when agents express their preferences as CP-nets. We define two procedures for aggregating preferences in this scenario, by interleaving voting and influence convergence, and study their resistance to bribery.
