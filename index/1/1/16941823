The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from small subtrees on overlapping leaf sets is an important contemporary problem in computational biology. Here we investigate the problem of constructing optimal phylogenetic trees from a weighted set of quartets (resolved trees on four leaves). This problem is faced by a general class of phylogenetic reconstruction techniques where small subsets of the taxon set are analysed first and these small phylogenies are reassembled into a complete phylogeny. The problem of constructing a phylogeny that agrees with the maximum number, or maximum weight set, of quartets is NP-hard. We consider two constrained versions. In the first we specify that T has bounded degree and that the splits of T must come from some given set, for example from the set of characters in the sequence data. We give a polynomial time algorithm that determines an optimal weight tree, or shows that no such tree exists. In the second we assume that the selection procedure for the small phylogenies returns at most two of the three possible resolved quartets for every set of four leaves. We give an O(n s) algorithm that finds an optimal weight binary tree, if it exists, with quartets exclusively from the input set.
