Service orientation is an approach to developing software applications by means of service orchestration and choreography. In such applications, a service interacts with not only other services but also its embedding environment via contexts. However, it is still unclear about how to develop effective testing techniques for service orchestration and choreography, particularly in the presence of contexts. In this article, we present a context-aware framework for testing service-oriented applications.
