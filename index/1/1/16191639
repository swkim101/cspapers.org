Semantic technologies aim to facilitate machine-to-machine communication and are attracting more and more interest from both academia and industry, especially in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider large-scale information sharing scenarios among mobile objects in IoT by leveraging semantic techniques. We propose to broadcast Linked Data on-air using RDF format to allow simultaneous access to the information and to achieve better scalability. We introduce a novel air indexing method to reduce the information access latency and energy consumption. To build air indexes, we firstly map RDF triples in the Linked Data into points in a 3D space and build B+-trees based on 3D Hilbert curve mappings for all of the 3D points. We then convert these trees into linear sequences so that they can be broadcast over a wireless channel. A novel search algorithm is also designed to efficiently evaluate queries against the air indexes. Experiments show that our indexing method outperforms the air indexing method based on traditional 3D R-trees.
