Entity Linking is the task of assigning entities from a Knowledge Base to textual mentions of such entities in a document. State-of-the-art approaches rely on lexical and statistical features which are abundant for popular entities but sparse for unpopular ones, resulting in a clear bias towards popular entities and poor accuracy for less popular ones. In this work, we present a novel approach that is guided by a natural notion of semantic similarity which is less amenable to such bias. We adopt a unified semantic representation for entities and documents - the probability distribution obtained from a random walk on a subgraph of the knowledge base - which can overcome the feature sparsity issue that affects previous work. Our algorithm continuously updates the semantic signature of the document as mentions are disambiguated, thus focusing the search based on context. Our experimental evaluation uses well-known benchmarks and different samples of a Wikipedia-based benchmark with varying entity popularity; the results illustrate well the bias of previous methods and the superiority of our approach, especially for the less popular entities.
