An analytic performance modeling case study of a complex command and control computer system is presented. A queueing network model of the system was developed and validated. Features of the model found to be critical to its accuracy were detailed software models, general service time distributions, and models of transient response time behavior. Response time prediction accuracy of the model was validated to 20 percent for moderate device utilizations. The study shows that analytic techniques can be successfully applied to performance modeling of complex systems. Prediction of response time percentile values and modeling of transient effects are identified as two areas where improved analytic techniques would enhance performance engineering of such systems.
