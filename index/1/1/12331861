The design objective for our task may be simply stated as “the development of a software package useable as a programming tool for numerically controlled drafting machines.” From this point on, the problem becomes quite a bit more involved. You see, this software package, as well as any other software package, cannot be developed for the machine. It must be developed for the user of the machine. I am sure that you all realize that when the subject of applications for drafting machines is considered, a multitude of categories and industries must be accounted for. Our main concern is how best to satisfy the needs of these various users.
