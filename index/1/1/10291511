We present the design of a soft wearable robotic device composed of elastomeric artificial muscle actuators and soft fabric sleeves, for active assistance of knee motions. A key feature of the device is the two-dimensional design of the elastomer muscles that not only allows the compactness of the device, but also significantly simplifies the manufacturing process. In addition, the fabric sleeves make the device lightweight and easily wearable. The elastomer muscles were characterized and demonstrated an initial contraction force of 38N and maximum contraction of 18mm with 104kPa input pressure, approximately. Four elastomer muscles were employed for assisted knee extension and flexion. The robotic device was tested on a 3D printed leg model with an articulated knee joint. Experiments were conducted to examine the relation between systematic change in air pressure and knee extension-flexion. The results showed maximum extension and flexion angles of 95° and 37°, respectively. However, these angles are highly dependent on underlying leg mechanics and positions. The device was also able to generate maximum extension and flexion forces of 3.5N and 7N, respectively.
