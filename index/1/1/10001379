Acoustic transducers with large radiation surface are commonly used in non-contact levitation and transportation systems. Traditional modeling can not predict its dynamic performance precisely. There is not enough documented information on design and optimization. A coupled 3D model has been built in this work. Modal and harmonic analysis has been performed to investigate mechanical and electrical behaviors. Identical experimental conditions were simulated by finite element method modeling to investigate size effect and optimize the transducer. Experiment has been set up to validate the model. The good agreement between the simulated and experimental results shows that the model in design procedure provides an optimal tool to construct an acoustic transducer used in Near Field Acoustic Levitation.
