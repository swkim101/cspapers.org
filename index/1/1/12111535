This paper presents a novel method to perform the outlier rejection task between two different views of a camera rigidly attached to an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Only two feature correspondences and gyroscopic data from IMU measurerments are used to compute the motion hypothesis. By exploiting this 2-point motion parametrization, we propose two algorithms to remove wrong data associations in the feature-matching process for case of a 6DoF motion. We show that in the case of a monocular camera mounted on a quadrotor vehicle, motion priors from IMU can be used to discard wrong estimations in the framework of a 2-point-RANSAC based approach. The proposed methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real data.
