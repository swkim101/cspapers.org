One of the challenges in precision agriculture is the detection of diseased crops in agricultural environments. This paper presents a methodology to detect the Ceratocystis wilt disease in Eucalyptus crops. An unmanned aerial vehicle is used to obtain high-resolution RGB images of a predefined area. The methodology enables the extraction of visual features from image regions and uses several supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to classify regions into three classes: ground, healthy and diseased plants. Several learning techniques were compared using data obtained from a commercial Eucalyptus plantation. Experimental results show that the GP learning model is more reliable than the other learning methods for accurately identifying diseased trees.
