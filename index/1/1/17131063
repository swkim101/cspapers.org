More and more security attacks today are perpetrated by exploiting the hardware: memory errors can be exploited to take over systems, side-channel attacks leak secrets to the outside worlds, weak random number generators render cryptography ineffective, etc. At the same time, many of the tenets of efficient design are in tension with guaranteeing security. For instance, classic secure hardware does not allow to optimize common execution patterns, share resources, or provide deep introspection. We provide brief descriptions of three recently-exposed hardware vulnerabilities along with extensive references for background and to learn more about these areas. Specifically, we first discuss the Rowhammer problem in modern DRAM chips, which enables attackers to circumvent memory isolation, and other potential vulnerabilities due to aggressive memory technology scaling. We next describe hardware Trojans implemented below the gate level, which can resist most detection techniques, and other manufacturing vulnerabilities in security primitives. Finally, we explain side channels that can achieve very large information leakage capacities, and various potential defenses against them. We conclude by noting that the intersection of hardware design and security attacks and countermeasures will continue to present a rich area for research and development for many years to come.
