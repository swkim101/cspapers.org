This paper proposes a technique of the extended template matching that detects the object with two-dimensional standard shape under the outdoor environment. Under the outdoor environment, the intensity distribution of the object changes variously by the change in the lighting condition and the change in the surface properties of the object. On the other hand, the conventional template matching assumes the intensity distribution of the object does not change. Therefore, it proposes the technique for evaluating plural similarities calculated with partial and whole templates by the linear discriminant function. The effectiveness of the proposed technique was confirmed by the detection experiment of the corner fitting of the container under the outdoor environment.
