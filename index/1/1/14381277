T h e O b j e c t Space: Text Editing motivates that the text and pat tern be strings. Image processing motivates that the text and pat tern be two dimensional arrays. In tree pattern matching [8], that was used for solving problems with grammars, the text and pat tern are trees. Cole and Hariharan introduced the Subset Matching problem where the text and patterns are arrays of sets [5]. The subset matching problem is an interesting generalization of string matching and has proven useful in producing more efficient solutions for tree matching.
