An expectation-based system, NGP, f o r parsing Engl ish noun groups i n to the Conceptual Dependency representat ion is descr ibed. The system is a par t of ELI (Engl ish Language I n t e rp re te r ) which is used as the f ron t end to several na tu ra l language understanding systems and is capable of handl ing a wide range of sentences of considerable complex i ty . NGP processes the input from l e f t to r i g h t , one word at a t ime, using l i n g u i s t i c and world knowledge to f i nd the meaning of a noun group. D ic t ionary en t r i es fo r i n d i v i d u a l words contain much of the program's knowledge. In a d d i t i o n , a l i m i t e d a b i l i t y f o r the handl ing of s l i g h t l y i nco r rec t sentences and unknown words is incorpora ted. 0. I n t roduc t i on Every na tu ra l language processor has to have the a b i l i t y to i n t e r p r e t noun phrases. This paper describes a set of programs ca l led NGP (Noun Group Processor) which is an i n t e g r a l par t of ELI , the Engl ish Language In te rp re te r (Riesbeck and Schank 1976) which serves as the f r o n t end to three of the Yale na tu ra l language understanding systems, SAM, PAM and WEIS. SAM is a system capable of understanding s to r i es such as var ious newspaper repor ts by using s c r i p t s (Schank and Abelson 1975, 1977; Cu l l i ng fo rd 1975, 1977). PAM is an understanding system which uses general knowledge about peoples' goals and plans (Wilensky 1976). WEIS is a system which understands and c l a s s i f i e s a great v a r i e t y of i so la ted newspaper headlines on i n t e r n a t i o n a l r e l a t i o n s . Thus, our task was to process not only noun phrases of considerable complexity but also to i n t e r p r e t newspaper headl ines, which are not always grammatical ly c o r r e c t . The fo l l ow ing two examples i l l u s t r a t e the kind of sentences our system is able to handle. 1.

FUNERAL OF INDIA 'S SHASTRI ATTENDED BY USSR KOSYGIN AND USA HUMPHREY. This work was supported in par t by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and monitored under the Of f i ce of Naval Research under cont rac t N00014-75-C-1111 To process such a la rge scope of sentences the program makes extensive use of i t s knowledge of the problem domain and the redundancy of n a t u r a l language expressions. This saves e f f o r t and permits co r rec t processing of such i r r e g u l a r i t i e s of input t ex t as missing commas and a r t i c l e s , or s l i g h t l y i nco r rec t word order. I t also provides f o r the a b i l i t y to ignore unknown words or ( i n some cases) to make p laus ib le i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of unknown words. This knowledge is kept in the d i c t i o n a r y . The con t ro l mechanisms remain domain independent. NGP is a p roduc t i on l i ke system which uses expectat ions as i t s basic con t ro l mechanism. The problem wi th every p roduc t i on l i ke system is the tendency f o r the accumulation of a la rge number of expectat ions f i g h t i n g fo r a chance to be tes ted . In t h i s work I have t r i e d to develop a theory of how var ious expectat ions are organized and processed, which, I be l i eve , is in f ac t a theory of how people process na tu ra l language. The basic gu id ing p r i n c i p l e fo r t h i s theory was i t s i n t u i t i v e p l a u s i b i l i t y . !â€¢ Noun Group Semantics In t h i s paper we w i l l discuss two classes of noun groups according to the conceptual s t r uc tures they generate: PP P ic tu re Producers and CTP Concept Producers. PP's are def ined by Schank (Schank 1975) as concepts which tend to produce p ic tu res of r e a l wor ld items in the mind of a hearer. For example,
