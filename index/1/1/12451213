In this paper, I will argue that the well-known ambiguity of directional prepositions between the intrinsic and relative readings is not lexical, but can be interpreted as a framework assignment ambiguity of the type observed in the temporal domain. A DRT semantics will then be constructed around a unified model of framework assignment which can be applied across the board to all three universal frame types.
