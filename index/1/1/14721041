Teaching how to write correct programs is hard; teaching how to write correct concurrent programs is even harder. There is a desperate need for a better concurrency programming model than what most people are currently using. The Erlang programming language might be a step in that direction. This paper provides an overview of Erlang and how it has been successfully used to teach concurrency-oriented programming (COP) in a sophomore level course at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Estado de México.
