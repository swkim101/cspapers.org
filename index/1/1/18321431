This paper proposes a new object model, called the distributed object model, wherein the model is unified as a protection unit, as a method of data abstraction, and as a computational unit, so as to realize reliable, maintainable, and secure systems. An object oriented architecture called ZOOM is designed based on this object model. A software simulator and cross assembler for this architecture have been implemented. The feasibility and performance of the architecture are discussed according to program sizes and estimated hardware size and execution speed.
