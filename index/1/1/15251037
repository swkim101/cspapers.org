Detecting potential dangers in the environment is a fundamental ability of living beings. In order to endure such ability to a robot, this paper presents an algorithm for detecting potential falling objects, i.e. physically unsafe objects, given an input of 3D point clouds captured by the range sensors. We formulate the falling risk as a probability or a potential that an object may fall given human action or certain natural disturbances, such as earthquake and wind. Our approach differs from traditional object detection paradigm, it first infers hidden and situated “causes (disturbance) of the scene, and then introduces intuitive physical mechanics to predict possible “effects (falls) as consequences of the causes. In particular, we infer a disturbance field by making use of motion capture data as a rich source of common human pose movement. We show that, by applying various disturbance fields, our model achieves a human level recognition rate of potential falling objects on a dataset of challenging and realistic indoor scenes.
