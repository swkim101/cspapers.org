Multi-view clustering is an important problem in information retrieval due to the abundance of data offering many perspectives and generating multi-view representations. We investigate in this short note a late fusion approach for multi-view clustering based on the latent modeling of cluster-cluster relationships. We derive a probabilistic multi-view clustering model outperforming an early-fusion approach based on multi-view feature correlation analysis.
