We present an alternative technique for discovering aggregate usage profiles from Web access logs. The technique is based on clustering information needs inferred from users' browsing paths. Browsing paths are extracted from users' access logs. Information need is inferred from each browsing path by using the Ostensive Model[1]. The technique is evaluated in a document recommendation application. We compare the performance of our technique against the well-established transaction-based technique proposed in [2]. Based on an initial evaluation, the results are encouraging.
