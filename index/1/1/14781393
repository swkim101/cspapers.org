Can bits of an RSA public key leak information about design and
implementation choices such as the prime generation algorithm?
We analysed over 60 million freshly generated key pairs from 22
open- and closedsource libraries and from 16 different
smartcards, revealing significant leakage. The bias introduced
by different choices is sufficiently large to classify a
probable library or smartcard with high accuracy based only on
the values of public keys. Such a classification can be used to
decrease the anonymity set of users of anonymous mailers or
operators of linked Tor hidden services, to quickly detect keys
from the same vulnerable library or to verify a claim of use of
secure hardware by a remote party. The classification of the
key origins of more than 10 million RSA-based IPv4 TLS keys and
1.4 million PGP keys also provides an independent estimation of
the libraries that are most commonly used to generate the keys
found on the Internet. Our broad inspection provides a sanity
check and deep insight regarding which of the recommendations
for RSA key pair generation are followed in practice, including
closed-source libraries and smartcards.
