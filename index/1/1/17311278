In this paper we report on our ongoing work in the EU project Multilingual Online Translation (MOLTO), supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement FP7-ICT-247914. More specifically, we present work workpackage 8 (WP8): Case Study: Cultural Heritage. The objective of the work is to build an ontology-based multilingual application for museum information on the Web. Our approach relies on the innovative idea of Reason-able View of the Web of linked data applied to the domain of cultural heritage. We have been developing a Web application that uses Semantic Web ontologies for generating coherent multilingual natural language descriptions about museum objects. We have been experimenting with museum data to test our approach and find that it performs well for the examined languages.
