The aim of our paper is to show that a general theory of Intelligent Systems /IS/ can be based on the mathematical logic and on its model theory. A descriptive definition of IS is given. One can see that the investigation of some important aspects of IS's functioning lead us to realize the necessity of a general language concept. The definition of the language is given as a triple: language = . 
 
The usefulness of this language concept for describing the IS functioning is shown. Mathematical background of this concept gives the possibility for the foundation of the formal IS's theory.
