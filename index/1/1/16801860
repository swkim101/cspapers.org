Recently, learning to rank algorithms have become a popular and effective tool for ordering objects (e.g. terms) according to their degrees of importance. The contribution of this paper is that we propose a simple and fast learning to rank model RankBayes and embed it in the co-training framework. The detailed proof is given that Na√Øve Bayes algorithm can be used to implement a learning to rank model. To solve the problem of two-model inconsistency, an ingenious approach is put forward to rank all the phrases by making use of the labeled results of two RankBayes models. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising in solving ranking problems.
