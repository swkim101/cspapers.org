Conventional CS-MRI algorithms usually exploit the sparse nature of MRI in an iterative manner. These optimization-based CS-MRI methods are often time-consuming at test time, and are based on ﬁxed transform bases or shallow dictionaries, which limits modeling capacity. Recently, deep models have been introduced to the CS-MRI problem. One main challenge for CS-MRI methods based on deep learning is the trade off between model performance and network size. We propose a recursive dilated network (RDN) for CS-MRI that achieves good performance while reducing the number of network parameters. We adopt dilated convolutions in each recursive block to aggregate multi-scale information within the MRI. We also adopt a modiﬁed shortcut strategy to help features ﬂow into deeper layers. Experimental results show that the proposed RDN model achieves state-of-the-art performance in CS-MRI while using far fewer parameters than previously required.
