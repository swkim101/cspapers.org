Piezoelectric actuators are the most common among a variety of smart actuators due to their high resolution, low power consumption and wide operating frequency but they suffer hysteresis which affects linearity. In this paper a novel digital charge amplifier is presented which reduces hysteresis and linearizes the piezoelectric actuator. A frequency-weighted data fusion algorithm uses a non-linear ARX model to remove drift and increase the bandwidth of digital charge amplifier. Experimental results are presented.
