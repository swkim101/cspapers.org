A critical problem in cluster ensemble research is how to combine multiple clusterings to yield a final superior clustering result. Leveraging advanced graph partitioning techniques, we solve this problem by reducing it to a graph partitioning problem. We introduce a new reduction method that constructs a bipartite graph from a given cluster ensemble. The resulting graph models both instances and clusters of the ensemble simultaneously as vertices in the graph. Our approach retains all of the information provided by a given ensemble, allowing the similarity among instances and the similarity among clusters to be considered collectively in forming the final clustering. Further, the resulting graph partitioning problem can be solved efficiently. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach against two commonly used graph formulations and show that it is more robust and achieves comparable or better performance in comparison to its competitors.
