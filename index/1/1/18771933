In this paper, a distributed mechanism used by a robotic swarm to facilitate the building of a loose wall structure is discussed and results presented. The ability of a robotic swarm to utilise a spatio-temporal varying template in construction tasks is verified. The work is seen as a step towards the development of a generalised methodology for collective construction building tasks and establishes a means for the building of more complex structures.
