LingoTurk is an open-source, freely available crowdsourcing client/server system aimed primarily at psycholinguistic experimentation where custom and specialized user interfaces are required but not supported by popular crowdsourcing task management platforms. LingoTurk enables user-friendly local hosting of experiments as well as condition management and participant exclusion. It is compatible with Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic. New experiments can easily be set up via the Play Framework and the LingoTurk API, while multiple experiments can be managed from a single system.
