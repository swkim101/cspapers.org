In this paper we present new state-of-the-art performance on CCG supertagging and parsing. Our model outperforms existing approaches by an absolute gain of 1.5%. We analyze the performance of several neural models and demonstrate that while feed-forward architectures can compete with bidirectional LSTMs on POS tagging, models that encode the complete sentence are necessary for the long range syntactic information encoded in supertags.
