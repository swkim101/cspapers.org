In this paper, we introduce a new framework within which to study VLSI layout problems. The framework is based on a straightforward generalization of the Lipton-Tarjan notion of a planar separator and, unlike previous approaches, leads to universally close upper and lower bounds on the layout area and crossing number of an arbitrary network. In addition, the framework permits simple proofs of results previously thought to be difficult and is suitable for use with good bisection width heurisitcs.
