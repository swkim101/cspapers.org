Logging dietary intake has been shown to be of benefit to individuals and health researchers, but a practical and objective system for food logging remains elusive despite decades of research. My thesis is that emerging wearable devices such as life-logging cameras, the ubiquity of sensors in mobile devices, and new computational techniques such as human computation, provide the foundation for a new class of food journaling systems that are lightweight and practical in everyday settings. In this proposal I describe my research in understanding how to leverage this new landscape of mainstream ubiquitous computing towards automatic and semi-automatic food journaling.
