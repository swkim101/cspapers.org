Minimization of energy or error functions has proved to be a useful principle in the design and analysis of neural networks and neural algorithms. A brief list of examples include: the backpropagation algorithm, the use of optimization methods in computational vision, the application of analog networks to the approximate solution of NP complete problems and the Hopfield model of associative memory.
