This paper focuses on the detection of pedestrian crossing intention to improve the situation awareness for autonomous driving in urban environments. A new definition of pedestrian crossing intention is discussed, which allows self-driving vehicles to identify pedestrians, whose intended actions are relevant for the own behavior planning, at an early stage. We propose a context-based feature descriptor in combination with a SVM classifier for detecting this. The descriptor captures the movement of a pedestrian relative to the road and the spatial layout of other scene elements in a generic manner. The performance of the feature descriptor is evaluated in relation to various SVM setups. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with data captured on-board of a vehicle in real inner-city traffic. The evaluation of the classification results confirms, that context-based data is a promising indicator for pedestrian crossing intention and that the proposed feature descriptor is capable of representing this. It is further shown that a lack of information about the pedestrian's posture and body movement results in a delayed detection of the pedestrians changing their crossing intention when compared to a human observer.
