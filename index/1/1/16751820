In spite of the incredible market penetration of smartphones and rapid growth of App markets, their utility has been restricted by their battery capacity. Smartphone users are frustrated by applications consuming too much power. To avoid this experience, they may have to profile energy consumption on the phone. However, it is difficult for a user to analyze energy consumption of his phone because the process requires deep understanding of the interaction between the hardware and software. Therefore, market curators need to examine applications for providing power consumption data before accepting them into App market. Unfortunately, current App markets mainly employ basic functional tests and checking policy on the submitted applications. Moreover, considering the exponentially increasing daily amount of new Apps posted on the App market, it is not feasible to perform the process manually. Therefore, if we can provide an automated energy estimation tool for App market curators, users can have energy consumption data in addition to the current functional description. In this poster, we propose a framework for automated power estimation of android apps.
