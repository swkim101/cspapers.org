In this paper, we introduce an open-source and modular password analysis and research system, PARS, which provides a uniform, comprehensive and scalable research platform for password security. To the best of our knowledge, PARS is the first such system that enables researchers to conduct fair and comparable password security research. PARS contains 12 state-of-the-art cracking algorithms, 15 intra-site and cross-site password strength metrics, 8 academic password meters, and 15 of the 24 commercial password meters from the top-150 websites ranked by Alexa. Also, detailed taxonomies and large-scale evaluations of the PARS modules are presented in the paper.
