This paper describes the projects written by students as part of our one-semester course in Operating Systems. It is aimed at Juniors and Seniors of average capabilities.
 The course is divided into three parts: (a) The assembly language, utilities and RT-11 operating system (*) of DEC's PDP-11 family, (b) general concepts in operating systems, and (c) a team programming project. Only the final third of the course will be discussed. In the remainder of this paper we describe the following: rationale for having the students write a stand-alone operating system in assembly language, the two design outlines given to the students, and our successes and failures with them.
