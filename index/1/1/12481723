With RFC 7748 the two elliptic curves Curve25519 and Curve448 were proposed for the next generation of TLS. Both curves were designed and optimized purely for software implementation; their implementation in hardware or physical protection against side-channel attacks were not considered in the design phase. Recently, it has been shown that for Curve25519 an efficient implementations in hardware along with side-channel protection is feasible - yet results for the high-security Curve448 are missing. In this work we demonstrate that Curve448 can indeed be efficiently and securely implemented in hardware. We present a novel architecture for Curve448 that can compute more than 1000 point multiplications per second with 1580 logic slices and 33 DSP units of a Xilinx XC7Z020 FPGA.
