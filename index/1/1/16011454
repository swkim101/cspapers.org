To explain, the ratings provided by advisors are possibly unfair. Buyers may provide unfairly high ratings to promote the seller. This is referred to as “ballot stuffing” (Dellarocas 2000). Buyers may also provide unfairly low ratings, in order to cooperate with other sellers to drive a seller out of the marketplace. This is referred to as “bad-mouthing”. Besides the problem of unfair ratings, rating submission is voluntary in most trust management systems. Buyers do not have direct incentives to provide ratings because, for example, providing reputation ratings of sellers requires some effort (Josang, Ismail, & Boyd 2005). Providing fair ratings for a trustworthy seller may also decrease the chance of doing business with the seller because of competition from other buyers.
