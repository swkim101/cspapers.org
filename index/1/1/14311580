Cascade Hashing is a new dynamic hashing scheme which is based on Spiral Storage. The purpose of this paper is first to give a unified exposition of Linear Hashing, Spiral Storage and other dynamic hashing schemes, and second to describe a new method for storing overflow records. The method stores the overflow records in the main file itself and clusters overflow records from each primary bucket in one or very few overflow buckets. Calculations on the load of the file promises search 1 engths very close to one even for a storage utilization above 90X, which makes the method appear better than any present dynamic hashing scheme.
