A particular classification and retrieval model are considered. A notion is introduced which indicates the extent to which retrieval performance may be improved by a suitable choice of classification within the model. A method for determining the optimal performance for the model is outlined together with an algorithm for constructing the classification which allows this limit to be attained. A treatment of the mathematical preliminaries for a particular class of match function is given. The relevance of the analysis in research on information retrieval systems is discussed.
