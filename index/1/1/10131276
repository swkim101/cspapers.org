In this paper, we introduce an adaptive Process Management System implementation that combines business process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and automated resolution strategies leveraging on well-established formalisms developed for reasoning about actions in Artificial Intelligence, including the situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. Such formalisms provide a natural framework for the formal specification of explicit mechanisms to model world changes and responding to anomalous situations, exceptions, exogenous events in an automated way during process execution.
