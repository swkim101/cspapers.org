Complex scientific problems involving large volumes of data need a huge computing power. Memory bandwidth remains a key issue in high performance systems. This paper presents an originrd method of memory organization, based on serial multiport memory components, which allows simultaneous access to all ports without causing either cortfhct between them or suspension. The resulting process for information exchange gives a cost-effective realization of a data memory for vector processors. The memory bandwidth can be increased considerably in a modular manner, without practical implementation constraints. The information exchange on the serial links guarantees a continuous data flow and the reaching of a maximum yield of the pipeline, thus avoiding the step-by-step feeding of the pipeline operator.
