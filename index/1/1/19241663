We present Champagne, a web tool for the execution of crowdsourcing campaigns. Through Champagne, task requesters can model crowdsourcing campaigns as a sequence of choices regarding different, independent crowdsourcing design decisions. Such decisions include, e.g., the possibility of qualifying some workers as expert reviewers, or of combining different quality assurance techniques to be used during campaign execution. In this regard, a walkthrough example showcasing the capabilities of the platform is reported. Moreover, we show that our modular approach in the design of campaigns overcomes many of the limitations exposed by the major platforms available in the market.
