Several interprocessor communication mechanisms for multiprocessor systems have been proposed. An efficient communication scheme must facilitate high throughput and good response time. We introduce such an efficient scheme, describe the hardware involved, and evaluate its performance. The method is based on a compile-time tagging of shared data and on using different paths for “shared” (S-) and “private” (P-) data. The S-data accesses a shared cache on a word-by-word basis; the P-references are made to a local memory under a demand paging system. The resulting design avoids most shortcomings of other communication methods and supports multiprogrammed multiprocessor systems.
