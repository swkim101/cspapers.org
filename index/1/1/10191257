There is a growing body of evidence that indicates that many students would benefit from coursework in computer science regardless of their academic majors. While there are obvious advantages to learning computer science for students in the quantitative and analytical fields that comprise the STEM disciplines, the advantages to other students are less obvious. In order to investigate the impact of computer science principles and methods on students in the liberal arts we convened a workshop of faculty comprised of an equal number of participants from each discipline, i.e. computer science and the various liberal arts. We identified a clear need to better understand the computational needs of liberal arts students and faculty and we identified opportunities for computer scientists and liberal arts students and faculty to work together to better prepare students in both disciplines and better support faculty research in the liberal arts.
