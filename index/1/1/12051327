In this paper, we propose an entirely new manipulation strategy for dynamic manipulation of a ribbon with a high-speed manipulator. The manipulation strategy involves manipulating the object at a constant, high speed. Then, we can assume that the dynamic behavior of the ribbon can be obtained by performing algebraic calculations of the robot motion using the proposed strategy. Based on this assumption, we derive a model of the ribbon and suggest a motion planning method using the proposed model. Finally, we show experimental results of shape control of a ribbon based on the proposed method.
