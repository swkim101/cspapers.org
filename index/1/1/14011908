Rapid prototypes are often developed early in the software development process in order to help project stakeholders explore ideas for possible features, and to discover, analyze, and specify requirements for the project. As prototypes are typically thrown-away following the initial analysis phase, it is imperative for them to be created quickly with little cost and effort. Tool support for finding and reusing components from open-source repositories offers a major opportunity to reduce this manual effort. In this paper, we present a system for rapid prototyping that facilitates software reuse by mining feature descriptions and source code from open-source repositories. Our system identifies and recommends features and associated source code modules that are relevant to the software product under development. The modules are selected such that they implement as many of the desired features as possible while exhibiting the lowest possible levels of external coupling. We conducted a user study to evaluate our approach and the results indicated that our proposed system returned packages that implemented more features and were considered more relevant than the state-of-the-art approach.
