We present the third generation of Argos platforms, ArgosV3, intended for real-world applications and research. Developed from scratch specifically for many-antenna MU-MIMO, ArgosV3 is highly efficient in space, power, computation, and cost. While this new platform is highly configurable, featuring FPGA SoCs and frequency agile transceivers capable of operation from 50 MHz to 3.8 GHz, it is also highly compact and power efficient, enabling a complete 160 radio base station in less than 2 cubic feet. ArgosV3 is currently being deployed in a campus-wide multi-cell many-antenna network. For our demonstration we will show a single ArgosV3 base station serving multiple clients using a realtime LTE stack.
