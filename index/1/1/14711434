In a survey of the CS-education community, we find a range of beliefs about the "geek gene" theory. We suggest an alternative term, the "geekiness quotient (GQ)". The GQ, grounded in Gardner's work on multiple intelligences, is a hypothetical measure of the student's current CS ability. The GQ supports a moderate view of the geek gene: that students arrive in our classrooms with a range of CS abilities, whether acquired through background or innate talent, and can improve their abilities through effort.
