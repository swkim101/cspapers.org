In this paper we examine the problem of autonomously exploring and mapping an environment using a mobile robot. The robot uses a graph-based SLAM system to perform mapping and represents the map as an occupancy grid. In this setting, the robot must trade-off between exploring new area to complete the task and exploiting the existing information to maintain good localization. Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not significantly increasing the robot's localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannon's and ReÃÅnyi's definitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannon's entropy. We show that by using the proposed utility function, the robot and map uncertainties are smaller than using other existing methods.
