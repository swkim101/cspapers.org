The paper presents two techniques for lemmatization of Polish person names. First, we apply a rule-based approach which relies on linguistic information and heuristics. Then, we investigate an alternative knowledge-poor method which employs string distance measures. We provide an evaluation of the adopted techniques using a set of newspaper texts.
