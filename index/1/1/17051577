This paper considers the problem of state feedback control of networked systems with an uncertain plant. The signal for feedback switches periodically between the plant state which is available via the communication network and the state of a model of the plant that is used to generate control signal when the plant state is not available from the network. A necessary and sufficient condition and a sufficient condition for the robust exponential stability of the closed loop system are derived in terms of the network dwell time and the system parameters. The results suggest a simple procedure for designing the state feedback controller of the system. Numerical simulations show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods
