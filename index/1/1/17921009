The techniques of abstract machine modelling and macro processing can be used to construct software which is easily moved from one computer to another. This paper describes a system developed at the University of Colorado which has been implemented on 8 different machines, with efforts ranging from 1 man-day to 1 man-week. We feel that these techniques offer a possible solution to the "software crisis" which is plaguing the computer industry today.
