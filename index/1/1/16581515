Text documents often hide valuable structured data. For example, a collection of newspaper articles might contain information on the location of the headquarters of a number of organizations. If we need to nd the location of the headquarters of, say, Microsoft, we could try and use traditional information-retrieval techniques for nding documents that contain the answer to our query. Alternatively, we could answer such a query more precisely if we somehow had available a table listing all the organization-location pairs that are mentioned in our document collection. One could view the extraction process as automatically building a materialized view over the unstructured text data. In this demo we present an interactive prototype of our Snowball system for extracting relations from collections of plain-text documents with minimal human participation. Our method builds on the DIPRE idea introduced by Brin [3]. Our system and techniques were presented in detail in [2] and [1].
