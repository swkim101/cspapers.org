One major challenge in System-on-Chip (SoC) design is the definition and design of interfaces between hardware and software. Traditional ASIC designer and software designer model HW/SW interface twice. Using two separate models introduces a discontinuity between hardware and software. This paper introduces a unified HW/SW component model to describe different parts of HW/SW interface at different abstraction levels. The benefits of using the proposed model are two fold: first, it provides a single model to present system design from abstract specification to mixed HW/SW implementation and second, it enables full system simulation at different abstraction level during refinement flow.
