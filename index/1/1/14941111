We present Jigg, a Scala (or JVMbased) NLP annotation pipeline framework, which is easy to use and is extensible. Jigg supports a very simple interface similar to Stanford CoreNLP, the most successful NLP pipeline toolkit, but has more flexibility to adapt to new types of annotation. On this framework, system developers can easily integrate their downstream system into a NLP pipeline from a raw text by just preparing a wrapper of it.
