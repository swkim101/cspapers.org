We describe a spatio-temporal triangulation method to be used with rolling shutter cameras. We show how a single pair of rolling shutter images enables the computation of both structure and motion of rigid moving objects. Starting from a set of point correspondences in the left and right images, we introduce the velocity and shutter characteristics in the triangulation equations. This results in a non-linear error criterion whose minimization in the least square sense provides the shape and velocity parameters. Unlike previous work on rolling shutter cameras, the constraining assumption of a-priori knowledge about the object geometry is removed and a full 3D motion model is considered. The aim of this work is thus to make the use of rolling shutter cameras of a broader interest. Experimental evaluation results confirm the feasibility of the approach.
