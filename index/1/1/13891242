Let <i>H</i> be any non-bipartite graph. We determine asymptotically the minimum degree of a graph <i>G</i> which ensures that <i>G</i> has a perfect <i>H</i>-packing. More precisely, we determine the smallest number τ having the following property: For every positive constant γ there exists an integer <i>n</i><inf>0</inf> = <i>n</i><inf>0</inf>(γ, <i>H</i>) such that every graph <i>G</i> whose order <i>n</i> ≥<i>n</i><inf>0</inf> is divisible by |<i>H</i>| and whose minimum degree is at least (τ + γ) <i>n</i> contains a perfect <i>H</i>-packing. The value of τ depends on the relative sizes of the colour classes in the optimal colourings of <i>H.</i> The proof is algorithmic, which shows that the problem of finding a maximum <i>H</i>-packing is polynomially solvable for graphs <i>G</i> whose minimum degree is at least (τ + γ)<i>n.</i> On the other hand, given any positive constant γ, we show that for infinitely many (non-bipartite) graphs <i>H</i> the corresponding decision problem becomes NP-complete if one considers input graphs <i>G</i> of minimum degree at least (τ - γ)<i>n.</i>
