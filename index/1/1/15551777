In his book The World is Flat, Thomas Friedman convincingly explains the challenges of a global marketplace [4]. One implication is that software development can be out-sourced, as can any narrow, skills-based occupation; however, as Friedman also points out, leadership, innovation, and insight are always in demand. We have recently created and are implementing threadstm, a new structuring principle for computing curricula. Threads provides one clear path for computer scientists seeking to reinvent and re-invigorate computer science degree programs. Threads form a cohesive, coordinated set of contexts for understanding computing. The union of all threads covers the breadth "computer science." The union of any two threads is sufficient to cover a computer science degree. In this paper, we describe Threads, our process, the impact so far, and some of our future plans. We close with recommendations for other schools, especially schools with smaller programs.
