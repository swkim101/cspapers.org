This paper presents an analytical model and experimental results from a study of guiding tasks in micro-assembly. This work is focused on the use of two fingers for gripping microparts. The stability of the grasp when the contact appears is investigated and strategies during the guiding task are discussed. The contact side detection and the contact force estimation are studied. The incremental control in static mode is then investigated for controlling the guiding task. Experimental setups are proposed and some experimental results are presented.
