We present an architecture for network processing nodes 
based on a massively parallel processor structure. Due to its 
regularity, our architecture can be easily scaled to accommodate 
a range of packet processing applications with disparate 
performance and throughput requirements at high reliability. 
Furthermore, the composition from predefined building blocks 
guarantees fast design cycles and eases system verification. For 
particular resource efficiency in terms of power consumption, 
computational performance, and area requirements, specialized 
hardware accelerators can be embedded into the tailored processor 
cluster, which have been optimized for a particular target 
application. We demonstrate our approach using a real-world 
network access scenario that implements a full Internet protocol 
based digital subscriber line access multiplexer (IP-DSLAM) on 
our architecture. For this scenario, we achieve substantial increases 
of performance with only a slight area increase of less 
than 0.3 %. At the same time, the processors are strongly relieved 
and are thus available for the remaining tasks.
