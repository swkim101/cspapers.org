Closed form expressions and related algorithms for fast power grid analysis are proposed in this paper. The IR voltage drop at an arbitrary point in a power distribution network is determined. Two algorithms are described for non-uniform voltage supplies and non-uniform current loads distributed throughout a power grid. The principle of spatial locality is exploited to accelerate the proposed power grid analysis method. Analysis of the non-uniform power grids utilizes the principle of spatial locality. Since no iterations are required for the proposed IR drop analysis, the proposed algorithms are over 70 times faster for smaller power grids composed of less than five million nodes and over 180 times faster for larger power grids composed of more than 25 million nodes as compared to existing methods. The proposed method exhibits less than 0.5% error.
