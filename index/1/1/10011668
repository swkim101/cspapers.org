Since many applications rely on time-based data, visualizing temporal data and helping experts explore large time series data sets are critical in many application domains. In this interactive system preview, we argue that time series often carry structural features that can, if efficiently identified and effectively visualized, help reduce visual overload and help the user quickly focus on the relevant portions of the data sets. Relying on this observation, we introduce a novel STFMap system, which includes four innovative query- and feature-driven time series data set visualization techniques: (a) segment-maps, (b) warp-maps, (c) stretch-maps, and (d) feature-maps. These rely on the salient temporal features of the time series and their alignments with respect to the given user query to help users explore the data set in a query-driven fashion.
