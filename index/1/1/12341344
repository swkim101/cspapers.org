This paper summarizes concepts, principles, and tools that were found useful in applications involving causal modeling. The principles are based on structural-model semantics, in which functional (or counterfactual) relationships, representing autonomous physical processes are the fundamental building blocks. The paper presents the formal basis of this semantics, illustrates its application in simple problems and discusses its ramifications to computational and cognitive problems concerning causation.
