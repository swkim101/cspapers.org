High performance computer communication between multiprocessor nodes requires significant improvements over conventional host-to-network adapters. Current host-to-network adapter interfaces impose excessive processing, system bus and interrupt overhead on a multiprocessor host. Current network adapters are either limited in function, wasting key host resources such as the system bus and the processors, or else intelligent but too slow, because of complex transport protocols and because of an inadequate internal memory architecture. Conventional transport protocols are too complex for hardware implementation and too slow without it.
In this paper, we describe the design of a network adapter board for the VMP multiprocessor machine that addresses these issues. The adapter uses a host interface that is designed for minimal latency, minimal interrupt processing overhead and minimal system bus and memory access overhead. The network adapter itself has a novel internal memory and processing architecture that implements some of the key performance-critical transport layer functions in hardware. This design is integrated with VMTP, a new transport protocol specifically designed for efficient implementation on an intelligent high-performance network adapter. Although targeted for the VMP system, the design is applicable to other multiprocessors as well as uni-processors.
