This paper investigated the visual servoing regulation of nonholonomic mobile robots with monocular camera. Nonholonomic kinematic systems with visual feedback are uncertain and more involved in comparison with common kinematic systems. Two-phase technique was used to present a robust controller that enabled the mobile robot image pose and the orientation regulation despite the lack of depth information and the lack of precise visual parameters. The most interesting feature of this paper is that the problem was discussed in the image frame and the inertial frame, which made the problem easy and useful. The stabilization of the system by using the proposed method was rigorously proved. The simulation was given to show the effectiveness of the presented controllers.
