In a previous paper [BS] we proved, using the elements of the theory of <italic>nilpotent groups</italic>, that some of the <italic>fundamental computational problems in matriz groups</italic> belong to <italic>NP</italic>. These problems were also shown to belong to <italic>coNP</italic>, assuming an <italic>unproven hypothesis</italic> concerning <italic>finite simple groups</italic>.
The aim of this paper is to replace most of the (proven and unproven) group theory of [BS] by elementary combinatorial arguments. The result we prove is that relative to a <italic>random oracle B</italic>, the mentioned matrix group problems belong to (<italic>NP∩coNP</italic>)<supscrpt><italic>B</italic></supscrpt>.
The problems we consider are <italic>membership</italic> in and <italic>order</italic> of a matrix group given by a list of generators. These problems can be viewed as multidimensional versions of a close relative of the discrete logarithm problem. Hence <italic>NP∩coNP</italic> might be the lowest natural complexity class they may fit in.
We remark that the results remain valid for <italic>black box groups</italic> where group operations are performed by an oracle.
The tools we introduce seem interesting in their own right. We define a new hierarchy of complexity classes <italic>AM</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) “just above <italic>NP</italic>”, introducing <italic>Arthur vs. Merlin games</italic>, the bounded-away version of Papdimitriou's <italic>Games against Nature</italic>. We prove that in spite of their analogy with the polynomial time hierarchy, the finite levels of this hierarchy collapse to <italic>AM=AM</italic>(2). Using a combinatorial lemma on finite groups [BE], we construct a game by which the nondeterministic player (Merlin) is able to convince the random player (Arthur) about the relation [<italic>G</italic>]=<italic>N</italic> provided Arthur trusts conclusions based on statistical evidence (such as a Slowly-Strassen type “proof” of primality).
One can prove that <italic>AM</italic> consists precisely of those languages which belong to <italic>NP<supscrpt>B</supscrpt></italic> for almost every oracle <italic>B</italic>.
Our hierarchy has an interesting, still unclarified relation to another hierarchy, obtained by removing the central ingredient from the <italic>User vs. Expert games</italic> of Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff.
