In this paper, we propose a method for helping users explore information via Web searches by using a question and answer (Q&A) corpus archived in a community Q&A site. When users do not have clear information needs and have little knowledge about the task domain, it is difficult for them to create queries that adequately reflect their information needs. We focused on terms like "famous temples," "historical townscapes," and "delicious sweets," which we call "adjective facets", and developed a method of extracting these facets from question and answer archives at a community Q&A site. We evaluated the effectiveness of our adjective facets by comparing them with several baselines.
