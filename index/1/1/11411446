Although they can be topologically different, two distinct transducers may actually recognize the same rational relation. Being able to test the equivalence of transducers allows to implement such operations as incremental minimization and iterative composition. This paper presents an algorithm for testing the equivalence of deterministic weighted finite-state transducers, and outlines an implementation of its applications in a prototype weighted finite-state calculus tool.
