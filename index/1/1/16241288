407) 823-7345 tmast@greatwall.cctt.com An integrated development team comprised of industry engineers, government engineers, and user community representatives is developing a large-scale complex networked virtual environment for the United States Army. The effort is organized into concurrent engineering teams responsible for each system component. Prototypical users who are formally called a User Optimization Team are an integral part of the development effort. The system under development is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT). It is comprised of a network of simulators and workstations which interface with a virtual environment representing real world terrain. The nature of these systems requires user involvement in all phases of systems engineering, software development, and testing. The development organization and the usability engineering approaches used are mosaics of engineering skills, knowledge and HCI techniques.
