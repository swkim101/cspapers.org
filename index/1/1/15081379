We propose a fully distributed group key distribution protocol for ad hoc networks. The protocol uses a key pre-distribution step that is performed by each node independently and generates secure links between nodes in a neighbourhood. The key pre-distribution step also allows formation of an initiator group who will generate a session key that will be distributed to all nodes using the secure links between nodes obtained in key pre-distribution stage. We describe efficient protocols for join of new nodes and revocation of compromised nodes. We analyse the system by calculating probability of success of each operation. We evaluate security of the system against outside eavesdroppers and discuss its security against an adversary that corrupts the nodes of the network. Finally we compare our system with two competing systems and show its superior performance in some scenarios.
