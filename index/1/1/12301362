We present new algorithms for approximate range counting, where, for a specified ε > 0, we want to count the number of data points in a query range, up to <i>relative</i> error of ε. We first describe a general framework, adapted from Cohen [10], for this task, and then specialize it to two important instances of range counting: halfspaces in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> and disks in the plane. The technique reduces the approximate range counting problem to that of finding the minimum rank of a data object in the range, with respect to a <i>random</i> permutation of the input.A major technical step in our analysis, which we believe to be of independent interest, is a bound of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) on the expected complexity of the overlay of all the Voronoi faces that are generated during a randomized incremental construction of the Voronoi diagram of <i>n</i> points in the plane. The same bound holds for the expected complexity of the overlay of all the faces of the minimization diagram of the lower envelope of <i>n</i> planes in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup>, or for the expected complexity of the overlay of all the normal (or Gaussian) diagram faces of the convex hull of <i>n</i> points in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup>, that are generated during a randomized incremental construction of the lower envelope or of the hull, respectively. All these bounds are tight in the worst case.The first bound leads to an algorithm that, for a query point <i>x</i> ∈ <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, efficiently retrieves the sequence of nearest neighbors of <i>x</i> in <i>P</i>, over the random insertion process. A query takes <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) expected time, and the expected storage size is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). Similarly, the other bounds lead to an algorithm that, for a query direction ω ∈ <i>S</i><sup>2</sup>, efficiently retrieves the sequence of the convex hull vertices that are touched by the planes with outward direction ω that support the convex hull during the random insertion process. Again, a query takes <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) expected time, and the expected storage size is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). These algorithms are used as the main component in the approximate range counting technique that we present, for ranges that are halfspaces in <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> or disks in the plane.
