Local computer networks are increasing in popularity for the interconnection of computers for a variety of applications. One such network that has been implemented on a large scale is the Ethernet. This paper describes an experimental performance evaluation of a 3 and a 10 Mb/s Ethernet. The effects of varying packet length and transmission speed on throughput, mean delay and delay distribution are quantified. The protocols are seen to be fair and stable. These measurements span the range from the region of high performance of the CSMA/CD protocol to the upper limits of its utility where performance is degraded. The measurements are compared to the predictions of existing analytical models. The correlation is found to range from good to poor, with more sophisticated models yielding better results than a simple one.
