We propose a lightweight parallel multicast targeting an asynchronous NoC with a variant Mesh-of-Trees topology. A novel strategy, local speculation, is introduced, where a subset of switches are speculative and always broadcast. These switches are surrounded by non-speculative switches, which throttle any redundant packets, restricting these packets to small regions. Speculative switches have simplified designs, thereby improving network performance. A hybrid network architecture is proposed to mix the speculative and non-speculative switches. For multicast benchmarks, significant performance improvements with small power savings are obtained by the new approach over a tree-based non-speculative approach. Interestingly, similar improvements are also shown for unicast. Finally, another benefit is to reduce the address field size in multicast packets.
