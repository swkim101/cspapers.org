Post-secondary and corporate programs in science and engineering have traditionally made good use of internship opportunities to identify, mentor and develop students in their specialties. Computer and computational sciences, especially in academia and research laboratories may not be making as effective use of internship opportunities. In discussing why they do not consider including students in their development projects, staff and management often cite personal lack of time, mentoring skills, and money as barriers to what they would consider an effective internship initiative.This BOF will provide an opportunity for students, supervisors, and other interested people to talk about how to identify internship opportunities and deal with perceived barriers that inhibit sites from offering pre-service opportunities to high school and college students. Discussions will focus on sharing successful strategies for capitalizing on the enthusiasm and availability of the next wave of scientists and technologists.
