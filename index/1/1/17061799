In this paper we describe a system for symbolic interpretation and tracing of programs written in PASCAL. We show how the symbolic execution method of King can be extended to handle special PASCAL-features and complex data structures. The system is designed for practical use. It should support the programmer in the modular program development process without bothering him with additional specifications.
