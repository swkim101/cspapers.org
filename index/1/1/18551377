The Druid user interface management system aims to help user interface designers create, modify, and maintain interactive, graphical, direct-manipulation user interfaces. Druid allows thecreationof the complete user interface in highly-interactive and demonstrational manner. In Druid,the designer creates the layout of the interface using interactive graphical facilities and demonstrates to the UlMS how the end-user might interact with the interface. From this demonstration, the UIMS determines the details of the interface and automatically produces an implementation of it.
