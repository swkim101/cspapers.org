We introduce an argument generation system in debating, one that is based on sentence retrieval. Users can specify a motion such as This house should ban gambling, and a stance on whether the system agrees or disagrees with the motion. Then the system outputs three argument paragraphs based on “values” automatically decided by the system. The “value” indicates a topic that is considered as a positive or negative for people or communities, such as health and education. Each paragraph is related to one value and composed of about seven sentences. An evaluation over 50 motions from a popular debate website showed that the generated arguments are understandable in 64 paragraphs out of 150.
