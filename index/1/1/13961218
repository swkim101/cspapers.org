Introduction and Main Contributions Providing mechanisms that allow the user to retrieve desired multimedia information by their semantic content is now an important issue in multimedia databases [1]. However, current prototypes (e.g. Oracle 8i interMedia and Informix Datablade Modules) index mostly only low-level features of multimedia objects. Therefore special techniques are needed for semantic indexing and retrieval of multimedia objects. In this context we present the SMOOTH system, a prototype of a distributed multimedia database system. It implements an integrated querying, annotating, and navigating framework relying on a generic video indexing model. The framework allows the structuring of videos into logical and physical units, and the annotation of these units by typed semantic objects. An index-database stores these structural and semantic information. We provide further a clear concept for capturing and querying the semantic content of multimedia objects, their correlation with low-level objects, as well as their spatio-temporal relationships. The main contributions of SMOOTH are :
