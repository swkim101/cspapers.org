This paper presents a fast collision-detection method for sampling-based motion planners based on bounding volume hierarchies in workspace-time space. By introducing time as an additional dimension to the robot's workspace, the method is able to quickly evaluate time-indexed candidate trajectories for collision with the known future motions of other agents. The approach makes no assumptions on the shape of the objects and is able to handle arbitrary motions. We highlight implementation details regarding the application of the collision detection technique within an online planning framework for automated driving. Furthermore, we give detailed profiling information to show the capability for real-time operation.
