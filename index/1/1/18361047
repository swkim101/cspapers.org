Copy-and-paste is a common practice in industrial software development and maintenance, which results in code clones. Prior research has focused on automatically detecting and analyzing code clones from legacy systems and on eliminating clones. We believe that it is equally important to provide automated support in an integrated development environment (IDE) for the copy-and-paste practice when programs are being written. By instrumenting an IDE, the cloning relation among multiple copy-and-pasted code fragments will be tracked, thus obtaining a clone group. The commonality among members of a clone group will be extracted and represented as rules that capture code intent. We envision uses of the extracted rules for better software quality. Our CnP tool is currently targeted at Java and integrated into Eclipse. Empirical evaluation in terms of false positives, usefulness, and usability will be performed.
