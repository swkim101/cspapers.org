As an entry for the 2006 Gordon Bell price/performance prize, we report an astrophysical N-body simulation performed with reconfigurable computing systems and a hierarchical tree algorithm. Each of our systems consists of a host PC and a reconfigurable add-in card attached via high-speed interface, PCI Express or PCI-X. The reconfigurable add-in card houses one FPGA chip, into which we integrated 16 pipeline processors specialized for gravitational force calculation. Other operations, such as tree construction, tree traverse and time integration, are performed on the host PC. On our system, we performed a cosmological N-body simulation with 2.1 million particles, which sustained a performance of 15.39 Gflops averaged over 4.33 hours. The price of our system is $2,384 in total and, price per performance obtained is $158/Gflops, which is 44 times better than that obtained by GRAPE-5 special-purpose hardware, the 1999 Gordon Bell winner.
