Recent advances in the field of intelligent vehicles have shown the applicability and utility for driver assistance systems, or even letting a car drive autonomously on highways. Usually these approaches are on a rather quantitative level. This hampers their capability to cope situations of great complexity in which humans need a lot of knowledge to act safely, for instance in city traffic. A qualitative representation of traffic scenes allows for formulating and using common sense knowledge in a human-comprehensible and machineprocessable way. A vocabulary for such a representation is proposed and a prototype that does the qualitative abstraction for knowledge-based behaviour control is presented and evaluated. Experiments in a simulation environment show the applicability of the approach for intelligent vehicles.
