This study investigates recall and recognition in a news refinding task where participants were asked to read news articles and then to search for the same articles a fortnight later. Recall, which is a task to express what a person remembers, corresponds to query formulations, while recognition, which is a task to judge whether a presented item has been shown before, corresponds to a user's relevance judgment on search results in a refinding task. Our four main contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) we developed a method to investigate the effects of memory loss on episode refinding tasks on a large scale; (ii) our user study revealed a big drop on search performances in the refinding task after a fortnight and several differences between search queries input immediately after news browsing and ones at a later time; (iii) we found that asking questions and expanding input queries on the basis of the answers significantly improved the search performance in the news refinding task; and (iv) the users' recognition abilities were different than their recall abilities, e.g. object names in a news story could be correctly recognized even though they were rarely recalled. Our findings support several findings in cognitive psychology from the viewpoint of information refinding and also have several implications for search algorithms for assisting user refinding.
