An optimal query has been defined as one which will recover all the known relevant documents of a query in their best probability of relevance ranking. We have slightly modified the definition so that it also allows one to trace its evolution from the original to the optimal via the various feedback stages. Such a query can be constructed by modifying the original query with terms from the known relevant documents. It is pointed out that such a term addition strategy differs materially from other approaches that add terms based on term association with all query terms, and calculated from the whole document collection. The effect of viewing a document as constituted of components, and hence affecting the weighting and retreival results of of the optimal query, is also discussed.
