The computing market has been dominated during the last two decades by the well-known convergence of the high-performance computing market and the mobile market. In this paper we witness a new type of convergence between the mission-critical market (such as avionic or automotive) and the mainstream consumer electronics market. Such convergence is fuelled by the common needs of both markets for more reliability, support for mission-critical functionalities and the challenge of harnessing the unsustainable increases in safety margins to guarantee either correctness or timing. In this position paper, we present a description of this new convergence, as well as the main challenges and opportunities that it brings to computing industry.
