Is my marketing working, how much is marketing helping the business and which campaigns and channels are effective? The key challenge for the Chief Marketing Officer is to tie investment in marketing to business results. In an increasingly complex marketing environment -- marketing organizations are being called upon to prove and optimize the return on marketing investment across different paid earned and owned marketing channels. In this talk we will show how data science and optimization techniques can be applied to cross channel data to attribute marketing effectiveness, drive media planning and real-time optimization of campaigns. Using terabytes of multi-channel data we answer questions such as what is the impact of different marketing campaigns on our business, how should we allocate our marketing dollars between different channels and when should I spend them and how do we execute our marketing campaigns based on the synergies of the different channels.
