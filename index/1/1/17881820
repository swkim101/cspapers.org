Apparatus for adjusting the length of a safety belt includes a base into which the end of a first safety belt portion and the end of a second safety belt portion are fed. The first safety belt portion is fed inward, around an elongated cylindrical member slidably mounted to the base and between the elongated cylindrical member and a portion of the base, so that it may be gripped therebetween. A spring is included for urging the elongated member in a gripping direction and into a gripping position relative to that portion of the base. The end of the second safety belt portion is secured to another portion of the base. Adjusting the belt involves slidably moving the elongated member against the force of the spring away from its associated base portion and sliding the first belt portion therebetween, to be gripped in another position.
