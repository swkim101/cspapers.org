Despite of several years of innovative research, indoor localization is still not mainstream. Existing techniques either employ cumbersome fingerprinting, or rely upon the deployment of additional infrastructure. Towards a solution that is easier to adopt, we propose CUPID, which is free from these restrictions, yet is comparable in accuracy. While existing WiFi based solutions are highly susceptible to indoor multipath, CUPID utilizes physical layer (PHY) information to extract the signal strength and the angle of only the direct path, successfully avoiding the effect of multipath reflections. Our main observation is that natural human mobility, when combined with PHY layer information, can help in accurately estimating the angle and distance of a mobile device from an wireless access point (AP). Real-world indoor experiments using off-the-shelf wireless chipsets confirm the feasibility of CUPID. In addition, while previous approaches rely on multiple APs, CUPID is able to localize a device when only a single AP is present. When a few more APs are available, CUPID can improve the median localization error to 2.7m, which is comparable to schemes that rely on expensive fingerprinting or additional infrastructure.
