Simulation can enhance the understanding of complex systems. A software producing organisation is a complex system. Therefore, an interactive simulation model is presented that lets its user act in the role of such an organisation’s top level management. In this role, business measures must be observed and investment decisions made. The model is developed with the premise of maximal abstraction, using concepts of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI 1.1) and balanced scorecards (BSC). It can be used by all stakeholders involved in software development to better understand the various aspects of software engineering, their interdependencies and the resulting complex behaviour of a software producing organisation’s operations.
