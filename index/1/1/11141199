Supercomputing systems have made great strides in recent years as the extensive computing needs of cuttingedge engineering work and scientific discovery have driven the development of more powerful systems. In 2008, the first petaflop machine was released, and historic trends indicate that in ten years, we should be at the exascale level. Indeed, various agencies are targeting a computer system capable of 1 Exaop (10⋆⋆18 ops) of computation within the next decade. We believe that applications in many industries will be materially transformed by exascale computers.
