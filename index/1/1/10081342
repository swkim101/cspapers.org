We present new, general-purpose kernels for protein structure analysis, and describe how to apply them to structural motif discovery and function classification. Experiments show that our new methods are faster than conventional techniques, are capable of finding structural motifs, and are very effective in function classification. In addition to strong cross-validation results, we found possible new oxidoreductases and cytochrome P450 reductases and a possible new structural motif in cytochrome P450 reductases.
