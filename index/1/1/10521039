This paper reports on an experiment comparing the retrieval effectiveness of an interactive information retrieval (IIR) system which adapts to support different information seeking strategies, with that of a standard baseline IIR system. The experiment, with 32 subjects each searching on 8 different topics, indicates that using the integrated IIR system resulted in significantly better performance, including user satisfaction with search results, significantly more effective interaction, and significantly better usability than using the baseline system.
