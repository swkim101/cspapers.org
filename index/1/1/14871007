A robot finger is developed for five-fingered robot hand having equal number of DOF to human hand. The robot hand is driven by a new method proposed by authors using ultrasonic motors and elastic elements. The method utilizes restoring force of elastic element as driving power for grasping an object, so that the hand can perform the soft and stable grasping motion with no power supply. In addition, all the components are placed inside the hand thanks to the ultrasonic motors with compact size and high torque at low speed. Applying the driving method to multi-DOF mechanism, a robot index finger is designed and implemented. It has equal number of joints and DOF to human index finger, and it is also equal in size to the finger of average adult male. The performance of the robot finger is confirmed by fundamental driving test.
