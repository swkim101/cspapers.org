The brain represents the skin surface as a topographic map in the somatosensory cortex. This map has been shown experimentally to be modifiable in a use-dependent fashion throughout life. We present a neural network simulation of the competitive dynamics underlying this cortical plasticity by detailed analysis of receptive field properties of model neurons during simulations of skin coactivation, cortical lesion, digit amputation and nerve section.
