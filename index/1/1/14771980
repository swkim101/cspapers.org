Maximizing overall performance in multicomputers requires matching application communication characteristics with a suitable routing scheme. However, since the communication demands of emerging applications vary significantly, it is hard for a single routing algorithm to perform well under all workloads. In order to study the complex dependencies between routing policies and communication workloads, we have performed a set of multi-factor experiments to better characterize routing performance. These experiments show that in addition to adaptivity, the selection functions used to order the candidate links greatly affect network performance under various traftic patterns. By supporting flexible routing, the network can tune its routing policies to application communication characteristics in order to improve performance.
