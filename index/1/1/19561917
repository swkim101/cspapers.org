A data-driven identification of dynamical systems 
requiring only minimal prior knowledge 
is promising whenever no analytically derived 
model structure is available, e.g., from first principles 
in physics. However, meta-knowledge on 
the systemâ€™s behavior is often given and should 
be exploited: Stability as fundamental property 
is essential when the model is used for controller 
design or movement generation. Therefore, this 
paper proposes a framework for learning stable 
stochastic systems from data. We focus on 
identifying a state-dependent coefficient form of 
the nonlinear stochastic model which is globally 
asymptotically stable according to probabilistic 
Lyapunov methods. We compare our approach 
to other state of the art methods on real-world 
datasets in terms of flexibility and stability.
