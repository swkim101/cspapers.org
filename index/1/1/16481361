With the advent of large scale and medium scale integrated circuit, test and diagnosis of digital logic circuits become more and more difficult to get an efficient and economical goal.
 In this paper, Test Generation Systems for testing digital logic circuits (IC Cards) in Japan are introduced. One implemented in Nippon Electric Co. is described in detail. Future problems of Test Generation Systems are also briefly discussed.
