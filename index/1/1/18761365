The recently proposed curricula for a master's degree present problems for a department with limited resources. This paper discusses the proposed curricula, their goals and problems, and then presents a new curriculum based upon a set of core courses. The new curriculum simultaneously satisfies two of the proposed curricula, yet imposes lower demands upon the department's resources.
