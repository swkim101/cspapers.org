In dynamic settings where data is exposed by streams, knowledge discovery aims at learning associations of data across streams. In the semantic Web, streams expose their meaning through evolutive versions of ontologies. Such settings pose challenges of scalability for discovering (a posteriori) knowledge. In our work, the semantics, identifying knowledge similarity and rarity in streams, together with incremental, approximate maintenance, control scalability while preserving accuracy of streams associations (as semantic rules) discovery.
