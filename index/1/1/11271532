We describe a new pruning approach to remove phrase pairs from translation models of statistical machine translation systems. The approach applies the original translation system to a large amount of text and calculates usage statistics for the phrase pairs. Using these statistics the relevance of each phrase pair can be estimated. The approach is tested against a strong baseline based on previous work and shows significant improvements.
