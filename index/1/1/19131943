Images are converted to sparse domain using transforms like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) where information that requires encoding is minimal. By optimally selecting the feature-rich frequencies, we are able to learn the latent vectors more robustly. We successfully show enhanced performance of autoencoders in sparse domain for images.
