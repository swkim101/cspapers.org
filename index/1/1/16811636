We illustrate the basic features of the Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE), a new finite-difference scheme that arises from the microdynamics of the Frisch-Hasslacher-Pomcau cellular automation once, instead of tracking the individual history of each particle, one only solves for the mean values of the particle populations living in the lattice. Details on the actual coding of the LBE scheme are presented and discussed along with performance data pertaining to the vector and parallel implementation on the IBM 3090/600 vector multiprocessor. Finally, two applications in the field of two and three-dimensional hydrodynamics are briefly illustrated.
