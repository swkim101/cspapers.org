In cross-database retrieval, the domain of queries differs from that of the retrieval target in the distribution of term occurrences. This causes incorrect term weighting in the retrieval system which assigns to each term a retrieval weight based on the distribution of term occurrences. To resolve the problem, we propose "term distillation", a framework for query term selection in cross-database retrieval. The experiments using the NTCIR-3 patent retrieval test collection demonstrate that term distillation is effective for cross-database retrieval.
