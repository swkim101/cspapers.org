A class of robotic systems that is attracting increased scientific attention is Large-Scale Actuator Networks (LSANs). A potential application of actuator networks is distributed manipulation, a technique that has significant utility within the field of industrial automation. A reactive elastic surface that autonomously morphs its shape to transport an arbitrary number of objects to a target location is presented to explore this class of systems. A collection of actuators within a network are used to overcome the limitations of individual actuator elements, and results in a system that has multiple degrees-of-freedom. Experimental results and simulation data are presented to illustrate the functionality and scalability of the platform.
