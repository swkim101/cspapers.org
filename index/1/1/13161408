The first course in the overwhelming majority of Computer Science Departments is an introductor y course in high-level language programming [1] . Because of this a number of papers have appeared, i n the SIGCSE Bulletin and elsewhere, describing details of the introductory programming course at a numbe r of schools . These papers are useful in comparing one ' s own approach with that of other schools and possibly learning from them . [2,3 ] However, instead of attempting to abstract general principles from a large number of specific cases , here we wish to take the reverse approach -to describe the crucial goals of any introductory programmin g course while leaving to the reader the design of a specific course to meet these goals . This paper presents what we feel are the ten essential objectives of an initial programming course in Computer Science , regardless of who is teaching or where it is being taught . It attempts to provide an in-depth, philosophical framework for the course called CSI -Computer Programming I -as described by the ACM Curriculu m Committee on Computer Science . [4] From these ten principles will come the skeletal outline of a course . The "flesh " , or specific details, of this course as it will appear at University "X " can and should b e left to the discretion of the instructor at that school . We are not so much concerned with exactly ho w these goals are to be implemented as we are with a consensus on what these goals should be . II. Basic Principle s
