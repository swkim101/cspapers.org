In this paper, we propose a two-stage student identification scheme-chin shape classification and holistic face recognition. Chin shape is first used to divide the input face into the corresponding chin-shape category. Next, the facial features are used for further face identification. This procedure approximates how humans perceive faces. The experimental results show that our system efficiently and accurately identified students via webcams, and that also shows that our system is promising for automatic roll-call in classroom locale.
