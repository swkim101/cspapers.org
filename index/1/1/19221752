Many of these social-based recommender systems linearly combine the multiplication of social features between users. However, these methods lack the ability to capture complex and intrinsic non-linear features from social relations. In this paper, we present a deep neural network based model to learn non-linear features of each user from social relations, and to integrate into probabilistic matrix factorization for rating prediction problem. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art social-based recommender systems.
