We present a taxonomy of languages for multiparty interaction, which covers all proposals of which we are aware. Based on this taxonomy, we present a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the multiparty interaction implementation problem, the problem of scheduling multiparty interactions in a given execution environment.
