The prediction of academic performance is one of the most important tasks in educational data mining, and has been widely studied in MOOCs and intelligent tutoring systems. Academic performance could be affected with factors like personality, skills, social environment, the use of library books and so on. However, it is still less investigated that how could the use of library books affect academic performance of college students and even leverage book-loan history for predicting academic performance. To this end, we propose a supervised content-aware matrix factorization for mutual reinforcement of academic performance prediction and library book recommendation. This model not only addresses the sparsity challenge by explainable dimension reduction techniques, but also promotes library book recommendation by recommending "right" books for students based on their performance levels and book meta information. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on three years of the book-loan history and cumulative grade point average of 13,047 undergraduate students in one university. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the competing baselines on both tasks, and that academic performance is not only predictable from the book-loan history but also improves the recommendation of library books for students.
