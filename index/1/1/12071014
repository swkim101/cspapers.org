We address a key problem in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion: the ambiguity in mapping grapheme units to phonemes. Rather than using single letters and phonemes as units, we propose learning chunks, or subwords, to reduce ambiguity. This can be interpreted as learning a lexicon of subwords that has minimum description length. We implement an algorithm to build such a lexicon, as well as a simple decoder that uses these subwords.
