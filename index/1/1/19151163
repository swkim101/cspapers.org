Dataset description vocabularies focus on provenance, versioning, licensing, and similar metadata. VoID is a notable exception, providing some expressivity for describing subsets and their contents and can, to some extent, be used for discovering relevant resources and for optimizing querying. In this poster we describe an extension of VoID that provides the expressivity needed in order to support the query planning methods typically used in federated querying.
