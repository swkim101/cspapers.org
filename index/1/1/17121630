This paper presents a novel interaction system, PUB (Point Upon Body), to explore eyes-free interaction in a personal space by allowing users tapping on their own arms to be provided with haptic feedback from their skin. Two user studies determine how users can interact precisely with their forearms and how users behave when operating in their arm space. According to those results, normal users can divide their arm space at most into 6 points between their wrists and elbows with iterative practice. Experimental results also indicate that the divided pattern of each user is unique from that of other ones. Based on the design principles from the observations, an interaction system, PUB, is designed to demonstrate how interaction design benefits from those findings. Two scenarios, remote display control and mobile device control, are demonstrated through the UltraSonic device attached on the users' wrists to detect their tapped positions.
