SETL is a very high level programming language supporting set theoretical syntax and semantics. It allows algorithms to be programmed rapidly and succinctly without requiring data structure declarations to be supplied, though such declarations can be manually specified later, without recoding the program, to improve the efficiency of program execution. We describe a new technique for automatic selection of appropriate data representations during compile-time for undeclared, or partially declared programs,and present an efficient data structure selection algorithm, whose complexity is comparable with those of the fastest known general data-flow algorithms of Tarjan [TA2] and Reif [RE].
