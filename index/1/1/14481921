We developed a RoboJockey (Robot Jockey) interface for coordinating robot actions, such as dancing - similar to "Disc jockey" and "Video jockey". The system enables a user to choreograph a dance for a robot to perform by using a simple visual language. Users can coordinate humanoid robot actions with a combination of arm and leg movements. Every action is automatically performed to background music and beat. The RoboJockey will give a new entertainment experience with robots to the end-users.
