We have trained networks of Î£ - II units with short-range connections to simulate simple cellular automata that exhibit complex or chaotic behaviour. Three levels of learning are possible (in decreasing order of difficulty): learning the underlying automaton rule, learning asymptotic dynamical behaviour, and learning to extrapolate the training history. The levels of learning achieved with and without weight sharing for different automata provide new insight into their dynamics.
