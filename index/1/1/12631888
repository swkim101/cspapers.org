Approximation of the permanent of a matrix with nonnegative entries is a well studied problem. The most successful approach to date for general matrices uses Markov chains to approximately sample from a distribution on weighted permutations, and Jerrum, Sinclair, and Vigoda developed such a method they proved runs in polynomial time in the input. The current bound on the running time of their method is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>7</sup>(log <i>n</i>)<sup>4</sup>). Here we present a very different approach using sequential acceptance/rejection, and show that for a class of dense problems this method has an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup> log <i>n</i>) expected running time.
