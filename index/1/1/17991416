Many downstream NLP tasks can benefit from Open Information Extraction (Open IE) as a semantic representation. While Open IE systems are available for English, many other languages lack such tools. In this paper, we present a straightforward approach for adapting PropS, a rule-based predicate-argument analysis for English, to a new language, German. With this approach, we quickly obtain an Open IE system for German covering 89% of the English rule set. It yields 1.6 extractions per sentence with 60% precision, making it readily usable in downstream applications.
