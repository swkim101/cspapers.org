Omnidirectional cameras are leaving the scientific labs to be used in market applications. Many such application areas like robotics and automotive need very accurate models of the image formation. When a car or robot motion is controlled by an omnidirectional camera system, the exact control of action depends on a reliable calibration. An unprecise calibration can cause costly or hazardous consequences for man and machine. Therefore, we developed an omnidirectional camera model that can deal with parabolic and hyperbolic mirrors in combination with distorting lenses. It has the adequate complexity to allow both, precision and robustness of the calibration process. We successfully applied this model to our driver assistance systems of future light and heavy trucks.
