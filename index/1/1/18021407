In this paper, we investigate case restoration for text without case information. Previous such work operates at the word level. We pro-pose an approach using character-level recurrent neural networks (RNN), which performs competitively compared to language modeling and conditional random Ô¨Åelds (CRF) approaches. We further provide quantitative and qualitative analysis on how RNN helps improve truecasing.
