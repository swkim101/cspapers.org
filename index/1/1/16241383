This research involves a method for finding global maxima in constraint satisfaction networks. It is an annealing process but, unlike most others, requires no annealing schedule. Temperature is instead determined locally by units at each update, and thus all processing is done at the unit level. There are two major practical benefits to processing this way: 1) processing can continue in 'bad' areas of the network, while 'good' areas remain stable, and 2) processing continues in the 'bad' areas, as long as the constraints remain poorly satisfied (i.e. it does not stop after some predetermined number of cycles). As a result, this method not only avoids the kludge of requiring an externally determined annealing schedule, but it also finds global maxima more quickly and consistently than externally scheduled systems (a comparison to the Boltzmann machine (Ackley et al, 1985) is made). Finally, implementation of this method is computationally trivial.
