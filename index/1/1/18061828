Transfer learning tends to be exploited as a powerful tool that mitigates the discrepancy between different databases used for knowledge transfer. It can also be used for knowledge transfer between different modalities within one database. However, in either case, transfer learning will fail if the target data are missing. To overcome this, we consider knowledge transfer between different databases and modalities simultaneously in a single framework, where missing target data from one database are recovered to facilitate recognition task. We referred to this framework as Latent Low-rank Transfer Subspace Learning method (L2TSL). We first propose to use a low-rank constraint as well as dictionary learning in a learned subspace to guide the knowledge transfer between and within different databases. We then introduce a latent factor to uncover the underlying structure of the missing target data. Next, transfer learning in two directions is proposed to integrate auxiliary database for transfer learning with missing target data. Experimental results of multi-modalities knowledge transfer with missing target data demonstrate that our method can successfully inherit knowledge from the auxiliary database to complete the target domain, and therefore enhance the performance when recognizing data from the modality without any training data.
