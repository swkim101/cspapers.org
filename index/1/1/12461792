It is important in Nuclear Security to detect changes made in a given installation or track the progression of the construction work in a new plant. This paper describes a system accepting multi-sensory, variable scale data as input. Scalability allows for different acquisition systems and algorithms according to the size of the objects/buildings/sites to be modelled. Semi-automated tools support the comparison between the acquired "as-built" and the approved design models. The paper presents examples of the use in indoor and outdoor environments. It shows that it is possible in any time to redo a data acquisition from the same area without any assumptions of exact position, orientation or used scanner. Based on this new information it is possible to detect centimetre changes in the scene.
