The “meaning” of KWILT has been lost to etymological history. The K was in honor of D. Knuth, but this gives “Knuth WILT” which is a bit disconcerting. Indeed, there was a tendency to pronounce the language as “kay-wilt”, which offended veteran users as much as COBOL programmers would resent “cobble”.
