We study challenges that are imposed to mathematical domain reasoning in the context of natural language tutorial dialog on mathematical proofs. The focus is on proof step evaluation: (i) How can mathematical domain reasoning support the resolution of ambiguities and underspecified parts in proof steps uttered by a student? (ii) How can mathematical domain reasoning support the evaluation of a proof step with respect to the criteria soundness, granularity, and relevance?.
