We introduce TeamGen, an interactive team formation system, to form project teams interactively by leveraging professional social network information of potential members. Unlike earlier approaches that focused on creating flat teams, i.e., teams without communities and central authorities, we model teams as hierarchical structures to reflect the ubiquitous nature of teams in real commercial and open source projects. Correspondingly, our team formation algorithms emphasize local density of sub teams to assess communication costs of newly formed teams. During the demonstration, audience can (a) explore professional social network of potential members, (b) learn the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed team formation algorithms by comparing them with existing ones, (c) inspect and understand the process of team formation, and (d) interactively refine a project team by revoking computed position assignments.
