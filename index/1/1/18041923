A relational knowledge base model and an architecture which manipulates the model are presented. An item stored in the relational knowledge base is called a term. A unification operation on terms in the relational knowledge base is used as the retrieval mechanism. The relational knowledge base architecture we propose consists of a number of unification engines, several disk systems, a control processor, and a multiport page-memory. The system has a knowledge compiler to support a variety of knowledge representations.
