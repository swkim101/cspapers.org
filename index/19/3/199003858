Ensuring a design’s functional correctness within time-tomarket constraints, continues to stand as one of the biggest challenges for today’s ASIC design teams. Lately, circuit designers have turned to Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for the simulation of their complete systems (FPGA emulation), that offer operating frequencies that are several orders of magnitude faster than simulation. However, debugging through FPGA emulation has its own challenges, such as lack of on-chip signal observability. Moreover, observing a new subset of signals requires recompilation of the circuit. Each instrument-compile-debug iteration can take multiple hours.
