The article offers a discussion about the limits of reception studies. Instead of this thread of research, the author engages with the proposal of study cultural identities. This involves an approach that has been developed in a series of studies based first in Hallâ€™s encode/decode model and finally in cultural circuits (du Gay, Hall et al, 1997; Hall, 1997). The main advantage of this method is to consider the sphere of regulation, rethinking the relations between culture and power, level that it is usually forgotten within reception studies.
