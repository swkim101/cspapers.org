This paper addresses practices of sound intervention and listening based on cell phones in the day-to-day life in urban spaces. It discusses the role of sounds and music as technologies of the self (De Nora), as well as couplings among body, subject and mobile and locative media in the construction of contemporary soundscapes. At the same time, it problematizes the argument put forward by Michael Bull in his work Sound Moves, which sees the use of mobile media in the urban space – especially Ipods and cell phones – as a tool that contribute to the decline of public life.
