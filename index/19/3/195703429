Five of Israel's institutions of higher learning have computer centers and teach courses related to computer sciences. There are two undergraduate programs, three master's degree programs, and one doctoral degree program. These programs are described in this paper. In particular, the undergraduate program at Bar-Ilan University, which is based on Curriculum 68, is described in detail. As a background to the descriptions of the Computer Science curricula, there is a general description of the various university computer centers. The Appendix contains a detailed discussion of the computer configurations, student enrollment, administrative position of the center within the universities, and the scientific applications staff, if any, within the centers.
