In the last decade, a lot of research has been done to prevent the illegal distribution of digital content, % in the context in which the proprietary content is a medium such as musical works and movies. However, only few works have tackled this problem for databases, and even less for databases containing personal and sensitive information (\emphe.g, a medical database). In this work, we address this latter issue by proposing Ã¸uralgo\ (for Sanitization and Personalization of Databases ), an approach in which the owner of a database personalizes it before distributing it to ensure that a malicious buyer can be traced back in case of an illegal redistribution. Our novel solution entwines the personalization step with a sanitization mechanism to prevent the leak of personal information and limit the privacy risks. Thus, our objective is to release a sanitized and personalized database, both to protect the privacy of the concerned individuals and to prevent the illegal redistribution, even from a collusion of malicious buyers.
