Recently social networks emerged as the main support of social movements and the technological platforms were identified as privileged scene. This work resumes the discussion of Social Sciences about actors, structures and social change, from the importance assumed by communication in the context of contemporary mobilizations. The idea is to contribute in strengthening analytical these new forms of political action from a conceptual review between the communicational paradigms and theories of social movements. The main challenge is that, at the expense of the little attention given to communication by theories of social movements, the complexity of the link between ICTs and the incidence policy confuses and redefines the concept of collective action and elevates the communication the condition of social movement. In this regard, the interpretations of these new movements online necessarily by communicative theories, which should cause reinterpretations in both areas.
