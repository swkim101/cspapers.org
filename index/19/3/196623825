The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a fundamental Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for sampling and inference. With the advent of Big Data, distributed and parallel variants of MCMC methods are attracting increased attention. In this paper, we give a distributed algorithm that can correctly simulate sequential single-site Metropolis chains without any bias in a fully asynchronous message-passing model. Furthermore, if a natural Lipschitz condition is satisfied by the Metropolis filters, our algorithm can simulate $N$-step Metropolis chains within $O(N/n+\log n)$ rounds of asynchronous communications, where $n$ is the number of variables. For sequential single-site dynamics, whose mixing requires $\Omega(n\log n)$ steps, this achieves an optimal linear speedup. For several well-studied important graphical models, including proper graph coloring, hardcore model, and Ising model, our condition for linear speedup is weaker than the respective uniqueness (mixing) conditions. 
The novel idea in our algorithm is to resolve updates in advance: the local Metropolis filters can often be executed correctly before the full information about neighboring spins is available. This achieves optimal parallelism without introducing any bias.
