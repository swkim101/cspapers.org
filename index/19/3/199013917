In recent years, Japanâ€™s elderly population has been growing. As a method of reducing the nursing care period, we studied a fall risk detection for elderly people. Our aim is to detect the fall risk with contactless sensors. First, we took a video of the 5-meter walking test by 40 subjects. Then, we processed them using OpenPose. Finally, rehabilitation exercise instructors evaluated the fall risk at 3 levels. In this paper, we reported on 3 machine learning models and evaluated the accuracy of the fall prediction. As a result, we found that all algorithms obtained accuracy of around 80% even with contactless sensors.
