This paper proposes a calibration strategy for distorted camera with high precision. It makes use of planar homography constraint to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. On the basis of this initial guess, an optimization scheme is used to minimize a new cost function, which is based on a perspective 3-point (P3P) algorithm. All the calibration parameters are globally optimized simultaneously with genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation and real image experiment result show this technique have much higher precision than traditional methods.
