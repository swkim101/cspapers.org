Learning class-conditional data distributions is crucial for Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in semi-supervised learning. To improve both instance synthesis and classification in this setting, we propose an enhanced TripleGAN (EnhancedTGAN) model in this work. We follow the adversarial training scheme of the original TripleGAN, but completely re-design the training targets of the generator and classifier. Specifically, we adopt feature-semantics matching to enhance the generator in learning class-conditional distributions from both the aspects of statistics in the latent space and semantics consistency with respect to the generator and classifier. Since a limited amount of labeled data is not sufficient to determine satisfactory decision boundaries, we include two classifiers, and incorporate collaborative learning into our model to provide better guidance for generator training. The synthesized high-fidelity data can in turn be used for improving classifier training. In the experiments, the superior performance of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the mutual reinforcement between the generator and classifiers in facilitating semi-supervised instance synthesis and classification.
