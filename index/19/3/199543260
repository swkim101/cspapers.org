The coded trace reconstruction problem asks to construct a code <tex>$C \subset \{0,1\}^{n}$</tex> such that any <tex>$x\in C$</tex> is recoverable from independent outputs (“traces”) of <tex>$x$</tex> from a binary deletion channel (BDC). We present binary codes of rate <tex>$1-\varepsilon$</tex> that are efficiently recoverable from <tex>$\exp(O_{q}(\log^{1/3}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})))$</tex> (a constant independent of <tex>$n$</tex>) traces of a <tex>$\text{BDC}_{q}$</tex> for any constant deletion probability <tex>$q\in(0,1)$</tex>. We also show that, for rate <tex>$1 -\varepsilon$</tex> binary codes, <tex>$\tilde{\Omega}(\log^{5/2}(1/\varepsilon))$</tex> traces are required. The results follow from a pair of black-box reductions that show that average-case trace reconstruction is essentially equivalent to coded trace reconstruction. We also show that there exist codes of rate <tex>$1 -\varepsilon$</tex> over an <tex>$O_{\varepsilon}(1)$</tex>-sized alphabet that are recoverable from <tex>$O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$</tex> traces, and that this is tight.
