Online discussions are valuable resources to study user behaviour on a diverse set of topics. Unlike previous studies which model a discussion in a static manner, in the present study, we model it as a time-varying process and solve two inter-related problems – predict which user groups will get engaged with an ongoing discussion, and forecast the growth rate of a discussion in terms of the number of comments. We propose RGNet (Relativistic Gravitational Nerwork), a novel algorithm that uses Einstein Field Equations of gravity to model online discussions as 'cloud of dust' hovering over a user spacetime manifold, attracting users of different groups at different rates over time. We also propose GUVec, a global user embedding method for an online discussion, which is used by RGNet to predict temporal user engagement. RGNet leverages different textual and network-based features to learn the dust distribution for discussions. We employ four baselines – first two using LSTM architecture, third one using Newtonian model of gravity, and fourth one using a logistic regression adopted from a previous work on engagement prediction. Experiments on Reddit dataset show that RGNet achieves 0.72 Micro F1 score and 6.01% average error for temporal engagement prediction of user groups and growth rate forecasting, respectively, outperforming all the baselines significantly. We further employ RGNet to predict non-temporal engagement – whether users will comment to a given post or not. RGNet achieves 0.62 AUC for this task, outperforming existing baseline by 8.77% AUC.
