Urbanization's rapid progress has led to many big cities, which have modernized people's lives but also engendered big challenges, such as air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. Tackling these challenges can seem nearly impossible years ago given the complex and dynamic settings of cities. Nowadays, sensing technologies and large-scale computing infrastructures have produced a variety of big data in urban spaces, e.g. human mobility, air quality, traffic patterns, and geographical data. The big data implies rich knowledge about a city and can help tackle these challenges when used correctly. Urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, buildings, and human, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g. air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. Urban computing connects unobtrusive and ubiquitous sensing technologies, advanced data management and analytics models, and novel visualization methods, to create win-win-win solutions that improve urban environment, human life quality, and city operation systems. Urban computing also helps us understand the nature of urban phenomena and even predict the future of cities.
