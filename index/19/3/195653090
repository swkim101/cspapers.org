Embedded and cyber-physical systems are critically dependent on the integrity of input and output signals for proper operation. Input signals acquired from sensors are assumed to correspond to the phenomenon the system is monitoring and responding to. Similarly, when such systems issue an actuation signal it is expected that the mechanism being controlled will respond in a predictable manner. Recent work has shown that sensors can be manipulated through the use of intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). In this work, we demonstrate thatboth input and output signals, analog and digital, can be remotely manipulated via the physical layer---thus bypassing traditional integrity mechanisms. Through the use of specially crafted IEMI it is shown that the physical layer signaling used for sensor input to, and digital communications between, embedded systems may be undermined to an attacker's advantage. Three attack scenarios are analyzed and their efficacy demonstrated. In the first scenario the analog sensing channel is manipulated to produce arbitrary sensor readings, while in the second it is shown that an attacker may induce bit flips in serial communications. Finally, a commonly used actuation signal is shown to be vulnerable to IEMI. The attacks are effective over appreciable distances and at low power.
