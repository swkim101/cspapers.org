To fight against real-life image forgery, which commonly involves different types and combined manipulations, we propose a unified deep neural architecture called ManTra-Net. Unlike many existing solutions, ManTra-Net is an end-to-end network that performs both detection and localization without extra preprocessing and postprocessing. \manifold{} is a fully convolutional network and handles images of arbitrary sizes and many known forgery types such splicing, copy-move, removal, enhancement, and even unknown types. This paper has three salient contributions. We design a simple yet effective self-supervised learning task to learn robust image manipulation traces from classifying 385 image manipulation types. Further, we formulate the forgery localization problem as a local anomaly detection problem, design a Z-score feature to capture local anomaly, and propose a novel long short-term memory solution to assess local anomalies. Finally, we carefully conduct ablation experiments to systematically optimize the proposed network design. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the generalizability, robustness and superiority of ManTra-Net, not only in single types of manipulations/forgeries, but also in their complicated combinations.
