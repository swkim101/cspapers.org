This study explores how ‘pirate audiences’ watch television shows through informal means of distribution over the internet. It investigates and categorises informal practices of television downloading through analysis of literature review and case studies in Brazil. Brazil is one of the world’s largest economies and where over 20 million people are involved in unauthorised downloading of media everyday. Moreover, I argue that regardless of the informal ways of viewing, pirates are, in fact, audiences. Though they are audiences involved in informal practices, they still watch the same television content. Therefore, a practice oriented research is needed to extend the notions of audiences and pirates and their television viewing practices.
