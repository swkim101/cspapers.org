This article intends to investigate the strategies that are promoted to put journalistic images in circulation. So this is a study about what is distributed by media and is reinstated in several devices, therefore, at the same time circulation and circularity. Thus starting with the presupposition that more and more there is an increasing number of images being offered, there is, however, a small number of images which fix themselves, so called vector images, or which become totem exactly because of their potential for fixation and self-referential communication, since they convene deep structures of the imaginary and are journalistically approved. In order to verify such hypothesis, this research presents as its corpus a group of images about Michael Jacksonâ€™s death. As theoretical support to this research, authors like Cassirer, Baitelo Junior, Marcia Benetti and Ferreira, among others, are taken. The question is: how does the creation of symbolic or totem images take place?
