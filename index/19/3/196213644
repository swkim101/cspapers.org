We present the first annotated resource for the aspectual classification of German verb tokens in their clausal context. We use aspectual features compatible with the plurality of aspectual classifications in previous work and treat aspectual ambiguity systematically. We evaluate our corpus by using it to train supervised classifiers to automatically assign aspectual categories to verbs in context, permitting favourable comparisons to previous work.
