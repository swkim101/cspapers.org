Liquid reaction product mixtures of diphenylmethane diisocyanates and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates resulting from the thermal decomposition of the corresponding carbamates produced by the acid condensation of an N-aryl carbamic acid ester, such as ethylphenylcarbamate, with formaldehyde are storage stabilized against an increase in viscosity and decrease in free NCO content, by incorporating therein an effective amount of a compound having the formula wherein R is hydrogen or an alkyl group having up to 4 carbon atoms, x plus y is equal to 3 and z is an integer of from 0 to 3.
