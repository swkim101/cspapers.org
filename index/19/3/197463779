We present a general policy formulation for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) called controller family policies that may be used as a framework to facilitate the design of new policy forms. We prove how modern approximate policy forms: point-based, finite state controller (FSC), and belief compression, are instances of this family of generalized controller policies. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the POMDP model and suggests novel ways to design POMDP solutions that can combine the benefits of different state-of-the-art methods. We illustrate this capability by creating a new customized POMDP policy form called the belief-integrated FSC (BI-FSC) tailored to overcome the shortcomings of a state-of-the-art algorithm that uses non-linear programming (NLP). Specifically, experiments show that for NLP the BI-FSC offers improved performance over a vanilla FSC-based policy form on benchmark domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate the BI-FSCâ€™s execution on a real robot navigating in a maze environment. Results confirm the value of using the controller family policy as a framework to design customized policies in POMDP robotic solutions.
