Since the traditional electrical system data monitor equipment has some shortage, such as limited monitoring objects, single monitoring direction, the authors combine computer science Internet technologies with electric power system production process and extend the scope of monitoring system. This paper analyzes the key technology by which the operator monitoring system can be realized, and puts forward the scheme, which based on.NET platform, of recording operator's behaviors during electric power generation, and it is implemented in WINDOWS system.
