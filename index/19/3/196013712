The purpose of this text is to impart in outline form the experience of the Popular School of Critical Communication (ESPOCC), which pioneers the training of youth from the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, in order to qualify them as civic reporters. They are expected to assert the social identity of neighborhoods set apart from the global society and to provide images of popular communities indeed different from those spread abroad by the regular mass media. ESPOCC is supposed to be a counter-hegemonic device, the main purpose of which is to foster the scattering of civic communication in Rio.
