In light of the method proposed by Simmel, centered on the concept of sociability, in this article we investigate the ludic dimension of the conversational site Omegle.com, aiming to apprehend the form of their interactions. For this, we problematize the two differential characteristics of the site. First, based on the social phenomenology of Schutz, we discuss the formation of relationships through the use of a random system. Secondly, based on the dialectic of identity of Ricoeur, we reflect how the site constitutes an anonymous subject, designated as "stranger." In conclusion, we believe that the social game played on Omegle is characterized by equilibrium, dynamism and ephemerality, being used for many different purposes, such as simple talk, virtual sex, autonomous learning and social observation.
