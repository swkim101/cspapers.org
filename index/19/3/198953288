In this paper we propose a neural message passing approach to augment an input 3D indoor scene with new objects matching their surroundings. Given an input, potentially incomplete, 3D scene and a query location, our method predicts a probability distribution over object types that fit well in that location. Our distribution is predicted though passing learned messages in a dense graph whose nodes represent objects in the input scene and edges represent spatial and structural relationships. By weighting messages through an attention mechanism, our method learns to focus on the most relevant surrounding scene context to predict new scene objects. We found that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of correctly predicting objects missing in a scene based on our experiments in the SUNCG dataset. We also demonstrate other applications of our method, including context-based 3D object recognition and iterative scene generation.
