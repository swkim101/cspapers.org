DNS is a vital component for almost every networked application. Originally it was designed as an unencrypted protocol, making user security a concern. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) is the latest proposal to make name resolution more secure. In this paper we study the current DNS-over-HTTPS ecosystem, especially the cost of the additional security. We start by surveying the current DoH landscape by assessing standard compliance and supported features of public DoH servers. We then compare different transports for secure DNS, to highlight the improvements DoH makes over its predecessor, DNS-over-TLS (DoT). These improvements explain in part the significantly larger take-up of DoH in comparison to DoT. Finally, we quantify the overhead incurred by the additional layers of the DoH transport and their impact on web page load times. We find that these overheads only have limited impact on page load times, suggesting that it is possible to obtain the improved security of DoH with only marginal performance impact.
