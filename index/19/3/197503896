This paper aims to discuss the role of experience in the constitution of representations. It starts by defining the notion of experience, by analyzing John Dewey’s pragmatist approach and some contemporary contributions. It then discusses the concept of representation, exploring Durkheim’s canonical definition, Paul Ricoeur’s idea of mimesis and Gilbert Durand’s notion of symbolic imagination. The paper highlights the complexity and dynamicity that marks the flows of signification. It emphasizes the role played by the symbolic in the construction of individuals and society, as well as the interactive dimension of experience. Moreover, the article stresses how experience and representation constitute each other; something essential to analyses in the field of communication studies.
