Subset selection, which is the task of finding a small subset of most informative items from a large ground set, finds numerous applications in different areas. Sequential data, including time-series and ordered data, contain important structural relationships among items, imposed by underlying dynamic models of data, that should play a vital role in the selection of representatives. However, nearly all existing subset selection techniques ignore underlying dynamics of data and treat items independently, leading to incompatible set of representatives. In this paper, we develop a new framework for sequential subset selection that takes advantage of the underlying dynamic models of data, promoting to select a set of representatives that not only are of high quality and diversity, but also are compatible according to the underlying dynamic models. To do so, we equip items with transition dynamic models and pose the problem as an integer binary optimization over assignments of sequential items to representatives, that leads to high encoding, diversity and transition potentials. As the proposed formulation is non-convex, we derive a max-sum message passing algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Experiments on synthetic and real data, including instructional video summarization and motion capture segmentation, show that our sequential subset selection framework not only achieves better encoding and diversity than the state of the art, but also successfully incorporates dynamic of data, leading to compatible representatives.
