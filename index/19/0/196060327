Based on the research of DA462 type engine cylinder and cylinder head vibration signal of the surface, the signal measured in the time domain and frequency domain are analyzed in detail, draw the following conclusions: the analysis of vibration signal of the subband energy method is applied to the engine, the concentration response of each of the motivation band can clearly be seen. Through the analysis we can see that the combustion excitation frequency response from 0k to 1K, the vibration influence on the body piston lateral impact force is mainly concentrated in 2K∼5K frequency range of Hz, valve opening and closing the excitation response frequency is mainly concentrated in the 3K∼4K range of Hz, and thus locating the valve clearance fault. This method is simple, accurate and practical for the post processing and analysis of vibration signals.
