Machine learning (ML) can be hard to master, but what first trips up novices is something much more mundane: the incidental complexities of installing and configuring software development environments. Everyone has a web browser, so can we let people experiment with ML within the context of any webpage they visit? This paper's contribution is the idea that the web can serve as a contextualized prototyping environment for ML by enabling analyses to occur within the context of data on actual webpages rather than in isolated silos. We realized this idea by building Mallard, a browser extension that scaffolds acquiring and parsing web data, prototyping with pretrained ML models, and augmenting webpages with ML-driven results and interactions. To demonstrate the versatility of Mallard, we performed a case study where we used it to prototype nine ML-based browser apps, including augmenting Amazon and Twitter websites with sentiment analysis, augmenting restaurant menu websites with OCR-based search, using real-time face tracking to control a Pac-Man game, and style transfer on Google image search results. These case studies show that Mallard is capable of supporting a diverse range of hobbyist-level ML prototyping projects.
