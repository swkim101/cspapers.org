Inspired by Simon Firthâ€™s discussions about meaningful productions and the consequent value of popular culture and using certain assumptions of the social-semiotics, this article proposes the observation of the features of a television program that regard the strategies of the formation of a particular communicative context that dialogues with ethical and aesthetical references of popular music. In a wider sense, this study explores the context as one of the operators of investigation to identify ways of addressing television programs.
