Considering a selection of digital images, this paper discusses the relation between the production of photographs for the scientific publicity of the text which organizes and institutionalizes the Kyoto Protocol, understood as the paramount discursive form of the contemporary ecological discourse. The approach addresses the differences between discursive processes driven eminently by writing (in Derrida's meaning), and the photographic process, highlighted as gesture with the potential to generate sensation-images.
