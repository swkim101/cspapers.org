Data workers are non-professional data scientists who engage in data analysis activities as part of their daily work. In this position paper, we share past and on-going work to understand data workersâ€™ sense-making practices. We use multidisciplinary approaches to explore their human-tool partnerships. We introduce our current research on the role of alternatives in data analysis activities. Finally, we conclude with open questions and research directions.
