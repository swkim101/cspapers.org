Learning from demonstration is a powerful tool for teaching manipulation actions to a robot. It is, however, an unsolved problem how to consider knowledge about the world and action-induced reactions such as forces imposed onto the gripper or measured liquid levels during pouring without explicit and case dependent programming. In this paper, we present a novel approach to include such knowledge directly in form of measured features. To this end, we use action demonstrations together with external features to learn a motion encoded by a dynamic system in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) representation. Accordingly, during action imitation, the system is able to couple the geometric trajectory of the motion to measured features in the scene. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with a broad range of external features in real-world robot experiments including a drinking, a handover and a pouring task.
