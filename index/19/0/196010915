We propose to develop a methodology articulating contemporary cultural studies with the principles of stylistic analyses, as developed by David Bordwell, aiming at identifying the elements of the identity of the Chilean man as putted on screen in documentary Nostalgia de la Luz (Chile, France, Germany, 2010) by Patricio Guzman. Based on three analytical operators; 1) performance of the actors; 2)Sceneries and 3) framing , we will try to identify the links that can be established between the Chilean man on the screen and the studies about the Latin-American identity undertaken by authors such as Jesus Martin-Barbero and Nestor Garcia Canclini. Following that path, we will strive to promote a production-culture dialogue avoiding to consider the products of the media as mere examples a theory given beforehand.
