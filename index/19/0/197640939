Providing explanations in a recommender system is getting more and more attention in both industry and research communities. Most existing explainable recommender models regard user preferences as invariant to generate static explanations. However, in real scenarios, a user’s preference is always dynamic, and she may be interested in different product features at different states. The mismatching between the explanation and user preference may degrade costumers’ satisfaction, confidence and trust for the recommender system. 
With the desire to fill up this gap, in this paper, we build a novel Dynamic Explainable Recommender (called DER) for more accurate user modeling and explanations. In specific, we design a time-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) to model user dynamic preferences, and profile an item by its review information based on sentence-level convolutional neural network (CNN). By attentively learning the important review information according to the user current state, we are not only able to improve the recommendation performance, but also can provide explanations tailored for the users’ current preferences. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our model for improving recommendation performance. And to evaluate the explainability of our model, we first present examples to provide intuitive analysis on the highlighted review information, and then crowd-sourcing based evaluations are conducted to quantitatively verify our model’s superiority.
