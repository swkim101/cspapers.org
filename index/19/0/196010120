Contemporary Western society tends towards inducing us to observe attentive vigilance over our own bodies, encouraging the adoption of rigorous physical conditioning practices, the incorporation of proper diets and habits, along with the submission to constant medical monitoring in order to instill the self management of health. Diagnosis technologies are fulcral to these complex negotiations, since they provide objective images that help legitimating and specifying disease concepts accordingly to the unyielding dogma of visual objectivity in Western sciences and culture, as well as to the logic of risk and the imperative of prevention. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the extent to which biomedical representations of the body affects the constitution of contemporary identities. In particular, it focuses on the profound cultural impact brought up by the shift on how formerly considered ordinary behaviors were pronounced pathological conditions since the association between neuroimaging and neurobiology in the 1980's.
