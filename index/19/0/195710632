In the wind farms, fans are widely distribution with large amount and they are away from the monitoring center, working environment is poor. In order to ensure the safe and stable operation of the wind farms, the wind power operation requirements need to be satisfied, own better function performance and stability of remote monitoring system to improve the management efficiency. In view of this, the power group increasing highly requirements on wind farm group management,but at present, the single SCADA system which the fan manufacturers offered has failed to meet the requirements. On the basis, this article designs the wind farm supervisory information system (SIS), and realizes wind farm cluster control, data analysis, performance optimization and fault warning.
