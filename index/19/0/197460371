We define several new complexity classes of search problems, "between" the classes FP and FNP. These classes are contained (along with factoring, and (JPY)'s class PLS) in the class TFNP of search problems that always have a solu- tion. A problem in each of these new classes is de- fined in terms of an implicitly given, exponentially large graph, very much like PLS. The existence of the solution sought is established via a simple graph- theoretic lemma with an inefficiently constructive proof; for example, PLS can be thought of as cor- responding to the lemma "every dag has a sink." The new classes are based on lemmata such as "ev- ery graph has an even number of odd-degree nodes." We show several class containments and collapses, resulting in the two new classes PDLF C PLF; the relation of either class to PLS is open. PLF contains several important problems for which no polynom'al time algorithm is presently known, including the lin- ear complementarity problem for P-matrices, finding a mixed equilibrium in a non-zero sum game, find- ing a second Hamilton circuit in a Hamiltonian cubic graph, finding a second Hamiltonian decomposition in a quartic graph, and the computational versions of Sperner's Lemma and Brouwer's Fixpoint Theo- rem. In fact, the latter two problems are shown to be PDLF-complete.
