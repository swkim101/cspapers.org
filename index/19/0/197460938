Sipser [Sip861 was the first to suggest the use of highly expanding bipartite multigraphs (called here dispersers) to drastically reduce the error of probabilistic algorithms at the cost of few additional random bits. The first explicit constructions of such graphs appeared in [Sze,AKS87]. We use and generalize these constructions to obtain: 0 The error probability of any RP (BPP) algorithm can be made exponentially small at the cost of only a constant factor increase in the number of random bits. 0 Simulations of RP (BPP) algorithms with some weak bit fixing sources.
