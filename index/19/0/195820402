For a finite collection of graphs ℱ, the ℱ-TM-Deletion problem has as input an n-vertex graph G and an integer k and asks whether there exists a set S ⊆ V(G) with |S| ≤ k such that G \ S does not contain any of the graphs in ℱ as a topological minor. We prove that for every such ℱ, ℱ -TM-Deletion is fixed parameter tractable on planar graphs. Our algorithm runs in a 2𝒪(k2) ⋅ n2 time, or, alternatively, in 2𝒪(k) ⋅ n4 time. Our techniques can easily be extended to graphs that are embeddable on any fixed surface.
