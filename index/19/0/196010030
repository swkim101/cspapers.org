The text has in its core the practical question of how to provide, according to the current reality of the Graduate Studies in Communication, student support for the referral of appropriate methodological theses and dissertations. It assumes that empirical research is a formative process, which is essential for master’s and doctoral students. Considering the ineffectiveness of the adoption of strict and a priori methodological rules and also the variety of theoretical angles and object types in Communication Studies, it proposes perspectives for basic and cross-methodological care, appropriate to the diversity of qualitative research. The absence of a priori rules makes the reflexive decision-making a central element of methodology. The article offers propositions on three elements of the research: research problems, theoretical foundations and empirical observation. It deals, finally, with the objections as a central process to the advancement of knowledge.
