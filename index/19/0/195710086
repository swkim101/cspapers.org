The Computer and Information Science (CIS) Department at Brooklyn College is unable to use full-time CIS faculty for most sections of the introductory programming course. Instead of using adjuncts, the administration of the College would like to use full-time faculty from overstaffed departments to teach these courses. In an attempt to certify these people, the CIS Department launched a two part Faculty Development Program in the Summer of 1981. Program I was an intensive introduction to computing for those with no previous experience. Program II was designed to enable those with some previous computing experience to teach computer programming. Both programs were successful. The participants in Program I gained quite a bit of programming experience. Almost half of those in Program II have taught in the CIS Department in the Fall of 1981, with others planning to do so next year. Based in part on the information gathered from this model, the entire City University is offering a Faculty Development Program in computer science as well.
