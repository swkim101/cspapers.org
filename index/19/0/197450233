Massive amounts of data in social networks have made researchers look for ways to display a summary of the information provided and extract knowledge from them. Basic methods in the field used the criteria coming from graph theory, but new approaches are trying to take advantage of the realm of traditional data exploration and linked data. One of these new approaches is the approach called conceptual link approach, which was introduced to describe the social networks. In this approach, using the concept of contextual links, knowledge of the social network through a conceptual view of the dramatic structure is summarized as means of social networking. Conceptual perspective provides a summary of existing knowledge on a social network. In order to build this display, it is first needed to extract conceptual links from the intended network. However, extracting these links for networks with larger scale is very time consuming. In this paper, a new method for extracting frequent conceptual link from social networking is provided where by using the concept of dependency, it is tried to accelerate the process of extracting conceptual links. The proposed method will be able to accelerate this process if there are dependencies between data
