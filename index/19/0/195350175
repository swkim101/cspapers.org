A user with a standing need for updates on current events uses a structured exploration process for finding and reviewing new documents, with the user comparing document information to her mental model. To avoid missing key changes on the topic, the user should see some documents on each of the subtopics available that day. This research includes a system and evaluation approach for this standing need use case.
