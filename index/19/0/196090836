I am pleased to welcome you to the seventh ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society -- WPES 2008. The need to consider privacy has been widely recognized in society at large, with resulting impact on government, commerce, education, health care, entertainment, and other sectors. The mission of WPES is to highlight privacy issues that arise in a global interconnected society, and to outline novel solutions to these problems. WPES 2008 continues our tradition of being held in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference, giving CCS attendees a unique opportunity to learn about privacy issues and potential solutions. 
 
The WPES 2008 call for papers attracted 42 paper submissions from Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, and the United States. The program committee accepted 9 full papers and 6 short papers on privacy-related issues in social networking, genomics, location-based services, privacy policies and metrics, authentication, publish-subscribe systems, data outsourcing, and private computing. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for all computer science researchers interested in the impact of the electronic age on privacy.
