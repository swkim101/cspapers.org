VLSI system performance increased by five orders of magnitude in the last three decades, made possible by continued technology scaling, improving transistor performance to increase frequency, increasing integration capacity to realize complex architectures, and reducing energy consumed per logic operation to keep power dissipation within limit. The technology treadmill will continue, providing integration capacity of billions of transistors, enabling unprecedented teraops levels of performance; however, with some adverse effects posing barrier.
