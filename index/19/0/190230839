We present a portable and highly-scalable framework that targets problems in the astrophysics and numerical relativity communities. This framework combines together the parallel Dendro octree with wavelet adaptive multiresolution and an automatic code-generation physics module to solve the Einstein equations of general relativity in the BSSNOK formulation. The goal of this work is to perform advanced, massively parallel numerical simulations of binary black hole and neutron star mergers, including Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios on the order of 100:1. These studies will be used to study waveforms for use in LIGO data analysis and to calibrate approximate methods for generating gravitational waveforms. The key contribution of this work is the development of automatic code generators for computational relativity supporting SIMD vectorization, OpenMP, and CUDA combined with efficient distributed memory adaptive data-structures. These have enabled the development of efficient codes that demonstrate excellent weak scalability up to 131K cores on ORNL's Titan for binary mergers for mass ratios up to 100.
