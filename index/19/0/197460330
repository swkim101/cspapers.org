Dataflow networks are a paradigm for concurrent computation in which a collection of concurrently and asynchronously ezecuting processes communicate by sending data values over FIFO communication channels. In this paper, we define a CCS-style calculus of dataflow networks with a standard structural operational semantics. A version of weak bisimulation equivalence, called “buffer bisimilarity, ” is defined for this calculus, and its equational theory is investigated. The main result is a completeness theorem for proving equations valid under buffer bisimilarity. The azioms have a familiar, category-theoretic flavor, in which a dataflow process with m input ports and n output ports is represented by an arrow from m to n in a category whose objects are the finite ordinals.
