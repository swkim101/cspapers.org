In this position paper, we present two different approaches to help social acceptance of head-mounted display in social and shared spaces: (1) discreet interactions and (2) a public spectator view. On a daily basis we evolve in shared and social spaces which may have different levels of acceptance for the use of head-mounted display (HMD), either from the users or the surroundings people. In contexts where the HMD is usually accepted by the non-HMD users (e.g. public transport) but still struggle to be adopted, we will approach the potential benefits of discreet interactions. Finally, we suggest and raise questions about the public spectator view approach to address contexts where the use of HMD is perceived by the surroundings as inappropriate.
