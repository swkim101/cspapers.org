This article aims to analyze aspects and features of the experimental production of composers and bands of Brazilian popular music in the 70’s, a period marked by the military dictatorship and the expansion of media industries linked to the popular song’s field (record companies and TV stations). It starts with the theoretical discussion about experimentalism led by Umberto Eco and from the concept of “critical song”, by Santuza C. Naves, in order to think of the “experimental song”. Three broad lines of the experimentation practiced by these creators will be pointed out: 1) relations between tradition and modernity, as a tropicalista heritage, but held on another level; 2) experimentalism like aesthetic exercise specifically performed within the materiality of the poetic and musical code of the song leading to specific meanings; 3) the creative use of the body and the performance, as elements which produce meanings, being in line with the national understanding of counterculture.
