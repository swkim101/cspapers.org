This paper addresses musical scenes as sonic territories, where musical genres are materialized, taking as a case study the configuration of heavy metal in its generic traits and how these marks are worked in “Territory”, a particular song from the brazilian metal group Sepultura. This analytical exercise allows us to observe the extent to which sound acts as a starting point to articulate aesthetic experiences that permeate local and global aspects of the musical scenes.
