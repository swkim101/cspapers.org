Needle insertion procedures can greatly benefit from robotic systems to improve their accuracy and success rate. However, a fully automated system is usually not desirable and the clinicians need to be included in the control loop. In this paper we present a teleoperation framework for beveledtip flexible needle steering that enables the user to directly and intuitively control the trajectory of the needle tip via a haptic interface. The 6 degrees of freedom of the needle base are used to perform several automatic safety and targeting tasks in addition to the one controlled by the user. Real-time visual feedback is provided by a 3D ultrasound probe and used to track the 3D location of the needle and of a spherical target. Several haptic force feedback are compared as well as two different levels of mix between automated and user-controlled tasks. A validation of the framework is conducted in gelatin phantom and a mean targeting accuracy of 2.5 mm is achieved. The results show that providing an adequate haptic guidance to the user can reduce the risks of damage to the tissues while still letting the surgeon in control of the tip trajectory.
