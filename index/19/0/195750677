Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based automatic colorization, they are still limited when it comes to few-shot learning. Existing models require a significant amount of training data. To tackle this issue, we present a novel memory-augmented colorization model MemoPainter that can produce high-quality colorization with limited data. In particular, our model is able to capture rare instances and successfully colorize them. Also, we propose a novel threshold triplet loss that enables unsupervised training of memory networks without the need for class labels. Experiments show that our model has superior quality in both few-shot and one-shot colorization tasks.
