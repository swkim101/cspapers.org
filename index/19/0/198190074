Triplets extraction is an essential and pivotal step in automatic knowledge base construction, which captures structural information from unstructured text corpus. Conventional extraction models use a pipeline of named entity recognition and relation classification to extract entities and relations, respectively, which ignore the connection between the two tasks. Recently, several neural network-based models were proposed to tackle the problem, and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them are unable to extract multiple triplets from a single sentence, which are yet commonly seen in real-life scenarios. To close the gap, we propose in this paper a joint neural extraction model for multitriplets, namely, TME, which is capable of adaptively discovering multiple triplets simultaneously in a sentence via ranking with translation mechanism. In experiment, TME exhibits superior performance and achieves an improvement of 37.6% on F1 score over state-of-the-art competitors.
