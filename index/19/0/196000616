Internet of Things (IoT) devices are slowly populating our homes. In th is age of shar ing econom y and increased mobility, however, the home environment is no longer a fixed location always shared by the same people . To better understand the issues and challenges around agency and IoT use in the home , we take a p ragmatic and situated approach . In this paper, we draw on our own experience s as users and identify the tensions between ownership and usage , and the economic implications there might be when sharing IoT system s with trusted people vs. strangers . We suggest the distinction between owners and users should be more carefully considered in the design and research of future device.
