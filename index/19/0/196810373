Consumer-grade solid-state drives (SSDs) guarantee very few things upon a crash. Lacking a strong disk-level crash guarantee forces programmers to equip applications and lesystems with safety nets using redundant writes and ushes, which in turn degrade the overall system performance. Although some prior works propose transactional SSDs with revolutionized disk interfaces to o er strong crash guarantees, adopting transactional SSDs inevitably incurs dramatic software stack changes. Therefore, most consumer-grade SSDs still keep using the standard block device interface. This paper addresses the above issues by breaking the impression that increasing SSDs’ crash guarantees are typically available at the cost of altering the standard block device interface. We propose Order-Preserving Translation and Recovery (OPTR), a collection of novel ash translation layer (FTL) and crash recovery techniques that are realized internal to block-interface SSDs to endow the SSDs with strong request-level crash guarantees de ned as follows: 1) A write request is not made durable unless all its prior write requests are durable. 2) Each write request is atomic. 3) All write requests prior to a ush are guaranteed durable. We have realized OPTR in real SSD hardware and optimized applications and lesystems (SQLite and Ext4) to demonstrate OPTR’s bene ts. Experimental results show 1.27× (only Ext4 is optimized), 2.85× (both Ext4 and SQLite are optimized), and 6.03× (an OPTR-enabled no-barrier mode) performance improvement.
