The potential is enormous for wall-climbing robots which can work in extremely hazardous environments, however, with the limits of many factors, the application is rather limited. Our work is to broaden the practical application by making specialized robots. In this paper, we introduce wall-climbing robots of two different absorption schemes we exploited: one with single suction cup and the other with permanent magnetic crawlers. The former adopts an omnidirectional vehicle and can perform remote-control inspection of nuclear storage tanks, moreover, it is further developed for cleaning of high-rise buildings of both ceramic tile and glass surfaces. The latter consists of two types of robot, one is for maintenance automation of storage tanks in petrochemical enterprises which can do operations of sand-blasting, spray-painting and inspection; and the other is expected for monitoring boiler water wall tubing.
