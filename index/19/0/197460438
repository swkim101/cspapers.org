We give a simple account of the connection between lambda teams and natural deduction proofs, showing how the terms can be rearranged into a form close to conventional proofs, and also to less conventional "top down" proofs. Creating proofs interactively by refinement can be seen as just keying in a lambda expression one symbol at a time in response to prompts from the machine. The aim is to convey some basic ideas to the uninitiated without technical or pragmatic detail. can get another way of writing proofs which mirrors the top down (subgoaling) style adopted by many interactive theorem provers. The trick is to write the lambda terms in reverse Polish notation and then adopt the Japanese (and Chinese) habit of writing down the page. To get the top down presentation we use forward Polish instead of reverse Polish. We see also that the process of interactively deriving a proof can be seen as starting with a desired type and then keying in a lambda term one symbol at a time in response to prompts from the machine proof assistant.
