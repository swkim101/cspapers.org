Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems aim to assist clinicians in their daily decision-making related to diagnosis, tests, and treatments of patients by providing relevant evidence from the scientific literature. This promise however is yet to be fulfilled, with search for relevant literature for a given patient condition still being an active research topic. The TREC CDS track was designed to address this research gap. We developed a platform to facilitate experimentation and hypothesis testing for information retrieval researchers working on this topic. It provides a large range of query and document processing techniques that are explored in the biomedical search domain.
