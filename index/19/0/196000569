It investigates the meanings of eating and cooking constructed by four Brazilian weekly magazines: Veja, IstoE, Epoca and Carta Capital. We consider journalism as a norma-tive discourse of social practices and we analyze texts of 96 magazines issues, trying to comprehend the patterns used by journalism in order to construct the meanings of being contemporary.
