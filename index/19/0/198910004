The application of robots in inspection tasks has been growing quickly thanks to the advancements in autonomous navigation technology, especially the robot localization techniques in GPS-denied environments. Although many methods have been proposed to localize a robot using onboard sensors such as cameras and LiDARs, achieving robust localization in geometrically degenerated environments, e.g. tunnels, remains a challenging problem. In this work, we focus on the robust localization problem in such situations. A novel degeneration characterization model is presented to estimate the localizability at a given location in the prior map. And the localizability of a LiDAR and an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging radio is analyzed. Additionally, a probabilistic sensor fusion method is developed to combine IMU, LiDAR and the UWB. Experiment results show that this method allows for robust localization inside a long straight tunnel.
