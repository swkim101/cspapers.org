This paper presents the results of an experiment to study the performance of four SIMD machines. The objectives of this study are to analyze the cost of regular communication on several SIMD machines and study its impact on the performance of two kernels. The machines are: a 32k processor CM2, a 16k processor MPP, a 16k processor MasPar MP-1, and a 4k processor DAP 610C. Regular communication is exemplified, in this study, by the shift operation where all elements of an array are shifted some number of positions along an array dimension. The cost of shift operations on the four machines is measured and analyzed for several two-dimensional arrays. The study shows that shift cost varies significantly from one machine to another, and depends on several factors including network topology, communication bandwidth, and the compilation partitioning scheme. Results also show that the communication overhead is quite significant on some of these machines even for nearest neighbor communication. Finally, results from this study are useful for obtaining a rough estimate of the communication overhead for many algorithms on these machines.
