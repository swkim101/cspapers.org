The way the retina processes and format visual information contributes, to a large extent, to the efficiency, compaction and reliability of the human visual system, which is of strong interest to artificial vision systems. Based on the transfer function of retinal neurons and their synaptic interaction, our application software computes, in real time, the different outputs of the human retina, from photoreceptors to Magno and Parvo ganglion cells. It is modular and fully configurable so that it can be used in a wide field of applications. A video camera is available to experiment, in live, how the different outputs of the retina reacts to various visual stimulations, and a user interface gives the oportunity to test the effects of retina space and time parameters as well as intensity and contrast local adaptation gain control. Attendees can also bring their own video data to be processed.
