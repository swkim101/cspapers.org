In this article, we propose that crime news constitute today a key element in shaping the experience of the city and of otherness. We argue that the media deploys the logics of fear and of compassion as means of fostering the audience’s identification with the suffering of strangers. We then analyze how descriptions of the city voiced by young members of Rio de Janeiro’s elite articulate insecurity, poverty and justice, thus generally restating the possibilities of identity building offered by crime news.
