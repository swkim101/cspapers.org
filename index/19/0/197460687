Higher-order unification is equational unification for pq-conversion. But it is not first-order equational unification, as substitution has to avoid capture. In this paper higher-order unification is reduced to first- order equational unification in a suitable theory: the Aa-calculus of explicit substitutions. Introduction Unification is the kernel of deduction processes used in theorem provers and programming languages. Syn- tactic unification initiated by Herbrand and developed by Robinson has been extended in two ways: equa- tional unification and higher-order unification. The same idea is at the root of both extensions. It consists in incorporating in the unification process some knowl- edge about the underlying theory, in the higher-order case, ,&-conversion (2) and in the case of a first-order theory, some equational axioms, such as associativ- ity 1121. Nevertheless although the goal is the same, the unification processes designed so far are fairly dif- ferent. In this paper, we show that higher-order uni- fication can be reduced to first-order equational unifi- cation in a suitable theory. Higher-order unification is equational unification for pq-conversion. But it is not first-order equational unification. This is due to some particularities of the substitution in A-calculus. Let us first develop this point, in order to present the framework of the paper. The well-known A-calculus is defined as follows. Let V be a set of variables, written x, y, etc. The terms of A(V), the A-calculus with names, are inductively defined by: a ::= z I (a a) I Az.a
