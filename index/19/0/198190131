We investigate the task of distantly supervised joint entity relation extraction. Itâ€™s known that training with distant supervision will suffer from noisy samples. To tackle the problem, we propose to adapt a small manually labelled dataset to the large automatically generated dataset. By developing a novel adaptation algorithm, we are able to transfer the high quality but heterogeneous entity relation annotations in a robust and consistent way. Experiments on the benchmark NYT dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms state-ofthe-art methods.
