This paper presents an analysis of the materialities of the thrash metal band Antcorpus. Vectorized by techno-interactions, we note that in such materialities there is the emergency of aesthetic epiphanies of Amazon borderer areas. These aesthetic epiphanies, on the other hand, shape a poetic of the dissent, in which are stated cultural and identity differences that contest an imagined Amazon, since the colonial period, such as “El Dorado” or “the green paradise”. We conclude that, besides the evidence of cosmopolitism, the sonority of the heavy metal is linked to an aesthetic regime of identifications that offers possibilities of visuality to those on the frontier, in the margins, and that, because of this, they are made invisible in hegemonic and traditional modes of representation.
