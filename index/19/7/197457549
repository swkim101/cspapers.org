Furthermore, we show that our proof technique is We investigate the use of unique fixpoint induction as applicable to the weak equivalence of observational cona proof method for value-passing process languages with gruence in both its late and early guises. Therefore the recursion. An intuitive generalisation of unique fixpoint current work strengthens previous results in two ways: induction based on loop invariants for symbolic graphs by allowing a wider class of process, the fully parameyields strong completeness results; we give an axiomatic terised process, and by a weakening of the equivalence characterisation of both late and early observational con- relation considered. We now address the issue of why we gruence for a class of fully parameterised processes. should be interested in fully parameterised processes. This new, generalised, rule is shown to be derivable Apart from the obvious issue of expressiveness we from existing formulations of unique fixpoint induction consider the expansion of parallel processes. It is comfor value-passing calculi, thereby providing original com- mon practice to simply treat the parallel composition pIq pleteness results. An example of the use of this new rule of regular processes using some form of expansion into is presented in detail. non-determinism. Regular processes in pure CCS are modelled using finite labelled transition systems. The
