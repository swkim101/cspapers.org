This study seeks to determine whether, and how conversation takes place in the communicative context of television journalism, based on an analysis of the programs: “Bom Dia Brasil” (Globo), “Programa do Jo” (Globo) and “Saia Justa” (GNT). The concept of conversation adopted is that of ethnomethodology, which postulates that conversation consists of any socially-governed verbal exchange, which varies according to the situation in which it takes place (Wolf, 1994). We believe that television journalism is constructed as a discourse situation, which creates a specific environment in which the conversation among the participants of the studio takes place. This environment is characterized by both media constraints (related to the duration of the programs, television language, market interests, etc.) and the premises of journalism (truth and relevance, news value, public interest, etc.).
