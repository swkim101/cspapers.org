ATOM (Analysis Tools with OM) is a single framework for building a wide range of customized program analysis tools. It provides the common infrastructure present in all code-instrumenting tools; this is the difficult and time-consuming part. The user simply defines the tool-specific details in instrumentation and analysis routines. Building a basic block counting tool like Pixie with ATOM requires only a page of code.
ATOM, using OM link-time technology, organizes the final executable such that the application program and user's analysis routines run in the same address space. Information is directly passed from the application program to the analysis routines through simple procedure calls instead of inter-process communication or files on disk. ATOM takes care that analysis routines do not interfere with the program's execution, and precise information about the program is presented to the analysis routines at all times. ATOM uses no simulation or interpretation.
ATOM has been implemented on the Alpha AXP under OSF/1. It is efficient and has been used to build a diverse set of tools for basic block counting, profiling, dynamic memory recording, instruction and data cache simulation, pipeline simulation, evaluating branch prediction, and instruction scheduling.
