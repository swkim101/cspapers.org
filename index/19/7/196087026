The emergence of the Internet as a global platform for computation and communication has sparked the development and deployment of many large-scale networked systems. Often, these systems involve multiple stakeholders with divergent or even competing interests. Unmitigated selfish behavior in these systems can lead to high inefficiency or even complete collapse. Research interest in the application of economic and game-theoretic principles to the design and analysis of networked systems has grown in recent years. 
 
The NetEcon Workshop promotes multi-disciplinary work and discussion about the role of incentives in communication and computation. It has evolved over the past five years, subsuming several other workshops that covered various aspects of strategic computation, including P2PEcon, Incentive-Based Computing (IBC), and Practive and theory of Incentives in Networked Systems (PINS). Information about NetEcon'06 and NetEcon'07, both of which were co-located with the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce (ACM EC), can be found at http://www.cs.duke.edu/nicl/netecon06/ and http://netecon-ibc.si.umich.edu/, respectively. 
 
This year, we are delighted to have NetEcon'08 co-located with the ACM SIGCOMM Conference. We received 33 submissions and accepted 18. The Program-Committee members and external reviewers did an excellent job, and we take this opportunity to thank them, the Sigcomm'08 organizers, and the NetEcon Steering Committee.
