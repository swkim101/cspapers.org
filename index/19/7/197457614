We give new upper bounds for the measure problem of Klee which significantly improve the previous bounds for dimensions greater than 2. We obtain an O(ndI2 log n, n) time-space upper bound to compute the measure of a set of n boxes in Euclidean d-space. The solution requires several new ideas including application of the inclusion/exclusion principle, the concept of trellises, streaming, and a partition of d-space.
