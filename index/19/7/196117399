While in English speaking countries the term “talk show” is used to designate programs, whether journalistic or not, which revolve around conversation between participants, in Brazil the expression “talk show” represents a cross between the genres journalism and entertainment. The objective of this article is to carry out a historical analysis of the genre talk show in Brazil, and to demonstrate analytically the elements that configure this type of program as a television genre, by means of observation of the Programa do Jo (Globo television network). The historical analysis seeks to demonstrate the development of this genre from interview programs and the socio-cultural factors of Brazilian society that enabled the boundary between information and entertainment to become blurred, to become what is commonly called infotainment today. The analysis of the program will take into consideration the concept of modes of address, thinking in terms of the tone and style of the program.
