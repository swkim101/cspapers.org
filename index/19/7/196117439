The aim of this research is to discuss the organization method and the digital files index done by the subject-narrator on the Web. Thus, it is established a delineation and discussion about the discourse introduced by the subject on the Internet, considering the production conditions of electronic discourse. Mobilizing the concepts about Internet and folksonomy, we intend to construct a dialogue with French Discourse Analysis to investigate the discursive functioning of tags, words used for indexing files on the Web in a rather free way. This way we can observe the way the tag “Brazil” has been used by subjects to nominate and index the files on Flickr website. For this purpose, we will analyze the linguistic marks left by the subjects on tags, those that make it say (and be silent about) certain words, investigating the way sayings are installed through the folksonomy process.
