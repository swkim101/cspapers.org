This essay arises from an insight: contemporary cinema is marked by a new transnational wave. A cinema intimately linked to a different look at the body. The body as reflection, as metaphor, as an experimental place for representation. Our hypothesis is that the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty provides us with valuable tools to broaden the debate on a cinema that explores a bodily relationship with the world. Our goal is to discuss these issues in brief analyzes of three contemporary filmmakers: Tsai Ming-Liang, A. Weerasethakul and Karim Ainouz.
