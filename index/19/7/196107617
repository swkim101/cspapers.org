A target location is represented by compressing a 360' image from a spherical mirror into a circular waveform. Navigation tasks are specified as a sequence of homing tasks on target locations. This is accomplished by matching landmarks from the current view with the next target view. This paper provides a new method for matching using qualitative geometric features of each of the waveforms. In addition, a geometric analysis allows us to do 3D reasoning about the environment, which is sufficient for computing the rotation and translation between the current location and the target location. It eventually may allow acquisition of a 3D model of the environment. Details of this work are presented in [3].
