In this paper, an overview of an approach for cross-language image indexing and multilingual terminology alignment is presented. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is proposed as a means to find similar images in target language documents in the web and natural language processing is used to reduce the search space and find the image index. As the experiments are carried out in specialized domains, a systematic and recursive use of the approach is used to align multilingual terminology by creating repositories of images with their respective cross-language indices.
