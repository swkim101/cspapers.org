Hydraulic confined piston engine (HCPE) is a new type of power system to transform the thermal energy from fuel combustion in cylinder into hydraulic energy directly. It s running stability is an important basis of design analysis and performance evaluation. Research achievement on running stability of engine was got by a hypothesis that the angle-velocity of the crankshaft is a constant before. And, of course, this method was not based on actual conditions. In this paper, the simulation model of HCPE is built in software CAD/CAE, and supposes the instantaneous angle-velocity is variable. The angle-velocity of the crankshaft can be converged to a working speed by a new way, controlling the rotated speed by fixed point iteration method. The running stability can reaches 4.75% by this way, and satisfied the using requirements
