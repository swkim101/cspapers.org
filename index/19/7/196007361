The main objective of this article is to understand how young people from Candelaria, a sub-locality in favela Mangueira, in Rio de Janeiro, appropriate communication technologies to carry out expressions of a specific kind of citizenship: the cultural one. These young people articulate digital elements that are normally associated to a rationality that is characterized by the modern velocity of the objective productivity, but they also make a different use in those relations of quotidian and banal sociability in their community. In the contemporary fast-changing cities, digital culture can be a support to affirm a new citizenship that is elaborated inside communitarian culture. Communitarian culture, with its popular sociability, considers several sources of information to create and mobilize knowledge about the city. From this popular and creative sociability, we have access to a universe of information in accelerated flows. The new powering articulations ‘unlocate’ the learning that used to legitimize the knowledge on the formation of the popular communitarian sociability.
