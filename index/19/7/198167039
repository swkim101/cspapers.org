Blind image deblurring aims to recover sharp image from a blurred one while the blur kernel is unknown. To solve this ill-posed problem, a great amount of image priors have been explored and employed in this area. In this paper, we present a blind deblurring method based on Local Maximum Gradient (LMG) prior. Our work is inspired by the simple and intuitive observation that the maximum value of a local patch gradient will diminish after the blur process, which is proved to be true both mathematically and empirically. This inherent property of blur process helps us to establish a new energy function. By introducing an liner operator to compute the Local Maximum Gradient, together with an effective optimization scheme, our method can handle various specific scenarios. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our method is able to achieve favorable performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world images.
