The paper aims to discuss the role of musical recommendation systems in digital culture, considering them as a class of mediators to re-monetize the musical experience. Regarding Pierre Bourdieu’s Sociology of Taste (1989;2007) and his discussion on distinction and symbolic capital; and Bruno Latour’s (1992) discussion on delegation and distributed activities, a set of implicated issues considering recommendation system’s classification logics will be considered. So, our main purposes are: a)Discuss the different methodologies employed by recommendation systems to filter data, classify information and to establish patterns to recommend. How do they recommend, what is the best methodology? Which are the criteria and how much does the notion of musical genre affect the filtering organization? b) Discuss the social network and, more specifically, the role of the tags –the labels the users can employ to classify content, aggregating subjective value, taking Last.fm social platform as an example. The premise is that far from a process devoid of ambiguities, tagging supposes a symbolical battlefield demarcated by the actors who fight for authority. And this social practices are crucial to legitimize the system as a whole.
