The aim of this paper is to present reflections on the reception of telenovela, discussing gender issues. To illustrate the theoretical approaches we used data from a critical ethnography of reception held with six women working class, three mothers and their daughters, living in Santa Maria/RS. The results show that despite the telenovelas present several possibilities for feminine, domestic space is still portrayed as essentially linked to women. This discourse is fully assimilated by those mothers and partly by their daughters who not so easily accept the separation between the public sphere for men and women to the private sphere, seeking to reconcile motherhood with professional activity, as financial autonomy is an ideal for them. These findings probably are due to their higher level of education when compared with educational level of the mothers.
