In robotic manipulation, finding a feasible motion plan doesnâ€™t guarantee a successful execution. The real world could bring all kinds of unexpected changes to the planned motion, the most deadly ones are usually marked by or caused by unexpected changes of contacts (object slipping away between fingers; getting stuck somewhere, etc). We notice that some actions are more likely to maintain desired contacts than others. To help finding these actions, in this work we propose a set of criteria to quantify the robustness of contacts against modeling uncertainties and disturbance forces. Under the quasi-static assumption, we analyze the causes of contact mode (sticking, sliding, disengaged) transitions and discuss how to endure larger uncertainties and disturbances. We summarize our results into several physically meaningful and easy-to-compute scores, which can be used to evaluate the quality of each individual contacts in a manipulation system. We illustrate the meaning of the scores with a simple example.
