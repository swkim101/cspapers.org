This work presents a new experimental set-up constructed to analyze ventilation networks from a control point of view. The dynamic system is built with low-cost material and it is designed to reproduce, at a small scale, similar conditions of existing underground mines. Different types of sensors are tested and compared to measure the airflow in the branches of the flow network. The transfer function representation of a constructed ventilation system is computed based on experimental data. The benchmark is devoted to the study of air distribution networks in mines, but the analysis can be extended to different fluid networks.
