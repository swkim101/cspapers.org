The second research colloquium organized for the informal presentation of research ideas in Information Retrieval was held at the University of Aston, Birmingham on 2-3 April 1979. Many of the talks were on aspects of bibliographic information retrieval systems but a large proportion were about data base management systems. Considering that the last colloquium contained virtually no mention of this topic, it was not surprising that this provoked quite a lively discussion about the relationship between the two types of systems. The main conclusions of this discussion were thata) A data base management system (DBMS) was a convenient tool with which a bibliographic information retrieval system could be implemented, butb) By considering the problems inherent with bibliographic data (large term vocabulary, non-exact matching), facilities may be provided on a DBMS to make this implementation more efficient.
