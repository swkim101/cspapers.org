The present article investigates the roles of the subject in relation to social networks media content by means of a study of Tweetdeck exchanges among Twitter users. It proposes that the individual is a media disseminator, as the dynamics of referential exchanges on the web are interpreted from his/her own point of view. Userâ€™s affinities that shape his/her profile and interactions provide him/her with an identity and, at the same time, are relevant content for contacts he/she establishes within groups of interest. This research addresses concepts of culture, media and representation, and carries out a quantitative research about information absorption and processing habits on Tweetdeck. It concludes that there are three possible roles for the subject in relation to the media content: producer, disseminator and reader.
