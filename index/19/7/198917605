Multi-class segmentation has recently achieved significant performance in natural images and videos. This achievement is due primarily to the public availability of large multi-class datasets. However, there are certain domains, such as biomedical images, where obtaining sufficient multi-class annotations is a laborious and often impossible task and only single-class datasets are available. While existing segmentation research in such domains use private multi-class datasets or focus on single-class segmentations, we propose a unified highly efficient framework for robust simultaneous learning of multi-class segmentations by combining single-class datasets and utilizing a novel way of conditioning a convolutional network for the purpose of segmentation. We demonstrate various ways of incorporating the conditional information, perform an extensive evaluation, and show compelling multi-class segmentation performance on biomedical images, which outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions (up to 2.7%). Unlike current solutions, which are meticulously tailored for particular single-class datasets, we utilize datasets from a variety of sources. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our method also to natural images and evaluate it on the Cityscapes dataset. We further discuss other possible applications of our proposed framework.
