Robot teleoperation is widely used for several hazardous applications. To increase teleoperator capabilities shared-control methods can be employed. In this paper, we present a passive task-prioritized shared-control method for remote telemanipulation of redundant robots. The proposed method fuses the task-prioritized control architecture with haptic guidance techniques to realize a shared-control framework for teleoperation systems. To preserve the semi-autonomous telerobotic system safety, passivity is analyzed and an energy-tanks passivity-based controller is developed. The proposed theoretical results are validated through experiments involving a real haptic device and a simulated slave robot.
