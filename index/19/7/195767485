We present new results on approximate colourings of graphs and, more generally, approximate H-colourings and promise constraint satisfaction problems. 
First, we show NP-hardness of colouring $k$-colourable graphs with $\binom{k}{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}-1$ colours for every $k\geq 4$. This improves the result of Bulin, Krokhin, and Oprsal [STOC'19], who gave NP-hardness of colouring $k$-colourable graphs with $2k-1$ colours for $k\geq 3$, and the result of Huang [APPROX-RANDOM'13], who gave NP-hardness of colouring $k$-colourable graphs with $2^{k^{1/3}}$ colours for sufficiently large $k$. Thus, for $k\geq 4$, we improve from known linear/sub-exponential gaps to exponential gaps. 
Second, we show that the topology of the box complex of H alone determines whether H-colouring of G-colourable graphs is NP-hard for all (non-bipartite, H-colourable) G. This formalises the topological intuition behind the result of Krokhin and Oprsal [FOCS'19] that 3-colouring of G-colourable graphs is NP-hard for all (3-colourable, non-bipartite) G. We use this technique to establish NP-hardness of H-colouring of G-colourable graphs for H that include but go beyond $K_3$, including square-free graphs and circular cliques (leaving $K_4$ and larger cliques open). 
Underlying all of our proofs is a very general observation that adjoint functors give reductions between promise constraint satisfaction problems.
