Full-duplex (FD) wireless can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency but requires tremendous amount of self-interference (SI) cancellation. Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where reconfigurable RF filters are used to channelize the SI signal path. In [2], we designed and implemented an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We also presented an optimized canceller configuration scheme based on the derived canceller model, and extensively evaluated the performance of the FDE-based FD radios in a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed in different network settings.
