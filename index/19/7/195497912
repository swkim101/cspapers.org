To overcome the limitations of existing hyperspectral cameras on spatial/temporal resolution, fusing a low resolution hyperspectral image (HSI) with a high resolution RGB (or multispectral) image into a high resolution HSI has been prevalent. Previous methods for this fusion task usually employ hand-crafted priors to model the underlying structure of the latent high resolution HSI, and the effect of the camera spectral response (CSR) of the RGB camera on super-resolution accuracy has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we first present a simple and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based method for HSI super-resolution in an unsupervised way, without any prior training. Later, we append a CSR optimization layer onto the HSI super-resolution network, either to automatically select the best CSR in a given CSR dataset, or to design the optimal CSR under some physical restrictions. Experimental results show our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts, and the CSR optimization can further boost the accuracy of HSI super-resolution.
