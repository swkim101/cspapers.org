Mobile communication devices have strengthened an amount of social practices that are currently developing supported by the technological evolution. One of these practices, among us for centuries – the practice of playing games – embodies new horizons and meanings by its integration with such devices, transforming itself not only in the exogenous area – in the way we play, related to the structure of rules and media – but internally as well, in its own ludic structure, in its essence. The current paper aims to better understand the social strategies developed by these ludic activities – in the form of gameplay – helped by mobile communication devices, like cell phones, palms and etc. It also intends to comprehend how, nowadays, these activities interact with spaces necessarily composed by the urban and by the virtual – the hybrid spaces – which are amid our reality.
