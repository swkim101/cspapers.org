The current paper analyses the re-thinking of the discourse strategies of rock bands from Alto Jose do Pinho, a district in the outskirts of the Greater Recife, taking as a starting point the social representation of this musical movement made by the mass media. It focus on the interface between this sub-cultural production and the hegemonic industry by crystallizing not only the singularities of the groups therein based as well as the effort made by the bands whose aim has been to conquer visibility and socio-cultural insertion. In this sense, it enhances the distance between the punk rock produced there and the anti-normative matrix of the movement in order to establish a distinct communication with the institutional cultural market.
