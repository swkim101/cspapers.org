The practice of graphic communication during the XX century adopted a reductive avant-garde aesthetics (modernism) which privileged the repetition of its stylistic solutions, its economy of means and the simplicity of its geometric forms. But with the appearance of the personal graphic computer, in the 80s, anyone was able to emulate any modernist solution at will with no difficulty at all. Thus both young professional designers and visual communicators decided to develop a new aesthetic in their works, which resulted in the inclusion of graphic characteristics never seen before. This strategy seems to explain graphic post-modernity as being the resultant outcome of a play on both visual provocations and humorous contradictions, aimed at the exploitation of new possibilities of transgression of graphic conventions in such a way that could lead to new visual possibilities to graphic de-sign.
