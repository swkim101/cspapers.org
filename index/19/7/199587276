With the rapid development of mobile devices, global position system (GPS) and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social networks (LBSNs) have attracted millions of users to share rich information, such as experiences and tips. Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender system plays an important role in LBSNs since it can help users explore attractive locations as well as help social network service providers design location-aware advertisements for Point-of-Interest. In this paper, we present a brief survey over the task of Point-of-Interest recommendation in LBSNs and discuss some research directions for Point-of-Interest recommendation. We first describe the unique characteristics of Point-of-Interest recommendation, which distinguish Point-of-Interest recommendation approaches from traditional recommendation approaches. Then, according to what type of additional information are integrated with check-in data by POI recommendation algorithms, we classify POI recommendation algorithms into four categories: pure check-in data based POI recommendation approaches, geographical influence enhanced POI recommendation approaches, social influence enhanced POI recommendation approaches and temporal influence enhanced POI recommendation approaches. Finally, we discuss future research directions for Point-of-Interest recommendation.
