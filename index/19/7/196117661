This article addresses the reading of communication texts as a cognitive enhancement process. For this, it starts from an assumption of need for semiotic literacy in the relational and diagrammatic structures that the media languages have introduced in the culture. It thus proposes structural reading exercises with journalistic texts in their process of representation. With this, it intends to verify how events are brought about to signify, how they become texts and what instruments languages use in order to build arguments that can be read within the structuralism of their composition.
