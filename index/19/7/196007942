This paper discusses the complex relationships between the current digital culture and contemporary technoscientific thought, guided by Information Technologies (ITs) model. We describe how this kind of thought has been structured as an internalized modern self arises, with a view of the world as an intellectual construct. We use the universes and discourses about the digital and analog sounds as an example of the Faustian and Promethean ideals of technologies, concepts proposed by the sociologist Herminio Martins.
