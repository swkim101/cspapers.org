Some countries of Latin America are assuming a communication system divided into three parts, on the basis of state, private and public sector. The idea of a public communication system, other than the State, is extremely controversial in the current literature on communication policies. The proposal of this work is to analyze the case of Brazil, in which there are no specific rules for what it is mentioned in the Brazilian Constitution as a “principle of mutual complementarity among public, private and state systems”, relating it to the situation of other Latin countries. This paper takes into account recent technological and political changes and the brazilian recent debate on this topic. It is based on documentary and bibliographic research, taking into account the existing experiences, such as radios and televisions and other communication media such as telecentres and public channels TV and radio potentially available digital transmission.
