This paper intends to study the role of music in the configuration of contemporary femininities and, specifically, the age and generational cleavage informing this relationship. First, we will go through three paradigms which inform studies about music and society: structural resonance, interpellation and narrative identity. From this overview, we will relocate the discussion: people appropriate music in such ways that it becomes an enabling and action-oriented device (DeNora, 2000). Second, we will analyze the account of two women who are members of an Argentine fan club devoted to Ricardo Arjona, who has been a highly successful Guatemalan singer and songwriter for over a 
decade in Spanish-speaking record industry. Our conclusion is that music is an aesthetical resource for agency which enables to erode middle-aged womenâ€™s age and gender expectations.
