An f(d)-spanner of an unweighted n-vertex graph G = (V, E) is a subgraph H satisfying that dist H(u, v) is at most f (distG (u, v)) for every u, v ∈ V. A simple girth argument implies that any f(d)-spanner with O(n1+1/k) edges must satisfy that f(d)/d = Ω(⌈k/d⌉). A matching upper bound (even up to constants) for super-constant values of d is currently known only for d = Ω((log k)log k) as given by the well known (1 + ϵ, β) spanners of Elkin and Peleg, and its recent improvements by [Elkin-Neiman, SODA'17], and [Abboud-Bodwin-Pettie, SODA'18]. We present new spanner constructions that achieve a nearly optimal stretch of O(⌈k/d⌉) for any distance value d ∈ [1, k1−o(1)] and d ≥ k1+o(1). We also show more optimized spanner constructions with nearly linear number of edges. Specifically for every ϵ ∈ (0, 1), we show the construction of (3 + ϵ, β) spanners for β = Oϵ(klog(3+8/ϵ)) with Oϵ(n) edges. In addition, we consider the related graph concept of hopsets introduced by [Cohen, J. ACM '00]. Informally, an hopset H is a weighted edge set that, when added to the graph G, allows one to get a path from each node u to a node v with at most β hops (i.e., edges) and length at most α · distG(u, v). We present a new family of (α, β) hopsets with O(k · n1+1/k) edges and α · β = O(k). Turning to nearly linear-size hopsets, we show a construction of (3 + ϵ, β) hopset with Oϵ(n) edges and hop-bound of β = Oϵ((log n)log(3+9/ϵ)), improving upon the state-of-the-art hop-bound of β = O(log log n)log log n.
