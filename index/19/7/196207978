Word embeddings have been shown to contain gender bias that is inherited from their training corpora. However, existing work focuses on quantifying and mitigating such bias in English, and the analysis cannot be directly applied in language with grammatical gender, such as Spanish. In this paper, we propose new definitions of gender bias for languages with grammatical gender and apply bilingual word embeddings to analyze and mitigate the bias. Experimental results on crosslingual analogy test and Word Embedding Association Test show that the proposed methods can effectively mitigate the multifaceted gender bias.
