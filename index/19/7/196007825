This article brings up reflections and concepts that were created by researchers in Latin America in order to define Popular Communication (participatory and communitarian) and others denominations which were established between 1960 and 1980. We intend to contribute towards a better understanding of those concepts, taking in to account changes which took place in expressions like popular communication, popular newspaper, popular journalism and communitarian newspaper. We bring up to our days the discussion about those themes, adding up news concepts disseminated in our academic circles.
