Recent developments in conversational IR have raised questions about the nature of interactions which occur between the user and the system and the cognitive capabilities expected of such systems. In our research, we investigate the completeness of existing theoretical frameworks in explaining conversational search data propose modifications to such systems. The linear and transient nature of speech makes it cognitively challenging for the user to process a large amount of information. We propose a study to evaluate the users' preference of modalities when using conversational search systems. The study will help us to understand how results should be presented in a conversational search system. As we observe how users search using audio queries, interact with the intermediary, and process the results presented, we aim to develop an insight on how to present results more efficiently in a conversational search setting. We also plan on exploring the effectiveness and consistency of different media in a conversational search setting. Our observations will inform future designs and help to create a better understanding of such systems.
