We develop a method for collecting security logs of industrial control systems (ICS) as a preliminary study for ICS security log management and integrated monitoring systems. Although there is scope to collect security logs by using traditional IT technology, this is challenging for special ICS devices such as a programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are the major target of APT in ICS because physical damage can be caused by connecting directly with sensors or actuators. According to NIST SP 800-92 \citekent2006sp, that provides importance of log management in computer security, security logs generated from PLCs also need to be managed to enhance ICS security. Therefore, this study analyzes how to collect various information on PLCs. Additionally, we experimented with collecting system logs from a PLC that provides system information via a web interface, and the results are described.
