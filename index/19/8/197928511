A search trail is an interactive visualization of how a previous searcher approached a related task. Using search trails to assist users requires understanding aspects of the task, user, and trails. In this paper, we examine two questions. First, what are task characteristics that influence a user's ability to gain benefits from others' trails? Second, what is the impact of a "mismatch" between a current user's task and previous user's task which originated the trail? We report on a study that investigated the influence of two factors on participants' perceptions and behaviors while using search trails to complete tasks. Our first factor, task scope, focused on the scope of the task assigned to the participant (broad to narrow). Our manipulation of this factor involved varying the number of constraints associated with tasks. Our second factor, trail scope, focused on the scope of the task that originated the search trails given to participants. We investigated how task scope and trail scope affected participants' (RQ1) pre-task perceptions, (RQ2) post-task perceptions, and (RQ3) search behaviors. We discuss implications of our results for systems that use search trails to provide assistance.
