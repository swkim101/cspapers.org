This paper will discuss the role of virtual bands in pop music today in order to understand how a band that does not exist in the “real world” is part of the entertainment industry with the same legitimacy as bands with real members. To do this, this paper will analyze the Gorillaz’s live performances and some of its consolidation strategies. Gorillaz is one of the most striking of this kind in many decades. To have legitimacy and be able to fit in the music scene, these bands modify some essential elements of the musical experience, deconstructing part of their concepts.
