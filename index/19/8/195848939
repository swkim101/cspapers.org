As smart environments become more common, IoT applications can automate more complex and dynamic activities. Users can define their activities as abstract workflows and suitable devices will be selected dynamically to execute them based on user quality of experience (QoE) requirements. However, many of such applications violate the principle of least privilege in terms of the allowed interactions between the IoT devices. We propose an Application-Centric Access Control (ACAC) framework to enable least privilege network access control for dynamic workflows while considering users' QoE. ACAC enables automatic derivation of an access control policy for an IoT application and allow this to be adjusted dynamically as new devices come and go in order to maintain user QoE.
