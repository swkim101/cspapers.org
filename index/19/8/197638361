Deep Q-Network (DQN) is an algorithm that achieves human-level performance in complex domains like Atari games. One of the important elements of DQN is its use of a target network, which is necessary to stabilize learning. We argue that using a target network is incompatible with online reinforcement learning, and it is possible to achieve faster and more stable learning without a target network when we use Mellowmax, an alternative softmax operator. We derive novel properties of Mellowmax, and empirically show that the combination of DQN and Mellowmax, but without a target network, outperforms DQN with a target network.
