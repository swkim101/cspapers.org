The article aims to observe the paths of movement of some abject figures considered by the Brazilian cultural imaginary: Exu and Pomba-gira, and their relationships with what we call here “social garbage”. We follow these characters through the figures of three Brazilian movies: Madame Sata, Cidade de Deus and Cafundo. Starting from the idea of Circulation, from which the understanding of the way things are done are complex and difficult to grasp, we use a social-historical perspective, but also symbolic-cultural. We conclude that the hidden is a enhancer force that allows the resistance, recurrence and resurgence of abject figures that nourish the imagination of Brazilian evil. Finally, we open the perspective of joy as a driving force that empowered the hidden.
