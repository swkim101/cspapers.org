It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third ACM Workshop on Scalable Trusted Computing (ACM STC'08). This year's symposium builds on the success of ACM STC'06 and STC'07 as a premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of fundamental technologies of trusted computing and its applications in large-scale systems. 
 
The call for papers attracted 34 submissions from Asia, Europe, Africa, and the United States. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover a variety of topics, including architecture and implementation technologies for trusted platforms, remote attestation of trusted devices, and cryptographic support in trusted computing. In addition, the program includes two keynote speakers, Peter Loscocco from the National Security Agency and Sean Smith from the Dartmouth College. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
