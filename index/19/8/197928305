Accurate user representation learning has been proven fundamental for many social media applications, including community detection, recommendation, etc. A major challenge lies in that, the available data in a single social network are usually very limited and sparse. In real life, many people are members of several social networks in the same time. Constrained by the features and design of each, any single social platform offers only a partial view of a user from a particular perspective. In this paper, we propose MV-URL, a multi-view user representation learning model to enhance user modeling by integrating the knowledge from various networks. Different from the traditional network embedding frameworks where either the whole framework is single-network based or each network involved is a homogeneous network, we focus on multiple social networks and each network in our task is a heterogeneous network. It's very challenging to effectively fuse knowledge in this setting as the fusion depends upon not only the varying relatedness of information sources, but also the target application tasks. MV-URL focuses on two tasks: user account linkage (i.e., to predict the missing true user account linkage across social media) and user attribute prediction. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on two real-world collections of linked social networks, and the experimental results show the superiority of MV-URL compared with existing state-of-art embedding methods. It can be learned online, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for real world applications.
