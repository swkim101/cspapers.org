Information and Communications Technologies 
(ICTs) have revolutionized contemporary media 
and entertainment systems. This change enhances 
socio-cultural practices – participation, socialization 
and language learning – that require users to 
refine their cognitive abilities. This paper aims 
to show how cyberculture, while highlighting the 
cognitive activities that exist in the practices of 
communications and contemporary entertainment, 
gives rise to a dual repositioning: the concepts 
of games/entertainment and technology/media 
are both associated with cognition. We will base 
our assumptions on the change in the concept of 
cognition that took place during the twentieth 
century to rethink the links between technology, 
the ludic and cognition in cyberculture. Among the 
preliminary results, we observe that entertainment 
has ceased to be childish, unpretentious and 
escapist, and is approaching the ludic category, while 
technology has ceased to be a mere tool, instead 
becoming an agent in cognitive processes.
