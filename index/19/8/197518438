The paper analyzes how the enunciator of Veja , Brazil's leading weekly magazine , places in speech the issue of technology . The text uses the following main assumptions : a) in Veja predominates a n world vision grounded in technological determinism b ) technology is placed in speech as a strategy for building a future that , in short , tends to reproduce actual social relations ; c ) technology acts to decrease the power of possibles social transformations . The research shows clear evidence in order to confirm the hypothesis . In fact , Veja builds an apologetic view of technological development that prefigures a deterministic picture of the future unfolding as a present were "the event", understood as Alain Badiou, is impossible. The Discourse Analysis , focusing on two thematic moments , points to two key trends: a) colonization of the future : technological future is built in cover stories (1968-2010) to legitimize hegemonic relations “encoded” (Feenberg) in technological devices , b ) disempowerment of the event: the foreshadowed vision of the future “frezzes” unpredictability of the present, that could engender political transformations , by operating a suture of the nodal point (Laclau) , which could have disruptive effects on the order of capital . Thus, it is concluded that the possible break point represented by the potential of the technology is converted in to "quilting point" ( Žižek ) , from which the discourse of technological determinism permanently reconstructs the social logic of Capital . Article drives , as the theoretical framework , recent post- structuralist Discourse Analysis ( Laclau ) , Philosophy of the Event ( Badiou ) Theory and Criticism of technology ( Feenberg ) trends.
