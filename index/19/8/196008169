In other areas of knowledge such as philosophy, phenomenology is understood as a theoretical proposal. In the Communication scientific community, however, there is no such consensus: phenomenology is understood as a theory and, more commonly in recent years, as a method. The point is that this ambiguity may result in an inappropriate use, since the absence of a well defined proposal may lead to questioning the results of studies that employ such method. In this context, this article aims to discuss this issue, with a brief historical survey on the phenomenology; it debates this theoretical and methodical relationship and suggests a seven step guideline to the phenomenological method. Finally, this proposed guideline is used as a key to analyze a study built with this method. The result shows that the explanation of techniques (such as in-depth interviews and participant observation) could improve the understanding of the method for Communication field users.
