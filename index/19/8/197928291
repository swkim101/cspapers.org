In a previous keynote address [1], we have described how voice-enabled intelligent assistants are revolutionizing the way humans interact with machines and how their ubiquitous presence in homes, cars, offices are taking us closer to the old dream of ambient computing. We also explained how Alexa, Amazon's intelligent assistant, is pioneering the domain of voice shopping, considering the customer's shopping journey in a holistic manner. In this talk, we will discuss in more details the key stages required in addressing customer's needs, namely (1) understanding customers, (2) satisfying their needs, and (3) predicting them. We will also provide a finer analysis of customers' needs, be they informational, transactional or navigational needs [2]. We will conclude by presenting some associated research challenges and encouraging the community to explore the unchartered area of voice-enabled product discovery.
