The underwater environment poses significant challenges for accurate autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. Electromagnetic (EM) waves rapidly attenuate due to absorption by water, thereby preventing the use of traditional EM-based positioning methods such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or visible-light cameras. Consequently, underwater positioning is often performed using systems that operate in the hydro-acoustic frequency range ($\leq 10$ MHz). Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of a novel acoustic positioning approach for multi-AUV operations called passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) localization-with each vehicle equipped with a time-synchronized USBL array, one-way travel-time (OWTT) range and angle between the AUV and a single acoustic beacon enables multi-AUV navigation relative to the beacon. In this work, a piUSBL system using a five-hydrophone pyramidal array implemented on a WAM-V autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) was used to experimentally gather acoustic measurements and to compare the accuracy of piUSBL localization against ground-truth from a differential GPS unit. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the positioning accuracy of the system in a real-world environment, both prior to and after Bayesian filtering, using two independent acoustic beacons for validation. We demonstrate that piUSBL provides acoustic range and angle measurements with errors of about $\mu\pm\sigma = 0.03\pm 1.49 \mathrm{m}$ and $\mu\pm\sigma = -0.11\pm 3.16^{\circ}$ respectively. These experimental results suggest that piUSBL localization can provide a highly accurate, inexpensive, and low-power navigation solution for the next generation of miniature, low-cost underwater vehicle.
