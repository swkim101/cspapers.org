This work is to enhance existing fine-grained access control to support a more expressive access policy over arithmetic operation results. We aim to enable data owners to flexibly bind a user's identity with his/her authorized access target according to a given access control policy, which indicates how a piece of data obfuscated by different noises. To this end, we design a cryptographic primitive that decouples the noisy data to two components, one associated with user identity, and the other one shared and dynamically changes, with the composite of these two components evaluated and revealed at user sides. The security of our scheme is formally proven using game based approach. We implement our system on a commercial cloud platform and use extensive experiments to validate its functionality and performance.
