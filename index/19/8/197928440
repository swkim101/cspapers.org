The query performance prediction task (QPP) is estimating retrieval effectiveness in the absence of relevance judgments. Prior work has focused on prediction for retrieval methods based on surface level query-document similarities (e.g., query likelihood). We address the prediction challenge for pseudo-feedback-based retrieval methods which utilize an initial retrieval to induce a new query model; the query model is then used for a second (final) retrieval. Our suggested approach accounts for the presumed effectiveness of the initially retrieved list, its similarity with the final retrieved list and properties of the latter. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the clear merits of our approach.
