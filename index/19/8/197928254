Many social media sites allow users to upload text, images, and videos (collectively referred to asanchor post) for public consumption. These posts may attract hundreds of comments from many social users leading to social conversations (ie discussions). Tools that can facilitate user-friendly and effective understanding and analysis of large volumes of comments associated with anchor posts can be of great benefit to individuals and organizations. In this demonstration, we present a novel end-to-end visualization system called Kandinsky to supportmulti-faceted visualization of social discussions associated with an anchor post. In Kandinsky, the social discussion landscape is visualized using a collection of colorfulcircles andconcentric circles, which are inspired from the famous abstract arts called"Squares with Concentric Circles" and"Several Circles" by Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944). Intuitively, a circle and a concentric circle represent a social comment and a collection of comments in a discussion thread, respectively. We discuss various innovative features of Kandinsky and demonstrate its effectiveness.
