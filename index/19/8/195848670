Mobile applications today increasingly integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) into their account management mechanisms. Unfortunately, the involved multi-party protocol, i.e., OAuth 2.0, was originally designed to serve websites for authorization purpose. Due to the complexity of the adapted protocol, a large number of insecure SSO implementations still exist in the wild. Although the security testing for real-world SSO deployments has attracted considerable attention in recent years, existing work either focuses on websites or relies on the manual discovery of specific and previously-known vulnerabilities. In the paper, we design and implement MoSSOT (Mobile SSO Tester), an automated blackbox security testing tool for Android applications utilizing the SSO services from three mainstream service providers. The tool detects the vulnerabilities within the practical SSO implementations by fuzzing related network messages. We used MoSSOT to examine over 500 first-tier third-party Android applications from US and Chinese app markets. According to the test result, around 72% of the tested applications incorrectly implement SSO and are thus vulnerable. Besides, our test identifies an unknown vulnerability as well as a new variant, in addition to four known ones. The vulnerabilities enable the attacker to illegally log into the mobile applications as the victims or gain access to the protected resources. MoSSOT has been released as an open-source project.
