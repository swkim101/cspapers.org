It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the third edition of the ACM Workshop on Cognitive Radio Networks (CoRoNet 2011). Spurred by recent advances in software defined radios and cognitive radios, cognitive wireless networking has emerged as a promising approach to address several challenges affecting the networks of today, including spectrum efficiency, interference management, coexistence and interoperability. This year's workshop continues its tradition of serving as a forum for presenting early research results and experience reports on the hot topics in cognitive radio networks. CoRoNet 2011 helps provide researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of this exciting area. 
 
The program includes two paper presentation sessions, one session from the open call and one session of invited papers and talks. We also have an exciting Keynote talk, a demonstration session showcasing early cognitive radio products, and a panel on "Separating Hype from Reality in Cognitive Radio Networks". We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for both researchers and practitioners.
