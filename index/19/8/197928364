Personalized search aims to adapt document ranking to user's personal interests. Traditionally, this is done by extracting click and topical features from historical data in order to construct a user profile. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully used in personalized search due to its ability of automatic feature learning. However, the small amount of noisy personal data poses challenges to deep learning models to learn the personalized classification boundary between relevant and irrelevant results. In this paper, we propose PSGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for personalized search. By means of adversarial training, we enforce the model to pay more attention to training data that are difficult to distinguish. We use the discriminator to evaluate personalized relevance of documents and use the generator to learn the distribution of relevant documents. Two alternative ways to construct the generator in the framework are tested: based on the current query or based on a set of generated queries. Experiments on data from a commercial search engine show that our models can yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art models.
