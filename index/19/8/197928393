Attributed entity is an entity defined by its structural attributes. Extracting attributed entities from textual documents is an important problem for a variety of big-data applications. We propose a system called EXACT for extracting attributed entities from textual documents by performing explorative annotation tasks, which create attributes and bind them to tag values. To support efficient annotation, we propose a novel tag recommendation technique based on a few-shot learning scheme which can suggest tags for new annotation tasks given very few human-annotated samples. We also propose a document recommendation scheme to provide run-time context for the user. Using a novel attribute index, the system can generate the task-relevant attributed entities on-the-fly. We demonstrate how these techniques can be integrated behind a novel user interface to enable productive and efficient extraction of attributed entities at limited cost in human annotation.
