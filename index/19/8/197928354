Open source softwares play an important role in information retrieval research. Most of the existing open source information retrieval systems are implemented in Java or C++ programming language. In this paper, we propose Parrot1, a Python-based interactive platform for information retrieval research. The proposed platform has mainly three advantages in comparison with the existing retrieval systems: (1) It is integrated with Jupyter Notebook, an interactive programming platform which has proved to be effective for data scientists to tackle big data and AI problems. As a result, users can interactively visualize and diagnose a retrieval model; (2) As an application written in Python, it can be easily used in combination with the popular deep learning frameworks such as Tersorflow and Pytorch; (3) It is designed especially for researchers. Less code is needed to create a new retrieval model or to modify an existing one. Our efforts have focused on three functionalists: good usability, interactive programming, and good interoperability with the popular deep learning frameworks. To confirm the performance of the proposed system, we conduct comparative experiments on a number of standard test collections. The experimental results show that the proposed system is both efficient and effective, providing a practical framework for researchers in information retrieval.
