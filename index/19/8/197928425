Community-based question answering (CQA), which provides a platform for people with diverse backgrounds to share information and knowledge, has become increasingly popular. With the accumulation of site data, methods to detect duplicate questions in CQA sites have attracted considerable attention. Existing methods typically use only questions to complete the task. However, the paired answers may also provide valuable information. In this paper, we propose an answer information- enhanced adaptive multi-attention network (AMAN) to perform this task. AMAN takes full advantage of the semantic information in the paired answers while alleviating the noise problem caused by adding the answers. To evaluate the proposed method, we use a CQADupStack set and the Quora question-pair dataset expanded with paired answers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the above two data sets.
