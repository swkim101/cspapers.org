In the computer-aided design of digital equipment, by the time a wire unit is in the check-out lab, a large amount of information concerning this unit exists in the form of tape files. Since our D.A. System is entered via logic equations, we have a file containing this information, plus files indicating the partitioning of the equations, the placement of smaller building blocks within larger building blocks, and the assignment of signals to pins for routing or wiring. Also, there will be a wire list file (or a router output file) plus a punch card deck when a wiring machine is to be used. In addition a large pile of computer output reports will exist communicating this information to the literate world. About two years ago we learned that in some of the checkout labs engineers were devoting large amounts of time pouring through the reports we generate in order to correlate signals appearing in logic equations with connector pins. In order to remove this burden from these engineers, a program known as the Equation Connector Program (EQNCON) was written. This program exhibits the correlation of logic signals and connector pins in a printed report which is then heavily used during checkout.
