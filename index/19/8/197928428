Emergency management organisations currently rely on a wide range of disparate tools and technologies to support the monitoring and management of events during crisis situations. This has a number of disadvantages, in terms of training time for new staff members, reliance on external services, and a lack of integration (and hence poor transfer of information) between those services. On the other hand, Event Tracker is a new solution that aims to provide a unified view of an event, integrating information from emergency response officers, the public (via social media) and also volunteers from around the world. In particular, Event Tracker provides a series of novel functionalities to realise this unified view of the event, namely: real-time identification of critical information, automatic grouping of content by the information needs of response officers, as well as real-time volunteers management and communication. This is supported by an efficient and scalable back-end infrastructure designed to ingest and process high-volumes of real-time streaming data with low latency.
