The task of event extraction contains subtasks including detections for entity mentions, event triggers and argument roles. Traditional methods solve them as a pipeline, which does not make use of task correlation for their mutual benefits. There have been recent efforts towards building a joint model for all tasks. However, due to technical challenges, there has not been work predicting the joint output structure as a single task. We build a first model to this end using a neural transition-based framework, incrementally predicting complex joint structures in a state-transition process. Results on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the joint model, which gives the best result in the literature.
