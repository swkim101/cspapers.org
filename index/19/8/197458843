We continue in the same vein as Lichtenstein, Pnueli and Zuck in ?The Glory of the Past?, demonstrating the advantages of including past-time operators in using temporal logic in computer science. A normal form for temporal formulas, based on a simple combination of past formulas, is arrived at via syntactic rewrites and is shown to be a useful alternative to automata-based temporal reasoning. The use of the normal form in providing a complete axiomatization for PCTL* (i.e. CTL* with past connectives) is sketched.
