This paper presents a method for finding a specification page on the web for a given object (e.g."Titanic o)and its class label (e.g."film o). A specification page for an object is a web page which gives concise attribute-value information about the object (e.g."director o-"James Cameron ofor "Titanic o). A simple unsupervised method using layout and symbolic decoration cues was applied to a large number of web pages to acquire the class attributes. We used these acquired attributes to select a representative specification page for a given object from the web pages retrieved by a normal search engine. Experimental results revealed that our method greatly outperformed the normal search engine in terms of specification retrieval.
