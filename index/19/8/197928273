Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based methods for Collaborative Filtering (CF) demonstrate remarkable performance for one-class (implicit negative) recommendation tasks by extending autoencoders with relaxed but tractable latent distributions. Explicitly modeling a latent distribution over user preferences allows VAEs to learn user and item representations that not only reproduce observed interactions, but also generalize them by leveraging learning from similar users and items. Unfortunately, VAE-CF can exhibit suboptimal learning properties; e.g., VAE-CFs will increase their prediction confidence as they receive more preferences per user, even when those preferences may vary widely and create ambiguity in the user representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Queryable Variational Autoencoder (Q-VAE) variant of the VAE that explicitly models arbitrary conditional relationships between observations. The proposed model appropriately increases uncertainty (rather than reduces it) in cases where a large number of user preferences may lead to an ambiguous user representation. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the Q-VAE generally performs comparably or outperforms VAE-based recommenders as well as other state-of-the-art approaches and is generally competitive across the user preference density spectrum, where other methods peak for certain preference density levels.
