The understanding of the process of relevance judgment helps to inspire the design of retrieval models. Traditional retrieval models usually estimate relevance based on document-level signals. Recent works consider a more fine-grain, passage-level relevance information, which can further enhance retrieval performance. However, it lacks a detailed analysis of how passage-level relevance signals determine or influence the relevance judgment of the whole document. To investigate the role of passage-level relevance in the document-level relevance judgment, we construct an ad-hoc retrieval dataset with both passage-level and document-level relevance labels. A thorough analysis reveals that: 1) there is a strong correlation between the document-level relevance and the fractions of irrelevant passages to highly relevant passages; 2) the position, length and query similarity of passages play different roles in the determination of document-level relevance; 3) The sequential passage-level relevance within a document is a potential indicator for the document-level relevance. Based on the relationship between passage-level and document-level relevance, we also show that utilizing passage-level relevance signals can improve existing document ranking models. This study helps us better understand how users perceive relevance for a document and inspire the designing of novel ranking models leveraging fine-grain, passage-level relevance signals.
