Query auto-completion presents a ranked list of search queries as suggestions for a customer-entered prefix. Ghosting is the process of auto-completing a search recommendation by highlighting the suggested text inline i.e., within the search box. We present a behavioral recommendation model that uses customer search context to ghost on high-confidence queries. We tested ghosting on over 140 million search sessions. Session-context ghosting increased the acceptance of offered suggestions by 6.18%, reduced misspelled searches by 4.42% and improved net sales by 0.14%.
