In this paper we propose the task of numeral attachment to detect the attached target of a numeral. Compared with other kinds of named entities, numerals provide richer and more crucial information in some domains. Fine-grained understanding of the information embedded in numerals is a fundamental challenge. We develop NumAttach, a pilot dataset for the proposed task based on tweets. Two main challenges of this task include the informal writing style in tweets and the representation of numerals. To address these challenges, we present an embedding technique that considers word and numeral information simultaneously. Furthermore, we design a joint learning model with the capsule network to accomplish the proposed task. We also release NumAttach to the research community as a resource.
