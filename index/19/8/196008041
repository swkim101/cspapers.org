This article discusses a genre of activism in new media, the cultural jamming, setting out the main features of this practice of activism. We seek also to show how the cultural jamming is not restricted to a critique of consumerism or reworkings of advertising, but as it has also been used in the art field, especially at the interface of the politics and popular culture.
