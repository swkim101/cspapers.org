This tutorial synthesizes and presents research on web tables over the past two decades. We group the tasks into six main categories of information access tasks: (i) table extraction, (ii) table interpretation, (iii) table search, (iv) question answering on tables, (v) knowledge base augmentation, and (vi) table completion. For each category, we identify and introduce seminal approaches, present relevant resources, and point out interdependencies among the different tasks.
