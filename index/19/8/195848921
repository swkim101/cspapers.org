We measure the usage of cipher suites in protected Wi-Fi networks, and do this for several distinct geographic areas. Surprisingly, we found that 44.81% of protected networks still support the old WPA-TKIP cipher. Motivated by this, we systematically analyze the security of several implementations of WPA-TKIP, and present novel side-channel attacks against them. The presented attacks bypass existing countermeasures and recover the Michael message authentication key in 1 to 4 minutes. Using this key, an adversary can then decrypt and inject network traffic. In contrast, previous attacks needed 7 to 8 minutes. These results stress the urgent need to stop using WPA-TKIP.
