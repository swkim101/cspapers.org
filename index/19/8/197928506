Compared to general web search, image search engines present results in a significantly different way, which leads to changes in user behavior patterns, and thus creates challenges for the existing evaluation mechanisms. In this paper, we pay attention to the context factor in the image search scenario. On the basis of a mean-variance analysis, we investigate the effects of context and find that evaluation metrics align with user satisfaction better when the returned image results have high variance. Furthermore, assuming that the image results a user has examined might affect her following judgments, we propose the Context-Aware Gain (CAG), a novel evaluation metric that incorporates the contextual effects within the well-known gain-discount framework. Our experiment results show that, with a proper combination of discount functions, the proposed context-aware evaluation metric can significantly improve the performances of offline metrics for image search evaluation, considering user satisfaction as the golden standard.
