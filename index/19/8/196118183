The horizontal communication model of the internet has given everyone a voice, calling into question the role of the journalist and resetting his functions. This article has analyzed the productive routines in O Globo and Extra brazilian’s newspapers sites to see how the internet added roles to these professionals. The starting point was to review David White´s pioneering study about the journalist as a gatekeeper in selecting news. The gatewatcher concept, which defines the journalist online as an observer that searchs for content to his audience, has also been applied. It was observed that, as the internet brings a new layer of information to the online journalism, it also superimposes functional layers onto old ones in the newsrooms. The increasing public participation proposes new roles to the journalists. It was possible to see how the online journalist is establishing his identity based on a new pillar: as an audience mobilizer, working to achieve the public’s engagement.
