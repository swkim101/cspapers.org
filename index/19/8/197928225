We introduce deep learning models to the two most important stages in product search at JD.com, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. Specifically, we outline the design of a deep learning system that retrieves semantically relevant items to a query within milliseconds, and a pairwise deep re-ranking system, which learns subtle user preferences. Compared to traditional search systems, the proposed approaches are better at semantic retrieval and personalized ranking, achieving significant improvements.
