Synonym expansion is a technique that adds related words to search queries, which may lead to more relevant documents being retrieved, thus improving recall. There is extensive prior work on synonym expansion for web search, however very few studies have tackled its application for email search. Synonym expansion for private corpora like emails poses several unique research challenges. First, the emails are not shared across users, which precludes us from directly employing query-document bipartite graphs, which are standard in web search synonym expansion. Second, user search queries are of personal nature, and may not be generalizable across users. Third, the size of the underlying corpora from which the synonyms may be mined is relatively small (i.e., user's private email inbox) compared to the size of the web corpus. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a solution tailored to the challenges of synonym expansion for email search. We formulate it as a multi-view learning problem, and propose a novel embedding-based model that joins information from multiple sources to obtain the optimal synonym candidates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we evaluate our model using both explicit human ratings as well as a live experiment using the Gmail Search service, one of the world's largest email search engines.
