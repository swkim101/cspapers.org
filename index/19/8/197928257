The spread of false information on the Web is one of the main problems of our society. Automatic detection of fake news posts is a hard task since they are intentionally written to mislead the readers and to trigger intense emotions to them in an attempt to be disseminated in the social networks. Even though recent studies have explored different linguistic patterns of false claims, the role of emotional signals has not yet been explored. In this paper, we study the role of emotional signals in fake news detection. In particular, we propose an LSTM model that incorporates emotional signals extracted from the text of the claims to differentiate between credible and non-credible ones. Experiments on real world datasets show the importance of emotional signals for credibility assessment.
