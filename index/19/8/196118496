This paper is based on a Feminist perspective and has diagnostic and analytical intentions that seek contributing to the theoretical-conceptual formulation of women’s human rights, locating gender violence in a scope in which the violations of their rights is made concrete. With such purpose, this work, which has its origin in the UNAM-PAPIIT project “La influencia de los medios de comunicacion en la representacion social de la violencia contra las mujeres y las ninas”, aims to share a set of theoretical-methodological reflections, directed to analyzing the influence of the means of communication on the social representation of violence against women, with the objective of calling these institutions to participate in their eradication and to propose keys to a education that contributes to the accomplishment of women’s human rights.
