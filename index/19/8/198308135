This text addresses the problematic dialog surrounding two different forms of expression – the so-called “root” samba and the “carioca” funk – both of which are believed to share the same origin: the slum. Despite several differences between the two – especially in what respects the material and plastic dimensions of the issue – my suggestion is that there is much more in common between samba and funk besides a mere "place of birth". And these points of convergence constitute important forms of production of subjectivity in the space of the city, especially if we take in account the performative aspects of the question. Our purpose is to make an approach that privileges a form of musical production which, on the one hand, represents a form of resistance to the oppressive management channels of the city and, on the other, gives place to new experiences and social relationships capable of influencing a new cultural sensitivity.
