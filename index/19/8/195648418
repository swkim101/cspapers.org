This article has as theme the popular segment of the big press, specifically the readers’ Places of Speech on the Diario Gaucho (DG) newspaper. The DG, edited by Rede Brasil Sul de comunicacao in Rio Grande do Sul, is read by more than a million readers from C, D and E classes. It dedicates itself to the service rendering, entertainment and a wide visibility concession to its popular readers. On DG’s case, is the speech of the popular reader that makes the difference. The paper analyses the places that the reader’s speech assumes on the newspaper and tackles the reference journalism and the popular journalism to understand who is authorized to speak in each one of them.
