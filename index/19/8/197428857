The preservation of the marine environment provides benefits for the whole society and constitutes a basic need for the mankind. These habitats are extremely complex systems, characterized by strong links between their physical and chemical processes and biological population. A great part of the work carried out by scientists involved in this field consists in the acquisition and analysis of robust and measurable data, in order to detect threats and take actions to contrast them. Unfortunately, this kind of activity has been proven to be very costly in terms of people and instrumentation1–3 to be carried out by a single research team with the goal to gather an amount of historical data that can allow a fully interpretation of phenomenon in this kind of environment. As a partial solution to these issues, in the last years there has been an increasing exploitation of the citizen science in marine monitoring projects, helped by the fact that in the last decades there is also a major assessing of scuba diving as a mass leisure activity, with millions of divers from all around the world. Because non-experts are involved in the research process through the citizen science, in literature there is a debate on the usefulness of this kind of researches, specifically on the quality of the data collected.4–6
