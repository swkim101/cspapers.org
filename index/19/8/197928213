We propose a method for identifying a set of entity properties from text. Identifying entity properties is similar to a relation extraction task that can be cast as a classification of sentences. Normally, this task can be achieved by distant supervised learning by automatically preparing training sentences for each property; however, it is impractical to prepare training sentences for every property. Therefore, we describe a zero-shot learning problem for this task and propose a neural network-based model that does not rely on a complete training set comprising training sentences for every property. To achieve this, we utilize embeddings of properties obtained from a knowledge graph embedding using different components of a knowledge graph structure. The embeddings of properties are combined with the model to enable identification of properties with no available training sentences. By using our newly constructed dataset as well as an existing dataset, experiments revealed that our model achieved a better performance for properties with no training sentences, relative to baseline results, even comparable to that achieved for properties with training sentences.
