Impoverished and segregated territories have been globally converted into tourist attractions eliciting ethical debates around the association between leisure and poverty. Many tourists who consume the touristic poverty do not ignore these debates and publicize their reflections on such experience through their travelblogs. This article examines the imagetic and discursive aspects of four blogs which present narratives about the experience of contact with the touristic poverty in Rocinha (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Soweto (Johannesburg, South Africa). The broader aim is to show the impacts that such touristic experience has upon the image of the city produced by those tourists.
