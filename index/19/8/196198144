In this paper we discuss the usefulness of applying a checking procedure to existing thesauri. The procedure is based on the analysis of discrepancies of corpus-based and thesaurus-based word similarities. We applied the procedure to more than 30 thousand words of the Russian wordnet and found some serious errors in word sense description, including inaccurate relationships and missing senses of ambiguous words.
