In this paper, we for the first time demonstrate how to enable OFDMA in Wi-Fi backscatter for capacity and concurrency enhancement. With our approach, the excitation signal is reflected, modulated and shifted to lie in the frequency band of the OFDM subcarrier by the tag; OFDMA is realized by coordinating tags to convey information to the receiver with orthogonal subcarriers concurrently through backscatter. The crux of the design is to achieve strict synchronization among communication components, which is more challenging than in regular OFDMA systems due to the more prominent hardware diversity and uncertainty for backscattering. We reveal how the subtle asychnronization scenarios particularly for backscattering can incur system offsets, and present a series of novel designs for the excitation signal transmitter, tag, and receiver to address the issue. We build a prototype in 802.11g OFDM framework to validate our design. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 5.2-16Mbps aggregate throughput by allowing 48 tags to transmit concurrently, which is 1.45-5x capacity and 48x concurrency compared with the existing design respectively. We also design an OFDMA tag IC, and the simulation and numerical analysis results show that the tag's power consumption is in tens of Î¼W.
