Image segmentation is an important step in medical image processing and has been widely studied and developed for refinement of clinical analysis and applications. New models based on deep learning have improved results but are restricted to pixel-wise ﬁtting of the segmentation map. Our aim was to tackle this limitation by developing a new model based on deep learning which takes into account the area inside as well as outside the region of interest as well as the size of boundaries during learning. Speciﬁcally, we propose a new loss function which incorporates area and size information and integrates this into a dense deep learning model. We evaluated our approach on a dataset of more than 2,000 cardiac MRI scans. Our results show that the proposed loss function outperforms other mainstream loss function Cross-entropy on two common segmentation networks. Our loss function is robust while using different hyperparameter lambda.
