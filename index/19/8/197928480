To deal with document clustering, we usually rely on document-term matrices. However, from additional available information like keywords, co-authors, citations we might rather exploit a reorganization of the data in the form of a tensor. In this paper, we extend the use of the Sparse Poisson Latent Block Model to deal with sparse tensor data using jointly all information arising from documents. The proposed model is parsimonious and tailored for this kind of data. To estimate the parameters, we derive a suitable tensor co-clustering algorithm. Empirical results on several real-world text datasets highlight the advantages of our proposal which improves the clustering results of documents.
