This article aims to discuss the complex and profuse articulations between popular music and the city. We chose as objects three different cities, styles and historical periods: Manchester from the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1990s; Seattle at the beginning of the 1990s and Recife from the 1990s to the 2000s. Our purpose is to identify certain recurrences and differences between these scenes to understand how cultural sensibilities are established and how musical movements model and redesign not only the actual cities, but also the way in which individuals apprehend and circulate in theses spaces.
