The planar motion of ground vehicles is often non-holonomic, which enables a solution of the two-view relative pose problem from a single point feature correspondence. Man-made environments such as underground parking lots are however dominated by line features. Inspired by the planar tri-focal tensor and its ability to handle lines, we establish an n-linear constraint on the locally circular motion of non-holonomic vehicles able to handle an arbitrarily large and dense window of views. We prove that this stays a uni-variate problem under the assumption of locally constant vehicle speed, and it can transparently handle both point and vertical line correspondences. In particular, we prove that an application of Vi√®te's formulas for extrapolating trigonometric functions of angle multiples and the Weierstrass substitution casts the problem as one that merely seeks the roots of a uni-variate polynomial. We present the complete theory of this novel solver, and test it on both simulated and real data. Our results prove that it successfully handles a variety of relevant scenarios, eventually outperforming the 1-point two-view solver.
