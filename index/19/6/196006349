This article originates from the post doctoral research, completed in 2009, with support from FAPESP, in PUCSP and the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona-UAB. Our aim is to analyze the magazines Radiosola and Radio Barcelona in the consolidation of EAJ-1 Radio Barcelona, Spainâ€™s first official radio station, in 1924. The theoretical discussion is based on publications in the fields of media and media history. We work with observations, document analysis, audiovisual material, researches in newspapers and journals, and interviews with professionals of Radio Barcelona and cited journals. The oral history has proved to have been extremely useful for the bias of diachronic research, given the oral fertility of radio media. We conclude that magazines are of vital importance and a mainstay of radio by the end of the Civil War (1939), times of great political turmoil, and also important for the success of the cinema in Spain, with illustrated covers by the most beautiful actresses of that time.
