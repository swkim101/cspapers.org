By means of an analysis of the daily newspaper Mundo al dia published between 1924 and 1938, whose presence has not been legitimized by our historians and journalists (compared to other newspapers that are more wellknown), this article shows how gradually in the twenties a new kind of journalism emerges. What previously was a journalism for a social and intellectual elite that circulated among a reduced number of literate people with a certain cultural level as well as an enormous avidness for the latest news transforms itself into a journalism that has a different focus that cannot be separated from the rise of modernity and industrialization in Colombia nor from the new technologies in the age of information. Visual communication constitutes a significant part of a series of strategies that aim at a massive coverage of the news.
