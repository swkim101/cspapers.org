Judgment aggregation (JA) studies how to aggregate truth valuations on logically related issues. Computing the outcome of aggregation procedures is notoriously computationally hard, which is the likely reason that no implementation of them exists as of yet. However, even hard problems sometimes need to be solved. The worst-case computational complexity of answer set programming (ASP) matches that of most problems in judgment aggregation. We take advantage of this and propose a natural and modular encoding of various judgment aggregation procedures and related problems in JA into ASP. With these encodings, we achieve two results: (1) paving the way towards constructing a wide range of new benchmark instances (from JA) for answer set solving algorithms; and (2) providing an automated tool for researchers in the area of judgment aggregation.
