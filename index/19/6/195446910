We formulate an equation describing a general Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging measurement and analyze the properties of the measurement in the Fourier domain regarding the spatial frequencies of the scene it encodes. We conclude that for a relay wall with finite size, certain scene configurations and features are not detectable in an NLOS measurement. We then provide experimental examples of invisible scene features and their reconstructions, as well as a set of example scenes that lead to an ill-posed NLOS imaging problem.
