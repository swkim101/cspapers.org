W. J. T. Mitchell, Art history and English professor in the University of Chicago, is Critical Inquiry's editor and the author of many books and articles. Focusing his studies in the problematization of the interface between sight and language in visual arts, literature and the media, Mitchell proposes very orginal methods to approach images, building new perspectives to what he calls, according to Panofsky, and Iconolgy. In his reflections, he has coined the well known expression "pictorial turn".
