Multimodal sentiment analysis combines information available from visual, textual, and acoustic representations for sentiment prediction. The recent multimodal fusion schemes combine multiple modalities as a tensor and obtain either; the common information by utilizing neural networks, or the unique information by modeling low-rank representation of the tensor. However, both of these information are essential as they render inter-modal and intra-modal relationships of the data. In this research, we first propose a novel deep architecture to extract the common information from the multi-mode representations. Furthermore, we propose unique networks to obtain the modality-specific information that enhances the generalization performance of our multimodal system. Finally, we integrate these two aspects of information via a fusion layer and propose a novel multimodal data fusion architecture, which we call DeepCU (Deep network with both Common and Unique latent information). The proposed DeepCU consolidates the two networks for joint utilization and discovery of all-important latent information. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing both common and unique information discovered by DeepCU on multiple real-world datasets.
