The necessity of radiation dosimeter with precise measurement of radiation dose is increased and required in the field of spacecraft, radiotheraphy hospital, atomic plant facility, etc. where radiation exists. Until now, a low power commercial metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor has been tested as a gamma radiation dosimeter. The measurement error between the actual value and the measurement one can occur since the MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) dosimeter, which is now being used, has two gates with same width. The measurement value of dosimeter depends on the variation of threshold voltage, which can be affected by the environment such as temperature. In this paper, a radiation dosimeter having a pair of MOSFET is designed in the same silicon substrate, in which each of the MOSFETs is operable in a bias mode and a test mode. It can measure the radiation dose by the difference between the threshold voltages regardless of the variation of temperature.
