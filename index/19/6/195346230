Phase retrieval (PR) algorithms have become an important component in many modern computational imaging systems. For instance, in the context of ptychography and speckle correlation imaging PR algorithms enable imaging past the diffraction limit and through scattering media, respectively. Unfortunately, traditional PR algorithms struggle in the presence of noise. Recently PR algorithms have been developed that use priors to make themselves more robust. However, these algorithms often require unrealistic (Gaussian or coded diffraction pattern) measurement models and offer slow computation times. These drawbacks have hindered widespread adoption. In this work we use convolutional neural networks, a powerful tool from machine learning, to regularize phase retrieval problems and improve recovery performance. We test our new algorithm, prDeep, in simulation and demonstrate that it is robust to noise, can handle a variety system models, and operates fast enough for high-resolution applications.
