In partial label learning (PML), each instance is associated with a candidate label set that contains multiple relevant labels and other false positive labels. The most challenging issue for the PML is that the training procedure is prone to be affected by the labeling noise. We observe that state-of-the-art PML methods are either powerless to disambiguate the correct labels from the candidate labels or incapable of extracting the label correlations sufficiently. To fill this gap, a two-stage DiscRiminative and correlAtive partial Multi-label leArning (DRAMA) algorithm is presented in this work. In the first stage, a confidence value is learned for each label by utilizing the feature manifold, which indicates how likely a label is correct. In the second stage, a gradient boosting model is induced to fit the label confidences. Specifically, to explore the label correlations, we augment the feature space by the previously elicited labels on each boosting round. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets clearly validate the superiority of our proposed method.
