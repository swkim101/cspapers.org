With about 100 million people using it recently, SVCD(Smart Voice Controlled Device) are becoming demotic. Whether at home or in an office, usually, multiple appliances are under the control of a single SVCD and several people may manipulate an SVCD simultaneously. However, present SVCD fails to handle them appropriately. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SVCD to eliminate ordersâ€™ ambiguity for single user or multi-user. We also design an algorithm combining Word2Vec and emotion detection for the device to wipe off ambiguity. Finally, we apply our framework into a virtual smart home scene and the performance of it indicates that our strategy resolves the problems commendably.
