Label distribution learning (LDL) can be viewed as the generalization of multi-label learning. This novel paradigm focuses on the relative importance of different labels to a particular instance. Most previous LDL methods either ignore the correlation among labels, or only exploit the label correlations in a global way. In this paper, we utilize both the global and local relevance among labels to provide more information for training model and propose a novel label distribution learning algorithm. In particular, a label correlation matrix based on low-rank approximation is applied to capture the global label correlations. In addition, the label correlation among local samples are adopted to modify the label correlation matrix. The experimental results on real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art LDL methods.
