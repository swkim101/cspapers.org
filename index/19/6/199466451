Existing approaches to causal embeddings rely heavily on hand-crafted high-precision causal patterns, leading to limited coverage. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method to boost causal embeddings by exploring potential verb-mediated causal patterns. It first constructs a seed set of causal word pairs, then uses them as supervision to characterize the causal strengths of extracted verb-mediated patterns, and finally exploits the weighted extractions by those verb-mediated patterns in the construction of boosted causal embeddings. Experimental results have shown that the boosted causal embeddings outperform several state-of-the-arts significantly on both English and Chinese. As by-products, the top-ranked patterns coincide with human intuition about causality.
