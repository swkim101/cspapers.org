We show that every n-point tree metric admits a (1 + e)-embedding into l1C(e) log n, for every e > 0, where C(e) ≤ O ((1/e)4 log 1/e)). This matches the natural volume lower bound up to a factor depending only on e. Previously, it was unknown whether even complete binary trees on n nodes could be embedded in l1O(log n) with O(1) distortion. For complete d-ary trees, our construction achieves C(e) ≤ O (½e2).
