Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem to find collision-free paths for a set of agents (mobile robots) moving on a graph. There exists several abstract models describing the problem with various types of constraints. The demo presents software to evaluate the abstract models when the plans are executed on Ozobots, small mobile robots developed for teaching programming. The software allows users to design the grid-like maps, to specify initial and goal locations of robots, to generate plans using various abstract models implemented in the Picat programming language, to simulate and to visualise execution of these plans, and to translate the plans to command sequences for Ozobots.
