In this paper we study a kind of non-prioritized contraction operator on belief bases -known as shielded base contractions. We propose twenty different classes of shielded base contractions and obtain axiomatic characterizations for each one of them. Additionally we thoroughly investigate the interrelations (in the sense of inclusion) among all those classes.
