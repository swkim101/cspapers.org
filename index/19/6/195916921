Motion planning of multiple mobile robots is more important than ever because their working area has become much wider. In this paper, we propose the concept of "groups" in motion planning. First, the groups are classified into "static groups" and "dynamic groups." Then, a grouping algorithm is implemented in Virtual Impedance Method, which was proposed by authors. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations.
