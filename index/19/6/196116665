In this article, an analysis will be made of the re-invention of the popular urban cultural circuits and the direct mediation of contemporary media practice. Specifically evident was the use of technological communication devices as the means of constituting the contemporary, popular, Brazilian, urban cultures. Based on the documentary 100% Favela, produced in Brazil, there is an emphasis, within social practice, on the self-management of the cultural and communicational processes as a form of re-invention of the means of economic and symbolic existence in a favela (shanty town) in the city of Sao Paulo. The use of the media devices and the construction of self-dialogue within this outer-city culture requires, these days, new modes of social listening.
