Automation in construction is possible with systems designed using the swarm robotic principles
of scalability, flexibility, robustness, and emergence. We derive quantitative measurements of
these principles in 10,000 robot swarms as a first
step in achieving this goal. We summarize our recent task allocation work in the context of an object gathering task and demonstrate its feasibility
in the context of automated construction tasks. We
present a trajectory to extend our current task allocation methodology using stochastic processes in
order to present a unified approach to task allocation in swarm-robotic construction
