The conventional methods for the next-item recommendation are generally based on RNN or one- dimensional attention with time encoding. They are either hard to preserve the long-term dependencies between different interactions, or hard to capture fine-grained user preferences. In this paper, we propose a Double Most Relevant Attention Network (DMRAN) that contains two layers, i.e., Item level Attention and Feature Level Self- attention, which are to pick out the most relevant items from the sequence of userâ€™s historical behaviors, and extract the most relevant aspects of relevant items, respectively. Then, we can capture the fine-grained user preferences to better support the next-item recommendation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets illustrate that DMRAN can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the recommendation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
