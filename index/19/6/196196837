In this work, we focus on complex question semantic parsing and propose a novel Hierarchical Semantic Parsing (HSP) method, which utilizes the decompositionality of complex questions for semantic parsing. Our model is designed within a three-stage parsing architecture based on the idea of decomposition-integration. In the first stage, we propose a question decomposer which decomposes a complex question into a sequence of sub-questions. In the second stage, we design an information extractor to derive the type and predicate information of these questions. In the last stage, we integrate the generated information from previous stages and generate a logical form for the complex question. We conduct experiments on COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONS which is a large scale complex question semantic parsing dataset, results show that our model achieves significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods.
