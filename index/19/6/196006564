We intend to present a brief panorama of the points of contact between two approaches towards the analysis of images, one from semiotics, the other from aesthetics: we take as a standpoint the assumption about the discursive regimes that defines the uses of visual representation, in the context of mass communications: in acknowledgement of the dominance of the views of semiotics on the matter, we intend to take into account the perspectives brought about by sciences of art (specially the in the methodological questions introduced by some historians of paintings), assuming to find in these theories certain ways of addressing the psychological structures of the experience of interpreting and appreciating visual icons, which could not be disregarded by a theory of image understanding which assumes that visual icons also function as textual forms.
