Network embedding has been extensively studied in recent years. In addition to the works on static networks, some researchers try to propose new models for evolving networks. However, sometimes most of these dynamic network embedding models are still not in line with the actual situation, since these models have a strong assumption that we can achieve all the changes in the whole network, while in fact we cannot do this in some real world networks, such as the web networks and some large social networks. So in this paper, we study a novel and challenging problem, i.e., network embedding under partial monitoring for evolving networks. We propose a model on dynamic networks in which we cannot perceive all the changes of the structure. We analyze our model theoretically, and give a bound to the error between the results of our model and the potential optimal cases. We evaluate the performance of our model from two aspects. The experimental results on real world datasets show that our model outperforms the baseline models by a large margin.
