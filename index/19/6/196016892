We show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation guarantee [EQUATION] for the s-t-path TSP, for any fixed e > 0. It is well known that Wolsey's analysis of Christofides' algorithm also works for the s-t-path TSP with its natural LP relaxation except for the narrow cuts (in which the LP solution has value less than two). A fixed optimum tour has either a single edge in a narrow cut (then call the edge and the cut lonely) or at least three (then call the cut busy). Our algorithm "guesses" (by dynamic programming) lonely cuts and edges. Then we partition the instance into smaller instances and strengthen the LP, requiring value at least three for busy cuts. By setting up a k-stage recursive dynamic program, we can compute a spanning tree (V, S) and an LP solution y such that [EQUATION] is in the T-join polyhedron, where T is the set of vertices whose degree in S has the wrong parity.
