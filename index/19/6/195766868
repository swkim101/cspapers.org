An independent transversal (IT) in a graph with a given vertex partition is an independent set consisting of one vertex in each partition class. Several sufficient conditions are known for the existence of an IT in a given graph and vertex partition, which have been used over the years to solve many combinatorial problems. Some of these IT existence theorems have algorithmic proofs, but there remains a gap between the best existential bounds and the bounds obtainable by efficient algorithms. Recently, Graf and Haxell (2018) described a new (deterministic) algorithm that asymptotically closes this gap, but there are limitations on its applicability. In this article, we develop a randomized algorithm that is much more widely applicable, and demonstrate its use by giving efficient algorithms for two problems concerning the strong chromatic number of graphs.
