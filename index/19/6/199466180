OpenMarkov is a Java open-source tool for creating and evaluating probabilistic graphical models, including Bayesian networks, influence diagrams, and some Markov models. With more than 100,000 lines of code, it offers some features for interactive learning, explanation of reasoning, and cost-effectiveness analysis, which are not available in any other tool. OpenMarkov has been used at universities, research centers, and large companies in more than 30Â countries on four continents. Several models, some of them for real-world medical applications, built with OpenMarkov, are publicly available on Internet.
