We present a neurosymbolic approach to the lifelong learning of algorithmic tasks that mix perception and procedural reasoning. Reusing highlevel concepts across domains and learning complex procedures are two key challenges in lifelong learning. We show that a combination of gradientbased learning and symbolic program synthesis can be a more effective response to these challenges than purely neural methods. Concretely, our approach, called HOUDINI, represents neural networks as strongly typed, end-to-end differentiable functional programs that use symbolic higher-order combinators to compose a library of neural functions. Our learning algorithm consists of: (1) a program synthesizer that performs a type-directed search over programs in this language, and decides on the library functions that should be reused and the architectures that should be used to combine them; and (2) a neural module that trains synthesized programs using stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate our approach on three algorithmic tasks. Our experiments show that our type-directed search technique is able to significantly prune the search space of programs, and that the overall approach transfers high-level concepts more effectively than monolithic neural networks as well as traditional transfer learning.
