We design approximation algorithms for the vertex ordering problems MINIMUM LINEAR ARRANGEMENT, MINIMUM CONTAINING INTERVAL GRAPH, and MINIMUM STORAGE-TIME PRODUCT, achieving approximation factors of <i>O</i>√log <i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>), <i>O</i>√log <i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>), and <i>O</i>√log <i>T</i> log log <i>T</i>), respectively, the last running in time polynomial in <i>T</i> (<i>T</i> being the sum of execution times). The technical contribution of our paper is to introduce <i>l</i><sup>2</sup><inf>2</inf> spreading metrics" (that can be computed by semidefinite programming) as relaxations for both undirected and directed "permutation metrics," which are induced by permutations of {1, 2, . . ., <i>n</i>}. The techniques introduced in the recent work of Arora, Rao and Vazirani can be adapted to exploit the geometry of such <i>l</i><sup>2</sup><inf>2</inf> spreading metrics, giving a powerful tool for the design of divide-and-conquer algorithms. In addition to their applications to approximation algorithms, the study of such <i>l</i><sup>2</sup><inf>2</inf> spreading metrics as relaxations of permutation metrics is interesting in its own right. We show how our results imply that, in a certain sense we make precise, <i>l</i><sup>2</sup><inf>2</inf> spreading metrics approximate permutation metrics on <i>n</i> points to a factor of <i>O</i>√log <i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>).
