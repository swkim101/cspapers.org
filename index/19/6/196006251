In this text we explore the characteristics of the built environment of a subway, focusing on the particularities of the Rio de Janeiro subway. We indicate that those characteristics resonate in the sociability that is generated there. We shape the notion of "machinical environment" in order to account for the technological component of this metropolitan space. Finally, we resort to our ethnographical data in order to investigate how subway riders address this environment in Rio de Janeiro.
