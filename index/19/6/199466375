Learning optimal policies in real-world domains with delayed rewards is a major challenge in Reinforcement Learning. We address the credit assignment problem by proposing a Gaussian Process (GP)-based immediate reward approximation algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness in 4 contexts where rewards can be delayed for long trajectories. In one GridWorld game and 8 Atari games, where immediate rewards are available, our results showed that on 7 out 9 games, the proposed GP-inferred reward policy performed at least as well as the immediate reward policy and significantly outperformed the corresponding delayed reward policy. In e-learning and healthcare applications, we combined GP-inferred immediate rewards with offline Deep Q-Network (DQN) policy induction and showed that the GP-inferred reward policies outperformed the policies induced using delayed rewards in both real-world contexts.
