In this position paper, we discuss the issue of how to ensure reproducibility of the results when off-the-shelf open source Information Retrieval (IR) systems are used. These systems provided a great advancement to the field but they rely on many configurations parameters which are often implicit or hidden in the documentation and/or source code. If not fully understood and made explicit, these parameters may make it difficult to reproduce results or even to understand why a system is not behaving as expected. The paper provides examples of the effects of hidden parameters in off-the-shelf IR systems, describes the enabling technologies needed to embody the approach, and show how these issues can be addressed in the broader context of component based IR evaluation. We propose a solution for systematically unfolding the configuration details of off-the-shelf IR systems and understanding whether a particular instance of a system using is behaving as expected. The proposal requires to: 1) build a taxonomy of components used by off-the-shelf systems, 2) uniquely identify them and their combination in a given configuration, 3) run each configuration on standard test collections, 4) compute the expected performance measures for each run, 4) and publish on a Web portal all the gathered information in order to make accessible and comparable for everybody how an off-the-shelf system with a given configuration is expected to behave.
