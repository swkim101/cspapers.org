This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of the PinPoint location determination system. PinPoint is a distributed algorithm that enables a set of $n$ nodes to determine the RF propagation delays between every pair of nodes, from which the inter-node distances and hence the spatial topology can be readily determined. PinPoint does not require any calibration of the area of interest and thus is rapidly deployable. Unlike existing time-of-arrival techniques, PinPoint does not require an infrastructure of accurate clocks (e.g., GPS) nor does it incur the o(n2) message exchanges of "echoing" techniques. PinPoint can work with nodes having inexpensive crystal oscillator clocks, and incurs a constant number of message exchanges per node to determine the location of $n$ nodes. Each node's clock is assumed to run reliably but asynchronously with respect to the other nodes, i.e., they can run at slightly different rates because of hardware (oscillator) inaccuracies. PinPoint provides a mathematical way to compensate for these clock differences in order to arrive at a very precise timestamp recovery that in turn leads to a precise distance determination. Moreover, each node is able to determine the clock characteristics of other nodes in its neighborhood allowing network synchronization. We present a prototype implementation for PinPoint and discusses the practical issues in implementing the mathematical framework and how PinPoint handles the different sources of error affecting its accuracy. Evaluation of the prototype in typical indoor and outdoor environments shows that PinPoint gives an average accuracy of four to six feet, in different environments, allowing PinPoint to support accurate rapidly deployable localization scenarios.
