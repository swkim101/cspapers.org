The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical discussion about the two main paths of the project “The visibility of disadvantaged women’s ordinary life within the mediascape” (CNPq/2010). They are: a) the connections between class and gender positions and b) the unique features of identity studies vis-a-vis studies on media reception and consumption. The interest in discussing these issues here lies in the fact that they are understood in many different ways and, as a consequence, the positions taken in this study should be clarified. Regarding the first path, the aim is to realize the relative influence of each position – gender and class – as a means of analyzing forms of inequality. Regarding the second path, we assume that there are three different approaches – reception studies, consumption studies and identity studies – which have distinct objectives and, therefore, are distinct, although the methodological strategies can converge. Finally, we want to set this research in the field of studies of media practices, in an attempt to take the focus away from representation analysis, also from discrete relationships between subjects and the media involved in reception studies, as well as in media consumption studies.
