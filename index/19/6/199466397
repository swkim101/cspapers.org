In the past few years, semi-supervised node classification in attributed network has been developed rapidly. Inspired by the success of deep learning, researchers adopt the convolutional neural network to develop the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and they have achieved surprising classification accuracy by considering the topological information and employing the fully connected network (FCN). However, the given network topology may also induce a performance degradation if it is directly employed in classification, because it may possess high sparsity and certain noises. Besides, the lack of learnable filters in GCN also limits the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Topology Optimization based Graph Convolutional Networks (TO-GCN) to fully utilize the potential information by jointly refining the network topology and learning the parameters of the FCN. According to our derivations, TO-GCN is more flexible than GCN, in which the filters are fixed and only the classifier can be updated during the learning process. Extensive experiments on real attributed networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TO-GCN against the state-of-the-art approaches.
