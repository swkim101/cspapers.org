Disconnected graphs are very common in the real world. However, most existing methods for graph similarity focus on connected graph. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for measuring the similarity of disconnected graphs. By embedding connected subgraphs with graph kernel, we obtain the feature vectors in low dimensional space. Then, we match the subgraphs and weigh the similarity of matched subgraphs. Finally, an intuitive example shows the feasibility of the method.
