This paper presents an analysis of the influence of the science news embargo system on the journalistic cover of two major Brazilian daily newspapers, O Globo and Folha de S. Paulo. The embargo system allows journalists to receive in advance information on scientific papers not published yet based on the reasoning that this would help them to make a better coverage. In this study we show a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of news produced under the embargo system of the scientific journals Science and Nature during five months of 2012. In contrast to the embargo stated goal, our results suggest that this system does not necessarily provide a good coverage of science, but, instead, leads to a journalist coverage highly influenced by the scientific journals, presenting a consensual view, without controversies and with low plurality of voices.
