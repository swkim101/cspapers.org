It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd ACM Workshop on Secure Web Services (SWS'06). This workshop, which continues the tradition of the XML Security workshop series, is now a premier forum for presenting research results and experience reports on all research issues related to security, privacy and trust in Web Service architectures, including models, systems, applications, and theory.Web services are now widely recognized as the standard means of implementing complex business processes, supporting interoperability between diverse software applications. Several specifications for Web services security have been proposed in the last few years, including major aspects of trust negotiation and privacy, access control policy languages and data protection via point-to-point encryption. The richness and diversity of this palette is due to the fact that security is always a balance of assessed risk and effort required by countermeasures; Web service architectures require different security mechanisms, depending upon the underlying infrastructure as well as on the degree and nature of threat or risk.The mission of the SWS series of workshops is sharing novel ideas and solutions for making security and privacy first class citizens in Web Service architecture design and implementation.This year's call for papers attracted 26 submissions from all over the world. The program committee accepted 11 full papers that cover a variety of topics, including the next generation privacy and access control models, relationships with business process modeling, engineering techniques for secure message exchange and multimedia support. In addition, the program includes a panel on 'Directions and Trends of XML and Web Service Security'. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
