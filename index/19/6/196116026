This article is a reflection on the status of Holocaust 
testimonies within the context of a culture of 
consumption, focusing on an analysis Steven 
Spielberg’s original Survivors of the Shoah, Visual 
History Foundation project, currently based at the 
University of South California, and duly renamed the 
USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and 
Education. The argument presented here is that even 
the memory of and testimonies about the Holocaust 
can be aestheticized and absorbed by the cultural 
goods market in a sanitized and consoling format fit 
for consumption by a potentially massive audience. 
Despite his good intentions – if they are, indeed, 
good – Steven Spielberg emerges as a debatable media 
“authority” on the Holocaust, shaping the western 
imaginary about the memory of that genocide through 
his Foundation and the prior success of the film 
Schindler’s List (1993).
