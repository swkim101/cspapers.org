A careful analysis of the critical literature on digital culture indicates that the word “cyberculture” has been facing a steady decline in the last few years. Charged with meanings and a history that probably no longer correspond to the current state of technological culture, the word seems to have lost its appeal, both in the sphere of “popular” representations as well as in the domain of academic appraisals. As a substitutive for the term “cyberculture”, “media studies” arises not so much as a label for a new academic discipline than as a field of research demarcated by three major theoretical axes: materialities, medialities and temporalities.
