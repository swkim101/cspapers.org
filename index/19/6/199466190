In this paper, we investigate the structural similarities within a finite Markov decision process (MDP).Â We view a finite MDP as a heterogeneous directed bipartite graph and propose novel measures for state similarity and action similarity in a mutual reinforcement manner. We prove that the state similarity is a metric and the action similarity is a pseudometric. We also establish the connection between the proposed similarity measures and the optimal values of the MDP. Extensive experiments show that the proposed measures are effective.
