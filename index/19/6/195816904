This paper presents a game with a purpose for the construction of a Portuguese lexical-semantic network. The network creation is implicit, as players collaboratively create links between words while they have fun. We describe the principles and implementation of the platform. As this is an ongoing project, we discuss challenges and long-term goals.We present the current network in terms a quantitative and qualitative analysis, comparing it to other resources. Finally, we describe our target applications.
