The object of the present article is to propose a new reading approach of the relationship that exists between the ideas of the social psychologist George Herbert Mead and the sociologist Erving Goffman. For such, this work attempts, first off, to present the problems in each author - the construction of self and the order of interaction, respectively - to, later, point out a certain complementarity between their perspectives. Finally, there are some clues as to how this revision of the sociological approach, based on the centrality of social interaction, allows us to complexify the discussion of communicative processes and human agency.
