The cyborg/posthuman topic has had a continuous presence in the cyberculture discussions. The discussion's summit generally debouches in the Imaginary of body and mind's disembodiment and the transcendence wish. We conjecture that the emphasis in the disembodiment branches from Imaginary's speculation about the computational theory of mind. According to this theory, there is not a substantial difference between physical existence and computational simulation. Aiming to remonstrate the disembodiment thesis, the article brings to the discussion the complex system theory. Founded in the working of the complex systems, the article presents the following hypothesis: the complex system theory is a research channel able to sustain the discussion in the field of embodiment, offering an alternative to the thesis of disembodiment.
