Based on the static analysis of the original inertial point theory, this paper analysed the existence of the inertial point with double slab motion differential equations on the elastic half-space foundation under the moving load. At the same time, the effect laws of the vehicle speed, the pavement slab thickness, the Poisson’s ratio, the density and the moving load size on the inertial point of the flexible pavement on the elastic half-space foundation under the moving load were analysed. The result showed that there was the inertial point to the flexible pavement structure on the elastic half-space foundation under the moving load. And the vehicle speed and the pavement slab thickness had great impact on the inertial point. But the pavement Poisson’s ratio, density and the moving load size had minor or negligible impact on the inertial point. The analysis result of the inertial point existence under the moving load provided a basis for the pavement structure parameters back-calculation research of the i...
