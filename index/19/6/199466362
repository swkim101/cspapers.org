With the development and adoption of the electricity information tracking system in China, real-time electricity consumption big data have become available to enable artificial intelligence (AI) to help power companies and the urban management departments to make demand side management decisions. We demonstrate the Power Intelligent Decision Support (PIDS) platform, which can generate Orderly Power Utilization (OPU) decision recommendations and perform Demand Response (DR) implementation management based on a short-term load forecasting model. It can also provide different users with query and application functions to facilitate explainable decision support.
