We consider the challenging problem of inferring a hidden moving scene from faint shadows cast on a diffuse surface. Recent work in passive non-line-of-sight (NLoS) imaging has shown that the presence of occluding objects in between the scene and the diffuse surface significantly improves the conditioning of the problem. However, that work assumes that the shape of the occluder is known a priori. In this paper, we relax this often impractical assumption, extending the range of applications for passive occluder-based NLoS imaging systems. We formulate the task of jointly recovering the unknown scene and unknown occluder as a blind deconvolution problem, for which we propose a simple but effective two-step algorithm. At the first step, the algorithm exploits motion in the scene in order to obtain an estimate of the occluder. In particular, it exploits the fact that motion in realistic scenes is typically sparse. The second step is more standard: using regularization, we deconvolve by the occluder estimate to solve for the hidden scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with simulations and experiments in a variety of settings.
