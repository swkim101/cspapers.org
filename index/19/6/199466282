Recently, person re-identification (re-ID) has attracted increasing research attention, which has broad application prospects in video surveillance and beyond. To this end, most existing methods highly relied on well-aligned pedestrian images and hand-engineered part-based model on the coarsest feature map. In this paper, to lighten the restriction of such fixed and coarse input alignment, an end-to-end part power set model with multi-scale features is proposed, which captures the discriminative parts of pedestrians from global to local, and from coarse to fine, enabling part-based scale-free person re-ID. In particular, we first factorize the visual appearance by enumerating $k$-combinations for all $k$ of $n$ body parts to exploit rich global and partial information to learn discriminative feature maps. Then, a combination ranking module is introduced to guide the model training with all combinations of body parts, which alternates between ranking combinations and estimating an appearance model. To enable scale-free input, we further exploit the pyramid architecture of deep networks to construct multi-scale feature maps with a feasible amount of extra cost in term of memory and time. Extensive experiments on the mainstream evaluation datasets, including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, validate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
