Representations of motion that are story-based constitute a promising tool to categorise the motion of entities, because they can be generated using any qualitative spatial representation, and they consider explicitly the speed of the entities. Up to the present, mainly categorisation properties of the story-based representations have been presented. In this paper we show how story-based representations allow for the reasoning operations that the qualitative calculi possess, namely, inverse and compositionâ€”We provide a method to compute the inverse, and a method that notably simplifies the computation of the composition.
