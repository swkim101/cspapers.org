Spammer detection in social media has recently received increasing attention due to the rocketing growth of user-generated data. Despite the empirical success of existing systems, spammers may continuously evolve over time to impersonate normal users while new types of spammers may also emerge to combat with the current detection system, leading to the fact that a built system will gradually lose its efficacy in spotting spammers. To address this issue, grounded on the contextual bandit model, we present a novel system for conducting interactive spammer detection. We demonstrate our system by showcasing the interactive learning process, which allows the detection model to keep optimizing its detection strategy through incorporating the feedback information from human experts.
