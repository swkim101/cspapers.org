For such, firstly it considers some important aspects of Western sexual life, particularly what contributes for homophobic actions and speeches. Secondly, it critically observes the journalistic process of construction of realities. Articulating both, are the journalistic ways of saying, pressed by moral rules of silence and traditional and contemporary uses of linguistic forms. It does not consider any specific case analysis, but attempts to indicate some theoretical and methodological aspects for other studies on journalism and homophobia.
