We study the complexity of several manipulation and control problems for six prevalent approval based multiwinner voting rules. We show that these rules generally resist the proposed strategic types. In addition, we also give fixed-parameter tractability results for these problems with respect to several natural parameters and derive polynomial-time algorithms for certain special cases.
