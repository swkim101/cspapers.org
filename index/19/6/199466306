Many real-world domains can be expressed as graphs and, more generally, as multi-relational knowledge graphs. Though reasoning and learning with knowledge graphs has traditionally been addressed by symbolic approaches such as Statistical relational learning, recent methods in (deep) representation learning have shown promising results for specialised tasks such as knowledge base completion. These approaches, also known as distributional, abandon the traditional symbolic paradigm by replacing symbols with vectors in Euclidean space. With few exceptions, symbolic and distributional approaches are explored in different communities and little is known about their respective strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we compare distributional and symbolic relational learning approaches on various standard relational classification and knowledge base completion tasks. Furthermore, we analyse the properties of the datasets and relate them to the performance of the methods in the comparison. The results reveal possible indicators that could help in choosing one approach over the other for particular knowledge graphs.
