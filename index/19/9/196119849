This paper discusses a number of erotic horror movies in Brazil between the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s that were starred by monster women, reversing one of the basic structures of those movies, which was the representation of men always as stronger and more threatening than women. The objective is to demonstrate that the films had some discussion on the position of women in cinema and society, showing capacity for reflection and self-criticism that is not always considered in the analysis of that cinematography.
