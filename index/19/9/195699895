The paper is concerned with the qualitative representation of spatiotemporal relations. We initially propose a multiresolution framework for the representation of relations among 1D intervals, based on a binary string encoding. We subsequently extend this framework to multiple dimensions, thus allowing the description of spatiotemporal relations at various contexts. The feasible relations at a particular resolution level are inherently permeated by a poset structure, called conceptual neighbourhood , upon which we propose efficient relation inferencing mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the application of our model to spatiotemporal reasoning, which refers to the classic problems of satisfiability and deductive closure of a set of spatiotemporal assertions.
