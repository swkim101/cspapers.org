This paper proposes a mechanically hopping 1U CubeSat-scale payload for lunar exploration. The high energy density of a mechanical compression spring-based locomotion system makes it very attractive for extra-terrestrial operations, especially in lower gravity and thinner atmospheres. The main aim is to record images and perform surface mapping from novel vantage points using on-board algorithms. We demonstrate prototypes of the locomotion and vision systems in terrestrial surrogate environments. We envision similar systems playing a crucial role in supporting the operation of ground-based lunar explorers, such as, mapping, (beyond-horizon) path planning and navigation.
