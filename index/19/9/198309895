The paper tries to evaluate the future of the democracy in the cyberculture, taking on account the introduced transformations from interactive distributed communication’s networks to the society’s government. The virtual communities and peer-to-peer are the post-modern State’s main agents of governability troubles. The leading ground hypothesis is that interactive distributed communication’s networks settled in the Internet create an opposition between information and communication expressing the conflict between immaterial communicational labor and the private information’s property. This conflict will be managed by the communication’s interface through the relationship between the different building code models and the different social evaluation and qualification practices that is allowed by its devices. It did a great difference in the way as the public consume and experiences itself in the actual society. Meanwhile in the mass market he is the Bells` curve middle man harassed by the blockbuster products; in the Internet he is the power law’s activist exploring the niche markets` long tail.
