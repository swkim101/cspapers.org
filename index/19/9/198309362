Among the different types of media production, journalism products – which establish an apparent link with truth – hold an outstanding power, social insertion and acceptance. From a broad concern with Brazilian corporate media agenda (FONTES, 2008), this communication focuses on a case study: a front page piece of “news” from Jornal do Brasil (15 may 2007) informing that drug dealers were using Orkut – a social networking web site – to promote and show off criminal activities. Nevertheless, the following day, “it was found out” that, in fact, the teenagers who appeared on the photographs were actors participating in the production of a police film. Far from being an isolated episode, the case is typical and helps to illuminate some aspects related to production routines and editorial lines of corporate media, such as the fact that the newspaper did not admit at all that it had lied. This paper also approaches the ethic and political implications of certain postures adopted by such journalism.
