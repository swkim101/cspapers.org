We consider the problem of feasible coordination control for multiple homogeneous or heterogeneous mobile vehicles subject to various constraints (nonholonomic motion constraints, holonomic coordination constraints, equality/inequality constraints etc). We develop a general framework involving differential-algebraic equations and viability theory to describe and determine coordination feasibility for a coordinated motion control under heterogeneous vehicle dynamics and various constraints. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for generating feasible trajectories for each individual vehicle. We show several application examples and simulation experiments on multi-vehicle coordination under various constraints to validate the theory and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and control schemes.
