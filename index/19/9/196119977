Using theories of work and consumption, the paper 
analyzes the advertising campaign by the Nextel 
brand’s telephone services. The paper discusses 
meanings of narratives constructed by the human 
subjects who protagonize the ads, presenting life 
histories that are unusual in relation to ordinary 
expectations as identifying characteristics of 
Nextel’s symbolic universe. In these narratives, an 
emphasis is placed on work, as a sphere that can 
bring challenges, failure, alienation, and success, 
as well as self-affirmation. Reflections about the 
spectacularization and aestheticization of intimacy, 
via the mediatization of narratives of the self, serve 
as a basis for understanding the role of productive 
activities in tying human subjects to imagined 
communities via advertising language.
