In this article, I argue that studies of media production should use grounded case studies in order to evaluate and reformulate classic social theories of production in light of the new spirit of capitalism. To wit, I present fieldwork with reality television casting personnel in which casters fail to achieve their industrial production goals. In this case, instances of failure may illustrate how the social concept of alienation is lived through processes of television production.
