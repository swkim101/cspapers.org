This work aims to identify stigma in hearing-impaired peopleâ€™s blogs. The fact that there are hearing-impaired people as authors of blogs justifies the reasearch on the concept of stigma (GOFFMAN, 1988) and the checking of its incidence on such network. Concerning methodology, netnography is used for identifying, selecting and obtaining data from the selected blogs. This study has observed low occurrence of stigma in posts and in comments.
