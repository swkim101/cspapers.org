From the perspective of Organizational Communication, aims to reflect on the tension that materializes in collaborative processes, particularly those that are characterized by, through the use of organizational blogs, giving visibility to knowledge/informations from different employees in the ambit of their organizations, as well as on appropriations that these same organizations do what is exposed. In this sense, it's possible to think of processes that enhance knowledge through collaboration of different subjects, but also in processes of surveillance and control processes over such subject. Attentive to the fact that organizations, as a place of realization of the subjects, these same processes, constitute, on the one hand, as a possibility for qualified exposure of these subjects, generating recognition / pleasure, and, on the other hand, the disqualified exposure, causing suffering (DEJOURS, 1996; 1999). In this study, from de Paradigm of Complexity, the organizational communication is understood as “process of construction and dispute of senses within the scope of organizational relationships” (AUTOR, 2014).
