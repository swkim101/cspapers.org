We showcase a model to generate a soundscape from a camera stream in real time. The approach relies on a training video with an associated meaningful audio track; a granular synthesizer generates a novel sound by randomly sampling and mixing audio data from such video, favoring timestamps whose frame is similar to the current camera frame; the semantic similarity between frames is computed by a pretrained neural network. The demo is interactive: a user points a mobile phone to different objects and hears how the generated sound changes.
