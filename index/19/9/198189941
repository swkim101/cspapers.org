The state of the art in automated conversational agents for enterprise (e.g. for customer support) require a lengthy design process with experts in the loop who have to figure out and specify complex conversation patterns. This demonstration looks at a prototype interface that aims to bring down the expertise required to design such agents as well as the time taken to do so. Specifically, we will focus on how a metawriter can assist the domain-writer during the design process and how complex conversation patterns can be derived from simplifying abstractions at the interface level.
