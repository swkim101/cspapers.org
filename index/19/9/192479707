Light field cameras are considered to have many potential applications since angular and spatial information is captured simultaneously. However, the limited spatial resolution has brought lots of difficulties in developing related applications and becomes the main bottleneck of light field cameras. In this paper, a learning-based method using residual convolutional networks is proposed to reconstruct light fields with higher spatial resolution. The view images in one light field are first grouped into different image stacks with consistent sub-pixel offsets and fed into different network branches to implicitly learn inherent corresponding relations. The residual information in different spatial directions is then calculated from each branch and further integrated to supplement high-frequency details for the view image. Finally, a flexible solution is proposed to super-resolve entire light field images with various angular resolutions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in both visual and numerical evaluations. Furthermore, the proposed method shows good performances in preserving the inherent epipolar property in light field images.
