Hashing can compress heterogeneous high-dimensional data into compact binary codes while preserving the similarity to facilitate efficient retrieval and storage, and thus hashing has recently received much attention from information retrieval researchers. Most of the existing hashing methods first predefine a fixed length (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 bit) for the hash codes before learning them with this fixed length. However, one sample can be represented by various hash codes with different lengths, and thus there must be some associations and relationships among these different hash codes because they represent the same sample. Therefore, harnessing these relationships will boost the performance of hashing methods. Inspired by this possibility, in this study, we propose a new model jointly multiple hash learning (JMH), which can learn hash codes with multiple lengths simultaneously. In the proposed JMH method, three types of information are used for hash learning, which come from hash codes with different lengths, the original features of the samples and label. In contrast to the existing hashing methods, JMH can learn hash codes with different lengths in one step. Users can select appropriate hash codes for their retrieval tasks according to the requirements in terms of accuracy and complexity. To the best of our knowledge, JMH is one of the first attempts to learn multi-length hash codes simultaneously. In addition, in the proposed model, discrete and closed-form solutions for variables can be obtained by cyclic coordinate descent, thereby making the proposed model much faster during training. Extensive experiments were performed based on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method.
