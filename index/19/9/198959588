Recently, systems that generate source code from bitmap renderings of graphical user interfaces have started to be developed (Beltramelli, 2017). Here we experiment with a new approach that is able to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of elements displayed in the graphical layout. As a case study, we take bitmap snapshots of HTML pages and infer from those the document object model (DOM), which can be then converted straightforwardly to HTML.
