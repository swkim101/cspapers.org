Visual surveillance through closed circuit television (CCTV) can help to prevent crime. In this paper, we propose an automatic visual surveillance network (AVS-Net), which simultaneously performs image processing and object detection to determine the dangers of situations captured by CCTV. In addition, we add a relation module to infer the relationships of the objects in the images. Experimental results show that the relation module greatly improves classification accuracy, even if there is not enough information.
