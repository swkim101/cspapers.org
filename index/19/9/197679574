In recent years, scene parsing has captured increasing attention in computer vision. Previous works have demonstrated promising performance in this task. However, they mainly utilize holistic features, whilst neglecting the rich semantic knowledge and inter-object relationships in the scene. In addition, these methods usually require a large number of pixel-level annotations, which is too expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Embedded Generative Adversarial Networks, dubbed as KE-GAN, to tackle the challenging problem in a semi-supervised fashion. KE-GAN captures semantic consistencies of different categories by devising a Knowledge Graph from the large-scale text corpus. In addition to readily-available unlabeled data, we generate synthetic images to unveil rich structural information underlying the images. Moreover, a pyramid architecture is incorporated into the discriminator to acquire multi-scale contextual information for better parsing results. Extensive experimental results on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that KE-GAN is capable of improving semantic consistencies and learning better representations for scene parsing, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance.
