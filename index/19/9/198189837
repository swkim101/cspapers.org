In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task learning approach for Answer Selection (MTAS), motivated by the fact that humans have no difficulty performing such task because they possess capabilities of multiple domains (tasks). Specifically, MTAS consists of two key components: (i) A category classification model that learns rich category-aware document representation; (ii) An answer selection model that provides the matching scores of question-answer pairs. These two tasks work on a shared document encoding layer, and they cooperate to learn a high-quality answer selection system. In addition, a multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to learn important information from different representation subspaces at different positions. We manually annotate the first Chinese question answering dataset in law domain (denoted as LawQA) to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results show that our model MTAS consistently outperforms the compared methods.1
