This article discusses the academic and journalistic production about the 1994 Soccer World Cup. Basing on the notion of authorized speeches, developed by Guedes (2010/2011) and inspired by Bourdieu (1983), we study the discourse constructed about this event on eight encyclopedias and books about World Cups, Jornal do Brasil (JB) newspaper and the special commemorative editions of Epoca and Placar magazines. The academic production analyzed was collected from the annals of conferences, articles published on academic journals and chapters of books. We observed that the authorized discourse lacks reflection and is led by common sense while the academic discourse lacks variety of themes, theoretical references and authors. The academic works dealt mainly on the hermeneutics of defeat, the question of national identity, the advertising and the presence of radio.
