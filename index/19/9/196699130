Regularization is a fundamental technique to solve an ill-posed optimization problem robustly and is essential to reconstruct compressive hyperspectral images. Various hand-crafted priors have been employed as a regularizer but are often insufficient to handle the wide variety of spectra of natural hyperspectral images, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. Moreover, the prior-regularized optimization requires manual tweaking of its weight parameters to achieve a balance between the spatial and spectral fidelity of result images. In this paper, we present a novel hyperspectral image reconstruction algorithm that substitutes the traditional hand-crafted prior with a data-driven prior, based on an optimization-inspired network. Our method consists of two main parts: First, we learn a novel data-driven prior that regularizes the optimization problem with a goal to boost the spatial-spectral fidelity. Our data-driven prior learns both local coherence and dynamic characteristics of natural hyperspectral images. Second, we combine our regularizer with an optimization-inspired network to overcome the heavy computation problem in the traditional iterative optimization methods. We learn the complete parameters in the network through end-to-end training, enabling robust performance with high accuracy. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments validate the superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.
