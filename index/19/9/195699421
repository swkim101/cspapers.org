Difficulty in collecting and annotating large-scale video data raises a growing interest in learning models which can recognize novel classes with only a few training examples. In this paper, we propose the Ordered Temporal Alignment Module (OTAM), a novel few-shot learning framework that can learn to classify a previously unseen video. While most previous work neglects long-term temporal ordering information, our proposed model explicitly leverages the temporal ordering information in video data through ordered temporal alignment. This leads to strong data-efficiency for few-shot learning. In concrete, our proposed pipeline learns a deep distance measurement of the query video with respect to novel class proxies over its alignment path. We adopt an episode-based training scheme and directly optimize the few-shot learning objective. We evaluate OTAM on two challenging real-world datasets, Kinetics and Something-Something-V2, and show that our model leads to significant improvement of few-shot video classification over a wide range of competitive baselines and outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin.
