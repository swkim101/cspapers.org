In the life-cycles of intelligent robots there are two knowledge-based systems of maximal relevance: the intelligent robot system and the engineering system. The intelligent robot uses knowledge in the performance of its tasks and in its relations with other agents. The engineering system is the human-centric, tool-intensive system that produces the robot system. This system uses the knowledge to build, operate, maintain and evolve the robot system. Both systems are obviously causally related but the coupling at the knowledge level is of special interest. In this talk I will address the nature and roles of this knowledge in an MBSE life-cycle context and how ontologies are the cornerstones for all this process.
