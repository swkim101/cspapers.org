The goal of this paper is to propose a critical analysis of the central role played by the increasingly powerful economic determinations of the culture industry throughout the 20th century in the formation of subjectivities and intersubjective practices, with emphasis on the question of musical tastes. It is a historical approach, inspired by the well-known critical theory of Adorno and Horkheimer, that defends its actual relevance but also accuses its limits, comparing it with some Hobsbawnâ€™s reflections on music. It also considers the new horizons recently opened for the world of music by new communication technologies, with caution.
