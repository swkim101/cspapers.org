This article also develops a typology of different journalistic uses of time, according to which functions are pragmatic, historiographical and cosmological, of measuring and mediation time. The research analyzes hundreds of copies of three newspapers with more than one hundred years in Rio de Janeiro, composing a panorama of 180 years.
