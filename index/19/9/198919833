Recently, deep learning based image Compressed Sensing (CS) methods have been proposed and demonstrated superior reconstruction quality with low computational complexity. However, the existing deep learning based image CS methods need to train different models for different sampling ratios, which increases the complexity of the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose a scalable convolutional neural network (dubbed SCSNet) to achieve scalable sampling and scalable reconstruction with only one model. Specifically, SCSNet provides both coarse and fine granular scalability. For coarse granular scalability, SCSNet is designed as a single sampling matrix plus a hierarchical reconstruction network that contains a base layer plus multiple enhancement layers. The base layer provides the basic reconstruction quality, while the enhancement layers reference the lower reconstruction layers and gradually improve the reconstruction quality. For fine granular scalability, SCSNet achieves sampling and reconstruction at any sampling ratio by using a greedy method to select the measurement bases. Compared with the existing deep learning based image CS methods, SCSNet achieves scalable sampling and quality scalable reconstruction at any sampling ratio with only one model. Experimental results demonstrate that SCSNet has the state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a comparable running speed with the existing deep learning based image CS methods.
