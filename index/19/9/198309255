Starting with an analysis of the usefulness of 
the concept of global cinema in the context of 
contemporary cinema, and utilizing a cosmopolitan 
perspective, this paper reflects over what it means to 
conceive of the world, how it can be shown, who can 
speak about it and how it is configured as an aesthetic 
challenge. Thus, the experience of globalization 
becomes everyday; memory, affect are translated, 
interpreted, not only as a theme but as a structural 
element, within a multidirectional network, as in 
the discussions raised by Negri and Hardt, under 
the aegis of Empire, deconstructing categories such 
as First/Third world and, by extension, the theory of 
Third Cinema. In developing these issues, the paper 
analyzes Wim Wendersâ€™ Until the End of the World 
(1991) and The World (Jia Zhang-ke, 2004), relating 
them to other films and emphasizing the construction 
of space and characters.
