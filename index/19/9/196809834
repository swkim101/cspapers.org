This paper tries to accelerate data recovery in a large-scale storage system with minimal interference to foreground traffic. By investigating I/O and failure traces from a real-world largescale storage system, we find that because of the scale of the system and the imbalanced and dynamic foreground traffic, no existing recovery protocols can generate a high-quality recovery strategy in a short time. To address this problem, this paper proposes Dayu, a timeslot-based recovery protocol, which only schedules a subset of tasks which are expected to finish in one timeslot: this approach reduces the computation overhead and naturally can cope with the dynamic foreground traffic. In each timeslot, Dayu incorporates four key algorithms, which enhance existing solutions with heuristics motivated by our trace analysis. Our evaluations in a 1,000-node real cluster and in a 25,000node simulation both confirm that Dayu can outperform existing recovery protocols, achieving high speed and high quality.
