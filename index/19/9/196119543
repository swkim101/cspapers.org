Rescuing some issues worked in the information model of Shannon and Weaver (1948), plus the extensions of Umberto Eco and Paolo Fabbri in the two models following communication, the model semiotic-information (1978) and model semiotic-textual (1979), this article aims to discuss the relationship between the concept of code and the circumstances of communication, understood here as those elements participants of a given concrete situation which assist in understanding between sender and recipient, directly interfering in the process of (re) signification of the messages. Far from producing a transmission of information from unequivocal meaning, the heterogeneity of factors involved in the communication process brings afloat complex interpretative games that compete in the update of a particular signification. The survey shows, as its main objective, to make a bibliographic review of the major works regarding the subject proposal, contributing to the expansion of the field of media in the relationship established with its various languages.
