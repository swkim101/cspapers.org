The presented research demonstrates the synthesis of two-dimensional kinematic mechanisms using feature-based reinforcement learning. As a running example the classic challenge of designing a straight-line mechanism is adopted: a mechanism capable of tracing a straight line as part of its trajectory. This paper presents a basic framework, consisting of elements such as mechanism representations, kinematic simulations and learning algorithms, as well as some of the resulting mechanisms and a comparison to prior art. Series of successful mechanisms have been synthesized for path generation of a straight line and figure-eight.
