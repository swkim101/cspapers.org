Abstract: This essay intends to argue about communication and city from notions of proximity and distance. Usually, it is granted to new technologies of communication the primacy for domain virtual space, as well as to the architecture domains the construction of the concrete spaces of materiliaty. Without a doubt, the technical ways of communication bring out a crisis into spacial matrix since they reorganize the percepction of distance, however, we believe that production of subjective can not be apart from a virtual thought process that recreates the meaning of the space itself. As a result, we have to consider that forms of inhabiting may not be reduced to the measurament of the concrete space, but depends on languages that produce the visibility of real. 
Key-words: space, language, inhabiting.
