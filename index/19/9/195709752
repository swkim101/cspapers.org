In this paper we describe our experience in the design and teaching of a new evolutionary introductory programming course in a new Distributed Computing and Communications Systems Technology program at the University of Guelph-Humber. This course is evolutionary and innovative because it integrates the use of HTML, JavaScript, and Java in a one-semester introductory computer programming course. This is a marked departure from the use of a single conventional, general purpose, programming language such as Java or C++. The course is designed with two goals in mind: to improve the students experience in their first computer programming; and to achieve retention in the new program.
