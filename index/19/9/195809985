In image co-saliency detection problem, one critical issue is how to model the concurrent pattern of the co-salient parts, which appears both within each image and across all the relevant images. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical image co-saliency detection framework as a coarse to fine strategy to capture this pattern. We first propose a mask-guided fully convolutional network structure to generate the initial co-saliency detection result. The mask is used for background removal and it is learned from the high-level feature response maps of the pre-trained VGG-net output. We next propose a multi-scale label smoothing model to further refine the detection result. The proposed model jointly optimizes the label smoothness of pixels and superpixels. Experiment results on three popular image co-saliency detection benchmark datasets including iCoseg, MSRC and Cosal2015 demonstrate the remarkable performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
