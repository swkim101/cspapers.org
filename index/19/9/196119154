This paper intends to analyze the various ways of appropriation of the play Romeo and Juliet (1595-1596), by William Shakespeare, into Brazilian cinema. These movies, either with the appropriation of one or more scenes, or with the construction of the narrative from the plot of the play, put the Shakespearean text in a permanent sense tension between the context and the genres in which they are created. In this sense, we seek to investigate the way these movies re-create the story of Romeo and Juliet, emphasizing how each one tries to develop new ways to express the Shakespearean theme, by the dialogue with popular comedy, musical and urban drama in Brazil.
