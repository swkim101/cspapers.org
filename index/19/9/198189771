We propose endurance sports as a rich and novel domain for recommender systems and machine learning research. As sports like marathon running, triathlons, and mountain biking become more and more popular among recreational athletes, there exists a growing opportunity to develop solutions to a number of interesting prediction, classification, and recommendation challenges, to better support the complex training and competition needs of athletes. Such solutions have the potential to improve the health and well-being of large populations of users, by promoting and optimising exercise as part of a productive and healthy lifestyle.
