The paper is about the possibilities of developing a management system and quality assessment for news organizations. It analyzes problems such as lack of objective methods for measuring the characteristics of products and the lack of consensus about the values and desirable requirements. It highlights the challenges: building reliable methods to obtain consensual values and the generation of innovation to products and processes that arise from the taken evaluations. It defines the concept of quality and proposes two basic requirements, truth and relevance. It concludes with the presentation of a preliminary proposal of system quality management in three parts: a) commitments and organizational structure; b) production processes; and c) products.
