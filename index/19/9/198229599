We consider multi-agent transport task problems where, e.g. in a factory setting, items have to be delivered from a given start to a goal pose while the delivering robots need to avoid collisions with each other on the floor.We introduce a Task Conflict-Based Search (TCBS) Algorithm to solve the combined delivery task allocation and multiagent path planning problem optimally. The problem is known to be NP-hard and the optimal solver cannot scale. However, we introduce it as a baseline to evaluate the sub-optimality of other approaches. We show experimental results that compare our solver with different sub-optimal ones in terms of regret.
