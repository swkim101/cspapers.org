Multi-networks integration methods have achieved prominent performance on many network-based tasks, but these approaches often incur information loss problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-networks representation learning method based on semi-supervised autoencoder, termed as DeepMNE, which captures complex topological structures of each network and takes the correlation among multinetworks into account. The experimental results on two realworld datasets indicate that DeepMNE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
