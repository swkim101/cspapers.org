A new type of malicious crowdsourcing (a.k.a., crowdturﬁng) clients, mobile apps with hidden crowdturﬁng user interface (UI), is increasingly being utilized by miscreants to coordinate crowdturﬁng workers and publish mobile-based crowdturﬁng tasks (e.g., app ranking manipulation) even on the strictly controlled Apple App Store. These apps hide their crowdturﬁng content behind innocent-looking UIs to bypass app vetting and inﬁltrate the app store. To the best of our knowledge, little has been done so far to understand this new abusive service, in terms of its scope, impact and techniques, not to mention any effort to identify such stealthy crowdturﬁng apps on a large scale, particularly on the Apple platform. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst measurement study on iOS apps with hidden crowdturﬁng UIs. Our ﬁndings bring to light the mobile-based crowdturﬁng ecosystem (e.g., app promotion for worker recruitment, campaign identiﬁcation) and the un-derground developer’s tricks (e.g., scheme, logic bomb) for evading app vetting.
