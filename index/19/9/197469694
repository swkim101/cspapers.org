This article is devoted to constructing equations of motion for Holonomic systems 
 
 using Lagrangian variables. We introduce the form of equations which allow 
 
 for detailed analyses of both linear and non-linear terms of perturbed motion 
 
 equations. Steady motion stability of systems with redundant coordinates is only 
 
 possible in critical cases; e.g. when the characteristic equation has roots whose 
 
 real parts are zero. In this case, it is imperative to analyze the nonlinear terms of 
 
 the characteristic equation to solve stability issues. We suggest a rigorous method 
 
 of solving stability problem for systems with geometric constraints. The method 
 
 is based on analytical mechanics, theory of critical cases, nonlinear stability 
 
 theory, and N.N. Krasovskyâ€™s procedure of solving linear-quadratic problems. This 
 
 grants the ability to make reasonable conclusions regarding system stability and 
 
 calculations and calculate coefficients of the linear stabilizing control
