Discriminative region responses residing inside an object instance can be extracted from networks trained with image-level label supervision. However, learning the full extent of pixel-level instance response in a weakly supervised manner remains unexplored. In this work, we tackle this challenging problem by using a novel instance extent filling approach. We first design a process to selectively collect pseudo supervision from noisy segment proposals obtained with previously published techniques. The pseudo supervision is used to learn a differentiable filling module that predicts a class-agnostic activation map for each instance given the image and an incomplete region response. We refer to the above maps as Instance Activation Maps (IAMs), which provide a fine-grained instance-level representation and allow instance masks to be extracted by lightweight CRF. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC12 dataset show that our approach beats the state-of-the-art weakly supervised instance segmentation methods by a significant margin and increases the inference speed by an order of magnitude. Our method also generalizes well across domains and to unseen object categories. Without fine-tuning for the specific tasks, our model trained on VOC12 dataset (20 classes) obtains top performance for weakly supervised object localization on the CUB dataset (200 classes) and achieves competitive results on three widely used salient object detection benchmarks.
