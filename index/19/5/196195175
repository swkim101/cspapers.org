This paper introduces the first fine-grained modular tool for automatic summarization. Open source and written in Java, it is designed to be as straightforward as possible for end-users. Its modular architecture is meant to ease its maintenance and the development and integration of new modules. We hope that it will ease the work of researchers in automatic summarization by providing a reliable baseline for future works as well as an easy way to evaluate methods on different corpora.
