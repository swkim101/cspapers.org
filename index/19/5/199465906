Sound event detection is intended to analyze and recognize the sound events in audio streams and it has widespread applications in real life. Recently, deep neural networks such as convolutional recurrent neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performance in this task. However, the previous methods were designed and implemented on devices with rich computing resources, and there are few applications on mobile devices. This paper focuses on the solution on the mobile platform for sound event detection. The architecture of the solution includes offline training and online detection. During offline training process, multi model-based distillation method is used to compress model to enable real-time detection. The online detection process includes acquisition of sensor data, processing of audio signals, and detecting and recording of sound events. Finally, we implement an application on the mobile device that can detect sound events in near real time.
