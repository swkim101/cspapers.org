We present a simple combination of A* and IDA*, which we call A*+IDA*. It runs A* until memory is almost exhausted, then runs IDA* below each frontier node without duplicate checking. It is widely believed that this algorithm is called MREC, but MREC is just IDA* with a transposition table. A*+IDA* is the first algorithm to run significantly faster than IDA* on the 24-Puzzle, by a factor of almost 5. A complex algorithm called dual search was reported to significantly outperform IDA* on the 24-Puzzle, but the original version does not. We made improvements to dual search and our version combined with A*+IDA* outperforms IDA* by a factor of 6.7 on the 24-Puzzle. Our disk-based A*+IDA* shows further improvement on several hard 24-Puzzle instances. We also found optimal solutions to a subset of random 27 and 29-Puzzle problems. A*+IDA* does not outperform IDA* on Rubikâ€™s Cube, for reasons we explain.
