So here's some advice, worth what you paid for it: When you deploy a new security tool, throw one away. If the new one is particularly invasive, then throw two away. Do what you can to drive your mean time to repair (MTTR) toward zero-the more powerful your security tools, the more collateral damage when they collide and the faster your recovery must be to avoid availability failures. Self/not-self decisions have never been harder, but there's always the cloud.
