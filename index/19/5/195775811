This paper proposes an optimal control system design for an Acrobot who has a single actuator at the elbow and no actuator at the shoulder; the system is underactuated because we desire to control two links of the Acrobot with only a single system input. The Acrobot is an unstable robot useful as a testbed for studying the theory and application of nonlinear control. The proposed control system consists of inverse linear quadratic (ILQ)design method. The numerical simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control system.
