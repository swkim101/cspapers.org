Vehicle detection and recognition in remote sensing images are challenging, especially when only limited training data are available to accommodate various target categories. In this paper, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine framework, which decomposes vehicle detection into segmentation-based vehicle localization and generalized zero-shot vehicle classification. Particularly, the proposed framework can well handle the problem of generalized zero-shot vehicle detection, which is challenging due to the requirement of recognizing vehicles that are even unseen during training. Specifically, a hierarchical DeepLab v3 model is proposed in the framework, which fully exploits fine-grained features to locate the target on a pixel-wise level, then recognizes vehicles in a coarse-grained manner. Additionally, the hierarchical DeepLab v3 model is beneficially compatible to combine the generalized zero-shot recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publically available dataset to test comparative methods, we therefore construct a new dataset to fill this gap of evaluation. The experimental results show that the proposed framework yields promising results on the imperative yet difficult task of zero-shot vehicle detection and recognition.
