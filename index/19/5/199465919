In this paper, we study the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem under the (distributed) non-interactive local differential privacy model. For the low dimensional case, we show the optimal rate for the private minimax risk of the k-dimensional PCA using the squared subspace distance as the measurement. For the high dimensional row sparse case, we first give a lower bound on the private minimax risk, . Then we provide an efficient algorithm to achieve a near optimal upper bound. Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets confirm the theoretical guarantees of our algorithms.
