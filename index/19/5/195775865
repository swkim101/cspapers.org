This paper deals with the problem of observer-based controller design for a class of descriptor linear systems. A new approach is proposed to solve this problem. It based on separation the dynamic relations of the static relations in the descriptor linear system. The main result of this paper consists in showing that the observer-based controller design for a class of descriptor linear systems can be obtained by using a controller law and observer structure based on differential equation only. The stability condition is established with Lyapunov theory in order to guarantee the convergence of the augmented system. To obtain the gains of the observer and controller we use the Young relation to establish a linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, to illustrate the proposed approach, a simple RLC circuit is considered.
