Sequential recommendation is a task that learns a temporal dynamic of a user behavior in sequential data and predicts items that a user would like afterward. However, diversity has been rarely emphasized in the context of sequential recommendation. Sequential and diverse recommendation must learn temporal preference on diverse items as well as on general items. Thus, we propose a sequential and diverse recommendation model that predicts a ranked list containing general items and also diverse items without compromising significant accuracy.To learn temporal preference on diverse items as well as on general items, we cluster and relocate consumed long tail items to make a pseudo ground truth for diverse items and learn the preference on long tail using recurrent neural network, which enables us to directly learn a ranking function. Extensive online and offline experiments deployed on a commercial platform demonstrate that our models significantly increase diversity while preserving accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model, and consequently our models improve user satisfaction.
