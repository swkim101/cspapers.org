Learning representations of medical concepts from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) has been shown effective for predictive analytics in healthcare. Incorporation of medical ontologies has also been explored to further enhance the accuracy and to ensure better alignment with the known medical knowledge. Most of the existing work assumes that medical concepts under the same ontological category should share similar representations, which however does not always hold. In particular, the categorizations in medical ontologies were established with various factors being considered. Medical concepts even under the same ontological category may not follow similar occurrence patterns in the EHR data, leading to contradicting objectives for the representation learning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model called MMORE which alleviates this conflicting objective issue by allowing multiple representations to be inferred for each ontological category via an attention mechanism. We apply MMORE to diagnosis prediction and our experimental results show that the representations obtained by MMORE can achieve better predictive accuracy and result in clinically meaningful sub-categorization of the existing ontological categories.
