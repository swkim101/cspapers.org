This paper discusses the possibilities of reading urban space from common people's communicative interaction downtown, city of Belo Horizonte. For this study, we tried to understand the subject's action on the city's time-space as communicative interaction. By acting over the places, on daily life, a subject attributes meaning to space, transforming its sense or just updating its current meaning. The research data used as base on this study, was collected as cartographic drifts, a strategy of enquiring urban spaces inspired by situationists' leeway.
