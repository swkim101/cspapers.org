Planning for complex scenarios, particularly in which large teams of humans with distributed expertise and varying preferences share a set of resources, poses a number of challenges including integrating distributed information and accounting for context-dependent preferences and constraints. We see three key pieces to solving the problem of introducing autonomous assistance through a mixed-initiative planning system in these scenarios: preference elicitation, integrating preferences into planning, and providing tailored explanations back to the humans in the loop. The process of preference elicitation, planning, and explanation can be integrated as an iterative process by which teams can efficiently converge on the ideal schedule. Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a common language, readily understandable by both planners and humans, that provides a natural link between the three components of the iterative planning problem, facilitating both elicitation of expressive preferences and intelligible explanations of the system's decision-making processes. Outputs of each of the preference elicitation, planning, and explanation pieces can be expressed as LTL specifications and used as inputs to each next step in the process. We propose to explore preference elicitation, planning, and explanation using LTL specifications and the integration of these pieces into an iterative process.
