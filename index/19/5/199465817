This paper demonstrates an opinion indicator (OI) generation system, named Crowd View, with which traders can refer to the fine-grained opinions, beyond the market sentiment (bullish/bearish), from crowd investors when trading financial instruments. We collect the real-time textual information from Twitter, and convert it into five kinds of OIs, including the support price level, resistance price level, price target, buy-side cost, and sell-side cost. The OIs for all component stocks in Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI) are provided, and shown with the real-time stock price for comparison and analysis. The information embedding in the OIs and the application scenarios are introduced.
