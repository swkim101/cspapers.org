Recommender systems on E-Commerce platforms track users' online behaviors and recommend relevant items according to each userâ€™s interests and needs. Bipartite graphs that capture both user/item feature and use-item interactions have been demonstrated to be highly effective for this purpose. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has been successfully applied in representation of bipartite graphs in industrial recommender systems. Providing individualized recommendation on a dynamic platform with billions of users is extremely challenging. A key observation is that the users of an online E-Commerce platform can be naturally clustered into a set of communities. We propose to cluster the users into a set of communities and make recommendations based on the information of the users in the community collectively. More specifically, embeddings are assigned to the communities and the user embedding is decomposed into two parts, each of which captures the community-level generalizations and individualized preferences respectively. The community embedding can be considered as an enhancement to the GNN methods that are inherently flat and do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a public dataset and a world-leading E-Commerce company dataset.
