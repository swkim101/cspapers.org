In this work we are considering the problem of compensation of the reactive power absorbed by a linear load from a three-phase network. For this, we proposed a three-phase active power filter based on three-phase voltage inverter to compensate the Reactive power absorbed or injected by the load, we have based on the non-linear model of the system and we developed a nonlinear control laws by the technique of Backstepping. The objective is twofold in this paper the regulation of the active power exchange between the filter and the network to track its reference value and the reactive power to compensate for that, which is absconded by the load. The theoretical results evaluated by simulation.
