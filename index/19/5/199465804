In personal context recognition many solutions rely on supervised learning that uses sensor data collected from the users' mobile devices. However, the recognition performance is significantly affected by the annotationsâ€™ quality. The problem lies in the fact that the annotator in such scenarios is usually the user herself which is not an expert and thus provides a significant amount of incorrect labels, while existing solutions can only tolerate a small fraction of mislabels. Our solution is Skeptical Learning, a framework for interactive machine learning where the machine uses all its available knowledge to check the correctness of its own and the user labeling. This allows to have a uniform confidence measure to be used when a contradiction arises that applies to both the annotator and the machine. The criteria of success is an improvement of the final recognition accuracy with respect to traditional supervised approaches.
