We investigate active learning by pairwise similarity over the leaves of trees originating from hierarchical clustering procedures. In the realizable setting, we provide a full characterization of the number of queries needed to achieve perfect reconstruction of the tree cut. In the non-realizable setting, we rely on known important-sampling procedures to obtain regret and query complexity bounds. Our algorithms come with theoretical guarantees on the statistical error and, more importantly, lend themselves to linear-time implementations in the relevant parameters of the problem. We discuss such implementations, prove running time guarantees for them, and present preliminary experiments on real-world datasets showing the compelling practical performance of our algorithms as compared to both passive learning and simple active learning baselines.
