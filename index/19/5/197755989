This text discusses the issue of consumption as important category in everyday life production. One tries to show that the means of consuming material and immaterial goods are product and producers of subjectivation flows, that they create living and being standards and may therefore lead to more (or less) solidary existence ways. In the field of ethical and solidary consumption, to discuss the matter of consumption practices is fundamental to understand the production and reproduction of social life towards more solidary ways of living. Besides a review of the literature of social sciences on consumption, we use as reference Boaventura de Sousa Santos â€™ sociology of absences and emergences. So we try to bring to debate some reflection including the issue of subjectivity.
