Allocating resources to customers in the customer service is a difficult problem, because designing an optimal strategy to achieve an optimal trade-off between available resources and customers' satisfaction is non-trivial.
In this paper, we formalize the customer routing problem, and propose a novel framework based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) to address this problem. To make it more practical, a demo is provided to show and compare different models, which visualizes all decision process, and in particular, the system shows how the optimal strategy is reached. Besides, our demo system also ships with a variety of models that users can choose based on their needs.
