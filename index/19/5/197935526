Person re-identification (reID) benefits greatly from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which learn robust feature embeddings. However, CNNs are inherently limited in modeling the large variations in person pose and scale due to their fixed geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a novel network structure, Interaction-and-Aggregation (IA), to enhance the feature representation capability of CNNs. Firstly, Spatial IA (SIA) module is introduced. It models the interdependencies between spatial features and then aggregates the correlated features corresponding to the same body parts. Unlike CNNs which extract features from fixed rectangle regions, SIA can adaptively determine the receptive fields according to the input person pose and scale. Secondly, we introduce Channel IA (CIA) module which selectively aggregates channel features to enhance the feature representation, especially for small-scale visual cues. Further, IA network can be constructed by inserting IA blocks into CNNs at any depth. We validate the effectiveness of our model for person reID by demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.
