This paper presents a robust backstepping sliding mode control (BSMC)method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT)of a photovoltaic (PV)system. The investigated PV system consists of a PV module as power source, a DC-DC boost converter and a resistive load. The proposed controller allows the PV system to operate around the estimated MPPT by adjusting the converter duty cycle. Thus, the stability of the PV system with BSMC controller is studied by Lyapunov theory, and the effectiveness of the designed control approach is exhibited by comparison to the conventional sliding mode control (SMC). For the proposed BSMC approach, the simulation results show good performances in terms of transition response, tracking error and fast response to solar irradiation variation.
