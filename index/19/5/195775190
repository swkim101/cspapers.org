This paper deals with the observer-based controller problem for a class of discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno descriptor models (DTSDMs) with measurable premise variables. The approach is based on the singular value decomposition. The convergence of the closed-loop state system is studied by using the Lyapunov theory and stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an application based on rolling disc process is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed dynamic controller design.
