Recent deep neural networks (DNN) utilize identity mappings involving either element-wise addition or channel-wise concatenation for the propagation of these identity mappings. In this paper, we propose a new propagation mechanism called channel-wise addition (cAdd) to deal with the vanishing gradients problem without sacrificing the complexity of the learned features. Unlike channel-wise concatenation, cAdd is able to eliminate the need to store feature maps thus reducing the memory requirement. The proposed cAdd mechanism can deepen and widen existing neural architectures with fewer parameters compared to channel-wise concatenation and element-wise addition. We incorporate cAdd into state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNet, WideResNet, and CondenseNet and carry out extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN and ImageNet to demonstrate that cAdd-based architectures are able to achieve much higher accuracy with fewer parameters compared to their corresponding base architectures.
