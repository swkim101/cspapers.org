This text discusses some aspects of the Brazilian Family Grant Program, related to the overcoming of socioeconomical inequalities in the confluence between the lifeworld and sistemic instances of communication society. The weekly magazine affirms that such Program is welfarist. We will examine the texts from the weekly magazine Veja (from 2005 and 2006), concerning the Program. Hence, we place our research question: how can the population make the Family Grant Program an emancipatory device throughout the creation of new sociabilities? Does the Family Grant Program tolerates – in its bureaucratic frame - the expression of multitude effects (plurilinguistic ones), which are able to create emancipatory effects over and above the income transfer (empowerment, improvement of well-being)? How to face the paradox of setting their demands in participative and sistemic ways, since the multitude effects - which come from the lifeworld – might be lost? 
Keywords: Brazilian Family Grant Program; welfarism; emancipation; communication societies; control society.
