In this paper we empirically explore the use of suction as a potential universal gripping mechanism. The context is provided by the Amazon Robotic Challenge (formerly Amazon Picking Challenge) - an international robotic competition hosted by Amazon with the intended purpose of advancing warehouse robotics. While highlighting some common misconceptions, we present practical and theoretical elements that are important in applying suction in the said context. The paper is structured in a tutorial format enabling the reader to appreciate and implement suction based gripping mechanisms in the wild. Numerous test examples are presented from the Amazon Robotic Challenge with high ï¬‚ow, high pressure and hybrid suction methods. A practical equipment selection guide is also included at the end to complement the tutorial value.
