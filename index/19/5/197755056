This paper discusses the concept of communicative contract, exploring its basis and its general outlines. It criticizes both the approaches that restrict the contract to a textual analysis and that are excessively focused on the subject, as it proposes an understanding of the notion of contract guided by the idea of communicative situation. In this track, the paper promotes a connection between the notions of contract and situated action, establishing dialogue with a sociological tradition that goes back to Tarde’s conversations, Mead’s and Dewey’s reflexivity, Goffman’s frames and Quere’s institutional contexts. The paper aims to draw attention to the fruitfulness of the concept of contract, once it is conceived through a pragmatic approach.
