Several self-healing protocols utilizing virtual paths have been proposed in the relevant literature. Those which work in a mesh topology function according to three main rerouting strategies (though specific flooding administrations differ): local rerouting, source-destination rerouting, and local-destination rerouting. Most performance studies of self-healing protocols have considered restoration time as sole performance metric. This would have to be within the 2s threshold in order to guarantee service continuity. This one-sided metric needs to be completed. In this paper, I propose an extended performance(or goodness) metric framework in order to catch more performance aspects. In addition, this analysis uses survivability functions to measure the performance of rerouting strategies.
