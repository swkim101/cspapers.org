Dynamic Scene deblurring is a challenging low-level vision task where spatially variant blur is caused by many factors, e.g., camera shake and object motion. Recent study has made significant progress. Compared with the parameter independence scheme [19] and parameter sharing scheme [33], we develop the general principle for constraining the deblurring network structure by proposing the generic and effective selective sharing scheme. Inside the subnetwork of each scale, we propose a nested skip connection structure for the nonlinear transformation modules to replace stacked convolution layers or residual blocks. Besides, we build a new large dataset of blurred/sharp image pairs towards better restoration quality. Comprehensive experimental results show that our parameter selective sharing scheme, nested skip connection structure, and the new dataset are all significant to set a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene deblurring.
