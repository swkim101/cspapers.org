Force and torque induced by the traveling motion of a mobile robot effect dynamically to the objects being carried on it. If the induced inertia force and torque should be bigger than the static friction force and torque, the carrying objects begin to slip on the mobile robot. A final purpose of this research is to construct a guidance controller that can travel as fast as possible, on a condition of preventing the slipping of the carrying objects. For this purpose, we modeled a mobile robot carrying plural objects to analyze the influences of the slipping to the traveling motion and to discuss a constraint conditions for the controller of guidance not to make the carrying objects slip.
