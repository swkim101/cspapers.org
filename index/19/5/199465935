Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is an emerging research topic whose goal is to build recognition models for previously unseen classes. The basic idea of ZSL is based on heterogeneous feature matching which learns a compatibility function between image and class features using seen classes. The function is constructed based on one-vs-all training in which each class has only one class feature and many image features. Existing ZSL works mostly treat all image features equivalently. However, in this paper we argue that it is more reasonable to use some representative cross-domain data instead of all. Motivated by this idea, we propose a novel approach, termed as Landmark Selection(LAST) for ZSL. LAST is able to identify representative cross-domain features which further lead to better image-class compatibility function. Experiments on several ZSL datasets including ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of LAST to the state-of-the-arts.
