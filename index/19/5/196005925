In this paper we are proposing the analysis of what we are calling the “photographic uses” by both users and producers in the digital-midiatic environment on the Web. We sought the technical elements that are mobilized in this digital environment and that are made of what we are calling digital photography panels on the Internet, which principal characteristic is the constitution of visual experiences funded on visual frames generated by the relation between individuals, programs and devices. These framing compositions of (digital) infographic nature are mainly visual (they may use text, audio and video) involving diverse contents related to everyday life. We focus, empirically, on the UOL Fotoblog case and the visual frames generated in the environment of this UOL service program.
