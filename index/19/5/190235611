As a vital approach to determine the structure of biomacromolecules, high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D reconstruction is extremely compute-intensive, and has gradually migrated to GPU accelerators in recent years. With certain kernels already achieving high speedup and efficiency on GPUs, the reconstruction part, which inherently requires accesses of a large 3D model in different orientations, brings tough challenges to GPU architectures and has no effective GPU-based options. To fill the above gap, in this paper, we propose Stream3D, a novel GPU-based parallel design for cryo-EM 3D reconstruction. Our major idea is to reorganize the related problem space as streams of key-value pairs, so that we can achieve both the flexibility and efficiency to compute and accumulate the contribution to the final 3D model from all different 2D image inputs. In addition, we design a hybrid communication mechanism to reduce intra-node communications and enable the solving process on a larger scale. With the addition of our GPU-based reconstruction design, we are able to improve the performance of the reconstruction part itself by 9.50 times, and the performance of the entire processing part (the reconstruction part and the other parts with mature GPU options) by 2.83 times. Moreover, Stream3D enables using the approach at a large scale, with 65.32-fold speedup when using up to 80 GPUs.
