Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with manifold embedding have achieved considerable attention in computer vision. However, prior arts are usually based on the neighborhood-based graph modeling only the pairwise relationship between two samples, which fail to fully capture intra-class variations and thus suffer from severe performance loss for noisy data. While such intra-class variations can be well captured via sophisticated hypergraph structure, we are motivated and lead a hypergraph induced Convolutional Manifold Network (H-CMN) to significantly improve the representation capacity of DCNN for the complex data. Specifically, two innovative designs are provides: 1) our manifold preserving method is implemented based on a mini-batch, which can be efficiently plugged into the existing DCNN training pipelines and be scalable for large datasets; 2) a robust hypergraph is built for each mini-batch, which not only offers a strong robustness against typical noise, but also captures the variances from multiple features. Extensive experiments on the image classification task on large benchmarking datasets demonstrate that our model achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art
