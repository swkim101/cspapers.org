Context identification is one of the key challenges in Ubicomp. An application example is providing contextual information to caregivers of person with dementia to identify assistance needs. Environmental audio provides significant and representative information of the context and the challenge is to automatically identify audio cues coming from overlapping sound sources without sophisticated microphone arrangements. My thesis proposes a succinct representation of the audio, based on the spectral entropy of the signal, and we show experimentally its robustness to source overlap and noise. This would permit ubiquitous applications that perform sound-based activity identification directly in mobile phones.
