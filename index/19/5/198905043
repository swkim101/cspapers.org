Delicate feature representation about object parts plays a critical role in fine-grained recognition. For example, experts can even distinguish fine-grained objects relying only on object parts according to professional knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel "Destruction and Construction Learning" (DCL) method to enhance the difficulty of fine-grained recognition and exercise the classification model to acquire expert knowledge. Besides the standard classification backbone network, another "destruction and construction" stream is introduced to carefully "destruct" and then "reconstruct" the input image, for learning discriminative regions and features. More specifically, for "destruction", we first partition the input image into local regions and then shuffle them by a Region Confusion Mechanism (RCM). To correctly recognize these destructed images, the classification network has to pay more attention to discriminative regions for spotting the differences. To compensate the noises introduced by RCM, an adversarial loss, which distinguishes original images from destructed ones, is applied to reject noisy patterns introduced by RCM. For "construction", a region alignment network, which tries to restore the original spatial layout of local regions, is followed to model the semantic correlation among local regions. By jointly training with parameter sharing, our proposed DCL injects more discriminative local details to the classification network. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard benchmarks. Moreover, our proposed method does not need any external knowledge during training, and there is no computation overhead at inference time except the standard classification network feed-forwarding.
