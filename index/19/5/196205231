Properly benchmarking a system is a difficult and intricate task. Even a seemingly innocuous mistake can compromise the guarantees provided by a systems security defense and threaten reproducibility and comparability. Moreover, as many modern defenses trade security for performance, the damage caused by benchmarking mistakes is increasingly worrying. To analyze the magnitude of the phenomenon, we identify 22 benchmarking flaws that threaten the validity of systems security evaluations, and survey 50 defense papers published in top venues. We show that benchmarking flaws are widespread even in papers published at tier-1 venues; tier-1 papers contain an average of five benchmarking flaws and we find only a single paper in our sample without any benchmarking flaws. Moreover, the scale of the problem appears constant over time, suggesting that the community is not yet taking sufficient countermeasures. This threatens the scientific process, which relies on reproducibility and comparability to ensure that published research advances the state of the art. We hope to raise awareness and provide recommendations for improving benchmarking quality and safeguard the scientific process in our community.
