This paper aims to make a reflection, through bibliographic research and theoretical analysis, about the possibilities of comprehension and apprehension of the complexities of the organizations from paradigmatic points of view which propose simultaneously distinct and complementary conceptions. By the one hand, the complexity paradigm developed by Edgar Morin, which shows the exhaustion of the old paradigm, known as the simplicity paradigm. On the other hand, the systemic-communicational approach from Niklas Luhmann, which changes the focus to the difference relation that happens between organizational systems and the environment, breaks up with the tradition of the whole and of the part.
