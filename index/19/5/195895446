A container is provided including a pair of hingedly connected housing halves swingable between first side-by-side open positions wherein the housing halves open outwardly in the same direction and second closed positions wherein the housing halves are swung together and open into each other. One of the housing halves includes an interior anchor portion with which the hooked end of a line attached fishhook may be engaged and a remote closing edge of one of the housing halves has an outwardly opening recess formed therein for receiving the end of a fishing line attached to the fishhook, the outer end of the recess being closed by the other housing half when the housing halves are in their closed positions. Coacting latch structure is carried by the housing halves for securing the latter in their closed positions and the marginal portions of the housing halves remote from the aforementioned notch include anchor tabs having keyhole-shaped recesses formed in edge portions thereof for snap-anchoring engagement with an associated fishing rod line eye.
