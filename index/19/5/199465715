We create an intention mining system, named AntProphet, for Alipay's intelligent customer service bot, to alleviate the burden of customer service. Whenever users have any questions, AntProphet is the first stop to help users to answer their questions. Our system gathers users' profile and their historical behavioral trajectories, together with contextual information to predict users' intention, i.e., the potential questions that users want to resolve. AntProphet takes care of more than 90% of the customer service demands in the Alipay APP and resolves most of the users' problems on the spot, thus significantly reduces the burden of manpower. With the help of it, the overall satisfaction rate of our customer service bot exceeds 85%.
