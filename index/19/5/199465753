Because of the intrinsic complexity in computation, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an essential and challenging topic in computer vision research and applications. The existing methods for 3D reconstruction often produce holes, distortions and obscure parts in the reconstructed 3D models, or can only reconstruct voxelized 3D models for simple isolated objects. So they are not adequate for real usage. From 2014, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is widely used in generating unreal dataset and semi-supervised learning. So the focus of this paper is to achieve high quality 3D reconstruction performance by adopting GAN principle. We propose a novel semi-supervised 3D reconstruction framework, namely SS-3D-GAN, which can iteratively improve any raw 3D reconstruction models by training the GAN models to converge. This new model only takes real-time 2D observation images as the weak supervision, and doesn't rely on prior knowledge of shape models or any referenced observations. Finally, through the qualitative and quantitative experiments & analysis, this new method shows compelling advantages over the current state-of-the-art methods on Tanks & Temples reconstruction benchmark dataset.
