Node classification is an important problem in relational machine learning. However, in scenarios where graph edges represent interactions among the entities (e.g., over time), the majority of current methods either summarize the interaction information into link weights or aggregate the links to produce a static graph. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that jointly captures both temporal and static interaction patterns, which we call Temporal-Static-Graph-Net (TSGNet). Our key insight is that leveraging both a static neighbor encoder, which can learn aggregate neighbor patterns, and a graph neural network-based recurrent unit, which can capture complex interaction patterns, improve the performance of node classification. In our experiments on node classification tasks, TSGNet produces significant gains compared to state-of-the-art methodsâ€”reducing classification error up to 24% and an average of 10% compared to the best competitor on four real-world networks and one synthetic dataset.
