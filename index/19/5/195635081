This article discusses the uses of communication digital technology in new forms of social mobilization by artists. The main point to be presented is a phenomenon started in the beginning of the 90’s: the artistic and activist appropriation of communication online networks combined to old media and to other presential resources in order to touch and to amplify political actions and to engage collectively a great amount of people in aid of social issues. Such actions indicate at the same time the redefinition of the concepts of art and of politics - making them quite different from the ones of the early europeen avant-gards and of high modernism of the 60’s – and the practices of political resistance in contemporary culture.
