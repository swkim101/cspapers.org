In this paper, we define Jump Point Graphs (JP), a preprocessing-based path-planning technique similar to Subgoal Graphs (SG). JP allows for the first time the combination of Jump Point Search style pruning in the context of abstraction-based speedup techniques, such as Contraction Hierarchies. We compare JP with SG and its variants and report new state-of-the-art results for grid-based pathfinding.
