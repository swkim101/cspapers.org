Political debates are the means used by political
candidates to put forward and justify their positions
in front of the electors with respect to the issues at
stake. Argument mining is a novel research area
in Artificial Intelligence, aiming at analyzing discourse on the pragmatics level and applying a certain argumentation theory to model and automatically analyze textual data. In this paper, we present
DISPUTool, a tool designed to ease the work of historians and social science scholars in analyzing the
argumentative content of political speeches. More
precisely, DISPUTool allows to explore and automatically identify argumentative components over
the 39 political debates from the last 50 years of
US presidential campaigns (1960-2016).Â
