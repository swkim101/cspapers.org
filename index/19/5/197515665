This essay discusses the conditions in which technical rationality constitutes a composite with mediatic society for the constitution of a normalized subject. To underpin the discussion, relationships are established between construction devices of the subject and devices of three types of discourse, to wit, the modern masterâ€™s discourse, the university discourse and the competent discourse. Subject and discourse are considered conceptually within 
the context of Lacanian theory, with discourse understood as the social bond from which the subject builds himself and upon which he projects himself. Technical rationality is considered an ideology of domination, in the terms developed by Marcuse, Habermas, Weber and Heidegger.
