In the cold rolling process, the web winding system (WWS) of reversible cold rolling mill, as a high precision mechanical-electrical system, plays an important role in the stable operation of rolling. The non-linear model of the WWS is characterized by a relatively strong coupling relationship between the winder tension, the main mill velocity and the unwinder tension, multiple variables, time varying parameters, model uncertainties and external disturbances. The main concern is to control the WWS velocity and tensions despite disturbances such as radius temporal variations and the winder and unwinder rotational inertia. In order to improve the overall performance of the training system, we propose to apply an adaptive backstepping Control strategy with unknown parameters for the WWS command. Our WWS control is simulated in the Matlab/Simulink environment, using actual data from a 1422 mm reversible cold rolling mill. The results obtained illustrate the efficiency of the proposed control without exceeding. The rise time is improved with good interference rejection.
