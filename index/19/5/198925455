When disagreements arise in hierarchical relationships, relationship members sometimes prefer conflict management strategies that avoid or quickly end the overt conflict even if the relationship is left in a state of dissatisfaction. Our lab has proposed that a peripheral robotic agent may be able to support these types of relationships during conflict. In this paper, we present the results of an IRB-approved human-robot interaction study that examines how the members of a hierarchical relationship involved in conflict respond to the presence of an unengaged robot. This study serves as a baseline for additional studies. The unengaged robot appears to have a minimal influence on the interaction. The observed conflicts followed the patterns typically described in mediation literature. Our lab previously proposed a computational model to identify weakness and alienation in these relationships. We discuss a partial implementation of this model, and its ability to recognize problems in certain relationships within the data collected. Based on our observations, and the performance of the modelâ€™s partial implementation, we suggest considerations that need to be made for an intervening robotic agent.
