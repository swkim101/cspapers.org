This paper proposes a computing methodology in order to provide the validity intervals of an Interval Fuzzy Petri Net model. IFPN is a tool which allows to integrate into a Petri Net different kinds of parameter as the time, the weight, the position, etc.â€¢ Fuzzy IF-THEN rules will be described and an algorithm for decomposition of IFCPN into set of linguistic descriptions will be presented. The Designs of experiments are used to exploit the manual controlled data production in order to compute the valid behaviour ranges. For illustrate the interest of the proposed modelling and analysis an example of batching system for mixing is presented at the end,. These data are integrated into the IFCPN model. Then, a valid setting is computed.
