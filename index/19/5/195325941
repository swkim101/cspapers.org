Web browsers have become one of the most commonly used applications for desktop and mobile users. Despite recent advances in network speeds and several techniques to speed up web page loading such as speculative loading, smart caching, and multi-threading, browsers still suffer from relatively long page load time (PLT). As web applications are receiving widespread attention owing to their cross-platform support and comparatively straightforward development process, they need to have higher performance to compete with native applications. Recent studies have investigated the bottleneck of the modern web browser's performance and conclude that network connection is not the browser's bottleneck anymore. Even though there is still no consensus on this claim, no subsequent analysis has been conducted to inspect which parts of the browser's computation contribute to the performance overhead. In this paper, we apply comprehensive and quantitative what-if analysis on the web browser's page loading process. Unlike conventional profiling methods, we applycausal profiling to precisely determine the impact of each computation stage such as HTML parsing and Layout on PLT. For this purpose, we develop COZ+, a high-performance causal profiler capable of analyzing large software systems such as the Chromium browser. COZ+ highlights the most influential spots for further optimization, which can be leveraged by browser developers and/or website designers. For instance, COZ+ shows that optimizing JavaScript by 40% is expected to improve the Chromium desktop browser's page loading performance by more than 8.5% under typical network conditions.
