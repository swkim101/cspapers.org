Bioimage Informatics is a growing area that aims to extract biological knowledge from microscope images of biomedical samples automatically. Its mission is vastly challenging, however, due to the complexity of diverse imaging modalities and big scales of multi-dimensional images. One major challenge is automatic image segmentation, an essential step towards high-level modeling and analysis. While progresses in deep learning have brought the goal of automation much closer to reality, creating training data for producing powerful neural networks is often laborious. To provide a shortcut for this costly step, we propose a novel two-stage generative model for simulating voxel level training data based on a specially designed objective function of preserving foreground labels. Using segmenting neurons from LM (Light Microscopy) image stacks as a testing example, we showed that segmentation networks trained by our synthetic data were able to produce satisfactory results. Unlike other simulation methods available in the field, our method can be easily extended to many other applications because it does not involve sophisticated cell models and imaging mechanisms.
