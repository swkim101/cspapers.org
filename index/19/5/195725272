In this paper we present a Simple Encoder for Fieldbus applications. The Simple Encoder is tailored to support the special kind of data transfer in a Fieldbus. The encoding rules have been simplified to such an extent that only required information between peers are exchanged, so that the coding/decoding process does not cause any significant delay during real time operation of the network. The PDUs obtained are upto 55% shorter than PDUs of Basic Encoding Rules, BER, and the Simple Encoder is upto four times faster than BER encoder.
