In this paper we investigate the socioeconomic and cultural context that allowed the beginning of the recording industry in Brazil in the early twentieth century, from the foundation of the store and the record label Casa Edison to the building of the record factory Odeon (1900-1930). Based on the analysis of the literature on the process of modernization of Brazil during the First Republic and the music market in Rio de Janeiro at the time, we try to understand how this cultural industry was related to the local musical events. It is believed that this sort of analysis can provide important data to rethink the relationship between peripheral modernization and the markets of cultural goods in Brazil.
