The Third Workshop on Social Network Systems (SNS'10) will gather researchers to discuss novel ideas about computer systems and social networks. Online social networks are among the most popular sites on the Web and continue to grow rapidly. They provide mechanisms to establish identities, share information, and create relationships. The resulting social graph provides a basis for communicating and distributing and locating content.
