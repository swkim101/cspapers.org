Clinical evaluation of frailty in the elderly is the 
first step to decide the degree of assistance they require. This 
evaluation is usually performed once and for all by filling 
standard forms with macro-information about standing and 
walking abilities. Advances in robotics make it possible to 
turn a standard assistance device into an augmented device. 
The existing tests could then be enriched by a new set of 
daily measured criteria derived from the daily use of standard 
assistance devices. This paper surveys existing Smart Walker 
to figure out whether they can be used for gait monitoring 
and frailty evaluation, focusing on the user-system interaction. 
Biomechanical gait analysis methods are presented and compared 
to robotics system designs, to highlight their convergences 
and differences. On the one hand, monitoring devices try to 
estimate accurately biomechanical features, whereas, on the 
other hand, walking assistance and fall prevention do not 
systematically rely on an accurate human model and prefer 
heuristics on the user-robot state.
