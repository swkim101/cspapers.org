This paper deals with the design of a new active fault-tolerant trajectory tracking controller (FTTTC)for current dynamics model of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)subject to unknown inputs and noise measurement. First, the generator current dynamics model is established, a reference model is introduced for the goal of fault-tolerant trajectory tracking control. Second, a proportional integral observer is used to estimate the system state, the unknown inputs and to compensate the effect of the occurred faults based on the online estimation of faults. Further, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by applying Lyapunov theory. And also, new sufficient conditions are proposed for ensuring the best tracking between the reference model states and the faulty system ones. These conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)which can be conveniently solved using the YALMIP toolbox with SeDuMi solver. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme is highlighted throughout simulation results under different type faults involving a typical doubly-fed induction generator.
