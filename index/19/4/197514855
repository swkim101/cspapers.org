This article develops a discussion about the nature of stereotypes in media iconographic imagery, in order to show the way they interact with the deepest layers of the imaginary, especially with archetypes and myths. The classification is made through the Regime of the Visual, proposed by Regis Debray and the theories of the imaginary by Gilbert Durand, showing that stereotype is the uppermost point in the process of symbolic impoverishment. Such impoverishment happens through the demystification of myths that have originally an oppositionist and liberating role in societies. Finally, the Durandian mythic criticism method is used to analyze four media images that remain vivid in the collective memory. The conclusion was that in their core, they refer to important myths for the psychosocial balance, which were degraded by the media establishment, which resulted in the stereotypification of images that derive from the archetypes of the femininity, the fall, the trickster and the hero.
