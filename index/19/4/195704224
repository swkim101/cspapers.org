RECAL, a Recursion by Chain Algorithm for computing the mean performance measures of product-form multiple-chain closed queueing networks, is presented. It is based on a new recursive expression which relates the normalization constant of a network with r closed routing chains to those of a set of networks having (r-l) chains. It relies on the artifice of breaking down each chain into constituent sub-chains that each have a population of one. The time and space requirements of the algorithm are shown to be polynomial in the number of chains. When the network contains many routing chains the proposed algorithm is substantially more efficient than the convolution or mean value analysis algorithms. The algorithm therefore extends the range of queueing networks which can be analyzed efficiently by exact means. A numerical example is given.
