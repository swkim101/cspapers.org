This paper presents a control design for the irrigation station by sprinkling. The proposed method is applied in order to solve the problem of managing water sources and distributions systems. The main contribution is focused primarily on conceiving T-S fuzzy model for the irrigation station. In formalism of the fuzzy-coalescence algorithm, we derive sufficient conditions to determine the model parameters. Meanwhile, additional effort is developed to achieve PI control for the irrigation station model.
