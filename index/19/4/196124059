This article aims to present and discuss an integrated analysis of television products, focusing on different dimensions of the communicative process: production, product and reception. We search to evidence the interlocutions among them from a methodological approach that articulates: a) content analysis and television gender analysis and b) a media product reception analysis in discussion groups. In order to test our methodological proposal we empirically employ it in a dramaturgical television gender study focusing on the subject positions (HALL, 2000) about inhabitants of Brazilian slum quarters constructed by media narratives. The three analytical dimensions have been used to understand the ways these inhabitants are presented and the place occupied by slum quarters in those narratives. Furthermore we also investigate the interpretations produced by slum quarterâ€™s inhabitants concerning the television series Cidade dos Homens (Rede Globo, 2002) through discussion groups carried out in two Brazilian cities: Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.
