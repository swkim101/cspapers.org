This paper aims at deepening and updating the concepts developped by North-American writer Hakim Bey in TAZ: Temporary Autonomous Zone, through using Gilles Deleuze’s and Felix Guattari’s Rhizome and War Machine metaphors, together with other developments, and also based on the work by authors such as Michel Foucault, Zygmunt Bauman and Howard Rheingold. Thus, we suggest locating the TAZ building process under the cyberculture sphere, more specifically in the collaborative systems which use the wiki platform, also proposing to contextualize the network cartography and the surveillance gadgets inside these projects.
