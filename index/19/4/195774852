Over the past several years, a growing interest in UAV's has been shown, since they are widely used for military as well as civilians applications. Quadrotors are a type of VTOL systems. They are capable of hover, forward flight and vertical takeoff landing, as a drawback, the nonlinear, underactuated dynamic system and the high energy consumption can be mentioned. This work introduces a new concept of quadrotors modeling by developing a nonlinear dynamic model that takes in consideration the energy limitation, then apply a set of linear commands in a real time simulation in order to choose the most adequate for a real application.
