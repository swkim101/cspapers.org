Users of wireless networks, require mostly speed and strength when it comes to connectivity. However, the increasing number of devices, diversity of traffic, and the density of networks, makes it difficult to maintain a reliable and efficient connection. Hence, the need for High Efficiency WLAN, often referred to as IEEE 802.llax. Unlike the previous standards, that improved the physical layer data rate, IEEE 802.llax aims to increase the medium access control layer speed by maximizing the capacity, thanks to a better use of the spectrum. In our paper, we offer a thorough evaluation of the performance by means of simulation, taking into account various characteristics. We prove that our analytical model offers remarkably good results and a satisfying performance.
