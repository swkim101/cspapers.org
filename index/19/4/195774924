This paper presents a stockout deterministic prediction method based on the use of a single level model of the supply chain. The warehouse has both open orders to be shipped as well as replenishment orders which can change the net inventory quantity at any given instance. The aim is to correctly predict possible stockouts based on the information we already have in a given time horizon, with point estimates.
