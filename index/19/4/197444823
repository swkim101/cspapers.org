For the three phase power electronic and drive applications, vector control or the synchronous reference frame (SRF) based control concept is well accepted and settled amongst the research communities. Although the SRF concept has gained popularity and appreciation in developing the three phase controllers, still the concept has not reached the same level in case of a single phase system. The work presented in this paper is mainly concerned to the design of a hybrid Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic based controller for a single phase stand-alone photo-voltaic (PV) power system. The adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controller proposed in this paper is chiefly meant for improving the transient and steady state responses; for minimizing the distorting effect of the low order load current harmonics encountered particularly in case of switching the drive based inductive loads and to help maintain the inverter output voltage constant under different loading circumstances. The result obtained through simulation work, shows the effectiveness of the proposed controller as compared with the previously established research works.
