According to economic-technical optimization objective of distribution network to which distributed generation is added, a multi-objective model is proposed in this paper. The model contains DG construction investment and operation fee, network loss, reliability, as well as environmental factor. and then puts forward the multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QSPO) algorithm, and the distributed power supply after installation position and capacity for the comprehensive planning research. The result proves that QPSO has advantages of speedy searching for the optimum and keeping the population diversity. Compared to Particle Swarms Optimization (PSO), QSPO shows high efficiency and robustness.
