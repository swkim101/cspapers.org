Software must be well developed and maintainable to adapt to the constantly changing requirement of the competitive world. Many costly software issues exist due to poorly designed systems and due to systems, which are not easy to maintain. R. C. Martin began with a set of object-oriented design principles and designed his metrics based on these principles. This paper developed a multivariate linear model ‘Maintainability Estimation Model’, which estimates the maintainability in terms of its self-descriptiveness, simplicity and modularity. We present an experimental study to validate metrics by showing their relationship to simplicity and modularity. Then we construct prediction models for these tree external quality attributes.
