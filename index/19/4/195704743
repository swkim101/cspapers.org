The optimization problem discussed in this paper is the translation of an SQL query into an efficient parallel execution plan for a multiprocessor database machine under the performance goal of reduced response times as well as increased throughput in a multiuser environment. We describe and justify the most important research problems which have to be solved to achieve this task, and we explain our approach to solve these problems.
