Dialogue summarization extracts useful information from a dialogue. It helps people quickly capture the highlights of a dialogue without going through long and sometimes twisted utterances. For customer service, it saves human resources currently required to write dialogue summaries. A main challenge of dialogue summarization is to design a mechanism to ensure the logic, integrity, and correctness of the summaries. In this paper, we introduce auxiliary key point sequences to solve this problem. A key point sequence describes the logic of the summary. In our training procedure, a key point sequence acts as an auxiliary label. It helps the model learn the logic of the summary. In the prediction procedure, our model predicts the key point sequence first and then uses it to guide the prediction of the summary. Along with the auxiliary key point sequence, we propose a novel Leader-Writer network. The Leader net predicts the key point sequence, and the Writer net predicts the summary based on the decoded key point sequence. The Leader net ensures the summary is logical and integral. The Writer net focuses on generating fluent sentences. We test our model on customer service scenarios. The results show that our model outperforms other models not only on BLEU and ROUGE-L score but also on logic and integrity.
