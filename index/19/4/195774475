The design problem of fuzzy unknown inputs observer (FUIO) and its application to fault detection and fault tolerant control strategy for dynamic Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems described by ordinary differential or difference equations is widely investigated in the literature see e.g. [1]â€“[9]. The aim of the paper is to extend this observer design to a class of discrete-time T-S implicit systems (DTSISs) with measurable premise variables allowing the simultaneous estimation of the unknown states and unknown inputs (UIs). Indeed, an augmented fuzzy implicit model which regroups the state variables and UIs is firstly given. Based on the singular value decomposition approach, a new FUIO design in explicit structure is secondly proposed. The exponential convergence of the augmented state estimation error is established by using the Lyapunov theory and the stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an illustrative application is given to show the good performances of the proposed method.
