The purpose here is to explain the human mind as updating of the mind, according to Peirce’ ideas. We relate, firstly, results of a theoretical research developed to demonstrate that the semiosis, in the human mind, is constituted as a self-organization process; then, we will treat the pair virtual/updating and its relation with the Thirdness, one of the categories in Peirce’s phenomenology.
