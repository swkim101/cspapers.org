Runtime testing of large scale systems running in dynamic and distributed environments is a costly and a resource consuming task. With the aim of handling such runtime validation activity in a cost effective manner, we introduce in this paper a scalable test execution platform deployed on the cloud, called TEPaaS (Test Execution Platform as-a-Service). The latter offers various testing capabilities provided as services like automatic test component deployment, test execution and test evaluation. A proof-of-concept prototype is developed and deployed on the Google Cloud Platform and also evaluated through several experiments. Based on this prototype, we validate an e-health case study implemented using Web service technology and also deployed on the cloud.
