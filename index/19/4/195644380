The preface to this book sets out the author's thesis, that "computer science students tend to view performance analysis as a practical discipline ... [and] often prefer to rely on physical insight and intuition rather than formal insights." Accordingly, the author's approach is to emphasize useful methods and applications, rather than formal mathematical derivations. The background expected of students is basic operating systems, machine architecture, data structures, and elementary calculus and basic probability theory.
