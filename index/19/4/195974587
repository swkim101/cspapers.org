In this paper, a model is established to find the optimal shape, size and merging pattern of the toll plaza. The main work is how to take the aspects such as the accident prevention, throughput and cost into consideration to make the model of the toll plaza optimal. By analyzing the match of the number of tollbooths (B) and travel lanes (L) considering safety and cost, the optimal toll plaza model is established when the traffic flow is given.
