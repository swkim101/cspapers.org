In allusion to the problem of the blind zone in present intelligent video monitoring system, an intelligent video monitoring system with auditory function is proposed in this article. Specifically, the sound localization of the microphone array is firstly adopted to detecting the target direction, and then the camera is driven to turn according to the target position. The simulation result shows that such system can improve target localization and tracking accuracy and effectively reduce false report and missing report, thus to have certain application value in modern security and protection field.
