An old question, that returns to the times of Adorno, refers to the possibility of television turning out to be a space of experimentation and creativity. The Italian program Cinico TV, by Cipri and Maresco, gives a radical answer to that question. Without making any concessions to the institutional standards and industrial television, Cinico brings to the scene, in a gloomy black and white, a world that looks like the day after a nuclear hecatomb, peopled by a gallery of absurd characters, somewhat scatological, with a Sicilian and plebeian accent almost unintelligible, in a setting of ruins, dejections, and unfinished and abandoned buildings. The program is conceived as a pirate intervention into television. This article discusses the decline of Italian television and the vital answer that Cipri and Maresco give to it. Cinico TV was a demonstration that television can be something else, it can risk itself towards an audiovisual insubordination to standard tastes, an audiovisual expression of concerns not catalogued, in order to prove that there is intelligent life in the small screen.
