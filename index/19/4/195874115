Recommendation problems with large numbers of discrete items, such as products, webpages, or videos, are ubiquitous in the technology industry. Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for these recommendation problems. These models use embeddings to represent discrete items as continuous vectors, and the vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions, despite their heavy influence on the model's accuracy, are often manually selected in a heuristical manner. We present Neural Input Search (NIS), a technique for learning the optimal vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions for categorical features. The goal is to maximize prediction accuracy subject to a constraint on the total memory used by all embeddings. Moreover, we argue that the traditional Single-size Embedding (SE), which uses the same embedding dimension for all values of a feature, suffers from inefficient usage of model capacity and training data. We propose a novel type of embedding, namely Multi-size Embedding (ME), which allows the embedding dimension to vary for different values of the feature. During training we use reinforcement learning to find the optimal vocabulary size for each feature and embedding dimension for each value of the feature. Experimentation on two public recommendation datasets shows that NIS can find significantly better models with much fewer embedding parameters. We also deployed NIS in production to a real world large scale App ranking model in our company's App store, Google Play, resulting in +1.02% App Install with 30% smaller model size.
