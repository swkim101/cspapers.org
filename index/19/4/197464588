We study how emotions influence norm outcomes in decision-making contexts. Following the literature, we provide baseline Dynamic Bayesian models to capture an agent's two perspectives on a directed norm. Unlike the literature, these models are holistic in that they incorporate not only norm outcomes and emotions but also trust and goals. 
We obtain data from an empirical study involving game play with respect to the above variables. We provide a step-wise process to discover two new Dynamic Bayesian models based on maximizing log-likelihood scores with respect to the data. We compare the new models with the baseline models to discover new insights into the relevant relationships.
Our empirically supported models are thus holistic and characterize how emotions influence norm outcomes better than previous approaches.
