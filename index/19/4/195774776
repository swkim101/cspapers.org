In this work, the differential flatness property and the sliding mode controller design are proposed for a quadrotor in order to track a predefined reference trajectory despite the presence of uncertain parameters. Firstly, differential flatness is utilized to resolve the problem for trajectory generation and tracking for the quadrotor. Next, a sliding controller is combined with a flatness design to guarantee the robustness of the tracking strategy. The numerical simulations of quadrotor system are done in order to evaluate the performance of the suggested control scheme.
