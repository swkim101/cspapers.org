In this paper, we propose a novel separation principle approach for a class of discrete-time implicit systems described by Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model. The idea of the proposed approach is based on the separation between dynamic and static relations of the TS descriptor model. The convergence of the cloosed-loop state system is studied by using the Lyapunov theory. Besides, the convergence conditions are given in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). To complete our approach, we propose an illustrative example.
