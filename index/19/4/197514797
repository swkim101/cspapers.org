The paper thinks about the arguments usually presented as a justification for the appropriation of Adorno's famous text on the essay as a reference for the essays’ production. These justifications, which are usually not spelled out, are reasoned on a double reading of the text, incorporating in the same reasoning the criticism of positivism and the adoption of the essay as its antidote (to positivism, not to criticism). What I intend to demonstrate is that even Adorno's critique of science is oversized, the largest problem is not there, but in the possibility of an interpretative bias finally legitimize an aestheticizing appropriation of Adorno's remarks on the essay´s form.
