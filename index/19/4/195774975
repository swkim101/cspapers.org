Cloud computing is an evolution in the computing area that takes advantage of the falling cost of CPU's and storage, combined with the ubiquity of broadband Internet access and dramatic increase of Internet connected devices. The impact of Cloud Computing technologies adoption include new standards, architecture paradigms, security challenges and disruptive business models. Security is a top concern in choosing the right cloud service provider. Analyzing intrusion based on attack patterns and risk assessment in cloud computing has demonstrated its efficiency in reducing the number of false alarms and optimizing the IDS performances. This paper intended to present the implementation of a new architecture to quantify attacks in cloud environment based on risk assessment. With the main objective to increase the efficiency of IDS and decrease the number of alarms. Experimental results show that our approach is better to the state-of-the-art approach for intrusion detection in cloud.
