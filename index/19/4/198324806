During the past few years, different methods for optimizing the camera settings and post-processing techniques to improve the subjective quality of consumer photos have been studied extensively. However, most of the research in the prior art has focused on finding the optimal method for an average user. Since there is large deviation in personal opinions and aesthetic standards, the next challenge is to find the settings and post-processing techniques that fit to the individual usersâ€™ personal taste. In this study, we aim to predict the personally perceived image quality by combining classical image feature analysis and collaboration filtering approach known from the recommendation systems. The experimental results for the proposed method show promising results. As a practical application, our work can be used for personalizing the camera settings or post-processing parameters for different users and images.
