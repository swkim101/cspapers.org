Based on statements that give clues concerning creativity and subjectivity in Brazilian theoretical studies of photography, this paper discusses the notion of the subject that is presented there, comparing it with that which is derived from contemporary theories underpinning the splintering of identity. The conclusion that subjectivism negates creativity because of its binary nature leads us to seek, along with Heidegger and Wunenburger, concepts that equate the idea of an unstable subject with that of creation. An anthropological - not epistemological - obstacle is presented by the constant which results either in “schizomorphic” or “gliscomorphic” thought, simultaneously embodied in the assertion of arrogant sovereignty over and integration divorced from technique (image). These results emphasize the need for a two-fold solution through coincidentia oppositorum that makes a third element the basis and justification for what was initially binary, restoring the possibility of demiurgy to the multipliable subject.
