This paper presents an approach of a safe control synthesis of Timed Discrete Event Systems, based on timed properties. This synthesis aims to realize a fault-tolerant control during the detection of sensor faults. To establish this synthesis, the proposed approach relies on the modularity of the manufacturing systems to avoid the combinatorial explosion recurrent to several approaches. An example of a manufacturing system illustrates our remarks.
