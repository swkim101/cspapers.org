Analyzing large-scale evolving graphs are crucial for understanding the dynamic and evolutionary nature of social networks. Most existing works focus on discovering repeated and consistent temporal patterns, however, such patterns cannot fully explain the complexity observed in dynamic networks. For example, in recommendation scenarios, users sometimes purchase products on a whim during a window shopping.Thus, in this paper, we design and implement a novel framework called BurstGraph which can capture both recurrent and consistent patterns, and especially unexpected bursty network changes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on both a simulated dataset and a world-leading E-Commerce company dataset, showing that they are able to discriminate recurrent events from extremely bursty events in terms of action propensity.
