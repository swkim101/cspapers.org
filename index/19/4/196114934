This essay aims to analyze the articulations between the soundtrack and the visual compositions in the narrative construction of the Brazilian film “Cinema, Aspirinas e Urubus”. I intend to use as a core concept of this reflection a combination of concepts related to the sonic principles of cinematic craft and also to mise-en-scene, thoroughfully reflecting about the different uses of silences and the organic employment of sounds diegetically broadcasted by a radio device. The axis of this essay is the concept of added value (CHION, 1994), which approaches the ways the soundtrack interferes in the perception of images, and vice-versa.
