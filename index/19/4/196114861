From questions about the body, the image and digital technologies, together with an analysis of interactive installations that have as main feature the transformation of the spectator in a kind of performer spectator, was identified a context marked by significant relationships in the artistic focus of experimental and new images systems that project the spectatorâ€™s body as an image of the work. This article develops a kind of update of relations made by Deleuze in his film studies, focusing interactive installations as contemporary continuities of film processes. It was noticed that the body not only experiences but also causes changes, from letting the viewer fall in system devices, especially through creative activities made possible by these systems.
