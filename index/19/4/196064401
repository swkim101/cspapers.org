Our research takes place within an image team where Image Processing (IP) experts are working on various types of IP problems (restoration, segmentation, feature extraction, ...) and on images from various origins (MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, cytology, histology, industry, ...). We are concerned with issues such as the acquisition, modelling and capitalisation of the knowledge used by those experts, with a view to help them reuse and share such knowledge. To achieve this objective, we are advocating for an interactive system that enables each IP expert to represent and memorise his/her know-how on the one hand, and to reuse the whole set of knowledge stored into the system by all experts on the other hand.
