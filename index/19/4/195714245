A new approach to the design of the computing curriculum for a Bachelor of Arts degree is described. The approach relies extensively on problem-based instruction and computer graphics to teach key concepts in computer science. The novelty arises from the magnitude and origin of the problems to be integrated into the curriculum and the breadth of the impact across the curriculum. Results from a trial course, the first experiment with the new approach, are described. The course, Tools and Techniques for Software Development, is a sophomore-level course in programming methodology. Construction of a ray-tracing system (for generating synthetic images) was the vehicle chosen for the instruction.
