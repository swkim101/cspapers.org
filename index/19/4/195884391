Welcome to the silver anniversary of the International Conference on Software Engineering! Managing the complexity of modern software systems is without question a grand challenge. It is therefore fitting that, inspired by the view of Mount Hood in Portland, Oregon, the theme for this year's meeting is: Scaling New Heights.ICSE, the premier conference for software engineering, brings together world leaders in software engineering research, practice, and education to present and discuss the most recent advances, trends, and concerns in this ever expanding and critical field. This year's Software Engineering Week, May 3 to 10, 2003, consists of the main ICSE conference and an interesting array of tutorials, workshops, and related events associated or co-located with ICSE.
