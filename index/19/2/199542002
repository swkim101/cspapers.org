In this paper, we will describe AMEvA (Automated Models of Everyday Activities), a special-purpose knowledge acquisition, interpretation, and processing system for human everyday manipulation activity that can automatically: (1) create and simulate virtual human living and working environments (such as kitchens and apartments) with a scope, extent, level of detail, physics, and close to photorealism that facilitates and promotes the natural and realistic execution of human everyday manipulation activities; (2) record human manipulation activities performed in the respective virtual reality environment as well as their effects on the environment and detect force-dynamic states and events; (3) decompose and segment the recorded activity data into meaningful motions and categorize the motions according to action models used in cognitive science; and (4) represent the interpreted activities symbolically in KNOWROB [1] using a first-order time interval logic representation.
