This work introduces a framework for the Cartesian control of multi-legged, highly redundant robots. The proposed framework allows the untrained user to perform complex motion tasks with robotics platforms by leveraging a simple, auto-generated ROS-based interface. Contrary to other motion control frameworks (e.g. ROS MoveIt!), we focus on the execution of Cartesian trajectories that are specified online, rather than planned in advance, as it is the case, for instance, in tele-operation and locomotion tasks. Moreover, we address the problem of generating such motions within a hard real-time (RT) control loop. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our framework both on the COMAN + humanoid robot, and on the hybrid wheeled-legged quadruped CENTAURO.
