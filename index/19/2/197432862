Harvesting wireless sensor node data by the mobile collector is a method that has received considerable attention in recent years. In this paper we investigate the problem of collecting Wireless sensor node (WSN) data when deployed randomly, To avoid networking between WSNs and base station, we use multi-robot exploration to find them, collect their data and transfer information to the base station. In this work we use a balanced way instead of full coverage exploration strategy to optimize consumed time for finding sensor node.Inthis approach; we combine the common spanning tree exploration and segmentation strategy to reach the acceptable method. This approach divides the exploration area into several regions and then each robot separately collects data to determine the less explored segment for more exploration. Indeed experiment results show noted algorithm.
