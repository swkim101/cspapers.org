A manipulation technique based on optothermally generated surface bubbles is proposed in this paper. The manipulation and assembly of microstructures are completed by using bubbles. In addition, the hydrogel microstructures are also used as microrobots driven by the bubble to operate and pattern the microspheres. Considering that many materials and lasers with different wavelength have been used for generating bubbles by optothermal effects, absorptivity and transmissivity are used as indicators of selections. Besides, the size of the bubble can be controlled by the frequency and time of the laser. This technique is supposed to be applied for manipulation of cells, microparticles and microstructures.
