In silico modeling of medicine refers to the direct use of computational methods in support of drug discovery and development. Machine learning and data mining methods have become an integral part of in silico modeling and demonstrated promising performance at various phases of the drug discovery and development process. In this tutorial we will introduce data analytic methods in drug discovery and development. For the first half, we will provide an overview about related data and analytic tasks, and then present the enabling data analytic methods for these tasks. For the second half, we will describe concrete applications of each of those tasks. The tutorial will be concluded with open problems and a Q&A session.
