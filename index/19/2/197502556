The myths that permeate “cachaca” in the Brazilian culture were identified, based on the fact that they favor the negative cultural representation – the image of an object on a particular culture – of this drink. It was constituted a corpus of research characterized by establishing significant links with the social practice in focus. The methodology adopted was semiology. Thus, five myths related to the cultural representation of the “cachaca” were identified: "drunkard", "discredit", "popular drink", "Brazilian brandy" and "fashion". It was concluded that, contrary to what was thought before the beginning of the study, the myths do not assign solely and exclusively negative connotations to the cachaca in Brazil. They also give it positive connotations. However, the positive myths cannot yet reformulate a new meaning to the cultural representation of this drink.
