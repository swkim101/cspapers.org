We propose a novel adsorption pad for wall climbing robot and irregular surface object using capillary force and water sealing. We call this adsorption pad as Super Wet Adsorption pad. The SWA pad has a porous part and a capillary part. The porous part is made by salt reaching method. When the SWA pad adsorbs to the wall which some sand and dust are attached, water comes from the porous part to avoid vacuum breaking. The capillary part is connected to the porous part to supply and stock the water. In this paper, we show the design of the porous part and the capillary part, fabrication process of each parts, and perform the evaluation experiment of the capillary force and adsorption of uneven surfaces, demonstration of wall climbing robot and adsorption of irregular surface foods.
