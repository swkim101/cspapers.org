The new open-source quadrotor platform called X4-MaG presented here was developed for aca-demic and research applications. X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammeswhich oers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to apowerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The controllers and estimators are highly cus-tomizable and are designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboardthe tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox).The new open-source Matlab/Simulink toolbox called RT-MaG toolbox (see [1]) generates reliablestandalone robotic applications running on real-time embedded Linux targets such as tiny ComputersOn Module (e.g., Gumstix boards). This toolbox gives direct access from Simulink to the maincommunication drivers classically used in robotics: network interfaces (via UDP), asynchronous andsynchronous serial port interfaces (RS232, SPI, I2C), Pulse-width-modulation (PWM), etc.[1] A.
