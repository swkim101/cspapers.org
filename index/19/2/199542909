In this paper, a two-layer architecture for the bilateral teleoperation of multi-arms systems with communication delay is presented. We extend the single-master-single-slave two layer approach proposed in [1] by connecting multiple robots to a single energy tank. This allows to minimize the conservativeness due to passivity preservation and to increment the level of transparency that can be achieved. The proposed approach is implemented on a realistic surgical scenario developed within the EU-funded SARAS project.
