In this talk I will share my experience at the start of "Data Science" in 2012, joining one of the fastest growing early stage unicorns and then building data science over 7 years. What we think of when we think of data science has evolved rapidly during this time. At Airbnb we now use data across product and operations, and for decisions by humans and machines. I will share my predictions for the future and where I believe data science can make the biggest impact in the years to come.
