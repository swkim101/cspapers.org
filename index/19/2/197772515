Our main objective in this paper is to discuss the deep relation between the main charac-teristics of the contemporary capitalist societies and one of the sports/shows that reaches a bigger number of persons not only in the Brazilian media but also in the international one: the MMA, Mixed Martial Arts. 
Far beyond the mostly rapidly identifiable aspects â€“ the violence or aggressiveness -, this sport/show is paradigmatic, because it embodies a huge amount of politics, economics and cultural aspects that are highly valorized in the contemporary develop-ment stage of the capitalists societies, characterized mainly by the expansion of the flow of information and goods globally, specially driven by the new communication technologies.
