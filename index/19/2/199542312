High-level human activities often have rich temporal structures that determine the order in which atomic actions are executed. We propose the Temporal Context Graph (TCG), a temporal reasoning model that integrates probabilistic inference with Allenâ€™s interval algebra, to capture these temporal structures. TCGs are capable of modeling tasks with cyclical atomic actions and consisting of sequential and parallel temporal relations. We present Learning from Demonstration as the application domain where the use of TCGs can improve policy selection and address the problem of perceptual aliasing. Experiments validating the model are presented for learning two tasks from demonstration that involve structured human-robot interactions. The source code for this implementation is available at https://github.com/AssistiveRoboticsUNH/TCG.
