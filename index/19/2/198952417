I plan to talk about a few big challenges we have at LinkedIn in the space of Data Science. The ones coming to my mind are (1) Measuring long-term impact; (2) Learning while preserving privacy; (3) Fairness. I can also touch upon productivity and efficiency -- which is a very practical challenge I'm sure all DS organizations face.
