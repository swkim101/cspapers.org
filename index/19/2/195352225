To maximize the probability of successful attacks and reduce the odds of being detected, malware developers implement different versions of the same malicious payloads. As a matter of fact, malware writers often generate new malicious code starting from existing ones, adding small programmed variations, or applying obfuscation mechanisms, that change the code structure, without altering the malicious functionalities. For these reasons phylogenetic analysis is becoming of interest as instrument for malware analysts in order to understand the derivation of a malicious payload, being thus able to reconduct a derived piece of code to its original, known originator. In this poster we describe a framework designed to infer and shape the phylogenetic tree of mobile malicious applications. The framework considers multi-level features with rule-based machine learning algorithm to retrieve antecedents and descendants of malicious samples.
