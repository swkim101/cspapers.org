Nowadays, publicity is an apparatus oriented to experiments which have caused an impasse to contemporary culture. As its purpose is to impress the user/consumer with an everlasting sensation, publicity appropriates the spectacle in the sense that it involves the spectator. The hypothesis is that this new use of language depends not only upon the challenges brought up by the new interfaces, by the information excess or by the digital, dispersed and accelerated culture. This use is also due to the post-industrial society claims which create indiscernible zones between everyday life and spectacle, experience and illusion.
