With the theme of “Games and Narratives”, the 
paper follows the path, or, rather, the possible 
“narratological chaining” that, in a certain way, allows 
players of The Sims game the possibility of expressing 
themselves and approaching the quotidian through 
different narrative forms. This can be done by 
playing the game, accessing the official website’s 
narrative possibilities, and publishing virtual 
“diaries” of the game, which are written by the 
players themselves, based on its avatars’ virtual 
quotidian. We attempt to perceive, throughout the 
study, how the players are able to express and make 
themselves present in the world by means of various 
digital narrative possibilities.
