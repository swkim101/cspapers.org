A major goal of learning from demonstration is task generalization via observation of a teacher. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning motion from a single demonstration. Our approach reconstructs the demonstrated trajectoryâ€™s phase space curve via a linear piece-wise regression method. We approximate dynamics of trajectory segments with linear time invariant equations, each yielding closed form solutions. We show convergence to desired phase space states via an energy-based analysis. The robustness of the model is evaluated on a robot for a sequential trajectory task. Additionally, we show the advantages that the phase space model has over the dynamic motion primitive for a kinematic based task.
