In this article I reflect on the commitments in the classroom in which the practice of cinema is central. I work the specific experience of the film-letter. To think the pedagogical space, I discuss the notions of emancipation (Jacques Ranciere) and machine (Felix Guattari) trying to understand the role of film in education. The article also establishes a dialogue between Jacques Ranciere and Gilles Deleuze / Felix Guattari’s writing’s, that despite their different philosophical backgrounds, they help us thinking the political dimension we bring to the teaching and practice of cinema.
