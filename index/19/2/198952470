What are the basic forms of healthcare data? How are Electronic Health Records and Cohorts structured? How can we identify the key variables in such data and how important are temporal abstractions? What are the main challenges in knowledge extraction from medical data sources? What are the key machine algorithms used for this purpose? What are the main questions that clinicians and medical experts pose to machine learning researchers? In this tutorial, we provide answers to these questions by presenting state-of-the-art methods, workflows, and tools for mining and understanding medical data. Particular emphasis is given on temporal abstractions, knowledge extraction from cohorts, machine learning model interpretability, and mHealth.
