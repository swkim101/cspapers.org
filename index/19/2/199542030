Obtaining an accurate estimate of the local wind remains a significant challenge for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Small UAVs often operate at low altitudes near terrain, where the wind environment can be more complex than at higher altitudes. Combined with their relatively low mass, this makes small UAVs particularly susceptible to wind. In this paper we present an approach for predicting high-resolution wind fields based on a terrain elevation model and known inflow conditions. Our approach uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate 3D wind estimates. We show that our approach produces wind estimates with lower prediction error than existing methods, and that inference can be performed on an on-board computer in less than two seconds. By providing the wind estimate to a sampling-based planner we show that the improved estimates allow the planner to generate safer paths in strong wind scenarios than with alternative wind estimation techniques.
