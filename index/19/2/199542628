In this paper, an active compliant revolute joint actuated by hydraulic energy is developed. The joint is made of polymer for integration in medical robotic systems, even in a challenging environment such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The use of multimaterial additive manufacturing allows us to develop two original aspects. First, a new seal design is proposed to build miniature hydraulic cylinders embedded in the active joint, with low level of friction. Second, a rack-and-pinion mechanism is being integrated to a compliant revolute joint to obtain a high level of compactness. Design and experimental assessment of the hydraulic cylinder and the compliant joint with embedded rack-and-pinion are presented, as well as an illustration in the context of needle manipulation with passive teleoperation.
