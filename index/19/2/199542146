In this work, we present an information based exploration strategy tailored for the generation of high resolution 3D maps. We employ RGBD panoramas because they have been shown to provide memory efficient high quality representations of space. Robots explore the environment by selecting locations with maximal Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic Mutual Information (CSQMI) computed on an angle enhanced occupancy grid to collect these RGBD panoramas. By employing the angle enhanced occupancy grid, the resulting exploration strategy emphasizes perspective in addition to binary coverage. Furthermore, the goal selection strategy is improved by using image morphology to reduce the search space over which CSQMI is computed. We present experimental results demonstrating the improved performance in perception related tasks by capturing panoramas using this approach, near frontier exploration, and a control of logging images at regular intervals while teleoperating the robot through the workspace. Collect imagery was passed through an object detection library with our perspective aware approach yielding a greater number of successful detections compared to near frontier exploration.
