This paper presents the results of the German research project SYMPARTNER (4/2015 - 6/2018), which aimed at developing a functional-emotional, mobile domestic robot companion for elderly people. The paper gives an overview of the developed robot, its system architecture, and essential skills and behaviors required for being a friendly home companion. Based on this, in a long-term field study running from January to June 2018 both technical aspects regarding the practical suitability and robustness of the robot under domestic operating conditions and social scientific questions on usability and acceptance of the robot and the usersâ€™ familiarization with their new housemate were evaluated. In the field study, two of these autonomous companion robots were used in 20 senior households in Erfurt (Germany). All participants lived with their robot in their apartments for one week without the need for supervising or supporting persons being present on-site. The tests in 20 single-person households in the age group 62 to 94 years (average 74 years) provided important insights into the special challenges of domesticity from a technical, social scientific, and user-oriented point of view. The results of the study show how seniors can shape their everyday life with a companion robot and how quickly they get used to the new housemate.
