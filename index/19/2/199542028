This paper presents a path following controller that is suitable for asymmetrical planar robots with significant mass and limited motor torques. the controller is resistant against environmental forces, and inaccurate estimates of robotâ€™s inertia, by estimating their effects with unscented kalman filter. the controller outputs wheel torque commands which take in account the motor torque limits and given relative priority of internal control elements. the method presented is thoroughly explained and the simulation results demonstrate the performance of the controller.
