We explore the characteristics of secondary contacts when applying forces with the end-effector of a robot and address the question when these secondary contacts can increase maximum applicable end-effector forces or reduce required actuator efforts. To this end, we formalize the effect of such secondary contacts in terms of required actuator efforts and derive efficiency bounds depending on the contact characteristics and robot configuration. Our findings are confirmed by experiments with a redundant serial manipulator.
