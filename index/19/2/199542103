The study of animals and insects have led to realization that animals select their gaits, patterns of leg movement, according to speed. For proper gait planning, the legs must be controlled for proper foot placement with respect to the body motion and ground interactions. However, in small scale robotic platforms gait planning through foot placement control is neither cost effective nor easily attainable due to a lack of available sensors. Thus, even though a desired gait is envisioned at the design phase, it is not known whether the gait is optimum. In this work, we present the comprehensive dynamic model of the miniature foldable robot, MinIAQ-II, which has four independently actuated legs. Dynamic model is used to perform gait analysis, to investigate the difference between the intended gait and the achieved gait in the absence of foot placement control. The model is verified through slow speed walking experiments on flat terrain. The work presented can be modified for different miniature robots with passive legs to predict their locomotion under no foot placement control.
