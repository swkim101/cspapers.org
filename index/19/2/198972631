As robots become more common in the classroom environment, opportunities emerge for improved distance learning via telepresence robots. K-12 students might be able to maintain their in-classroom education during extended absences through the use of telepresence robots, but existing robot platforms lack desirable self-awareness capabilities like rear vision and speaking volume awareness. At a high level, our research aims to augment the remote environment awareness of telepresence robot operators without significantly increasing their task load. As an initial proof of concept, we constructed a machine learning pipeline that uses dynamic time warping to classify certain prosocial and antisocial behaviors of people near a robot with an accuracy of 85.8%. In this initial work, a teleoperated TurtleBot2 serves as a proxy for the telepresence robots that will later use this classification ability. This robot responds to classified behaviors by maneuvering in a socially appropriate way and notifying stakeholders of events that could harm the robot. We propose future work to improve and build on these initial efforts.
