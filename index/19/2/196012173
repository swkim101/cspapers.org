This paper proposes a reflection on relational aesthetics, developed in the 90s by the French critic and curator Nicolas Bourriaud. To this end, elects as a counterpoint Marcel Maussâ€™ thought, specifically his essay on the gift, in order to understand the similarities and differences between the approaches of the two authors to the concepts of relationship and exchange. The question that motivates this text is well prepared: sociability models proposed by Bourriaud reinforce and reproduce the logic of consumer capitalism or suggest alternatives to it?
