Private comparison is about privately determining whether a > b, given two input integers a and b which are held as private information. Private comparison is an important building block for applications such as secure auction and privacy-preserving decision tree evaluation. In this paper, we consider a variant setting in which the inputs a and b as well as the result bit 1 {a > b} are encrypted. Using a ring variant of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme, our solution takes as input the ciphertexts of a and b and produces only one ciphertext which decrypts to the bit 1 {a > b} without any interaction with the secret key holder. Our approach does not encrypt the inputs bit-wisely and requires only a multiplicative depth of one, giving about 48 - 90 fold speed up over previous solutions.
