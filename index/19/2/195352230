This study aims to understand the threats caused by abandoned Internet resources used by Android apps. By abandoned, we mean Internet resources that support apps that were published and are still available on the mobile app marketplace, but have not been maintained and hence are at risk for abuse by an outsider. Internet resources include domain names and hard-coded IP addresses, which could be used for nefarious purposes, e.g., stealing sensitive private information, scamming and phishing, click fraud, and injecting malware distribution URL. As a result of the analysis of 1.1 M Android apps published in the official marketplace, we uncovered 3,628 of abandoned Internet resources associated with 7,331 available mobile apps. These resources are subject to hijack by outsiders. Of these apps, 13 apps have been installed more than a million of times, a measure of the breadth of the threat. Based on the findings of empirical experiments, we discuss potential threats caused by abandoned Internet resources and propose countermeasures against these threats.
