Sparse representation based methods have successfully put forward a general framework for robust face recognition through linear reconstruction and sparsity constraints. However, residual modeling in existing works is not yet robust enough when dealing with dense noise. In this paper, we aim at recognizing identities from faces with varying levels of noises of various forms such as occlusion, pixel corruption, or disguise, and take improving the fitting ability of the error model as the key to addressing this problem. To fully capture the characteristics of different noises, we propose a mixed model combining robust sparsity constraint and low-rank constraint, which can deal with random errors and structured errors simultaneously. For random noises such as pixel corruption, we adopt a Laplacian-uniform mixed function for fitting the error distribution. For structured errors like continuous occlusion or disguise, we utilize robust nuclear norm to constrain the rank of the error matrix. An effective iterative reweighted algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed model. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark databases for robust face recognition, and the overall results demonstrate that our model is most robust against various kinds of noises, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.
