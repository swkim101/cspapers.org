This paper investigates the curve path following problem for a class of planar underactuated bio-inspired snake robots. The time-varying line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and the cubic spline interpolation (CSI) path-planning method are employed. Existing studies focus on straight line path following which only gives a solution for snake robot motion control in relatively simple environments. Considering the snake robotâ€™s many degrees of freedom and excellent mobility in terrains, we propose a more applicable solution of curve path following for snake robots on the ground. The improved LOS helps the snake robot to steer aggressively at a sharp turning point. Furthermore, to avoid the sideslip of the snake robot caused by the ground friction change, an integral controller is introduced in the design of the heading reference. Simulations and experiments on an 8-link custom-built snake robot are conducted and the results demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed curve path following algorithm.
