In this paper, we present a method for depth control of one degree of freedom (1DOF) underwater robotic platform aMussel, based on the measurements from the ambient light sensor. Since ambient light values change during the day and depend on the weather conditions, references for the controller are acquired from other aMussel holding depth using pressure sensor based controller. Control inputs are transmitted using acoustic communication.
