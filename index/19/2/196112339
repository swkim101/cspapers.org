Although Gramsci and Bourdieu resist in considering a journalist an intellectual, journalistic identity has frequently been characterized by such notion. This paper deals with the different types, classes and concepts of intellectual forged by authors such as Sartre, Gramsci and Bobbio. Moreover, as this paper is concerned with the role of intellectualsâ€™ image in journalistic identity in the contemporary world, it is important to reflect upon the connections between different kinds of intellectuals and new information and communication technologies. This task counts on contributions given by authors such as Said, Sarlo, Ianni and others.
