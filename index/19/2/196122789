The article proposes to conceive newspieces on mental disorders published in weekly magazines as advertisements aimed at stimulating the consumption of medication, in particular of antidepressants. It then examines the linkages 
between consumption and contemporary subjectivities by analyzing two main rhetorical strategies by which individuals may come to conceive of themselves as possibly ill and thus as a potential consumer of medication. The first one separates suffering and morality, thus erasing the 
stigma associated to mental disorders; the second one inquires how quizzes published in these newspieces may enhance the sense of uncertainty in individuals regarding oneâ€™s allegedly normal mental states.
