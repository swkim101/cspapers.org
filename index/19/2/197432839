The internet of things (IoT) is applied to many areas due to wide area connectivity and massive amount of information processing capability. It can be applied to the smart grid for sensing, monitoring and controlling the grid state information. The IoT enabled sensors are used to sense the grid state information, and then H-infinity algorithm is adopted to estimate the system states. Simulation result using the micro grid illustrates that the proposed algorithm can estimate the system states within a short period of time. Consequently, this framework is valuable to design the smart energy management systems in future.
