Through selective readings of literary chronicles, artistic and media representations, this essay explores how a particular kind of crowd — the carnival crowd — has been interpreted and represented in key periods of Rio de Janeiro’s history. More than any other public celebration, carnival was and still is the festive ritual that mirrors most clearly the cultural negotiations of the city. I argue that different media not only express the social contradictions and the distinct cultural negotiations of this profane celebration but they also shape the experiences of the crowd.
