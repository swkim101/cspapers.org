We propose a novel data-driven learning-based contact clustering (i.e., of contact points and contact normals) framework for rigid-body robot simulation, with its accuracy established/verified by real experimental data. We first construct an experimental robotic setup with force/torque (F/T) sensors to collect real contact motion/force data. We then design a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network for the contact clustering based on the full motion and force/torque information of the contacts. We also adopt the constraint-based optimization contact solver to facilitate the learning of our MLP network during the training. Our proposed data-driven/learning-based contact clustering framework is then verified against the experimental setup, compared with other techniques/simulators and shown to significantly (or meaningfully) enhance the accuracy of contact simulation as compared to them.
