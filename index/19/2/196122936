This article is part of a research that has started in 2009 and that analyzes the relational dynamics involving art and media technology uses of in urban space. This article particularly focuses on the actions of so-called "collective of artists”, groups which operate in public spaces making interventions that mix art and activism in a quite different fashion if compared to those of the 1960’s and the 1970’s. Based on a connectionist design and networking, these actions can be considered a social practice with interesting communicative aspects since they interconnect urban spaces, media technology, different social actors and artistic forms in an unusual way. In particular, the text addresses the operations of the group Contra Filet from Sao Paulo and their intersection with social movements.
