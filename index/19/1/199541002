This article describes an innovative design of variable stiffness soft actuator, which can potentially be utilized for manipulation and locomotion of soft robots. The new actuator is a combination of two types of actuations: soft pneumatic actuation and muscle-like supercoiled polymer (SCP) actuation. Soft pneumatic actuator has two roles: first is to generate bending motions and second is to increase the stiffness of the whole actuator together with SCP artificial muscles. SCP artificial muscles are exploited to generate pre-load to resist the whole actuator from (excessive) deformation when external load is applied. These two types of actuations are arranged antagonistically to realize stiffness tuning of the whole actuator. At a given bending position, stiffness of the actuator could be tuned by controlling the pressure inside the air chamber and the tension on the SCP artificial muscles. In experimental section, tests are conducted to characterize the applied SCP artificial muscles before they are applied to the proposed actuator. Afterwards, tests of proposed actuator are performed to examine its variable stiffness capability. From experimental results, the proposed actuator can achieve 3.47 times stiffness variation ratio from 0.0312 N/mm(40kPa air pressure and no SCP actuation) to 0.1083 N/mm(82kPa air pressure and SCP actuation at 0.143 W/cm) at the same position (bending angle of 56 degree). This study exhibits the potential of applying SCP artificial muscles to promote the performance of soft robots.
