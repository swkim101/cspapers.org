This paper presents a contact-event-triggered filter using only a force-torque sensor with impedance control for non-cooperative, rotating, heavy object capture. Contact events are modeled for prediction, and detected to trigger the particle filterâ€™s updating process. By combining these features, a computationally efficient, contact-event-triggered filter is proposed. For our purpose of capture using impedance control, expected contact events, collisions and sliding are defined for prediction and detection. This novel method is implemented in an air bearing robotic system, and has demonstrated its superiority with the highest success rate (100%) for sliding contact mode cases, whereas the previous method could only yield a success rate of 87.9%. The computation resource is demonstrated to be limited, with a computation time of 4.2 milliseconds on average and 8.3 milliseconds at worst.
