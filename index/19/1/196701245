Most existing ensemble methods aim to train the underlying embedded models independently and simply aggregate their final outputs via averaging or weighted voting. As many prediction tasks contain uncertainty, most of these ensemble methods just reduce variance of the predictions without considering the collaborations among the ensembles. Different from these ensemble methods, multiple choice learning (MCL) methods exploit the cooperation among all the embedded models to generate multiple diverse hypotheses. In this paper, a new MCL method, called vMCL (the abbreviation of versatile Multiple Choice Learning), is developed to extend the application scenarios of MCL methods by ensembling deep neural networks. Our vMCL method keeps the advantage of existing MCL methods while overcoming their major drawback, thus achieves better performance. The novelty of our vMCL lies in three aspects: (1) a choice network is designed to learn the confidence level of each specialist which can provide the best prediction base on multiple hypotheses; (2) a hinge loss is introduced to alleviate the overconfidence issue in MCL settings; (3) Easy to be implemented and can be trained in an end-to-end manner, which is a very attractive feature for many real-world applications. Experiments on image classification and image segmentation task show that vMCL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art MCL methods.
