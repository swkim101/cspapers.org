In this study, a single-step additive manufacturing approach to fabricate an array of bio-inspired soft whisker-like sensors is presented. Each whisker is a damped oscillator system that is tuned to a different resonant frequency whose response is characterized through experimentation in an air medium. A 3 × 1 polymer based whisker-array is used to distinguish individual frequency components in mixed-frequency signals, achieving a form of “mechanical Fourier transform”
