The deployment of robotics in real-world scenarios, which may involve harsh and irregular physical interactions with the environment, such as those when robots operating in a disaster scenario, or the interactions that prosthetic devices may experience, demands hardware, which is physically resilient. The end-effectors, as the main media of interaction, are probably the parts at the highest risk. The capability of robotic hands to survive severe impacts is thus a necessity for the effective deployment of reliable robotic solutions in real-world tasks. Although, this robustness capability has been noted and discussed in the robotics community for long time, the literature does not provide a systematic study nor there is any proposal of standardized test or metric to evaluate hand resilience. In this work, inspired by the works of Charpy and Izod for the systematic definition of resilience and toughness of materials through impact tests, we consider extending the standard test to robot hands. We introduce a resilience evaluation framework, including a precisely defined experimental set-up and test procedure. As an example of application of the procedure, we apply it to experimentally characterize two robot hands, with a similar conceptual architecture but different size and material. From these tests we obtain several insights, including the observation that the dominant factor in hand resilience is their compliance and actuation principle, and that the use, under certain design conditions, of lightweight materials, such as plastic instead of aluminum, may not necessarily reduce the mechanical strength of the overall system.
