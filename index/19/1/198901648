Robotic grasping in cluttered environments is often infeasible due to obstacles preventing possible grasps. Then, pre-grasping manipulation like shifting or pushing an object becomes necessary. We developed an algorithm that can learn, in addition to grasping, to shift objects in such a way that their grasp probability increases. Our research contribution is threefold: First, we present an algorithm for learning the optimal pose of manipulation primitives like clamping or shifting. Second, we learn non-prehensible actions that explicitly increase the grasping probability. Making one skill (shifting) directly dependent on another (grasping) removes the need of sparse rewards, leading to more data-efficient learning. Third, we apply a real-world solution to the industrial task of bin picking, resulting in the ability to empty bins completely. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner with around 25 000 grasp and 2500 shift actions. Our robot is able to grasp and file objects with 274±3 picks per hour. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system’s ability to generalize to novel objects.
