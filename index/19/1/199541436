This paper presents a novel light-weight back-drivable inherently-safe robotic mechanism for delivering ankle rehabilitation therapies. The robot is designed to be used as the ankle module of a multi-purpose lower-limb rehabilitation robot. A novel friction-based safety feature has been introduced that enables mechanical adjustment of the maximum amount of allowable transfer forces and torques to the patientâ€™s limb. The design procedure, mathematical modeling and experimental validations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system.
