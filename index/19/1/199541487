Bio-syncretic robots made up of living biological systems and electromechanical systems may have the potential excellent performance of natural biological entities. Therefore, the study of the bio-syncretic robots has got lots of attention in recent years. The 3D skeletal muscles have been used widely, due to the considerable contraction force and the controllability. However, the low differentiation quality of the C2C12 in the tissues hinders the broad application in the development of the skeleton muscle actuated bio-syncretic robots. In this work, an approach based on circular mould and rotary electrical stimulation to build high-quality muscle rings, which can be used to actuate various bio-syncretic robots, has been proposed. Firstly, the advantage of the proposed circular mould for the muscle rings culture has been shown by simulation. Then, the muscle rings have been fabricated with different moulds using the experiment-optimized compositions of the biological mixture. After that, the muscle rings in the circular moulds with different electrical stimulations have been cultured, to show the superiority of the proposed rotary electrical stimulation. Moreover, the contractility of the muscle rings have been measured under the different electrical pulses stimulation, for the study of the control property of the muscle rings. This work may be meaningful not only the development of bio-syncretic robots actuated by 3D muscle tissues but also the muscle tissue engineering.
