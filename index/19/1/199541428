Wireless magnetic microrobots can perform complex tasks for small-scale minimally invasive surgery (MIS) that requires high precision and dexterity. The choice of the configuration of the electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system is a key issue for reliable medical applications. This paper addresses the study of a robotic EMA platform firstly devoted to ophthalmic MIS, aiming at improving the manipulability and dexterity of the procedure. To this end, a robotic EMA system comprising four static and four mobile electromagnets is investigated. Evaluation of the magnetic force and torque, the manipulability and the dexterity indexes of EMA platforms are studied. The results demonstrate that a robotic EMA platform increases the versatility of the EMA system, and becomes resourceful to perform various tasks.
