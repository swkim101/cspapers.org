The paper addresses the static balancing and walking of elastically actuated legged robots. The control is realized by commanding the motor positions only and exploiting the bijective relation between motor and link positions at equilibrium under static external forces. The approach is formulated in a quite general framework first. The main implementation contribution is the definition of a body coordinate system and of an appropriate set of constraints, which leads to a fully determined system of equations. In addition to the desired COM and the vertical foot positions, which are defined by the walking task and the terrain, the imposed constraints are related to distances between individual legs. The controller is experimentally validated on a compliantly actuated quadruped.
