We propose a geometric method to solve inverse kinematics (IK) problems of 7-DoF manipulators with joint offsets at shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Traditionally, inverse position kinematics for redundant manipulators are solved by using an iterative method based on the pseudo-inverse of the manipulator Jacobian. This provides a single solution among the infinitely many possible solutions for the IK problem of redundant manipulators. There are no closed-form IK solutions for redundant manipulators with multiple joint offsets. Using our method we can compute multiple IK solutions using two-parameter search by exploiting geometry of the structure of a redundant manipulator. Our proposed IK algorithm can handle multiple joint offsets and is mathematically simple to implement in a few lines of code. We apply our algorithm to compute IK solutions for 7-DoF redundant Baxter robot (that has joint offsets at shoulder, wrist, and elbow joints) for end-effector configurations where existing geometry-based IK solvers fail to find solutions. We also demonstrate the use of our algorithm in an application where we want to compute an IK solution (among the infinitely many possible solutions) that has minimum error bound in end-effector position, in the presence of random joint actuation and sensing uncertainties.
