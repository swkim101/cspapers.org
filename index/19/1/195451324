We propose a retrieval-augmented convolutional network (RaCNN) and propose to train it with local mixup, a novel variant of the recently proposed mixup algorithm. The proposed hybrid architecture combining a convolutional network and an off-the-shelf retrieval engine was designed to mitigate the adverse effect of off-manifold adversarial examples, while the proposed local mixup addresses on-manifold ones by explicitly encouraging the classifier to locally behave linearly on the data manifold. Our evaluation of the proposed approach against seven readilyavailable adversarial attacks on three datasets–CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet–demonstrate the improved robustness compared to a vanilla convolutional network, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-art reactive defense approaches.
