On behalf of the Program Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of the Student Research Workshop at ACL-03, the 41st Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Sapporo, Japan. This is the fourth time that the Student Session at ACL is organized in the form of a workshop, and it is the 13th ACL Student Session. This year, the Student Research Workshop hosts 12 presentations of high-quality full-length papers. After each presentation, a panel of senior researchers will provide detailed comments and feedback on the work. We would like to thank the panelists in advance.
