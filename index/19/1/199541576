We demonstrate an autonomous ground robot capable of exploring unknown indoor environments for reconstructing their 2D maps. This problem has been traditionally tackled by geometric heuristics and information theory. More recently, deep learning and reinforcement learning based approaches have been proposed to learn exploration behavior in an end-to-end manner. We present a method that combines the strengths of these different approaches. Specifically, we employ a state-of-the-art generative neural network to predict unknown regions of a partially explored map, and use the prediction to enhance the exploration in an information-theoretic manner. We evaluate our system in simulation using floor plans of real buildings. We also present comparisons with traditional methods which demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of exploration efficiency. We retain an advantage over end-to-end learned exploration methods in that the robotâ€™s behavior is easily explicable in terms of the predicted map.
