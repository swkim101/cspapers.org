This paper aims to investigate how certain popular music genres helped to reinforce a mythical image of Portugal, linked to its condition of touristic destination or oriented to Portuguese communities in other countries, especially in the last ten years of Salazarism (1964-1974) and the following decade. Initially, I try to establish a connection between the symbolic imaginary which has become hegemonic on many representations of Portugal that circulate in Brazilian touristic magazines and newspapers, especially the ones focused on the city of Lisbon. Furthermore, I discuss how our lack of knowledge about Portuguese contemporary music production can be related to the predominance of musical formats usually known as nacional-canconetismo, which reproduce some stereotypes about Portuguese culture with political and commercial intentions.
