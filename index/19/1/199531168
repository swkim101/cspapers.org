A motion-planning problemâ€™s setup can drastically affect the quality of solutions returned by the planner. In this work we consider optimizing these setups, with a focus on doing so in a computationally-efficient fashion. Our approach interleaves optimization with motion planning, which allows us to consider the actual motions required of the robot. Similar prior work has treated the planner as a black box: our key insight is that opening this box in a simple-yet-effective manner enables a more efficient approach, by allowing us to bound the work done by the planner to optimizer-relevant computations. Finally, we apply our approach to a surgically-relevant motion-planning task, where our experiments validate our approach by more-efficiently optimizing the fixed insertion pose of a surgical robot.
