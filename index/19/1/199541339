In contrast to underactuated robotic hands the DLR AWIWI II hand of the David robot is fully controllable because each finger with 4 joints is actuated by 6 or 8 tendons respectively. For such fingers all joint angles (generalized positions) or joint torques (generalized forces) can be controlled independently. Usually, the specifications in joint space are converted to desired tendon forces or motor torques, which are regulated by an inner loop impedance controller. However, this conversion typically exhibits couplings between the components of the joint angle vector or the joint torque vector respectively, which arise when using the well known equations. Therefore the usual force control and position control schemes are reviewed and a generic computation of the desired tendon forces is presented. This is also done for the control of the Cartesian position and force at the finger endpoint. Thus the main contribution of the paper is the inhibition of couplings in joint space or at the Cartesian endpoint. This is demonstrated in simulations of the index finger of the DLR David hand.
