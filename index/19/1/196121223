Newspapers present daily the contemporary consequences of the social-cultural transformations occurred in the last centuries, the results of late capitalism that extended its arms to most parts of the world, with the consequent economic globalization and its fissures, its contradictions, its unsustainability. However, not much is said, in newspapers or outside them, regarding the world view that supports this social-economic paradigm, effective in both the territory of science and technology, and in the territory of ethics and religion that support it. Also, not much is said about the deep semiotics transformations occurred in this scenery, of how the technological contemporary societies are operating a deep crisis in the signification processes, what puts upside down the shared directions and the communications constructed from it. Functionalism and mechanical view are historical inheritances that take us to this current scenery of disenchantment of the world which impacts necessarily in the relation of men with their environment and other men, hence, for their communicative relations, as well as for the opposite of these relations, the processes by which is constructed the phenomenon of the incommunication. In this way, the text intends to rescue the common direction present in the terms communication and communion, analyzing the origins of these two processes in search of its common root and the quarrel concerning the sociocultural conditions which promoted, at a determined moment of our history, a disassociation between these two processes, disassociation from which the communication direction has transformed itself radically, valorizing the imposition of a functionalist vision over communication.
