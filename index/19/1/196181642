Ranking comments on an online news service is a practically important task for the service provider, and thus there have been many studies on this task. However, most of them considered users’ positive feedback, such as “Like”-button clicks, as a quality measure. In this paper, we address directly evaluating the quality of comments on the basis of “constructiveness,” separately from user feedback. To this end, we create a new dataset including 100K+ Japanese comments with constructiveness scores (C-scores). Our experiments clarify that C-scores are not always related to users’ positive feedback, and the performance of pairwise ranking models tends to be enhanced by the variation of comments rather than articles.
