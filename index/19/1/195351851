Dynamic Sampling is a novel, non-uniform, statistical sampling strategy in which documents are selected for relevance assessment based on the results of prior assessments. Unlike static and dynamic pooling methods that are commonly used to compile relevance assessments for the creation of information retrieval test collections, Dynamic Sampling yields a statistical sample from which substantially unbiased estimates of effectiveness measures may be derived. In contrast to static sampling strategies, which make no use of relevance assessments, Dynamic Sampling is able to select documents from a much larger universe, yielding superior test collections for a given budget of relevance assessments. These assertions are supported by simulation studies using secondary data from the TREC 2017 Common Core Track.
