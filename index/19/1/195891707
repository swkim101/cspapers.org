This paper describes CoLo - a performance evaluation system for two-dimensional cooperative localization algorithms. The system consists of a physical experiment (CoLo-PE) for data collection and a software analysis tool (CoLo-AT) using real-world datasets to evaluate the performances of usersâ€™ cooperative localization algorithms. This paper details the design and operation of the physical experiment (CoLo-PE) and discusses the functionalities and uses of the software analysis tool (CoLo-AT) for algorithm evaluation. Specifically, CoLo allows researchers to conveniently add their cooperative localization algorithms and test them extensively on different real-world datasets with various settings.
