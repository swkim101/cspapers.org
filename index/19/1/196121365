This article establishes relationships between Jonas Mekas films (like “Paradise not yet lost”, “Notes for Jerome”, “Walden”) and “Rolls”, by Ivo Lopes, and “Supermemorias”, by Danilo Carvalho, trying to create connections and to update a proposition that before being just a defense of the cinema as a place of retaining fragments of life is a defense of cinema itself. Approaching cinemas, the fragments themselves, transits arise from a movie over the other and so comes the permanence of cinema itself. For this, we take the thesis of survival, as a theoretical framework from Didi-Huberman.
