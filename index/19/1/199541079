We propose an efficient multi-robot motion planning algorithm for missions captured by linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications, in the presence of bounded disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the communication between robots and base stations. Given an LTL formula Ψ, our goal is to construct robot trajectories, and associated control strategies, to satisfy Ψ and continuously establish communication paths between robots and base stations despite the DoS attacks and the disturbances on the robot states. Our approach combines and extends results from robust control and efficient motion planning via satisfiability modulo convex programming (SMC). We first compute a feedback controller that rejects the disturbance together with a perturbation of the DoS-free workspace that accounts for the worst-case disturbance scenario. On the perturbed workspace, we formulate the planning problem as a feasibility problem over Boolean and convex constraints, respectively capturing the DoS-resilient mission constraints and the constraints on the nominal, disturbance-free, robot dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our algorithm in providing DoS-resilient plans that are robust to disturbances and support the execution of complex missions.
