This paper addresses for the first time the singularity analysis of cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) with sagging cables using the Irvine model. We present the mathematical framework of singularity analysis of CDPR using this cable model. We then show that, besides a cable model representation singularity, both the inverse and forward kinematics (IK and FK) have a singularity type, called parallel robot singularity, which correspond to the singularity of an equivalent parallel robot with rigid legs. We then show that both the IK and FK have also full singularities, that are not parallel robot singularity and are obtained when two of the IK or FK solution branches intersect. IK singularity will usually lie on the border of the CDPR workspace. We then exhibit an algorithm that allow one to prove that a singularity exist in the neighborhood of a given pose and to estimate its location with an arbitrary accuracy. Examples are provided for parallel robot, IK and FK singularities. However we have not been able to determine examples of combined singularity where both the IK and FK are singular (besides parallel robot singularity).
