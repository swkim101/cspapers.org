The aim of this paper is to analyze the mediated public culture about the subject of disability from 1960 to 2008 in Brazil. Supported by the analysis of 364 news published in that period by the newspapers Folha de Sao Paulo and O Globo, and by the magazine Veja, the work points out an intense pluralization of frames along the last decades and the strengthening of a perspective of rights that did not have visibility until the eighties. The obtained results contest the skepticism of previous studies about the change of the values related to the topic. Our long-term analysis, while comparing the current media frames to those of the past decades, suggests a deep process of social learning.
