This paper describes a new robotic tabletop rearrangement system, and presents experimental results. The tasks involve rearranging as many as 30 to 100 blocks, sometimes packed with a density of up to 40%. The high packing factor forces the system to push several objects at a time, making accurate simulation difficult, if not impossible. Nonetheless, the system achieves goals specifying the pose of every object, with an average precision of ± 1 mm and ± 2°. The system searches through policy rollouts of simulated pushing actions, using an Iterated Local Search technique to escape local minima. In real world execution, the system executes just one action from a policy, then uses a vision system to update the estimated task state, and replans. The system accepts a fully general description of task goals, which means it can solve the singulation and separation problems addressed in prior work, but can also solve sorting problems and spell out words, among other things. The paper includes examples of several solved problems, statistical analysis of the system’s behavior on different types of problems, and some discussion of limitations, insights, and future work.
