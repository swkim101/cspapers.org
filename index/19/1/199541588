Navigation and control are a largely unsolved problems for micro autonomous underwater vehicles ($\mu$AUVs). The main challenges are due to the lack of accurate underwater localization systems, which fit on-board of $\mu$AUVs. In this work, we present an integrated navigation and control architecture consisting of a low-cost embedded localization module and an underwater way-point tracking controller, which fulfills the requirements of $\mu$AUVs. The performance of the navigation and control system is benchmarked in two different experimental scenarios.
