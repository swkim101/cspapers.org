Mitigating potential hazards for planetary rovers posed by soft soils requires testing in representative environments such as with Martian soil simulants in reduced gravity. This work describes the experimentation, methods, and results of a rover-soil visualization technique that produced rich datasets of reduced gravity wheel-terrain interaction. The activities are linked to the upcoming ExoMars space mission, through the use of ExoMars wheel prototype and Martian soil simulant in simulated Martian gravity produced in parabolic flights. The results indicate that, with wheel normal load held equal between experiments, the amount of soil mobilized by wheel-soil interaction increases as gravity decreases. Moreover, the amount of soil mobilized is more sensitive to slip in lower gravity. The results of the visualization analysis suggest a deterioration in the soil resistance and weaker soil bonding at lower gravities, which undermines the rover mobility by reducing the net traction. The results have important implications regarding the practice of using a reduced-mass rover on Earth to assess the performance of a full-mass rover in similar soil on an extraterrestrial surface.
