With the rising importance of knowledge exchange, ontologies have become a key technology in the development of shared knowledge models for semantic-driven applications, such as knowledge interchange and semantic integration. Significant progress has been made in the use of entropy to measure the predictability and redundancy of knowledge bases, particularly ontologies. However, the current entropy applications used to evaluate ontologies consider only single-point connectivity rather than path connectivity, assign equal weights to each entity and path, and assume that vertices are static. To address these deficiencies, the present study proposes a Path-based Text-aware Entropy Computation method, PTEC, by considering the path information between different vertices and the textual information within the path to calculate the connectivity path of the whole network and the different weights between various nodes. Information obtained from structure-based embedding and text-based embedding is multiplied by the connectivity matrix of the entropy computation. An experimental evaluation of three real-world ontologies is performed based on ontology statistical information (data quantity), entropy evaluation (data quality), and a case study (ontology structure and text visualization). These aspects mutually demonstrate the reliability of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that PTEC can effectively evaluate ontologies, particularly those in the medical field.
