Avoiding obstacles poses a significant challenge for amputees using mechanically-passive transfemoral prosthetic limbs due to their lack of direct knee control. In contrast, powered prostheses can potentially improve obstacle avoidance via their ability to add energy to the system. In past work, researchers have proposed stumble recovery systems for powered prosthetic limbs that provide assistance in the event of a trip. However, these systems only aid recovery after an obstacle has disrupted the user’s gait and do not proactively help the amputee avoid obstacles. To address this problem, we designed an adaptive system that learns online to use kinematic data from the prosthetic limb to detect the user’s obstacle avoidance intent in early swing. When the system detects an obstacle, it alters the planned swing trajectory to help avoid trips. Additionally, the system uses a regression model to predict the required knee flexion angle for the trip response. We validated the system by comparing obstacle avoidance success rates with and without the obstacle avoidance system. For a non-amputee subject wearing the prosthesis through an adapter, the trip avoidance system improved the obstacle negotiation success rate from 37% to 89%, while an amputee subject improved his success rate from 35% to 71% when compared to utilizing minimum jerk trajectories for the knee and ankle joints.
