In this paper, we present CTRAS, a tool for automatically aggregating and summarizing duplicate crowdsourced test reports on the fly. CTRAS can automatically detect duplicates based on both textual information and the screenshots, and further aggregates and summarizes the duplicate test reports. CTRAS provides end users with a comprehensive and comprehensible understanding of all duplicates by identifying the main topics across the group of aggregated test reports and highlighting supplementary topics that are mentioned in subgroups of test reports. Also, it provides the classic tool of issue tracking systems, such as the project-report dashboard and keyword searching, and automates their classic functionalities, such as bug triaging and best fixer recommendation, to assist end users in managing and diagnosing test reports.
