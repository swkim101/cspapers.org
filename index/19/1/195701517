Apple's mobile handheld devices have been a huge success; beginning with the launching of the iPhone in 2007 and that has been maintained until present days with the launching of the iPad in 2010. There are now more than 85,000 apps available for the more than 50 million iPhone and iPod touch customers worldwide and over 125,000 developers in Apple's iPhone Developer Program. That is why iPhone is a new and widely extended platform to develop object-oriented applications. iPhone platform involves several and amazing technologies that makes programming it a cool activity for experienced programmers willing to know the goodness of a mobile device, and a great option for students or novices to learn programming. Both of them will find the power of the iPhone libraries and development tools amazing to quickly start building powerful iPhone apps. We will be using Xcode under Mac OS X as our IDE, and Objective-C and iPhone API as our programming tools to create iPhone applications (from basic to medium level), which finally can be loaded into the iPhone device. We'll start with the classical "Hello World" and continue to develop applications using graphical user interfaces, handling multi-touch and motion detection, communication interfaces, and different media.
