Static analysis is widely used to detect potential defects in apps. Existing analysis tools focus on specific problems and vary in supported sensitivity, which make them difficult to reuse and extend for new analysis tasks. This paper presents Androlic, a precise static analysis framework for Android which is flow, context, object, field and path-sensitive. Through configuration items and APIs provided by Androlic, developers can easily extend it to perform custom analysis tasks. Evaluation on an example program and 20 real-world apps show that Androlic can analyze apps with high precision and efficiency.
