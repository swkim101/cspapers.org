Gregory McColm conjectured that positive elementary inductions are bounded in a class K of flnite structures if every (FO + LFP) formula is equivalent to a flrst-order formula in K. Here (FO + LFP) is the extension of flrst-order logic with the least flxed point operator. We disprove the conjecture. Our main results are two model-theoretic constructions, one deterministic and the other randomized, each of which refutes McColmâ€™s conjecture.
