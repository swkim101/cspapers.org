This hands-on half-day tutorial consists of two 90-minute sessions. Part I covers the following topics: paired and two-sample t -tests, confidence intervals (with Excel and R); familywise error rate, multiple comparison procedures; ANOVA (with Excel and R); Tukey's HSD test, simultaneous confidence intervals (with R). Part II covers the following topics: randomised Tukey HSD test (with Discpower); what's wrong with statistical significance tests?; effect sizes, statistical power; topic set size design (with Excel); power analysis (with R); summary: how to report your results. Participants should have some prior knowledge about the very basics of statistical significance testing and are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop with R already installed. The tutorial participants will be able to design and conduct statistical significance tests for comparing the mean effectiveness scores of two or more systems appropriately, and to report on the test results in an informative manner.
