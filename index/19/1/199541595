In this contribution, a new adaptive motion cueing algorithm for a full motion driving simulator at the University of Stuttgart is presented, which allows kinematic vehicle movements to be taken into account. These are adequately processed via a state-flow chart and transferred to the motion cueing algorithm in such a way that the dynamic of the Stuttgart Driving Simulator can be used much more efficiently. Furthermore, a linear quadratic error minimization of the mentioned algorithm is presented. The primary objective is to provide a more realistic driving experience to the driver.
