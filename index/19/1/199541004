Consider many particles actuated by a uniform global external field (e.g. gravitational or magnetic fields). This paper presents analytical results using workspace obstacles and global inputs to reshape such a group of particles. Shape control of many particles is necessary for conveying information, construction, and navigation. First we show how the particlesâ€™ characteristic angle of repose can be used to reshape the particles by controlling angle of attack and the magnitude of the driving force. These can then be used to control the force and torque applied to a rectangular rigid body. Next, we examine the full set of stable, achievable mean and variance configurations for the shape of a particle group in two canonical environments: a square and a circular workspace. Finally, we show how workspaces with linear boundary layers can be used to achieve a more rich set of mean and variance configurations.
