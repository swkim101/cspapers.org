This paper presents a novel continuum robot sheath for use in single-port minimally invasive procedures such as neuroendoscopy in which the sheath is designed to deliver multiple robotic arms. Articulation of the sheath is achieved by using precurved superelastic tubes lining the working channels used for arm delivery. These tubes perform a similar role to push/pull tendons, but can accomplish shape change of the sheath via rotation as well as translation. A kinematic model using Cosserat rod theory is derived which is based on modeling the system as a set of eccentrically aligned precurved tubes constrained along their length by an elastic backbone. The specific case of a two-arm sheath is considered in detail and its relationship to a concentric tube balanced pair is described. Simulation and experiment are used to investigate the concept, map its workspace and to evaluate the kinematic model.
