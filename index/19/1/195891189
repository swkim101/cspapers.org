Value flow are widely used in static analysis to detect bugs. Existing techniques usually employ a pointer analysis and generate source sink summaries defined by problem domain, then a solver is invoked to determine whether the path is feasible. However, most of the tools does not provide an easy way for users to find user defined bugs within the same architecture of finding pre-defined bugs. This paper presents VFQL, an expressive query language on value flow graph and the framework to execute the query to find user defined defects. Moreover, VFQL provides a nice GUI to demonstrate the value flow graph and a modeling language to define system libraries or user libraries without code, which further enhances its usability. The experimental results on open benchmarks show that VFQL achieve a competitive performance against other state of art tools. The result of case study conducted on open source program shows that the flexible query and modeling language provide a great support in finding user specified defects.
