Test collection based evaluation represents the standard of evalua- tion for information retrieval systems. Legal IR, more speci cally case law retrieval, has no such standard test collection for evalua- tion. In this paper, we present a test collection for use in evaluating case law search, being the retrieval of judicial decisions relevant to a particular legal question. The collection is made available at ielab.io/caselaw.
