Testing students' programming skills remains a challenge for courses that teach beginning programming. This paper describes the introduction of a laboratory final examination into a CS1 course. We present our approach to a lab final and present initial evidence indicating the effectiveness of the lab final. We also describe the problems encountered and solutions to those problems, which may benefit others interested in instituting a similar exam.
