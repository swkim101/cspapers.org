Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used for sequential data processing. Recent state-of-the-art video deblurring methods bank on convolutional recurrent neural network architectures to exploit the temporal relationship between neighboring frames. In this work, we aim to improve the accuracy of recurrent models by adapting the hidden states transferred from past frames to the frame being processed so that the relations between video frames could be better used. We iteratively update the hidden state via re-using RNN cell parameters before predicting an output deblurred frame. Since we use existing parameters to update the hidden state, our method improves accuracy without additional modules. As the architecture remains the same regardless of iteration number, fewer iteration models can be considered as a partial computational path of the models with more iterations. To take advantage of this property, we employ a stochastic method to optimize our iterative models better. At training time, we randomly choose the iteration number on the fly and apply a regularization loss that favors less computation unless there are considerable reconstruction gains. We show that our method exhibits state-of-the-art video deblurring performance while operating in real-time speed.
