Many applications in distributed systems rely on underlying lossless networks to achieve required performance. Existing lossless network solutions propose different hop-by-hop flow controls to guarantee zero packet loss. However, another crucial problem called network deadlock occurs concomitantly. Once the system traps in a deadlock, a large part of network would be disabled. Existing deadlock avoidance solutions focus all their attentions on breaking the cyclic buffer dependency to eliminate circular wait (one necessary condition of deadlock). These solutions, however, impose many restrictions on network configurations and side-effects on performance. In this work, we explore a brand-new perspective to solve network deadlock: avoiding hold and wait situation (another necessary condition). Experimental observations tell that frequent pause on upstream ports driven by existing flow control schemes is the root cause of hold and wait. We propose Gentle Flow Control (GFC) to manipulate the port rate at a fine granularity, so all ports can keep packets flowing even cyclic buffer dependency exists, and prove GFC can eliminate deadlock theoretically. We also present how to implement GFC in mainstream lossless networks (Converged Enhanced Ethernet and InfiniBand) with moderate modifications. Furthermore, testbed experiments and packet-level simulations validate GFC can efficiently avoid deadlock and introduce less than 0.5% of bandwidth occupation.
