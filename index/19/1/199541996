Key design and operation parameters of the system for magnetically guided actuation of miniature robots on planar surfaces are analyzed and discussed. The study is carried out on the numerical analysis and also on the experimental measurement on the prototype of the system. Special attention is paid to robot actuation under uncertainty, which can be caused by both external and internal effects. A technique based on a superposition of actuation and lock-up field is proposed.
