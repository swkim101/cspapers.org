We propose an efficient spatio-temporal model for mobile autonomous robots operating in human populated environments. Our method aims to model periodic temporal patterns of people presence, which are based on peoplesâ€™ routines and habits. The core idea is to project the time onto a set of wrapped dimensions that represent the periodicities of people presence. Extending a 2D spatial model with this multidimensional representation of time results in a memory efficient spatio-temporal model. This model is capable of long-term predictions of human presence, allowing mobile robots to schedule their services better and to plan their paths. The experimental evaluation, performed over datasets gathered by a robot over a period of several weeks, indicates that the proposed method achieves more accurate predictions than the previous state of the art used in robotics.
