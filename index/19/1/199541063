Ability of autonomous vehicles to operate in complex dynamic environments requires, among other things, fast and accurate perception of surroundings, which includes recognition and tracking of traffic signs.For development and testing of modern sophisticated computer vision systems large and diverse datasets are of the major importance. To test the robustness of algorithms, image data with different moving speeds, camera settings, lighting and weather conditions are especially important.In this work we present a comprehensive, lifelike dataset of traffic sign images collected on the Russian winter roads in varying conditions, which include different weather, camera exposure, illumination and moving speeds. The dataset was annotated in accordance with the Russian traffic code. Annotation results and images are published under open CC BY 4.0 license and can be downloaded from the project website: http://oscar.skoltech.ru/.
