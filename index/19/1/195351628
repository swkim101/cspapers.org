NAVER, Korea's No. 1 internet company, and LINE, the Japan-based global messenger platform, have teamed up to use their extensive online content databases (documents, maps, encyclopedia, etc.) and user information to develop an AI platform called Clova (Cloud-based Virtual Assistant). Clova's deep-learning based methods have made tremendous progress in image classification and intelligent Q&A response. For example, in Naver, users can procure product or location information by showing pictures. Keyword-based matching is enhanced using semantic analysis, and retrieving top links is changed to answering questions by refining user queries through dialogue. In addition to PC and mobile, Clova is evolving to enable a user to access the relevant information using multiple devices and interfaces. Line released a smart speaker called Clova Friends that includes Line's free voice-call function and infrared home-appliance control. IPTV set-top box powered-by the Clova AI platform which can recommend movies based on Naver's user reviews. In this talk, I will cover some efforts and challenges in understanding and satisfying users on each device with sophisticated natural language processing technologies. I will introduce the technically challenging problems that we are currently tackling and future AI developments.
