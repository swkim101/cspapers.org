This text describes the rise of discursive forms 
in Latin American society since the so-called 
Washington Consensus until today and their 
implications for the national cultural industries 
field. The paper is divided into two sections. The 
first discusses the category of cosmopolitics, a 
neologism that seeks to emphasize the economic and 
political models of actions and their connections with 
contemporary sensibilities. The second is focused 
on debates about media and the virtualization of 
Latin American, a sort of reorganization process 
involving institutions and identities that surpasses a 
former system of representation based on national 
cronotopos, seeking to achieve new cognitive patterns 
in the media. It deals with physical immigration and 
the migration of tastes, as well as new structures of 
cultural agency and production, and new modalities 
of consumption and symbolic reproduction.
