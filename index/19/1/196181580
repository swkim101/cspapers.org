We show that sampling latent variables multiple times at a gradient step helps in improving a variational autoencoder and propose a simple and effective method to better exploit these latent variables through hidden state averaging. Consistent gains in performance on two different datasets, Penn Treebank and Yahoo, indicate the generalizability of our method.
