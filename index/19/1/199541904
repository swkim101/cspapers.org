In robotic surgery the motion of instruments and the laparoscopic camera is constrained by their insertion ports, i. e. a remote centre of motion (RCM). We propose a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) approach that estimates laparoscopic camera motion under RCM constraints. To achieve this we derive a minimal solver for the absolute camera pose given two 2D-3D point correspondences (RCM-PnP) and also a bundle adjustment optimiser that refines camera poses within an RCM-constrained parameterisation. These two methods are used together with previous work on relative pose estimation under RCM [1] to assemble a SLAM pipeline suitable for robotic surgery. Our simulations show that RCM-PnP outperforms conventional PnP for a wide noise range in the RCM position. Results with video footage from a robotic prostatectomy show that RCM constraints significantly improve camera pose estimation.
