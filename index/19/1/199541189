In this study, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop optimization approach for exoskeleton robot control. We develop a method to optimize widely-used Electromyography (EMG)-based assistive strategies. If we use multiple EMG channels to control multi-DoF robots, optimization process becomes complex and requires a large amount of data. To make the optimization tractable, we exploit the synergies both of the human muscles and artificial muscles of the exoskeleton robots to reduce the number of parameters of the assistive strategies. We show that we can extract the synergies not only from the user’s muscle activities but from pneumatic artificial muscle (PAMs) contractions of the exoskeleton robot. Then, we adopt a Bayesian optimization method to acquire the parameters for assisting human movements by iteratively identifying the user’s preferences of the assistive strategies. We conducted experiments to evaluate our proposed method with a PAMs-driven upper-limb exoskeleton robot. Our method successfully learned assistive strategies from the human-in-theloop optimization with a practicable number of interactions.
