This paper presents a fast approach for vision-based self-localization in RoboCup. The vision system extracts the features required for localization without processing the whole image and is a fist step towards independence of lighting conditions. In the field of self-localization, some new ideas are added to the well-known Monte Carlo localization approach that increase both stability and reactivity, while keeping the processing time low.
