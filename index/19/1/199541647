In this paper, we present a novel approach for surgical task segmentation. A segmentation policy learns the correlations between features and segmentation points from manually labeled data. The most correlated features and rules for segmenting them are identified and learned. These form a complete set of segmentation policy. The proposed approach is developed to segment new but similar tasks through transfer learning. It is verified through applying the segmentation rule learned from the labeled data to segment other tasks. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated by comparing the results against the ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve high segmentation rates with an accuracy of between 68.8% - 81.8%.
