Enlightened by task resumption behaviors in cross-session search, we explore information resumption behaviors in cross-device search. In order to find important features of information resumption behaviors, we conducted a user experiment and modeled information resumption behaviors using machine learning. The model of C5.0 Decision Tree outperformed and showed that features of FamiliarityScores, AveEditDistance, AveQueryEffectiveRate and ValidClickRate are of importance.
