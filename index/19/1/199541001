The particularly compliant and adaptable properties of soft robotic systems and structures offer enormous potential for use in unpredictable environments as well as for safe and interactive work in human environments. Therefore, new approaches for the design of soft robotic systems are constantly being introduced in this still emerging field of research. Through the use of additive manufacturing methods, it is possible to design systems specifically for an individual task. In this paper we present an approach for an automated design process for monolithic soft robotic structures that can assume pre-defined end poses. The idea thereby is to design simple individualizable systems that are 3D-printable and require a minimum number of actuators. Using the automated design process, we could already generate soft robotic systems for different applications which show promising properties.
