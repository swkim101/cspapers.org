The paper investigates the relationship between knowledge representation languages P-log [Baral et al., 2004] and LPMLN [Lee et al., 2015] designed for representing and reasoning with logic and probability. We give a translation from an important subset of LPMLN to P-log which preserves probabilistic functions defined by LPMLN programs and complements recent research [Lee and Wang, 2016] by the authors of LPMLN where they give a similar translation from a subset of P-log to their language. This work sheds light on the different ways to treat inconsistency in both languages.
