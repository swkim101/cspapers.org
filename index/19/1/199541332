Fluidic transmission mechanisms use fluids to transmit force through conduits. We previously presented a transmission mechanism called solid-media transmission (SMT), which uses conduits filled with spheres and spacers for push-only bidirectional transmission. In this paper, we present new designs of SMT-actuated one-degree-of-freedom (DoF) and two-degree-of-freedom positioning manipulators, and report experiment studies to assess their performance. In these studies, closed-loop position control was performed with a PI controller and/or master-slave control. With braided PTFE tubing, SMT exhibited sub-millimeter accuracy, with a tolerance of Â±0.05 mm for the tested transmission lines with lengths up to 4m.
