This paper describes development of a controllerfor bilateral robotic system for tele-echography with delayed communications. The system comprises two identical 6DOF robotic devices based on Stewart-Gough mechanisms, which were developed especially for the sake of the considered application. Controller design is facilitated by a symmetry of the teleoperation setup, in which the master and slave devices have identical geometry, actuation and measurement arrays. To further simplify the analysis, we treat coupling between degrees of freedom as exogenous disturbances and this allows us to split the control problem into six independent IDOF settings. The IDOF problems are addressed then using a novel approach to bilateral teleoperation control, based on a complete parameterization of feasible teleoperators. It allows to intuitively shape teleoperator performance while guaranteeing passivity and thus coupled stability of the system. The potential of the proposed control method is demonstrated with experimental results.
