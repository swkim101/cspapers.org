This paper describes Algorithma 98 which has three fundamental features: walkthroughs, animations, and availability of source code and documentation. The first two features allow the user to exercise the algorithm in a step-by-step manner while viewing its animation. The third feature makes Algorithma 98 an open system that can be improved and extended by another developer. This paper also describes the object-oriented software process that was used in developing Algorithma 98 to support its extensibility and reusability.
