We describe the infrastructure we have created for a large enrollment (1700 / semester) non-major course. The course combines collaborative, lab-based problem-solving instruction with modified mastery-learning assessment. The infrastructure supports continuous improvement to respond to client department needs, incoming student experience, course design flaws and computing platform upgrades.
