A city is an aggregate of a huge amount of heterogeneous data. However, extracting meaningful values from that data remains challenging. City Brain is an end-to-end system whose goal is to glean irreplaceable values from big city data, specifically from videos, with the assistance of rapidly evolving AI technologies and fast-growing computing capacity. From cognition to optimization, to decision-making, from search to prediction and ultimately, to intervention, City Brain improves the way we manage the city, as well as the way we live in it. In this talk, firstly we will introduce current practices of the City Brain platform in a few cities in China, including what we can do to achieve the goal and make it a reality. Then we will focus on visual search technologies and applications that we can apply on the city data. Last, a few video demos will be shown, followed by highlighting a few future directions of city computing.
