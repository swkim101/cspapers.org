The observation of social media provides an important complementing source of information about an unfolding event such as a crisis situation. For this purpose we have developed and demonstrate Sover!, a system to monitor real-time dynamic events via Twitter targeting the needs of aid organizations. At its core it builds upon an effective adaptive crawler, which combines two social media streams in a Bayesian inference framework and after each time-window updates the probabilities of whether given keywords are relevant for an event. Sover! also exposes the crawling functionality so a user can actively influence the evolving selection of keywords. The crawling activity feeds a rich dashboard, which enables the user to get a better understanding of a crisis situation as it unfolds in real-time.
