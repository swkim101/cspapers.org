Autonomous vehicles are increasingly being used in the underground mining industry, but competition and a challenging market is placing pressure for further improvements in autonomous vehicle technology with respect to cost, infrastructure requirements, robustness in varied environments and versatility. In this pa- per we introduce several new vision-based techniques for visual place recognition on under- ground mining vehicles that improve on cur- rent available technologies while only requiring camera input. We present a Shannon Entropy- based salience generation approach that enhances the performance of single image-based place recognition by selectively processing image regions. We then add a learning-based scheme realised by Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that filters problematic images from both the reference map databases and from live processing. We evaluate the approaches on new large real-world underground vehicle mining datasets, demonstrating âˆ¼ 107% improvement in area under the precision-recall curve than a state-of-the-art place recognition algorithm, and demonstrate its generality on a non- mining-based benchmark dataset. Together this research serves as a step forward in developing domain-appropriate improvements to existing state-of-the-art place recognition algorithms that will hopefully lead to improved efficiencies in the mining industries.
