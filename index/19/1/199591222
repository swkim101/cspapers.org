This paper identifies and analyses the constitution of a new cyberspace cartography, whose differential consists of not being just a mapping of the places and data of the informational space, but especially a monitoring and a surveillance of the users and their routes in this space. Starting from this monitoring, the tracks left on the Web are ordered and classified in databases, making possible the construction of profiles about behavioral standards, preferences and desires of countless individuals and/or groups. The several Google services are today the biggest and more efficient example of this cartography, constituting our privileged object of analysis. We intent to show how this cartography of the cyberspace is at the same time a taxonomy of the users and a simulation of their identities, whose central feature resides in its performative dimension.
