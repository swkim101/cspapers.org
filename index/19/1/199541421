Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery allows for easy recording of kinematic data, and presents excellent opportunities for data-intensive approaches to assessment of surgical skill, system design, and automation of procedures. However, typical surgical cases result in long data streams, and therefore, automated segmentation into gestures is important. The public release of the JIGSAWS dataset allowed for developing and benchmarking data-intensive segmentation algorithms. However, this dataset is small and the gestures are similar in their structure and directions. This may limit the generalization of the algorithms to real surgical data that are characterized by movements in arbitrary directions. In this paper, we use a recurrent neural network to segment a suturing task, and demonstrate one such generalization problem-limited generalization to rotation. We propose a simple augmentation that can solve this problem without collecting new data, and demonstrate its benefit using: (1) the JIGSAWS dataset, and (2) a new dataset that we recorded with a da Vinci Research Kit. Our study highlights the prospect of using data augmentation in the analysis of kinematic data in surgical data science.
