This paper presents a new method to efficiently monitor localization safety in mobile robots. Localization safety is quantified by measuring the systemâ€™s integrity risk, which is a well-known aviation performance metric. However, aviation integrity monitoring solutions almost exclusively rely on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) while robot navigation usually needs the additional information provided by a state evolution model and/or relative positioning sensors, which makes previously established approaches impractical. In response, this paper develops an efficient integrity monitoring methodology applicable to Kalman Filter-based localization. The work is intended for life-or mission-critical operations such as co-robot applications where ignoring the impact of faults can jeopardize human safety.
