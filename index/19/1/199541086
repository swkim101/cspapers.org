This paper investigates strategies for 3D multi-agent position control using a shared control input and self-propelled agents. The only control inputs allowed are rotation commands that rotate all agents by the same rotation matrix. In the 2D case, only two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) in position are controllable. We review controllability results in 2D, and then show that interesting things happen in 3D. We provide control laws for steering up to nine DOF in position, which can be mapped in various ways, including to control the x, y, z position of three agents, make four agents meet, or reduce the spread of ${n}$ agents.
