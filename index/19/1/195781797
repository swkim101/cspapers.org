We address the problem of “fail-slow” fault, a fault where a hardware or software component can still function (does not fail-stop) but in much lower performance than expected. To address this, we built IASO, a peer-based, non-intrusive fail-slow detection framework that has been deployed for more than 1.5 years across 39,000 nodes in our customer sites and helped our customers reduce major outages due to fail-slow incidents. IASO primarily works based on timeout signals (a negligible overhead of monitoring) and converts them into a stable and accurate fail-slow metric. IASO can quickly and accurately isolate a slow node within minutes. Within a 7-month period, IASO managed to catch 232 failslow incidents in our large deployment field. In this paper, we have also assembled a large dataset of 232 fail-slow incidents along with our analysis. We found that the fail-slow annual failure rate in our field is 1.02%.
