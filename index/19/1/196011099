The technology to produce communication is in the hands of the public, and the internet radicalized this trend in the last decade. It is in this way that the fanfiction phenomenon proliferates; it is the practical to write stories based on ficcional universes - characters, scenes and events on fiction - created by third ones and launched in products of the cultural industry, as books, films and TV series. Our objective is to understand a little more about the existing dynamics in the publication of fanfiction on Internet. Over all, to detach the tools that the media offers so that the writers can have their texts published and read in the whole world, with minimum cost and work.
