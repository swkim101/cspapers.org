In this study, a human-chair model was developed as the basis for a wearable chair design. A prototype chair, HUST-EC, was fabricated and evaluated. Employing the optimization under an inner point penalty function, an optimized simulation of the operating mode with the lowest chair height was implemented. The solid models were established by using the finite element analysis program embedded in Solidworks, which revealed that the support from the designed chair was steady to the user. An electromyography (EMG) test platform has been developed, consisting of four EMG sensors, a MATLAB-based acquisition software, and a loaded vest. Four healthy subjects participated in the evaluation experiment, in which EMGs were collected from the muscle groups of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis under different loads and chair angles. The experimental data demonstrate that (1) the HUST-EC can greatly reduce muscle activation at a variety of loads and bending angles; (2) under the same load, the muscle activation decreases slightly with an increased bending angle; and (3) at the same bending angle, muscle activation increases slightly with an increased load. The results show that the designed chair can effectively reduce the physical burden in workers and may improve work efficiency.
