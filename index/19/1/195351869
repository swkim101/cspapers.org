Social data is a rich data source for identifying trends and topics of interest based on user activity. Social data also provides opportunities to collect numerical data about events like elections, sport games, disasters or economic news. We propose the problem of identifying relevant quantitative information from social data as annotations for a topic. We investigate how to extract quantitative information and perform a number of experiments and analysis with Twitter data.
