User-generated comments and tags can reveal important visual concepts associated with an image in Flickr. However, due to the inherent noisiness of the metadata, not all user tags are necessarily descriptive of the image. Likewise, comments may contain spam or chatter that are irrelevant to the image. Hence, identifying and ranking relevant tags and comments can boost applications such as tag-based image search, tag recommendation, etc. In this paper, we present a lightweight visual signature-based model to concurrently generate ranked lists of comments and tags of a social image based on their joint relevance to the visual features, user comments, and user tags. The proposed model is based on sparse reconstruction of the visual content of an image using its tags and comments. Through empirical study on Flickr dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed technique against state-of-the-art tag ranking and refinement techniques.
