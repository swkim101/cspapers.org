The possibility of adapting online the way a robot interacts with the environment is becoming more and more important. In this paper we introduce the tank based admittance controller. We show that all the admittance controllers can be modeled as an energy optimization problem and then we introduce a novel admittance control strategy that allows to change online the interactive behavior while preserving a stable interaction with the environment. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is experimentally validated.
