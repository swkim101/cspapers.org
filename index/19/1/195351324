The concept of surprise is central to human learning and development. However, compared to accuracy, surprise has received little attention in the IR community, yet it is an essential component of the information seeking process. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners of IR to discuss the topic of computational surprise, to set a research agenda, and to examine how to build datasets for research into this fascinating topic. The themes in this workshop include discussion of what can be learned from some well-known surprise models in other fields, such as Bayesian surprise; how to evaluate surprise based on user experience; and how computational surprise is related to the newly emerging areas, such as fake news detection, computational contradiction, clickbait detection, etc.
