Airbnb is an online marketplace which connects hosts and guests all over the world. Our inventory includes over 4.5 million listings, which enable the travel of over 300 million guests. The growth team at Airbnb is responsible for helping travelers find Airbnb, in part by participating in ad auctions on major search platforms such as Google and Bing. In this talk, we will describe how ad- vertising efficiently on these platforms requires solving several information retrieval and machine learning problems, including query understanding, click value estimation, and realtime pacing of our expenditure.
