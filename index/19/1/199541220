We pose the problem of path-constrained trajectory generation for the synchronous motion of multi-robot systems as a non-linear optimization problem. Our method determines appropriate parametric representation for the configuration variables, generates an approximate solution as a starting point for the optimization method, and uses successive refinement techniques to solve the problem in a computationally efficient manner. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method on challenging simulation and physical experiments with high degrees of freedom robotic systems.
