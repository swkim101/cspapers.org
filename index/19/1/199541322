This paper suggests reflections can be practically useful if they are included in planning for collision capable robot platforms. By modifying a proven strategy for navigation with reflections we maintain global convergence results and reach the goal in less time. An algorithm for identifying reflection surfaces for a given cell decomposition is reported. Baseline and reflected scenarios are compared for two different cell decompositions. Omnipuck, a reflection capable omnidirectional robot meant to store and release impact energy, is used to obtain experimental results and draw conclusions for future work.
