Our main goal is studying the merits of using inter-passage similarities for the task of focused retrieval; i.e., ranking passages in documents by their relevance to an information need expressed by a query. As an initial research direction we study the cluster hypothesis for passage (focused) retrieval. We propose a novel suite of cluster hypothesis tests that employ inter-passage similarities and demonstrate that the cluster hypothesis holds for passages. In addition, we present several future directions we intend to pursue.
