Weakly supervised learning has attracted growing research attention due to the significant saving in annotation cost for tasks that require intra-image annotations, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. To this end, existing weakly supervised object detection and semantic segmentation approaches follow an iterative label mining and model training pipeline. However, such a self-enforcement pipeline makes both tasks easy to be trapped in local minimums. In this paper, we join weakly supervised object detection and segmentation tasks with a multi-task learning scheme for the first time, which uses their respective failure patterns to complement each other's learning. Such cross-task enforcement helps both tasks to leap out of their respective local minimums. In particular, we present an efficient and effective framework termed Weakly Supervised Joint Detection and Segmentation (WS-JDS). WS-JDS has two branches for the above two tasks, which share the same backbone network. In the learning stage, it uses the same cyclic training paradigm but with a specific loss function such that the two branches benefit each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the widely-used Pascal VOC and COCO benchmarks, which demonstrate that our model has achieved competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
