The ongoing development of the Inverted PENdulum Type Assistant Robot (I-PENTAR) is being undertaken by the authors. The I-PENTAR has many tasks like lifting objects with unknown mass, pushing and pulling a carts and many more. During execution of these tasks unknown disturbances enter the system and cause dynamic responses and errors. Most notably, the wheels of the robot move with excessively transients. To alleviate this problem, a strain gauge based sensor is attached to the existing structure of the robot to gain information regarding the disturbances. This allows minimal change to the system design while improving robustness to disturbances. In this paper the development of the sensor, the corresponding model and a method of updating the existing purely estimation based control is presented together with tests.
