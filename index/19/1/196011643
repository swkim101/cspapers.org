This article deals with the mediatization of the political discourse in Belo Horizonte’s municipal electoral campaign in 2008, more specifically, of the discursive strategies of (de)construction of mobilized images by two of the candidates.

In the case, to examine a complex strategy of negative campaign in YouTube’s environment: a parodist satire that uses the free political electoral programs (Horario Gratuito Politico Eleitoral - HGPE) of the adversary, in a metadiscursive level; either by appealing to the massive popular aesthetics and the language as an image construction strategy in television programs. It also interests us to show how these media strategies, so contemporary, covered the old and traditional populist speech.
