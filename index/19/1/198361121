Keyword spotting (KWS) is defined as the problem of detecting all instances of a given word, provided by the user either as a query word image (Query-by-Example, QbE) or a query word string (Query-by-String, QbS) in a body of digitized documents. Keyword detection is typically preceded by a preprocessing step where the text is segmented into text lines (line-level KWS). Methods following this paradigm are monopolized by test-time computationally expensive handwritten text recognition (HTR)-based approaches; furthermore, they typically cannot handle image queries (QbE). In this work, we propose a time and storage-efficient, deep feature-based approach that enables both the image and textual search options. Three distinct components, all modeled as neural networks, are combined: normalization, feature extraction and representation of image and textual input into a common space. These components, even if designed on word level image representations, collaborate in order to achieve an efficient line level keyword spotting system. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is on par with state-of-the-art KWS methods.
