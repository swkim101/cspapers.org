In this paper, a novel magnetic manipulation system using mobile coils for remote actuation of magnetic untethered devices in an enlarged workspace is proposed and studied. A parallel mechanism is implemented to actuate the mobile coils. A proof-of-concept prototype is designed and constructed, namely the DeltaMag, which includes three electromagnetic coils for generating magnetic fields and three motors for actuation of the coils. It has good space utilization: ratio between the diameter of the workspace and the diameter of the whole prototype reaches 0.7.A calibrated mathematical model is developed for the field distribution of a single coil, which has an average error of 8.75%. Then, we introduce a calculation method for the 3D magnetic field at any working position for the configuration of multiple parallel mobile coils. Moreover, an embedded system is established for actuating the parallel mechanism, whose pose is fed back via serial communication for magnetic field computation. A vision based approach is developed for closed-loop control of the parallel mechanism. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate the capabilities of the DeltaMag for manipulation of a magnetic catheter mock-up and a magnetic capsule mock-up in a workspace with a diameter more than 200 mm.
