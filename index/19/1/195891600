Testing Android applications is becoming more and more challenging due to the notorious fragmentation issues and the complexity of usage scenarios in different environments. Crowdsourced testing has grown as a trend, especially in mobile application testing. However, due to the lack of professionalism and communication, the crowd workers tend to submit low-quality and duplicate bug reports, leading to a waste of test resources on inspecting and aggregating such reports. To solve these problems, we developed a platform, CoCoTest, embracing the idea of collective intelligence. With the help of CoCoTest Android SDK, workers can efficiently capture a screenshot, write a short description and create a bug report. A series of bug reports are aggregated online and then recommended to the other workers in real time. The crowdsourced workers can (1) help review, verify and enrich each others' bug reports; (2) escape duplicate bug reports; (3) be guided to conduct more professional testing with the help of collective intelligence. CoCoTest can improve the quality of the final report and reduce test costs. The demo video can be found at https://youtu.be/PuVuPbNP4tY.
