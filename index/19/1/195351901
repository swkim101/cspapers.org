Wireless cameras are widely deployed in surveillance systems for security guarding. However, the privacy concerns associated with unauthorized videotaping, are drawing an increasing attention recently. Existing detection methods for unauthorized wireless cameras are either limited by their detection accuracy or requiring dedicated devices. In this paper, we propose DeWiCam, a lightweight and effective detection mechanism using smartphones. The basic idea of DeWiCam is to utilize the intrinsic traffic patterns of flows from wireless cameras. Compared with traditional traffic pattern analysis, DeWiCam is more challenging because it cannot access the encrypted information in the data packets. Yet, DeWiCam overcomes the difficulty and can detect nearby wireless cameras reliably. To further identify whether a camera is in an interested room, we propose a human-assisted identification model. We implement DeWiCam on the Android platform and evaluate it with extensive experiments on 20 cameras. The evaluation results show that DeWiCam can detect cameras with an accuracy of 99% within 2.7 s.
