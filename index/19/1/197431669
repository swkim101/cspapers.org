We present a method for computing the 3D motion of articulated models from 2D correspondences. An iterative batch algorithm is proposed which estimates the maximum aposteriori trajectory based on the 2D measurements subject to a number of constraints. These include (i) kinematic constraints based on a 3D kinematic model, (ii) joint angle limits, (iii) dynamic smoothing and (iv) 3D key frames which can be specified the user. The framework handles any variation in the number of constraints as well as partial or missing data. This method is shown to obtain favorable reconstruction results on a number of complex human motion sequences.
