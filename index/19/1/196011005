This paper is an essay about the iconoclast gesture and its circumscription in the media horizon. It describes briefly some historical episodes that dealt over controversies upon the semiotic status of image and identifies three aspects of the new conditions determined by the culture of media: a) the demands of visibility; b) the paradox of destruction; and c) the media circulation of memory. We depart from the theory of image elaborated by German scholar Hans Belting and also from French philosopher Bruno Latour's contributions.
