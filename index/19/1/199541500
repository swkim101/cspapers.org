Vehicle detection from short-range aerial image faces challenges including vehicle blocking, irrelevant object interference, motion blurring, color variation etc., leading to the difficulty to achieve high detection accuracy and real-time detection speed. In this paper, benefiting from the recent development in MobileNet family network engineering, we propose a compressed MobileNet which is not only internally resistant to the above listed challenges but also gains the best detection accuracy/speed tradeoff when comparing with the original MobileNet. In a nutshell, we reduce the bottleneck architecture number during the feature map downsampling stage but add more bottlenecks during the feature map plateau stage, neither extra FLOPs nor parameters are thus involved but reduced inference time and better accuracy are expected. We conduct experiment on our collected 5-k short-range aerial images, containing six vehicle categories: truck, car, bus, bicycle, motorcycle, crowded bicycles and crowded motorcycles. Our proposed compressed MobileNet achieves 110 FPS (GPU), 31 FPS (CPU) and 15 FPS (mobile phone), 1.2 times faster and 2% more accurate (mAP) than the original MobileNet.
