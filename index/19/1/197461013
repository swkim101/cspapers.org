We study the problem of designing polyno- mial prediction algorithms for learning binary relations. We study these problems under an on-line model in which the instances are drawn by the learner, by a helpful teacher, by an adversary or according to a probability distribution on the instance space. We represent the relation as an n x m binary matrix, and present results for when the matrix is restricted to have at most k distinct row types, and when it is constrained by requiring that the predicate form a total order.
