Fake documentaries in found footage style have been consolidated as one of the most prolific subgenres of horror cinema. In the area of sound design, this subgenre pushes the creative boundaries toward an aesthetic that, unlike traditional fiction, emphasizes a certain degree of technical imperfection.
