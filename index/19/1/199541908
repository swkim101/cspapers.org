Remoras employ their adhesive discs to rapidly attach to and detach from a wide range of marine surfaces. By analyzing high-speed images of remoras’ (Echeneis naucrates) hitchhiking behavior, we describe the fish’s detachment mechanism as a lip curling up to break the seal between the disc and substrate. By mimicking the kinematic and morphological properties of the biological disc, we fabricated a multi-material biomimetic disc (whose stiffness spans four orders of magnitude) that is capable of both attachment and detachment. Detachment is realized by a flexible cable-driven mechanism that curls the anterior region of the silicone soft lip, allows leakage under the disc, and equalizes the internal pressure to the external pressure. The disc lamellae with attached carbon fiber spinules can be rotated by hydraulic soft actuators whose internal pressure is precisely tuned to the ambient underwater pressure. During attachment, increasing the rotational angle of the lamellae and the preload of the disc significantly enhanced the adhesive forces. We found that curling up the soft lip and folding down the lamellae rapidly reduced the pulling force of the disc by a factor of 254 compared to that under the attached state, which lead to detachment. Based on these mechanisms, underwater maneuvers involving repeated attachment and detachment were demonstrated with an integrated ROV unit that had a self-contained actuation and control system for the disc. This study lays a foundation for the development of fully untethered robotic systems for underwater hitchhiking in real-world marine environments.
