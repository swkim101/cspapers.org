This article aims to discuss aspects of the horror genre in five feature films made in Sao Paulo in the 50’s. These movies, inspired by what Mary Ann Doane (1987) called "paranoid woman's films" made in Hollywood in the 1940s, may have had some influence on horror brazilian films, including the seminal At midnight I’ll take your soul (1964), by Jose Mojica Marins, considered the first and greatest representative of the horror genre in brazilian cinema.
