On the basis of constructing the safety assessment index system of aerial ground support, natural weight and variable weight theory are introduced according with the dynamic and fuzzy nature of the index. The weight of index can be calculated and adjusted to solve the problem effectively of reducing the risk grade of system because of some lower index weight being neutralized by others. Then using extensible method to make the connection normalized, and subordinate degree matrix of the positive and negative index fields to safety level is set up based on both-branch fuzzy model, in order to optimize and show the importance of the factor in the assessment system. Finally, characteristic value of system comprehensive connection number is calculated by characteristic formula, the assessment level of the system is determined. Index system and this method are applied to one aerial ground support of Jinan airport, results are rational and accurate. Reference basis is provided for deep development of safety asse...
