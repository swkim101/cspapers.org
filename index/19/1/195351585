A new educational service has been prototyped by Echo360 that uses natural language processing to analyze students notes and provide personalized recommendations on how to both improve note-taking and scaffold learning. The LessonWare middleware system uses computer-generated transcriptions from class captures and available student notes to identify key terms mentioned during class sessions. The combination of analyzed key terms and corresponding timestamps allows contextual linkages to be created between educational resources. Student notes are automatically augmented with corresponding moments in class captures, specific pages in the course eTextbook or open education resources or specific adaptive learning assets.
