Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is one of the most successful applications of surgical robots. Although the introduction of robotic technology has brought a number of benefits, further advancements in MIS are limited by the size and bending radius of instruments. In this paper, we present a compliant four degree-of-freedom manipulator that consists of elastic elements with partly thinner structures. The proposed mechanism allows the elastic element to deform locally, thus minimizing its bending radius while the low number of mechanical parts greatly contributes to its compactness. This paper describes the design strategy, optimization method using FEA, prototype implementation, and evaluations. The evaluations reveal high accuracy and repeat accuracy, which are key elements for robotic instruments in MIS. Further, the prototype is able to exert sufficient force and it is possible to perform a simulated needle insertion task using the manipulator, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed mechanism.
