Dense visual SLAM methods are able to estimate the 3D structure of an environment and locate the observer within them. They estimate the motion of a camera by matching visual information between consecutive frames, and are thus prone to failure under extreme motion conditions or when observing texture-poor regions. The integration of additional sensor modalities has shown great promise in improving the robustness and accuracy of such SLAM systems. In contrast to the popular use of inertial measurements we propose to tightly-couple a dense RGB-D SLAM system with kinematic and odometry measurements from a wheeled robot equipped with a manipulator. The system has real-time capability while running on GPU. It optimizes the camera pose by considering the geometric alignment of the map as well as kinematic and odometric data from the robot. Through experimentation in the real-world, we show that the system is more robust to challenging trajectories featuring fast and loopy motion than the equivalent system without the additional kinematic and odometric knowledge, whilst retaining comparable performance to the equivalent RGB-D only system on easy trajectories.
