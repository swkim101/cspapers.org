This article analyzes journalistic mediation and the universe of individuals in the Brazilian democratic process considering the influence of digital technologies. We begin from the principle that the global computer network has changed the way journalism is conducted, by incorporating citizens as producers and consumers of information. The journalistic coverage of the Ficha Limpa [Clean Record] episode by the website Congresso em Foco [Focus on Congress], produced in Brasilia, was the scenario for the case study. Based in the methodological field of Depth Hermeneutics, the study revealed that the possibilities for interaction between subjects create new contours in the historic position of journalists as mediators of public debate. The study perceives a communication based on intersubjectivity, in which a common and collective situation can connect citizens and journalists.
