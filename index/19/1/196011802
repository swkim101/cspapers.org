Neuroscience and brain images are becoming increasingly socially relevant. The purpose of this paper is to analyze contemporary technologies of visualizing the human brain from a political perspective. Based on Foucauldian concepts it develops a historical comparison by studying the regimes of visibility that subject the body. It begins by approaching the experience of disease produced by clinical medicine, then it examines one of the contemporary modes of body care, namely the media-neuroscience alliance. Finally, it argues that the increasing intensification of visualization of the body cannot be reduced to a function of a refined technological apparatus; it entails a significant transformation in the experience of disease that goes hand in hand with the blurring of limits between normality and abnormality.
