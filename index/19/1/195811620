Cyber attacks against IoT devices are a severe threat. These attacks exploit software vulnerabilities in IoT ﬁrmware. Fuzzing is an effective software testing technique for vulnerability discovery. In this work, we present F IRM -AFL, the ﬁrst high-throughput greybox fuzzer for IoT ﬁrmware. F IRM - AFL addresses two fundamental problems in IoT fuzzing. First, it addresses compatibility issues by enabling fuzzing for POSIX-compatible ﬁrmware that can be emulated in a system emulator. Second, it addresses the performance bottleneck caused by system-mode emulation with a novel technique called augmented process emulation. By combining system-mode emulation and user-mode emulation in a novel way, augmented process emulation provides high compatibility as system-mode emulation and high throughput as user-mode emulation. Our evaluation results show that (1) F IRM -AFL is fully functional and capable of ﬁnding real-world vulnerabilities in IoT programs; (2) the throughput of F IRM -AFL is on average 8.2 times higher than system-mode emulation based fuzzing; and (3) F IRM -AFL is able to ﬁnd 1-day vulnerabilities much faster than system-mode emulation based fuzzing, and is able to ﬁnd 0-day vulnerabilities.
