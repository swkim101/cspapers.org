As the most important organs of sense, human eyes perceive 80% information from our surroundings. Eyeball movement is closely related to our brain health condition. Eyeball movement and eye blink are also widely used as an efficient human-computer interaction scheme for paralyzed individuals to communicate with others. Traditional methods mainly use intrusive EOG sensors or cameras to capture eye activity information. In this work, we propose a system named SmartLens to achieve eye activity sensing using zero-power contact lens. To make it happen, we develop dedicated antenna design which can be fitted in an extremely small space and still work efficiently to reach a working distance more than 1 m. To accurately track eye movements in the presence of strong self-interference, we employ another tag to track the user's head movement and cancel it out to support sensing a walking or moving user. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. At a distance of 1.4 m, the proposed system can achieve an average accuracy of detecting the basic eye movement and blink at 89.63% and 82%, respectively.
