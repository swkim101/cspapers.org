In this demonstration, we suggest lightweight haptic communications from the context of remote neurorehabilitation. In particular, we collect tactile data from pressure sensors attached to the human hand and design a classifier to determine the objects that an individual holds or grasps. Finally, we have implemented the proposed system on Raspberry Pi and demonstrated a personalized classification while rendering the haptic feedback in a virtual perception.
