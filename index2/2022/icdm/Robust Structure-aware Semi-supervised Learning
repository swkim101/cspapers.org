We present a novel unified framework robust structure-aware semi-supervised learning called Unified RSSL (URSSL) which is robust to both outliers and noisy labels where the ground truth of the corrupted labels can be either within or out of training sets. Particularly, URSSL applies joint semi-supervised dimensionality reduction with robust estimators and network sparse regularization simultaneously on the graph Laplacian matrix iteratively to preserve the intrinsic graph structure and ensure robustness to the compound noise. First, in order to relieve the influence from outliers, a novel semi-supervised robust dimensionality reduction is applied relying on robust estimators to suppress outliers. Meanwhile, to tackle noisy labels, the denoised graph similarity information is encoded into the network regularization. Moreover, by identifying strong relevance of dimensionality reduction and network regularization in the context of robust semi-supervised learning (RSSL), a two-step alternative optimization is derived to compute optimal solutions with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of this framework when applied to multiple benchmark datasets with respect to state-of-the-art approaches for important applications in the areas of image classification.
