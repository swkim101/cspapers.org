Network sampling is the task of selecting a subset of nodes and links from a network in a way that preserves its topological properties and other user requirements. This paper investigates the problem of generating an unbiased network sample that contains balanced proportion of nodes from different groups. Creating such a representative sample would require handling the trade-off between ensuring structural preservability and group representativity of the selected nodes. We present a novel max-min subgraph fairness measure that can be used as a unifying framework to combine both criteria. A greedy algorithm is then proposed to generate a fair and representative sample from an initial set of target nodes. A theoretical approximation guarantee for the output of the proposed greedy algorithm based on submodularity and curvature ratios is also presented. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method will generate more fair and representative samples compared to other existing network sampling methods.
