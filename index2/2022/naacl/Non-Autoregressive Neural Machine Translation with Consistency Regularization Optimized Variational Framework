Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is an effective framework to model the interdependency for non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT). One of the prominent VAE-based NAT frameworks, LaNMT, achieves great improvements to vanilla models, but still suffers from two main issues which lower down the translation quality: (1) mismatch between training and inference circumstances and (2) inadequacy of latent representations. In this work, we target on addressing these issues by proposing posterior consistency regularization. Specifically, we first perform stochastic data augmentation on the input samples to better adapt the model for inference circumstance, and then conduct consistency training on posterior latent variables to construct a more robust latent representations without any expansion on latent size. Experiments on En<->De and En<->Ro benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our methods with about 1.5/0.7 and 0.8/0.3 BLEU points improvement to the baseline model with about 12.6\times faster than autoregressive Transformer.
