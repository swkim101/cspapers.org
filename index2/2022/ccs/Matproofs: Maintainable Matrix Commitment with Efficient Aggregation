We present Matproofs, a matrix commitment scheme that allows one to commit to any matrix and then open any subset of the matrix entries. If we encode any vector as a matrix, by committing to the matrix Matproofs may function well as a vector commitment (VC) scheme. We show that Matproofs are simultaneously concise, aggregatable, easily updatable and maintainable. With these promising features, Matproofs give solutions to payment-only stateless cryptocurrencies with lower bandwidth and computational complexity. Compared with Hyperproofs, the only existing VC scheme that is simultaneously aggregatable, easily updatable and maintainable, Matproofs achieve the additional property of conciseness. Furthermore, in the worst case, the proof aggregation and verification in Matproofs are 700x and 10x faster than Hyperproofs, respectively.
