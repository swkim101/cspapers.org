To save costs residential routers often do not implement most of the functionalities and security features of DNS, yet they still contain DNS forwarders which merely proxy the clients' requests to another address. These forwarders separate the network configuration of the internal client network from the network of the ISP. This provides connectivity without the need for synchronization. History of cache poisoning attacks shows however that such simplified implementations expose a wide range of vulnerabilities. We propose to remove DNS from routers. We show that the performance impact is negligible, while security gain is substantial. We discuss a number of ways for implementing our approach
