This article introduces the E-MANAFA energy profiler, a plug-and-play, device-independent, model-based profiler capable of obtaining fine-grained energy measurements on Android devices. Besides having the capability to calculate performance metrics such as the energy consumed and runtime during a time interval, E-MANAFA also allows to estimate the energy consumed by each device component (e.g. CPU, WI-FI, screen). In this article, we present the main elements that compose this framework, as well as its workflow. In order to present the power of this tool, we demonstrate how the tool can measure the overhead of the instrumentation technique used in the PyAnaDroid application benchmarking pipeline, which already supports E-MANAFA to monitor power consumption in its Android application automatic execution process.
