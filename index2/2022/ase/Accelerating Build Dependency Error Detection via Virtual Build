Build scripts play an important role in transforming the source code into executable artifacts. However, the development of build scripts is typically error-prone. As one kind of the most prevalent errors in build scripts, the dependency-related errors, including missing dependencies and redundant dependencies, draw the attention of many researchers. A variety of build dependency analysis techniques have been proposed to tackle them. Unfortunately, most of these techniques, even the state-of-the-art ones, suffer from efficiency issues due to the expensive cost of monitoring the complete build process to build dynamic dependencies. Especially for large-scale projects, such the cost would not be affordable. This work presents a new technique to accelerate the build dependency error detection by reducing the time cost of the build monitoring. Our key idea is to reduce the size of a program while still preserving the same dynamic dependencies as the original one. Building the reduced program does not generate a real software artifact, but it yields the same list of dependency errors and meanwhile speeds up the process. We implement the tool VirtualBuild and evaluate it on real-world projects. It is shown that it detects all the dependency errors found by existing tools at a low cost. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique, VirtualBuild accelerates the build process by 8.74 times, and improves the efficiency of error detection by 6.13 times on average. Specifically, in the large-scale project LLVM that contains 5.67 MLoC, VirtualBuild reduces the overall time from over four hours to 38.63 minutes.
