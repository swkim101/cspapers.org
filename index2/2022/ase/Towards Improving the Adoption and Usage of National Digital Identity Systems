User perceptions of national digital identity systems (NDIDs) significantly impact their use and acceptance. Previous study on the use of NDIDs has provided limited frameworks for future research, with a strong emphasis on government services as well as how the system may be improved. This study evaluates how human-centric cybersecurity factors influence the use of NDIDs and acceptance among users. For instance, MyHealth record, which is used in Australia to record medical services provided to users, was overwhelmingly rejected by users due to concerns about digital identification information being used without authorisation and other privacy concerns. We hypothesise that human-centric cybersecurity factors influence the use of NDID and acceptance among users. The study also has a practical implication since it provides a framework to determine human-centric cybersecurity factors that influence adoption and improve NDIDs usage.
