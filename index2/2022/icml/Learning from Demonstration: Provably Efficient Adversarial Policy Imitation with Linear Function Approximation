In generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), the agent aims to learn a policy from an expert demonstration so that its performance cannot be discriminated from the expert policy on a certain predefined reward set. In this paper, we study GAIL in both online and offline settings with linear function approximation, where both the transition and reward function are linear in the feature maps. Besides the expert demonstration, in the online setting the agent can interact with the environment, while in the offline setting the agent only accesses an additional dataset collected by a prior. For online GAIL, we propose an optimistic generative adversarial policy imitation algorithm (OGAPI) and prove that OGAPI achieves (cid:101) O ( √ H 4 d 3 K + (cid:112) H 3 d 2 K 2 /N 1 ) regret. Here N 1 represents the number of trajectories of the expert demonstration, d is the feature di-mension, K is the number of episodes, and (cid:101) O ( · ) hides logarithmic terms and constants. For offline GAIL, we propose a pessimistic generative adversarial policy imitation algorithm (PGAPI). We also obtain the optimality gap of PGAPI, achieving the minimax lower bound in the utilization of the additional dataset. Assuming sufficient coverage on the additional dataset, we show that PGAPI achieves (cid:101) O ( (cid:112) H 4 d 2 /K + (cid:112) H 4 d 3 /N 2 + (cid:112) H 3 d 2 /N 1 ) optimality gap. Here N 2 represents the number of trajectories of the additional dataset with sufficient coverage.
