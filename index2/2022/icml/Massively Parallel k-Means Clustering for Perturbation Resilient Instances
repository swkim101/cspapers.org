We consider k -means clustering of n data points in Euclidean space in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, a computational model which is an abstraction of modern massively parallel computing system such as MapReduce. Recent work provides evidence that getting O (1) - approximate k -means solution for general input points using o (log n ) rounds in the MPC model may be impossible under certain conditions [Ghaffari, Kuhn & Uitto’2019]. However, the real-world data points usually have better structures. One instance of interest is the set of data points which is perturbation resilient [Bilu & Linial’2010]. In particular, a point set is α - perturbation resilient for k -means if perturbing pairwise distances by multiplicative factors in the range [1 , α ] does not change the optimum k -means clusters. We bypass the worst case lower bound by considering the perturbation re-silient input points and showing o (log n ) rounds k -means clustering algorithms for these instances in the MPC model. Speciﬁcally, we show a fully scalable (1 + ε ) -approximate k -means clustering algorithm for O ( α ) -perturbation resilient instance in the MPC model using O (1) rounds and O ε,d ( n 1+1 /α 2 + o (1) ) total space. If the space per machine is sufﬁciently larger than k , i.e., at least k · n Ω(1) , we also develop an optimal k - means clustering algorithm for O ( α ) -perturbation resilient instance in MPC using O (1) rounds and O d ( n 1+ o (1) · ( n 1 /α 2 + k )) total space.
