Human learners can readily understand speech, or a melody, when it is presented slower or faster than usual. Although deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely powerful in extracting information from time series, they require explicit training to generalize to different time scales. This paper presents a deep CNN that incorporates a temporal representation inspired by recent findings from neuroscience. In the mammalian brain, time is represented by populations of neurons with temporal receptive fields. Critically, the peaks of the receptive fields form a geometric series, such that the population codes a set of temporal basis functions over log time. Because memory for the recent past is a function of log time, rescaling the input results in translation of the memory. The Scale-Invariant Temporal History Convolution network (SITHCon) builds a convolutional layer over this logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A max-pool operation results in a network that is invariant to rescalings of time modulo edge effects. We compare performance of SITHCon to a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN). Although both networks can learn classification and regression problems on both univariate and multivariate time series f(t), only SITHCon generalizes to rescalings f(at). This property, inspired by findings from contemporary neuroscience and consistent with findings from cognitive psychology, may enable networks that learn with fewer training examples, fewer weights and that generalize more robustly to out of sample data.
