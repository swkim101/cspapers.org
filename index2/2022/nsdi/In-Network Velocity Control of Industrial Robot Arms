In-network computing has emerged as a new computational paradigm made possible with the advent of programmable data planes. The beneﬁts of moving computations tradition-ally performed by servers to the network have recently been demonstrated through different applications. In this paper, we argue that programmable data planes could be a key technology enabler of cloud and edge-cloud robotics, and in general could revitalize industrial networking. We propose an in-network approach for real-time robot control that sepa-rates delay sensitive tasks from high-level control processes. The proposed system ofﬂoads real-time velocity control of robot arms to P4-enabled programmable data planes and only keeps the high-level control and planning at the industrial controller. This separation allows the deployment of industrial control in non-real-time environments like virtual machines and service containers running in a remote cloud or an edge-computing infrastructure. In addition, we also demonstrate that our method can smoothly control 100s of robot arms with a single P4-switch, enables fast reroute between trajectories, solves the precise synchronization of multiple robots by design and supports the plug-and-play deployment of new robot devices in the industrial system, reducing both operational and management costs.
