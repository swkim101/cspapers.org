Successful wireless communication requires that sender and receiver are operational at the same time. This requirement is difﬁcult to satisfy in battery-free networks, where the energy harvested from ambient sources varies across time and space and is often too weak to continuously power the devices. We present Bonito , the ﬁrst connection protocol for battery-free systems that enables reliable and efﬁcient bi-directional communication between intermittently powered nodes. We collect and analyze real-world energy-harvesting traces from ﬁve diverse scenarios involving solar panels and piezoelectric harvesters, and ﬁnd that the nodes’ charging times approximately follow well-known distributions. Bonito learns a model of these distributions online and adapts the nodes’ wake-up times so that sender and receiver are operational at the same time, enabling successful communication. Experiments with battery-free prototype nodes built from off-the-shelf hardware components demonstrate that our design improves the average throughput by 10–80 × compared with the state of the art.
