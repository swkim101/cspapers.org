Datacenter workloads have evolved from the data intensive, loosely-coupled workloads of the past decade to more tightly coupled ones, wherein ultra-low latency communication is essential for resource disaggregation over the network and to enable emerging programming models. We introduce Aquila , an experimental datacenter network fabric built with ultra-low latency support as a ﬁrst-class de-sign goal, while also supporting traditional datacenter trafﬁc. Aquila uses a new Layer 2 cell-based protocol, GNet, an integrated switch, and a custom ASIC with low-latency Remote Memory Access (RMA) capabilities co-designed with GNet. We demonstrate that Aquila is able to achieve under 40 µ s tail fabric Round Trip Time (RTT) for IP trafﬁc and sub-10 µ s RMA execution time across hundreds of host machines, even in the presence of background throughput-oriented IP trafﬁc. This translates to more than 5x reduction in tail latency for a production quality key-value store running on a prototype Aquila network.
