randomized return decomposition (RRD), which sets up a surrogate optimization problem of the least-squares-based return decomposition. The proposed surrogate objective allows us to conduct return decomposition on short subsequences of agent trajectories, which is scalable in long-horizon tasks. We provide analyses to characterize the algorithmic property of our surrogate objective function and discuss connections to existing methods.
