Graph Benchmark (Hu et al., 2020). These datasets cover a wide range of domains, cover both transductive and inductive tasks, and are larger than datasets which are typically used in GNN works. We use evaluation metrics and splits speciﬁed by these papers. Baseline architectures chosen reﬂect popular general-purpose choices (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Hamilton et al., 2017; Veli ˇ ckovi ´ c et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017), along with the state-of-the-art PNA (Corso et al., 2020) and GATv2 (Brody et al., 2022) architectures.
