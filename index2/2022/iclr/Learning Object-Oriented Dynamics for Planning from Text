The advancement of dynamics models enables model-based planning in complex environments. Dynamics models mostly study image-based games with fully observable states. Generalizing these models to Text-Based Games (TBGs), which often include partially observable states with noisy text observations, is challenging. In this work, we propose an Object-Oriented Text Dynamics (OOTD) model that enables planning algorithms to solve decision-making problems in text domains. OOTD predicts a memory graph that dynamically remembers the history of object observations and ﬁlters object-irrelevant information. To improve the robustness of dynamics, our OOTD model identiﬁes the objects inﬂuenced by input actions and predicts beliefs of object states with independently parameterized transition layers. We develop variational objectives under the object-supervised and self-supervised settings to model the stochasticity of predicted dynamics. Empirical results show that our OOTD-based planner signiﬁcantly outperforms model-free baselines in terms of sample efﬁciency and running scores.
