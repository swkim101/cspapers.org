We introduce the first metric for evaluating disentanglement at individual hierarchy levels of a structured latent representation. Applied to object-centric generative models, this offers a systematic, unified approach to evaluating (i) object separation between latent slots (ii) disentanglement of object properties inside individual slots (iii) disentanglement of intrinsic and extrinsic object properties. We theoretically show that for structured representations, our framework gives stronger guarantees of selecting a good model than previous disentanglement metrics. Experimentally, we demonstrate that viewing object compositionality as a disentanglement problem addresses several issues with prior visual metrics of object separation. As a core technical component, we present the first representation probing algorithm handling slot permutation invariance.
