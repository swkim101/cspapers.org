Hypersafety properties of arity n are program properties that relate n traces of a program (or, more generally, traces of n programs). Classic examples include determinism, idempotence, and associativity. A number of relational program logics have been introduced to target this class of properties. Their aim is to construct simpler proofs by capitalizing on structural similarities between the n related programs. We propose an unexplored, complementary proof principle that establishes hyper-triples (i.e. hypersafety judgments) as a unifying compositional building block for proofs, and we use it to develop a Logic for Hyper-triple Composition (LHC), which supports forms of proof compositionality that were not achievable in previous logics. We prove LHC sound and apply it to a number of challenging examples.
