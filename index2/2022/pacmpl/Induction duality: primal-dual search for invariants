Many invariant inference techniques reason simultaneously about states and predicates, and it is well-known that these two kinds of reasoning are in some sense dual to each other. We present a new formal duality between states and predicates, and use it to derive a new primal-dual invariant inference algorithm. The new induction duality is based on a notion of provability by incremental induction that is formally dual to reachability, and the duality is surprisingly symmetric. The symmetry allows us to derive the dual of the well-known Houdini algorithm, and by combining Houdini with its dual image we obtain primal-dual Houdini, the first truly primal-dual invariant inference algorithm. An early prototype of primal-dual Houdini for the domain of distributed protocol verification can handle difficult benchmarks from the literature.
