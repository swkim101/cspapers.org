The DEEM'22 workshop (Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning) is held on Sunday June 12th, in conjunction with SIGMOD/PODS 2022. DEEM brings together researchers and practitioners at the intersection of applied machine learning, data management and systems research, with the goal to discuss the arising data management issues in ML application scenarios. The workshop solicits regular research papers (10 pages) describing preliminary and ongoing research results, including industrial experience reports of end-to-end ML deployments, related to DEEM topics. In addition, DEEM 2022 establishes a new paper category for reports on applications and tools (4 pages) as a forum for sharing interesting use cases, problems, datasets, benchmarks, visionary ideas, system designs, and descriptions of system components and tools related to end-to-end ML pipelines. DEEM 2022 received 13 high-quality submissions from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, with 5 regular research papers, and 8 reports on applications and tools.
