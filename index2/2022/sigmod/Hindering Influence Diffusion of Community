Considering the rapid spread of incidents like rumours or epidemics, it is important to hinder their influence diffusion. However, none of the existing works can well control the influence diffusion of a community. Based on a novel metric named interaction frequency that can measure the influence diffusion of a community, we aim to remove b nodes from a given community such that the interaction frequency of the remaining nodes is minimized. We also design a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. The experiments show our algorithm can efficiently hinder the influence diffusion.
