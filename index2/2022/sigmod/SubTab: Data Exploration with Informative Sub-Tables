We demonstrate SubTab, a framework for creating small, informative sub-tables of large data tables to speed up data exploration. Given a table with n rows and m columns where n and m are large, SubTab creates a sub-table T_sub with k<n rows and l<m columns, i.e. a subset of k rows of the table projected over a subset of l columns. The rows and columns are chosen as representatives of prominent data patterns within and across columns in the input table. SubTab can also be used for query results, enabling the user to quickly understand the results and determine subsequent queries.
