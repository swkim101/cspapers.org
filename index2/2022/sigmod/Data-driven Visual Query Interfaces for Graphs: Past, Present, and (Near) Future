Visual graph query interfaces (VQI) widen the reach of graph querying frameworks across a variety of end users by enabling non-programmers to use them. Several industrial and academic frameworks for querying graphs expose such visual interfaces. In this tutorial, we survey recent developments in the emerging area of data-driven visual query interface that is grounded on the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) and cognitive psychology to enhance usability of graph querying frameworks. A data-driven VQI has many benefits such as reducing the cost in constructing and maintaining an interface, superior support for query formulation, and increased portability of the interface. We discuss the notion of making VQIs data-driven and compare it with its classical manual counterpart, and review techniques for automatic construction and maintenance of these interfaces. In addition, the tutorial suggests open problems and new research directions. In summary, in this tutorial, we review and summarize the research thus far into data-driven visual graph query interface management, giving researchers a snapshot of the current state of the art in this topic, and future research directions.
