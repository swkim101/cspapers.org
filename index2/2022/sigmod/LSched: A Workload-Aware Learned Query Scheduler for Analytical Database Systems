Query scheduling is a crucial task for analytical database systems that can greatly affect the query latency. However, existing scheduling approaches are based on heuristics and not optimal. A recent trial proposed to use reinforcement learning for automatically learning end-to-end scheduling policies. However, such trial was not capable of considering the database-specific characteristics (e.g., operator types, pipelining), and hence becomes not efficient for analytical database systems. In this paper, we try to fill this gap and introduce LSched (Learned Scheduler), a fully learned workload-aware query scheduler for in-memory analytical database systems. LSched provides an efficient inter-query and intra-query scheduling for dynamic analytical workloads (i.e., different queries can arrive/depart at any time). We integrated LSched with an efficient in-memory analytical database system, and evaluated it with TPCH, SSB, and JOB benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that LSched improves over the performance of existing state-of-the-art query schedulers and heuristic-based ones by at least 35% and 50% in both streaming and batching query workloads.
