New hardware, like multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies, and low-power hardware impose a great challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research. In the past decade the DaMoN workshop has established itself as the primary database venue to present ideas how to exploit new hardware for data management, in particular how to improve performance or scalability of databases, how new hardware unlocks new database application scenarios, and how data management could benefit from future hardware.
