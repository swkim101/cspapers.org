Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) systems have recently gained popularity as they combine OLAP and OLTP processing to reduce administrative and synchronization costs between dedicated systems. However, there is no precise characterization of the features that distinguish a good HTAP system from a poor one. In this paper, we seek to solve this problem from the perspectives of both performance and freshness. To simultaneously capture the performance of both transactional and analytical processing, we introduce a new concept called throughput frontier, which visualizes both transactional and analytical throughput in a single 2D graph. The throughput frontier can capture information regarding the performance of each engine, the interference between the two engines, and various system design decisions. To capture how well an HTAP system supports real-time analytics, we define a freshness metric which quantifies how recent is the snapshot of the data seen by each analytical query. We also develop a practical way to measure freshness in a real system. We design a new hybrid benchmark called HATtrick which incorporates both throughput frontier and freshness as metrics. Using the benchmark, we evaluate three representative HTAP systems under various data size and system configurations and demonstrate how the metrics reveal important system characteristics and performance information.
