Computer Science is a wonderful field with many interesting and important problems to work on. This is true today and was also true in the past; of course what is considered interesting changes as a field matures. In this talk I will discuss some of the problems that I found intriguing. In each case I will discuss the state of the field at the time I did this work to provide an historical context for my work and that of others doing related work. I will also discuss how I selected problems, what I brought to the table, and where the ideas for my solutions came from.
