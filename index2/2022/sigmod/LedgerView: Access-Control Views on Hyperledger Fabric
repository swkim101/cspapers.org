We present LedgerView -- a system that adds access control views to permissioned blockchains. The approach is motivated by an AT&T application of tracking refurbished devices. A blockchain is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger managed by a group of peers. It is used in many applications for storing and sharing sensitive information, e.g., monetary transactions, health records, personal documents, etc. But in blockchain, all the peers see all the stored transactions, while in some applications, access to sensitive information should be limited, that is, concealed from peers and users who do not have proper access permissions. In database management systems, sets of records that are visible to some users and concealed from others are defined by views, but existing blockchain systems lack such access-control capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we introduce access-control views for Hyperledger Fabric. We present two types of views -- irrevocable and revocable, according to whether access to sensitive information can or cannot be revoked. We explain how to implement the two types of view by using cryptographic hash functions and encryption keys, and we show how to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Experiments with supply chain transactions illustrate the incurred costs of the views in LedgerView, including latency, transaction rate and storage overhead.
