The Second International Workshop on Big Data in Emergent Distributed Environments (BiDEDE) focuses on scalable data management issues in emergent computing environments like (post) cloud and fog/edge/dew computing. All these computing environments aim to smoothly integrate scalable data management and processing into distributed environments, such that communication and computational costs are reduced for higher throughput, lower latencies of applications and extending battery lifetimes of nodes in companion with robust approaches to overcome failures and crashes. While there has been research in these areas for already over one decade, still many open challenges exist because of technology triggers like lightweight virtualization, increasing capabilities of nodes and increasing massive parallelization. This workshop supports lively discussions in these and related areas.
