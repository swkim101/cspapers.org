Local differential privacy (LDP) is promising for private streaming data collection and analysis. However, existing few LDP studies over streams either apply to finite streams only or may suffer from insufficient protection. This paper investigates this problem by proposing LDP-IDS, a novel w-event LDP paradigm to provide practical privacy guarantee for infinite streams. By constructing a unified error analysis, we adapt the existing budget division framework in centralized differential privacy (CDP) for LDP-IDS, which however incurs prohibitive noise and expensive communication cost. To this end, we propose a novel and extensible framework of population division and recycling, as well as online adaptive population division algorithms for LDP-IDS. We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate, through extensive discussions, that our proposed framework not only achieves significant reduction in utility loss and communication overhead, but also enjoys great compatibility for varied analytic tasks and flexibility of incorporating ideas of many existing stream algorithms. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the high effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of our proposed framework and methods.
