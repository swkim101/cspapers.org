Visual graph query interfaces (VQI) facilitate non-programmers to query graph data effortlessly. The construction of these interfaces for large networks is typically not data-driven. That is, they do not exploit the underlying networks to automatically generate the contents of various panels of a VQI. Such data-driven construction has several benefits such as facilitating efficient top-down and bottom-up query formulation and portability of an interface across different application domains and sources. In this demonstration, we present a novel plug-and-play visual subgraph query interface construction engine called PLAYPEN that can be plugged on any large network G with a plug specification b to automatically generate the VQI for G that satisfies b by populating various components of the interface.
