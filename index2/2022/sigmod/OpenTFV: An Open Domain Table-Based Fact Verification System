The prevalence of misinformation, both online and offline, has prompted a great demand of fact verification. Table-based fact verification aims to check whether a textual claim is supported or refuted based on relational tables. However, most of the existing approaches are in a closed-domain setting, which may not be realistic in practice. To address this problem, in this paper, we introduce OpenTFV, a user-friendly system that supports open domain table-based fact verification. Given a claim input by an end-user, OpenTFV retrieves the relevant tables, and provides a verification result for each table with an intuitive interpretation in natural language. We have implemented OpenTFV and demonstrated OpenTFV in two representative scenarios, COVID-19 claims fact verification based on academic tables and general fact verification on Wiki-tables.
