With the ever-increasing amount of data stored and processed and ever-evolving hardware technology, there is not only an ongoing need for testing database management systems but also data-intensive systems in general. Reviving the previous success of the eight previous workshops, the goal of DBTest 2022 is to bring researchers and practitioners from academia and industry together to discuss key problems and ideas related to testing database systems and applications. The long-term objective is to reduce the cost and time required to test and tune data management and processing products so that users and vendors can spend more time and energy on actual innovations.
