With the increasing demand for computational power, research on general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) has been active for various real-time systems spanning from autonomous vehicles to real-time clouds. While the use of GPUs can significantly benefit compute-intensive tasks with timing constraints, their high power consumption becomes an important problem given that it is not rare to see multiple GPUs in today's systems. In this paper, we present our study towards energy-efficient real-time scheduling in heterogeneous multi-GPU systems. We first make observations using a custom power monitoring setup that, in a multi-GPU system, conventional task allocation approaches for multiprocessors do not lead to energy efficiency and there is no clear winner. Then we propose a multi-GPU real-time scheduling framework, sBEET-mg, that builds upon prior work on single-GPU systems and makes offline and runtime scheduling decisions to execute a given job on the energy-optimal GPU while exploiting spatial multitasking on each GPU for better concurrency and real-time performance. We implemented the proposed framework on a real multi-GPU system and evaluated it with randomly-generated task sets of benchmark programs. We also experimentally simulated our method in a system containing more GPUs. Experimental results show that sBEET-mg reduces deadline misses by up to 23% and 18% compared to the conventional load distribution and load concentration methods, respectively, while simultaneously achieving lower energy consumption than them.
