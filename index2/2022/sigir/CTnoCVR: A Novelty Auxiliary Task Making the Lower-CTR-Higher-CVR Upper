In recent years, multi-task learning models based on deep learning in recommender systems have attracted increasing attention from researchers in industry and academia. Accurately estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) is often considered as the primary task of multi-task learning in recommender systems. However, some advertisers may try to get higher click-through rates (CTR) by over-decorating their ads, which may result in excessive exposure to samples with lower CVR. For example, some only eye-catching clickbait have higher CTR, but actually, CVR is very low. As a result, the overall performance of the recommender system will be hurt. In this paper, we introduce a novelty auxiliary task called CTnoCVR, which aims to predict the probability of events with click but no-conversion, in various state-of-the-art multi-task models of recommender systems to promote samples with high CVR but low CTR. Plentiful Experiments on a large-scale dataset gathered from traffic logs of Taobao's recommender system demonstrate that the introduction of CTnoCVR task significantly improves the prediction effect of CVR under various multi-task frameworks. In addition, we conduct the online test and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method to make those samples with high CVR and low CTR rank higher.
