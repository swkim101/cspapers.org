Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) provide recommendations through interactive conversations. CRSs typically provide recommendations through relatively straightforward interactions, where the system continuously inquires about a user's explicit attribute-aware preferences and then decides which items to recommend. In addition, topic tracking is often used to provide naturally sounding responses. However, merely tracking topics is not enough to recognize a user's real preferences in a dialogue. In this paper, we address the problem of accurately recognizing and maintaining user preferences in CRSs. Three challenges come with this problem: (1) An ongoing dialogue only provides the user's short-term feedback; (2) Annotations of user preferences are not available; and (3) There may be complex semantic correlations among items that feature in a dialogue. We tackle these challenges by proposing an end-to-end variational reasoning approach to the task of conversational recommendation. We model both long-term preferences and short-term preferences as latent variables with topical priors for explicit long-term and short-term preference exploration, respectively. We use an efficient stochastic gradient variational Bayesian (SGVB) estimator for optimizing the derived evidence lower bound. A policy network is then used to predict topics for a clarification utterance or items for a recommendation response. The use of explicit sequences of preferences with multi-hop reasoning in a heterogeneous knowledge graph helps to provide more accurate conversational recommendation results. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metric
