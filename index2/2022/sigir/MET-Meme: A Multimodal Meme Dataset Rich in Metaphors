Memes have become the popular means of communication for Internet users worldwide. Understanding the Internet meme is one of the most tricky challenges in natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to its convenient non-standard writing and network vocabulary. Recently, many linguists suggested that memes contain rich metaphorical information. However, the existing researches ignore this key feature. Therefore, to incorporate informative metaphors into the meme analysis, we introduce a novel multimodal meme dataset called MET-Meme, which is rich in metaphorical features. It contains 10045 text-image pairs, with manual annotations of the metaphor occurrence, sentiment categories, intentions, and offensiveness degree. Moreover, we propose a range of strong baselines to demonstrate the importance of combining metaphorical features for meme sentiment analysis and semantic understanding tasks, respectively. MET-Meme, and its code are released publicly for research in \urlhttps://github.com/liaolianfoka/MET-Meme-A-Multi-modal-Meme-Dataset-Rich-in-Metaphors.
