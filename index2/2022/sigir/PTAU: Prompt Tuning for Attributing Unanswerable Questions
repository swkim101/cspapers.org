Current question answering systems are insufficient when confronting real-life scenarios, as they can hardly be aware of whether a question is answerable given its context. Hence, there is a recent pursuit of unanswerability of a question and its attribution. Attribution of unanswerability requires the system to choose an appropriate cause for an unanswerable question. As the task is sophisticated for even human beings, it is expensive to acquire labeled data, which makes it a low-data regime problem. Moreover, the causes themselves are semantically abstract and complex, and the process of attribution is heavily question- and context-dependent. Thus, a capable model has to carefully appreciate the causes, and then, judiciously contrast the question with its context, in order to cast it into the right cause. In response to the challenges, we present PTAU, which refers to and implements a high-level human reading strategy such that one reads with anticipation. In specific, PTAU leverages the recent prompt-tuning paradigm, and is further enhanced with two innovatively conceived modules: 1) a cause-oriented template module that constructs continuous templates towards certain attributing class in high dimensional vector space; and 2) a semantics-aware label module that exploits label semantics through contrastive learning to render the classes distinguishable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design better enlightens not only the attribution model, but also current question answering models, leading to superior performance.
