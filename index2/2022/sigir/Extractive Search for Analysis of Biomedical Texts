Extractive search has been used to create datasets matching queries and syntactic patterns, but less attention has been paid on what to do with those datasets. We present a two-stage system targeted towards biomedical texts. First, it creates custom datasets using a powerful mix of keyword and syntactic matching. We then return lists of related words, provide semantic search, train a large language model, a synthetic data based QA model, a summarization model over those results, and so on. These are then used in downstream biomedical work.
