Online healthcare services can provide unlimited and in-time medical information to users, which promotes social goods and breaks the barriers of locations. However, understanding the user intents behind the medical related queries is a challenging problem. Medical search queries are usually short and noisy, lack strict syntactic structure, and also require professional background to understand the medical terms. The medical intents are fine-grained, making them hard to recognize. In addition, many intents only have a few labeled data. To handle these problems, we propose a few-shot learning method for medical search query intent recognition called MEDIC. We extract co-click queries from user search logs as weak supervision to compensate for the lack of labeled data. We also design a new query encoder which learns to represent queries as a combination of semantic knowledge recorded in an external medical knowledge graph, syntactic knowledge which marks the grammatical role of each word in the query, and generic knowledge which is captured by language models pretrained from large-scale text corpus. Experimental results on a real medical search query intent recognition dataset validate the effectiveness of MEDIC.
