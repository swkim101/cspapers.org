The goal of the seventh edition of SCAI (https://scai.info) is to bring together and further grow a community of researchers and practitioners interested in conversational systems for information access. The previous iterations of the workshop already demonstrated the breadth and multidisciplinarity inherent in the design and development of conversational search agents. The proposed shift from traditional web search to search interfaces enabled via human-like dialogue leads to a number of challenges, and although such challenges have received more attention in the recent years, there are many pending research questions that should be addressed by the information retrieval community and can largely benefit from a collaboration with other research fields, such as natural language processing, machine learning, human-computer interaction and dialogue systems. This workshop is intended as a platform enabling a continuous discussion of the major research challenges that surround the design of search-oriented conversational systems. This year, participants have the opportunity to meet in person and have more in-depth interactive discussions with a full-day onsite workshop.
