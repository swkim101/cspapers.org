Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task designed to identify the polarity of a target aspect. Some works introduce various attention mechanisms to fully mine the relevant context words of different aspects, and use the traditional cross-entropy loss to fine-tune the models for the ABSA task. However, the attention mechanism paying partial attention to aspect-unrelated words inevitably introduces irrelevant noise. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss lacks discriminative learning of features, which makes it difficult to exploit the implicit information of intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Aspect Feature Distillation and Enhancement Network (AFDEN) for the ABSA task. We first propose a dual-feature extraction module to extract aspect-related and aspect-unrelated features through the attention mechanisms and graph convolutional networks. Then, to eliminate the interference of aspect-unrelated words, we design a novel aspect-feature distillation module containing a gradient reverse layer that learns aspect-unrelated contextual features through adversarial training, and an aspect-specific orthogonal projection layer to further project aspect-related features into the orthogonal space of aspect-unrelated features. Finally, we propose an aspect-feature enhancement module that leverages supervised contrastive learning to capture the implicit information between the same sentiment labels and between different sentiment labels. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our AFDEN model achieves state-of-the-art performance and verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model.
