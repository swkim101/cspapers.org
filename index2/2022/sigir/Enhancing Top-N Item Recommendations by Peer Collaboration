Deep neural networks (DNN) based recommender models often require numerous parameters to achieve remarkable performance. However, this inevitably brings redundant neurons, a phenomenon referred to as over-parameterization. In this paper, we plan to exploit such redundancy phenomena for recommender systems (RS), and propose a top-N item recommendation framework called PCRec that leverages collaborative training of two recommender models of the same network structure, termed peer collaboration. We first introduce two criteria to identify the importance of parameters of a given recommender model. Then, we rejuvenate the unimportant parameters by copying parameters from its peer network. After such an operation and retraining, the original recommender model is endowed with more representation capacity by possessing more functional model parameters. To show its generality, we instantiate PCRec by using three well-known recommender models. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and show that PCRec yields significantly better performance than its counterpart with the same model (parameter) size.
