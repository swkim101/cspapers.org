Steadily increasing numbers of patent applications per year and large amounts of available patent data necessitate highly efficient and interactive next-generation information retrieval systems in the patent domain. AI and Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Deep Learning (DL) are successfully adopted in many domains, so patent researchers and practitioners start to employ AI-based approaches as well, to support experts in the patenting process or to automate patent analysis and retrieval processes. AI-enhanced Information Retrieval systems can improve patent search and analysis but also require millions of annotated sample data for training the ML models. When working with patent data, particular challenges arise that call for adaption of existing IR and AI methods as well as development of novel approaches suited for the patent domain. The focus of the 3rd edition of this workshop will be on two-way communication between industry and academia from all areas of Information Retrieval, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text and Data Mining (TDM), and Semantic Technologies (ST). We want to bring together novel research results and the latest systems and methods employed by the Intellectual Property (IP) industry.
