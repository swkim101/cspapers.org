Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GNN) based recommender systems are state-of-the-art since they can capture the high order collaborative signals between users and items. However, they suffer from the feature leakage problem since label information determined by edges can be leaked into node embeddings through the GNN aggregation procedure guided by the same set of edges, leading to poor generalization. We propose the accurate removal algorithm to generate the final embedding. For each edge, the embeddings of the two end nodes are evaluated on a graph with that edge removed. We devise an algebraic trick to efficiently compute this procedure without explicitly constructing separate graphs for the LightGCN model. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can perform better on datasets with sparse interactions, while the training time is significantly reduced.
