News recommendation is often modeled as a sequential recommendation task, assuming there are rich short-term dependencies over historical clicked news. However, users usually have strong preferences on the temporal diversity of news information and may not tend to click similar news successively, which is very different from many sequential recommendation scenarios such as e-commerce recommendation. In this paper, we study whether news recommendation can be regarded as a standard sequential recommendation problem. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we find it suboptimal to model news recommendation as a conventional sequential recommendation problem. To handle this issue, we further propose a temporal diversity-aware sequential news recommendation method that can promote candidate news that are diverse from recently clicked news to help predict future clicks more accurately. Experiments show that our method can empower various news recommendation methods.
