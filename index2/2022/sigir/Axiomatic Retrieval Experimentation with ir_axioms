Axiomatic approaches to information retrieval have played a key role in determining basic constraints that characterize good retrieval models. Beyond their importance in retrieval theory, axioms have been operationalized to improve an initial ranking, to "guide" retrieval, or to explain some model's rankings. However, recent open-source retrieval frameworks like PyTerrier and Pyserini, which made it easy to experiment with sparse and dense retrieval models, have not included any retrieval axiom support so far. To fill this gap, we propose ir_axioms, an open-source Python framework that integrates retrieval axioms with common retrieval frameworks. We include reference implementations for 25 retrieval axioms, as well as components for preference aggregation, re-ranking, and evaluation. New axioms can easily be defined by implementing an abstract data type or by intuitively combining existing axioms with Python operators or regression. Integration with PyTerrier and ir_datasets makes standard retrieval models, corpora, topics, and relevance judgments---including those used at TREC---immediately accessible for axiomatic experimentation. Our experiments on the TREC Deep Learning tracks showcase some potential research questions that ir_axioms can help to address.
