When users initiate search sessions, their query are often ambiguous or might lack of context; this resulting in non-efficient document ranking. Multiple approaches have been proposed by the Information Retrieval community to add context and retrieve documents aligned with users' intents. While some work focus on query disambiguation using users' browsing history, a recent line of work proposes to interact with users by asking clarification questions or/and proposing clarification panels. However, these approaches count either a limited number (i.e., 1) of interactions with user or log-based interactions. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a fully simulated query clarification framework allowing multi-turn interactions between IR systems and user agents.
