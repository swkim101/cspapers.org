Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims at the next-item prediction with a short behavior session. Existing solutions fail to address two main challenges: 1) user interests are shown as dynamically coupled intents, and 2) sessions always contain noisy signals. To address them, in this paper, we propose a hypergraph-based solution, HIDE. Specifically, HIDE first constructs a hypergraph for each session to model the possible interest transitions from distinct perspectives. HIDE then disentangles the intents under each item click in micro and macro manners. In the micro-disentanglement, we perform intent-aware embedding propagation on session hypergraph to adaptively activate disentangled intents from noisy data. In the macro-disentanglement, we introduce an auxiliary intent-classification task to encourage the independence of different intents. Finally, we generate the intent-specific representations for the given session to make the final recommendation. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate the significant performance gain of our HIDE over the state-of-the-art methods.
