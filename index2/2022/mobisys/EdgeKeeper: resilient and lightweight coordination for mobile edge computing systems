Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is gaining significant interest from first responders and tactical teams. Typical cloud-based coordination (e.g., service discovery and coordination, device naming, authentication) does not work in MEC due to high user mobility. We design and implement EdgeKeeper to provide cloud-like service coordination to distributed edge computing applications for MEC systems. It maintains an edge cluster among devices and intelligently stores data on a group of replicas to guard against node failures/disconnections. We provide a full-system implementation of Edge-Keeper for Android and Linux platforms and evaluate it with MEC applications in a real-world wide-area search and rescue operation conducted by first responders.
