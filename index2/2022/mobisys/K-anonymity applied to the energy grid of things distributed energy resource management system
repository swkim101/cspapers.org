The violation of information privacy in Smart Grids can be a significant barrier to customers' participation. Employing privacy protection models such as K-anonymity in a Smart Grid implementation adds desirable privacy guarantees. This work provides an approach to applying the Mondrian algorithm to ensure data within the system excludes Personally Identifiable Information. Results suggest that a dynamically generated generalization hierarchy minimizes information loss incurred by the anonymization process.
