Interoperability among a vast number of heterogeneous IoT nodes is a key issue. However, the communication among IoT nodes does not fully interoperate to date. The underlying reason is the lack of a lightweight and unified network architecture for IoT nodes having different radio technologies. In this paper, we design and implement TinyNet, a lightweight, modular, and unified network architecture for representative low-power radio technologies including 802.15.4, BLE, and LoRa. The modular architecture of TinyNet allows us to simplify the creation of new protocols by selecting specific modules in TinyNet. We implement TinyNet on realistic IoT nodes including TI CC2650 and Heltec IoT LoRa nodes. We perform extensive evaluations. Results show that TinyNet (1) allows interoperability at or above the network layer; (2) allows code reuse for multi-protocol co-existence and simplifies new protocols design by module composition; (3) has a small code size and memory footprint.
