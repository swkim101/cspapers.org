This demonstration presents the Location-Specific Public Broadcast system, in which localization and wireless broadcasts are combined to deliver a scalable, privacy preserving, and generic solution to location-based services. Other interactive location-based systems either preload information on the user devices, which are usually bulky, difficult to update and have to be custom-made for each venue, or fetch information from cloud based on location, which sacrifices user privacy. In our system, a wireless access point continuously broadcasts information tagged by locations of interest, and the mobile devices performing passive localization select and display the information pertinent to themselves. In this case, the location-specific information is stored only on the WiFi AP, and the phone app would be ultra lightweight with only the location calculation and information filtering functionalities, which can be used in any space. We envision our solution being adopted in public places, such as museums, aquariums, etc., for location-specific information delivery purposes, like enhancing interactive experience for visitors.
