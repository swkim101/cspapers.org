Federated Learning (FL) [2] has emerged as a popular solution of Confidential Computing [3] to distributedly train a model on user devices, improving privacy and system scalability. Such privacy-preserving models can be used in wide range of applications, and especially in Telco networks [4]. However, there are no practical systems to easily enable FL training on mobile apps, and especially in an as-a-service fashion. In this demo, we implement and test FLaaS, our recently proposed end-to-end FL service [1]. FLaaS includes a client-side framework with app library and service, and a back-end server, to enable secure and easy to deploy intra- and inter-app FL model training on mobile environments.
