Existing backscatter systems using commodity radios all have a limited throughput, which prevents their usage in high-rate scenarios. We present SubScatter, which realizes a high throughput and keeps commodity-radio compatibility at the same time. Specifically, SubScatter boosts throughput for 11× by using 802.11b WiFi as excitation (11/8×) and designing sub-symbol modulation (8×).
