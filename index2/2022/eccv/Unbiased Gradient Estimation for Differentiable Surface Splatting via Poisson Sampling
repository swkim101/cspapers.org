over a large number of source centers xk and target points x in linear time. The FMM assumes that the Gaussian kernels are isotropic and that all source points xk share the same standard deviation h. However, the (unnormalized) cumulative probability σn(x) := ∑ k∈In fkρk(x) in Algorithm 1 (in the main paper) is the sum of multivariate and anisotropic Gaussian densities. Nevertheless, we use FMM to approximate the weight function under the assumption that the Gaussian densities are close to being univariate and isotropic.
