We present a method for transferring the artistic features of an arbitrary style image to a 3D scene. Previous methods that perform 3D stylization on point clouds or meshes are sensitive to geometric reconstruction errors for complex real-world scenes. Instead, we propose to stylize the more robust radiance field representation. We find that the commonly used Gram matrix-based loss tends to produce blurry results without faithful brushstrokes, and introduce a nearest neighbor-based loss that is highly effective at capturing style details while maintaining multi-view consistency. We also propose a novel deferred back-propagation method to enable optimization of memory-intensive radiance fields using style losses defined on full-resolution rendered images. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms baselines by generating artistic appearance that more closely resembles the style image.
