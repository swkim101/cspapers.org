. We propose an unsupervised, mid-level representation for a generative model of scenes. The representation is mid-level in that it is neither per-pixel nor per-image; rather, scenes are modeled as a collection of spatial, depth-ordered “blobs” of features. Blobs are differentiably placed onto a feature grid that is decoded into an image by a generative adversarial network. Due to the spatial uniformity of blobs and the locality inherent to convolution, our network learns to associate different blobs with different entities in a scene and to arrange these blobs to capture scene layout. We demonstrate this emergent behavior by showing that, despite training without any supervision, our method enables applications such as easy manipulation of objects within a scene ( e.g. moving, removing, and restyling furniture), creation of feasible scenes given constraints ( e.g. plausible rooms with drawers at a particular location), and parsing of real-world images into constituent parts. On a challenging multi-category dataset of indoor scenes, BlobGAN outperforms StyleGAN2 in image quality as measured by FID. See our project page for video results and interactive demo: http://www.dave.ml/blobgan. objects that comprise them. Here, we demonstrate through various image manipulation applications that this ability emerges in our model. Our unsupervised representation allows effortless rearrangement, removal, cloning, and restyling of objects in scenes. We also measure correlation between blob presence and semantic categories as predicted by an off-the-shelf network and thus empirically verify the associations discovered by our model.
