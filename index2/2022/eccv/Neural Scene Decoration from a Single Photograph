Furnishing and rendering indoor scenes has been a long-standing task for interior design, where artists create a conceptual design for the space, build a 3D model of the space, decorate, and then perform rendering. Although the task is important, it is tedious and requires tremendous effort. In this paper, we introduce a new problem of domain-specific indoor scene image synthesis, namely neural scene decoration. Given a photograph of an empty indoor space and a list of decorations with layout determined by user, we aim to synthesize a new image of the same space with desired furnishing and decorations. Neural scene decoration can be applied to create conceptual interior designs in a simple yet effective manner. Our attempt to this research problem is a novel scene generation architecture that transforms an empty scene and an object layout into a realistic furnished scene photograph. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method by comparing it with conditional image synthesis baselines built upon prevailing image translation approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conduct extensive experiments to further validate the plausibility and aesthetics of our generated scenes.
