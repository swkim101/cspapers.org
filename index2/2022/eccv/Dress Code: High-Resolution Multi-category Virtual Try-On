Image-based virtual try-on strives to transfer the appearance of a clothing item onto the image of a target person. Existing literature focuses mainly on upper-body clothes (e.g. t-shirts, shirts, and tops) and neglects full-body or lower-body items. This shortcoming arises from a main factor: current publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on do not account for this variety, thus limiting progress in the field. In this research activity, we introduce Dress Code, a novel dataset which contains images of multi-category clothes. Dress Code is more than 3× larger than publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on and features high-resolution paired images (1024 × 768) with front-view, full-body reference models. To generate HD try-on images with high visual quality and rich in details, we propose to learn fine-grained discriminating features. Specifically, we leverage a semantic-aware discriminator that makes predictions at pixel-level instead of image- or patch-level. The Dress Code dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/dress-code.
