We present the first method that automatically transfers poses between stylized 3D characters without skeletal rigging. In contrast to previous attempts to learn pose transformations on fixed or topology-equivalent skeleton templates, our method focuses on a novel scenario to handle skeleton-free characters with diverse shapes, topologies, and mesh connectivities. The key idea of our method is to represent the characters in a unified articulation model so that the pose can be transferred through the correspondent parts. To achieve this, we propose a novel pose transfer network that predicts the character skinning weights and deformation transformations jointly to articulate the target character to match the desired pose. Our method is trained in a semi-supervised manner absorbing all existing character data with paired/unpaired poses and stylized shapes. It generalizes well to unseen stylized characters and inanimate objects. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on this novel task.
