Because of our research topic of inpainting at modern camera resolutions, we have prepared a 2 gigabyte supplemental material with an included HTML viewer that shows results of all methods at full resolution, and have uploaded that in an anonymized way to cloud file hosting. We checked with a program committee member and were told we can include a link as long as we are very confident we have anonymized it, which we are. The link is https://drive.google.com/ file/d/1Lmar1byASRReJ0SimBfWAE2Dt_-gMhor . To prove that the supplemental is not changed since the time of submission, the MD5 sum of the 2 gigabyte supplemental material is 59eb1591b1601f491bd6962e43e81672 .
