The main question we address in this paper is how to scale up visual recognition of unseen classes, also known as zero-shot learning, to tens of thousands of categories as in the ImageNet-21K benchmark. At this scale, especially with many fine-grained categories included in ImageNet-21K, it is critical to learn quality visual semantic representations that are discriminative enough to recognize unseen classes and distinguish them from seen ones. We propose a \emph{H}ierarchical \emph{G}raphical knowledge \emph{R}epresentation framework for the confidence-based classification method, dubbed as HGR-Net. Our experimental results demonstrate that HGR-Net can grasp class inheritance relations by utilizing hierarchical conceptual knowledge. Our method significantly outperformed all existing techniques, boosting the performance by 7\% compared to the runner-up approach on the ImageNet-21K benchmark. We show that HGR-Net is learning-efficient in few-shot scenarios. We also analyzed our method on smaller datasets like ImageNet-21K-P, 2-hops and 3-hops, demonstrating its generalization ability.
