We present additional details on experiments, qualitative results as figures and videos in the following sections. We present complete derivations and further detailed analysis in this supplemental. Details of experiments for scene and ray based evaluation appear under §2.1 along with the new ray based evaluations. In §2.2 we provide full experiment evaluation of different decoding strategies of baselines. In §3 we discuss complete details for all the datasets. In §4 we discuss the important implementation details, followed by a discussion on rays vs. scene distances in §5 Then in §6 we discuss the detailed behavior of different distance functions under uncertainty and graph them. We follow this up with additional qualitative results on all the three datasets with randomly sampled images from the test set in §7. In §8 we derive the results mathematically to showcase the analysis technique for other distance functions.
