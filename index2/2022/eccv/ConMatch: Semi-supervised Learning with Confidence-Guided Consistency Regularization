We present a novel semi-supervised learning framework that intelligently leverages the consistency regularization between the model's predictions from two strongly-augmented views of an image, weighted by a confidence of pseudo-label, dubbed ConMatch. While the latest semi-supervised learning methods use weakly- and strongly-augmented views of an image to define a directional consistency loss, how to define such direction for the consistency regularization between two strongly-augmented views remains unexplored. To account for this, we present novel confidence measures for pseudo-labels from strongly-augmented views by means of weakly-augmented view as an anchor in non-parametric and parametric approaches. Especially, in parametric approach, we present, for the first time, to learn the confidence of pseudo-label within the networks, which is learned with backbone model in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we also present a stage-wise training to boost the convergence of training. When incorporated in existing semi-supervised learners, ConMatch consistently boosts the performance. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our ConMatch over the latest methods and provide extensive ablation studies.
