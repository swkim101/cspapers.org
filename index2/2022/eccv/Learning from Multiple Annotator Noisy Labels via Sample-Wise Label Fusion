Data lies at the core of modern deep learning. The impressive performance of supervised learning is built upon a base of massive accurately labeled data. However, in some real-world applications, accurate labeling might not be viable; instead, multiple noisy labels (instead of one accurate label) are provided by several annotators for each data sample. Learning a classifier on such a noisy training dataset is a challenging task. Previous approaches usually assume that all data samples share the same set of parameters related to annotator errors, while we demonstrate that label error learning should be both annotator and data sample dependent. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel learning algorithm. The proposed method displays superiority compared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods on MNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100.
