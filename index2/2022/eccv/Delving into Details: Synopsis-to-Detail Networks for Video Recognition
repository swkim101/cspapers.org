In the supplementary material, we will provide more technical background, technical details, training details and efficiency analysis of our method. Specifically, we discuss the differences between S2DNet and some related works in Sec. 1. Then, we present more details about the detail sampler in Sec. 2 and more details about the training in Sec. 3. At last, we compare the efficiency of S2DNet to efficient action recognition methods in Sec. 4.
