Popular object detection models generate bounding boxes in a different way than we humans. As an example, modern detectors yield object box either upon the regression of its center and width/height (center-guided detector), or by grouping paired estimated corners (corner-guided detector). However, that is not the pattern we manually label an object due to high degrees of freedom in searching centers or low efficiency of grouping corners. Empirically, humans run two steps to locate an object bounding box manually: 1) click the mouse at the top-left corner of object, and then drag the mouse to the bottom-right corner; 2) refine the corner positions to make the bounding box more precisely, if necessary. Inspired by this manual labeling process, we propose a novel human-like detector, termed as HumanLiker, which is devised as a two-stage end-to-end detector to simulate the two aforementioned. Like we humans in manual labeling, HumanLiker can effectively avert both the thorny center searching and heuristic corner grouping. Different from the mainstream detector branches, i.e. , the center/corner-guided methods, the Human-Liker provides a new paradigm which integrates the advantages of both branches to balance the detection efficiency and bounding box quality. On MS-COCO test-dev set, HumanLiker can achieve 50.2%/51.6% and 53.8%/55.6% in term of AP with ResNeXt-101 and SwinTransformer backbones in single/multi-scale testing, out-performing current popular center/corner-guided baselines ( e.g. , DETR/CornerNet) by a large margin, with much less training epochs and higher inference FPS.
