Machine learning has been highly successful in data-driven applications but is often hampered when the data contains noise, especially label noise. When trained on noisy labels, deep neural networks tend to ﬁt all noisy labels, resulting in poor generalization. To handle this problem, a common idea is to force the model to ﬁt only clean samples rather than mislabeled ones. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that automatically distinguishes the mislabeled samples and prevents the model from memorizing them, named Noise Attention Learning. In our method, we introduce an attention branch to produce attention weights based on representations of samples. This attention branch is learned to divide the samples according to the predictive power in their representations. We design the corresponding loss function that incorporates the attention weights for training the model without affecting the original learning direction. Empirical results show that most of the mislabeled samples yield signiﬁcantly lower weights than the clean ones. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that the gradients of training samples are dynamically scaled by the attention weights, implicitly preventing memorization of the mislabeled samples. Experimental results on two benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) with simulated label noise and three real-world noisy datasets (ANIMAL-10N, Clothing1M and Webvision) demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
