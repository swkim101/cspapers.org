Deep topic models have been proven as a promising way to extract hierarchical latent representations from documents represented as high-dimensional bag-of-words vectors. However, the representation capability of existing deep topic models is still limited by the phenomenon of “ posterior collapse ”, which has been widely criticized in deep generative models, resulting in the higher-level latent representations exhibiting similar or meaningless patterns. To this end, in this paper, we first develop a novel deep-coupling generative process for existing deep topic models, which incorporates skip connections into the generation of documents, enforcing strong links between the document and its multi-layer latent representations. After that, utilizing data augmentation techniques, we reformulate the deep-coupling generative process as a Markov decision process and develop a corresponding Policy Gradient (PG) based training algorithm, which can further alleviate the information reduction at higher layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our developed methods can effectively alleviate “ posterior collapse ” in deep topic models, contributing to providing higher-quality latent document representations.
