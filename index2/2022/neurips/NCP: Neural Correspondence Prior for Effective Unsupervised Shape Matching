Specifically, we first give a background on functional maps in Appendix A. Next, the implementation details are provided in Appendix B. The implementation details of our few-shot keypoint detection algorithm are presented in Appendix C. In Appendix D, we provide a complete formulation and proof of the theorem we introduced in Sec. 3.2 of the main text. In Appendix E, we provide an experiment to verify the conditions of the aforementioned theorem. We present a more in-depth analysis of the Neural Correspondence Prior (NCP) effect in Appendix F. Additional quantitative and qualitative results for the shape matching on man-made data tasks are included in Appendix G. An experiment showing the performance of our method in the case of near isometric data is presented in Appendix H. Finally, we discuss the societal impact of our work in Appendix I.
