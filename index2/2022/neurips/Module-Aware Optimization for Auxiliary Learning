In line 2 of (A2), we obtain the relation between ∇αθM and its previous term ∇αθM−1, like a linear function with its weight (I − η1∇2θM−1L̄t(α, θM−1)) and bias term −η1∇α∇θM−1L̄t(α, θM−1) . In the following derivation, ∇αθM−1 can be replaced with its previous linear form of ∇αθM−2, until we reach the initial ∇αθ0, which equals to 0. Summing up all the bias terms gives the final expression. From (A2), the derivation of ∇αθM requires the Jacobi and Hessian matrix in previous M steps, which is memory consuming. By approximating all previous θτ as θM , we obtain the following best-response approximation:
