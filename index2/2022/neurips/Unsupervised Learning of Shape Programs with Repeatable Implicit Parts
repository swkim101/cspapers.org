This document contains additional materials for our proposed method, ProGRIP, including additional details of our implementation (Sec. A), two demonstrative applications in semantic shape editing (Sec. B) and shape compactness (Sec. C), our study on using repeatable parts instead of posed parts for segmentation (Sec. D), a comparison on reconstruction quality between our box abstractions and our posed implicit functions (Sec. E), a comparison on reconstruction quality between repeatable parts and nonrepeatable parts both using implicit shape representations (Sec. F), more baselines (Sec. G), more qualitative visualizations (Sec. H), and some representative failure cases of our method (Sec. I). Please visit our project webpage, progrip-project.github.io , for additional visualizations.
