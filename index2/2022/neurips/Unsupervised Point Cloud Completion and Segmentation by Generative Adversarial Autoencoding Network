Most existing point cloud completion methods assume the input partial point cloud is clean, which is not the case in practice, and are generally based on supervised learning. In this paper, we present an unsupervised generative adversarial au-toencoding network, named UGAAN, which completes the partial point cloud contaminated by surroundings from real scenes and cutouts the object simultaneously, only using artificial CAD models as assistance. The generator of UGAAN learns to predict the complete point clouds on real data from both the discriminator and the autoencoding process of artificial data. The latent codes from generator are also fed to discriminator which makes encoder only extract object features rather than noises. We also devise a refiner for generating better complete cloud with a segmentation module to separate the object from background. We train our UGAAN with one real scene dataset and evaluate it with the other two. Extensive experiments and visualization demonstrate our superiority, generalization and robustness. Comparisons against the previous method show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised point cloud completion and segmentation on real data.
