Temporal difference (TD) learning with function approximations (linear functions or neural networks) has achieved remarkable empirical success, giving impetus to the development of ﬁnite-time analysis. As an accelerated version of TD, the adaptive TD has been proposed and proved to enjoy ﬁnite-time convergence under the linear function approximation. Existing numerical results have demonstrated the superiority of adaptive algorithms to vanilla ones. Nevertheless, the performance guarantee of adaptive TD with neural network approximation remains widely unknown. This paper establishes the ﬁnite-time analysis for the adaptive TD with multi-layer ReLU networks approximation whose samples are generated from a Markov decision process. Our established theory shows that if the width of the deep neural network is large enough, the adaptive TD using neural network approximation can ﬁnd the (optimal) value function with high probabilities under the same iteration complexity as TD in general cases. Furthermore, we show that the adaptive TD using neural network approximation, with the same width and searching area, can achieve theoretical acceleration when the stochastic semi-gradients decay fast.
