Aiming to locate the object that emits a specified sound in complex scenes, the task of sounding object localization bridges two perception-oriented modalities of vision and acoustics, and brings enormous research value to the comprehensive perceptual understanding of machine intelligence. Although there are massive training data collected in this field, few of them contain accurate bounding box annotations, hindering the learning process and further application of proposed models. In order to address this problem, we try to explore an effective multi-modal knowledge transfer strategy to obtain precise knowledge from other similar tasks and transfer it through well-aligned multi-modal data to deal with this task in a zero-resource manner. Concretely, we design and propose a novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions. The former is utilized to extract the knowledge related to referring object localization from the image grounding task, while the latter is devised to learn a universal semantic space shared between texts and audios. Moreover, we further develop an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of our model. The extensive experiments on various publicly-available benchmarks demonstrate that TURN can achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches without using any data in this field, which verifies the feasibility of our proposed mechanisms and strategies.
