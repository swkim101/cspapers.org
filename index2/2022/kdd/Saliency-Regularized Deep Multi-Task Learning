Multi-task learning (MTL) is a framework that enforces multiple learning tasks to share their knowledge to improve their generalization abilities. While shallow multi-task learning can learn task relations, it can only handle pre-defined features. Modern deep multi-task learning can jointly learn latent features and task sharing, but they are obscure in task relation. Also, they pre-define which layers and neurons should share across tasks and cannot learn adaptively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework that jointly learns latent features and explicit task relations by complementing the strength of existing shallow and deep multitask learning scenarios. Specifically, we propose to model the task relation as the similarity between tasks' input gradients, with a theoretical analysis of their equivalency. In addition, we innovatively propose a multi-task learning objective that explicitly learns task relations by a new regularizer. Theoretical analysis shows that the generalizability error has been reduced thanks to the proposed regularizer. Extensive experiments on several multi-task learning and image classification benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, efficiency as well as reasonableness in the learned task relation patterns.
