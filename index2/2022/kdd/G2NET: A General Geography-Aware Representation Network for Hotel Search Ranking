Hotel search ranking is the core function of Online Travel Platforms (OTPs), while geography information of location entities involved in it plays a critically important role in guaranteeing its ranking quality. The closest line of works to the hotel search ranking problem is thus the next POI (or location) recommendation problem, which has extensive works but fails to cope with two new challenges, i.e., consideration of two more location entities and effective utilization of geographical information, in a hotel search ranking scenario. To this end, we propose a General Geography-aware representation NETwork (G2NET for short) to better represent geography information of location entities so as to optimize the hotel search ranking. In G2NET, to address the first challenge, we first propose the concept of Geography Interaction Schema (GIS) which is a meta template for representing the arbitrary number of location entity types and their interactions. Then, a novel geography interaction encoder is devised providing general representation ability for an instance of GIS, followed by an attentive operation that aggregates representations of instances corresponding to all historically interacted hotels of a user in a weighted manner. The second challenge is handled by the combined application of three proposed geography embedding modules in G2NET, each of which focuses on computing embeddings of location entities based on a certain aspect of geographical information of location entities. Moreover, a self-attention layer is deployed in G2NET, to capture correlations among historically interacted hotels of a user which provides non-trivial functionality of understanding the user's behaviors. Both offline and online experiments show that G2NET outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. G2NET has now been successfully deployed to provide the high-quality hotel search ranking service at Fliggy, one of the most popular OTPs in China, serving tens of millions of users.
