We introduce a random hypergraph model for core-periphery structure. By leveraging our model's sufficient statistics, we develop a novel statistical inference algorithm that is able to scale to large hypergraphs with runtime that is practically linear wrt. the number of nodes in the graph after a preprocessing step that is almost linear in the number of hyperedges, as well as a scalable sampling algorithm. Our inference algorithm is capable of learning embeddings that correspond to the reputation (rank) of a node within the hypergraph. We also give theoretical bounds on the size of the core of hypergraphs generated by our model. We experiment with hypergraph data that range to âˆ¼ 105 hyperedges mined from the Microsoft Academic Graph, Stack Exchange, and GitHub and show that our model outperforms baselines wrt. producing good fits.
