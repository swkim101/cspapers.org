With advancement of recent network and chip technologies, IoT devices are becoming smarter with increasing compute power, bandwidth, and storage available on the device. This enables intelligent decision making and information transferring on the devices and unleashes the power of AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) that supports applications such as smart city/agriculture/manufacturing/health care and self-driving scenarios. The AIoT Workshop is a forum for researchers, scientists, engineers, and practitioners to share and learn AI powered IoT solutions. The AIoT is a multi-disciplinary area, which include but not limited to IoT, AI/ML, embedded systems, networking, and stream analytics. The 5th AIoT workshop will be hosted in person in conjunction with the 28th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2022). The workshop program consists of keynotes, invited talks, accepted technical paper presentations, as well as a digital agriculture hackathon panel
