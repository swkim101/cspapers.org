Search result diversification focuses on reducing redundancy and improving subtopic richness in the results for a given query. Most existing approaches measure document diversity mainly based on text or pre-trained representations. However, some underlying relationships between the query and documents are difficult for the model to capture only from the content. Given that the knowledge base can offer well-defined entities and explicit relationships between entities, we exploit knowledge to model the relationship between documents and the query and propose a knowledge-enhanced search result diversification approach KEDIV. Concretely, we build a query-specific relation graph to model the complicated query-document relationship from an entity view. Then a graph neural network and node weight adjust algorithm are applied to the relation graph to obtain context-aware entity representations and document representations at each selection step. The diversity features are derived from the updated node representations of the relation graph. In this way, we can take advantage of entities' abundant information to model document's diversity in search result diversification. Experimental results on commonly used datasets show that our proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.
