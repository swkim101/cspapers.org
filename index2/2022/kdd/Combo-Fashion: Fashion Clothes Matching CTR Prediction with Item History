As one of the fundamental trends for future development of recommender systems, Fashion Clothes Matching Recommendation for click-through rate (CTR) prediction has become an increasingly essential task. Unlike traditional single-item recommendation, a combo item, composed of a top item (e.g. a shirt) and a bottom item (e.g. a skirt), is recommended. In such a task, the matching effect between these two single items plays a crucial role, and greatly influences the users' preferences; however, it is usually neglected by previous approaches in CTR prediction. In this work, we tackle this problem by designing a novel algorithm called Combo-Fashion, which extracts the matching effect by introducing the matching history of the combo item with two cascaded modules: (i) Matching Search Module (MSM) seeks the popular combo items and undesirable ones as a positive set and a negative set, respectively; (ii) Matching Prediction Module (MPM) models the precise relationship between the candidate combo item and the positive/negative set by an attention-based deep model. Besides, the CPM Fashion Attribute, considered from characteristic, pattern and material, is applied to capture the matching effect further. As part of this work, we release two large-scale datasets consisting of 3.56 million and 6.01 million user behaviors with rich context and fashion information in millions of combo items. The experimental results over these two real-world datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed model with significant improvements. Furthermore, we have deployed Combo-Fashion onto the platform of Taobao to recommend the combo items to the users, where an 8-day online A/B test proved the effectiveness of Combo-Fashion with an improvement of pCTR by 1.02% and uCTR by 0.70%.
