Flow graphs capture the directed flow of a quantity of interest (e.g., water, power, vehicles) being transported through an underlying network. Modeling and generating realistic flow graphs is key in many applications in infrastructure design, transportation, and biomedical and social sciences. However, they pose a great challenge to existing generative models due to a complex dynamics that is often governed by domain-specific physical laws or patterns. We introduce FlowGEN, an implicit generative model for flow graphs, that learns how to jointly generate graph topologies and flows with diverse dynamics directly from data using a novel (flow) graph neural network. Experiments show that our approach is able to effectively reproduce relevant local and global properties of flow graphs, including flow conservation, cyclic trends, and congestion around hotspots.
