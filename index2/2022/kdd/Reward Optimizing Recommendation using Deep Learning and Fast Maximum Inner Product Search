How can we build and optimize a recommender system that must rapidly fill slates (i.e. banners) of personalized recommendations? The combination of deep learning stacks with fast maximum inner product search (MIPS) algorithms have shown it is possible to deploy flexible models in production that can rapidly deliver personalized recommendations to users. Albeit promising, this methodology is unfortunately not sufficient to build a recommender system which maximizes the reward, e.g. the probability of click. Usually instead a proxy loss is optimized and A/B testing is used to test if the system actually improved performance. This tutorial takes participants through the necessary steps to model the reward and directly optimize the reward of recommendation engines built upon fast search algorithms to produce high-performance reward-optimizing recommender systems.
