Time series data are ubiquitous, and is one of the fastest growing and richest types of data. Recent advances in sensing technologies has resulted in a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. This demands development of new tools and solutions. The goals of this workshop are to: (1) highlight the significant challenges that underpin learning and mining from time series data (e.g. irregular sampling, spatiotemporal structure, uncertainty quantification), (2) discuss recent algorithmic, theoretical, statistical, or systems-based developments for tackling these problems, and (3) exploring new frontiers in time series analysis and their connections with important topics such as knowledge representation, reasoning, control, and business intelligence. In summary, our workshop will focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of time series data analysis and will provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss potential research directions, key technical issues, and present solutions to tackle related issues in practical applications. We will invite researchers and practitioners from the related areas of AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, and many others to contribute to this workshop.
