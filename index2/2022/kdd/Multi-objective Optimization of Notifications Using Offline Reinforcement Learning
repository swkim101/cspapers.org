Mobile notification systems play a major role in a variety of applications to communicate, send alerts and reminders to the users to inform them about news, events or messages. In this paper, we formulate the near-real-time notification decision problem as a Markov Decision Process where we optimize for multiple objectives in the rewards. We propose an end-to-end offline reinforcement learning framework to optimize sequential notification decisions. We address the challenge of offline learning using a Double Deep Q-network method based on Conservative Q-learning that mitigates the distributional shift problem and Q-value overestimation. We illustrate our fully-deployed system and demonstrate the performance and benefits of the proposed approach through both offline and online experiments.
