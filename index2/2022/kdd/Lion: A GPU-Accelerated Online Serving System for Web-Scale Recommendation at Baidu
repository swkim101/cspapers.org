Deep Neural Network (DNN) based recommendation systems are widely used in the modern internet industry for a variety of services. However, the rapid expansion of application scenarios and the explosive global internet traffic growth have caused the industry to face increasing challenges to serve the complicated recommendation workflow regarding online recommendation efficiency and compute resource overhead. In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated online serving system, namely Lion, which consists of the staged event-driven heterogeneous pipeline, unified memory manager, and automatic execution optimizer to handle web-scale traffic in a real-time and cost-effective way. Moreover, Lion provides a heterogeneous template library to enable fast development and migration for diverse in-house web-scale recommendation systems without requiring knowledge of heterogeneous programming. The system is currently deployed at Baidu, supporting over twenty recommendation services, including news feed, short video clips, and the search engine. Extensive experimental studies on five real-world deployed online recommendation services demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GPU-accelerated online serving system. Since launched in early 2020, Lion has answered billions of recommendation requests per day, and has helped Baidu successfully save millions of U.S. dollars in hardware and utility costs per year.
