Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become an appealing approach for knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, when the classes in source and target domains are imbalanced, most existing UDA methods experience significant performance drop, as the decision boundary usually favors the majority classes. Some recent class-imbalanced domain adaptation (CDA) methods aim to tackle the challenge of biased label distribution by exploiting pseudo-labeled target samples during training process. However, these methods suffer from the issues with unreliable pseudo labels and error accumulation during training. In this paper, we propose a pairwise adversarial training approach for class-imbalanced domain adaptation. Unlike conventional adversarial training in which the adversarial samples are obtained from the lp ball of the original samples, we generate adversarial samples from the interpolated line of the aligned pairwise samples from source and target domains. The pairwise adversarial training (PAT) is a novel data-augmentation method which can be integrated into existing UDA models to tackle with the CDA problem. Experimental results and ablation studies show that the UDA models integrated with our method achieve considerable improvements on benchmarks compared with the original models as well as the state-of-the-art CDA methods.
