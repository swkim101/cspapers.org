Online  behavioral  advertising,  and  the  associated tracking  paraphernalia,  poses  a  real  privacy  threat.  Unfortunately,  existing  privacy-enhancing  tools  are  not  always  effective against  online  advertising  and  tracking.  We  propose  HARPO, a  principled  learning-based  approach  to  subvert  online  behavioral advertising through obfuscation. HARPO uses reinforcement learning to adaptively interleave real page visits with fake pages to distort a tracker’s view of a user’s browsing profile. We evaluate HARPO against real-world user profiling and ad targeting models used  for  online  behavioral  advertising.  The  results  show  that HARPO improves privacy by triggering more than 40% incorrect interest segments and 6×higher bid values. HARPO outperforms existing  obfuscation  tools  by  as  much  as  16×for  the  same overhead.  HARPO is  also  able  to  achieve  better  stealthiness  to adversarial  detection  than  existing  obfuscation  tools.   HARPO meaningfully  advances  the  state-of-the-art  in  leveraging  obfuscation  to  subvert  online  behavioral  advertising.
