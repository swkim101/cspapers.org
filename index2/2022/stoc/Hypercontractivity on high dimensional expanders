We prove hypercontractive inequalities on high dimensional expanders. As in the settings of the p-biased hypercube, the symmetric group, and the Grassmann scheme, our inequalities are effective for global functions, which are functions that are not significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. As applications, we obtain Fourier concentration, small-set expansion, and Kruskal–Katona theorems for high dimensional expanders. Our techniques rely on a new approximate Efron–Stein decomposition for high dimensional link expanders.
