We introduce DISTAL, a compiler for dense tensor algebra that targets modern distributed and heterogeneous systems. DISTAL lets users independently describe how tensors and computation map onto target machines through separate format and scheduling languages. The combination of choices for data and computation distribution creates a large design space that includes many algorithms from both the past (e.g., Cannonâ€™s algorithm) and the present (e.g., COSMA). DISTAL compiles a tensor algebra domain specific language to a distributed task-based runtime system and supports nodes with multi-core CPUs and multiple GPUs. Code generated by is competitive with optimized codes for matrix multiply on 256 nodes of the Lassen supercomputer and outperforms existing systems by between 1.8x to 3.7x (with a 45.7x outlier) on higher order tensor operations.
