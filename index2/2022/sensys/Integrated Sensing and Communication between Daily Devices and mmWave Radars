Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar has demonstrated excellent performance in object tracking and micro-displacement detection. Besides the powerful sensing function, this work brings the communication function, allowing daily devices to communicate with mmWave radars through vibrations. In this work, we present VibBeat, in which a daily device (e.g., smartphone and smartwatch) sends messages by modulating vibrations, while a mmWave radar receives the messages by detecting and decoding the vibrations with reflected mmWave signals. By doing so, the device (user) can not only be passively sensed by a mmWave radar, but also actively send messages to the radar for a personalized response. We implement our system using a COTS mmWave radar and smartphones without any hardware modification. Experimental results show that VibBeat supports multiple object communication and achieves a communication range of up to 5m.
