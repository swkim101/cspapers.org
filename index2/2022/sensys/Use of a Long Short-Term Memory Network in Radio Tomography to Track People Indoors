The aim of the research is to develop a system enabling effective and efficient tracking of people inside buildings using radio waves. The presented concept uses radio tomography imaging (RTI) as a passive analysis of radio wave interference as well as active connections with transmitting and receiving devices---mainly smartphones. A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was used to solve the inverse tomographic problem of converting measurements into images. The presented concept uses a proprietary design of transducers, which are transmitting and receiving devices that can exchange information with each other and establish connections with other devices. The novelty is the hybrid nature of the people location system, using both device-free and device-based methods. Another new approach is using the LSTM network to solve the inverse problem in RTI. Both solutions make the location system much more flexible, which makes imaging much more accurate and reliable.
