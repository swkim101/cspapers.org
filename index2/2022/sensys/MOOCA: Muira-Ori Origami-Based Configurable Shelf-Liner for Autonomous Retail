Current autonomous checkout is often enable by the use of multiple overhead cameras and/or load sensors on shelf, which is limited by the occlusion and dense deployment. We present MOOCA, an origami-inspired low-cost configurable surface structure as the smart shelf liner. MOOCA leverage conductive threads and copper wires integrated in to the origami structure to detect and recognize pick-up and put-down products. We build our prototype with 3D printed structure using elastic resin. We will demonstrate MOOCA's functionality of predicting the item that is picked up from it.
