We present MicNest: an acoustic localization system enabling precise landing of aerial drones. Drone landing is a crucial step in a drone's operation, especially as high-bandwidth wireless networks, such as 5G, enable beyond-line-of-sight operation in a shared airspace and applications such as instant asset delivery with drones gain traction. In MicNest, multiple microphones are deployed on a landing platform in carefully devised configurations. The drone carries a speaker transmitting purposefully-designed acoustic pulses. The drone may be localized as long as the pulses are correctly detected. Doing so is challenging: i) because of limited transmission power, propagation attenuation, background noise, and propeller interference, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of received pulses is intrinsically low; ii) the pulses experience non-linear Doppler distortion due to the physical drone dynamics while airborne; iii) as location information is to be used during landing, the processing latency must be reduced to effectively feed the flight control loop. To tackle these issues, we design a novel pulse detector, Matched Filter Tree (MFT), whose idea is to convert pulse detection to a tree search problem. We further present three practical methods to accelerate tree search jointly. Our real-world experiments show that MicNest is able to localize a drone 120 m away with 0.53% relative localization error at 20 Hz location update frequency.
