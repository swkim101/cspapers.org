With increasing numbers of nano-satellites (CubeSats) being launched into space in recent years, monitoring their health and debugging become crucial problems. In traditional systems such as big satellites, time-series telemetry is widely used by users to monitor the state of the satellite from the ground stations. However, today smaller CubeSats do not enjoy the benefits of live telemetry due to low throughput and lack of coverage from ground station infrastructure. In this poster, we conduct a motivation study based on data collected from public satellites in low-earth orbit to demonstrate the potential bottlenecks in obtaining live telemetry data from CubeSats. We then describe the design space of possible solutions and opportunities for researchers to improve time-series telemetry for CubeSats.
