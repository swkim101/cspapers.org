Energy harvesting (EH) devices without batteries can enable the Internet of Things (IoT) to reach new and challenging scenarios. Multihop routing is needed to extend the range but, when low EH causes intermittency, it has been overlooked and is not possible with existing protocols. Also, whilst wake-up receivers (WuRxs) have been used to enable star networks, the cost of another EH node sending wake-ups, required for multihop communication, has not been considered. This paper adapts the opportunistic RPL (ORPL) protocol to make possible multihop routing between intermittently-powered devices. Furthermore, the benefit of using WuRx to enable networks is measured, considering different sensitivity devices and associated range. Comparing ORPL to RPL, we show that opportunistic routing enables multihop communication where RPL cannot. If WuRx are used for routing towards a central hub, the more sensitive WuRx perform better, but routing cross-network benefits from lower sensitivity, lower power WuRx.
