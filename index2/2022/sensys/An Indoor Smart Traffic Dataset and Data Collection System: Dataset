Smart traffic is an emerging research area gaining more attention due to a class of emerging applications such as autonomous driving. Most smart traffic scenarios are outdoors, which are hard to collect traffic data and build demanding sensing systems. In this work, an indoor smart traffic testbed with an F1TENTH autonomous driving vehicle is built, allowing the collection of traffic datasets under different scenarios and performing various smart traffic tasks. This novel data collection system and collected dataset can help research teams build various smart traffic systems and evaluate indoor smart traffic datasets. The collected traffic light dataset is publicly available at the link1.
