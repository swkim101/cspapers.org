Energy harvesting technology enables the battery-free realization of some sensing, computing, and connectivity functions. However, its promotion in battery-free human-computer interaction is relatively slow in comparison. There is a critical energy gap around interactive devices which are screen-focused and usually power-hungry. This energy gap can be narrowed down and filled up by selecting a proper display and taking a sophisticated hardware and software co-design. Motion-powered gameboy, the first robust personal mobile gaming device, is manufactured by combining the features of a bistable E-ink display and a quasi-static toggling motion energy harvester. With the hardware-software co-design, the amount of energy generated by the player's pinch action can adequately guarantee successful user interaction and preferable user experience. The design methodology of the motion-powered game-boy provides a valuable example for the development of motion-powered human-computer interactive devices.
