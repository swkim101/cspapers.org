In this work, we demonstrate a radically novel approach towards inertial-only tracking of wrist in real-time on a smartwatch for air-writing tasks. Deriving motion trajectories from commercial-grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) has always been a challenging task due to inherent sensor errors and associated trajectory drift. Computationally expensive solutions offered in literature cannot be used for a fully real-time tracking while also maintaining acceptable accuracy. This work presents 'NNTrak', marking our attempt to address these issues using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained to learn various strokes of the wrist and efficiently generates motion trajectory in real-time for air-writing. For this demonstration, we show computationally constrained Raspberry Pi 3B running our solution and a smartwatch worn while drawing a gesture in air with the trajectory being displayed in true real-time.
