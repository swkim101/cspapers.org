LoRa has emerged as a key wireless communication technology for a gateway to provide geographically-distributed IoT devices with low-rate, long-range connections. In this paper, we present MaLoRaGW, the first-of-its-kind Multi-antenna LoRa GateWay that enables multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) LoRa communications in both uplink and downlink. MaLoRaGW was inspired by the success of MU-MIMO in cellular and Wi-Fi networks. The key component of MaLoRaGW is a joint baseband PHY design for uplink packet detection and downlink beamforming. Its innovation lies in three modules: spatial signal projection, accurate channel estimation, and implicit beamforming, all of which reside only in a LoRa gateway and require no modification on LoRa client devices. We have built a prototype of two-antenna MaLoRaGW on a USRP device and extensively evaluated its performance with commercial LoRa dongles in three scenarios: lab, office building, and university campus. Our experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, the two-antenna MaLoRaGW increases uplink throughput by 10% and downlink throughput by 95%.
