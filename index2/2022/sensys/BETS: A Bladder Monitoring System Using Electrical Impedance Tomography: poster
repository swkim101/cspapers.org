In this study are presented the results of our ongoing research on an original concept for visualizing and tracking the state of the urinary bladder. We have developed a measuring device based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Using electrical current stimulation and measuring the resulting voltages on a patient's body surface, we can visualize the bladder's position and shape, allowing us to analyze its filling level. The project also involves the development of diagnostic methods for functional disorders of the lower urinary tract. In addition, the device will measure muscle tension by electromyography, with the possibility of incorporating electrostimulation therapy. This approach can be used to monitor and support the treatment of patients with various health conditions related to the urinary bladder.
