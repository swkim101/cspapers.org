With an ongoing search for alternative energy sources, plants may serve as a viable means for operating low-power digital circuits. Biopotential, the electrical signals found within the body due to electrochemical activity, can be monitored and harnessed within plants and vegetables. Measuring plant biopotential, in combination with electrogenic microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology [14], suggests that a self-sufficient and micro-power generation system can be made using a microbial fuel cell in tandem with a living plant [18]. This research presents ongoing work in proposed sub-systems within this power generation system and their compatibility with low-power electronics, a project inspired from works focused on converting plants into batteries [7, 8]. The power harvesting aspect of the project consists of long deployment experiments with mud based MFCs using MudWatt kits, as well as a plant based MFC. The plant sensing aspect of the project is depending on thigmonastic reactions from the plant specie Mimosa pudica.
