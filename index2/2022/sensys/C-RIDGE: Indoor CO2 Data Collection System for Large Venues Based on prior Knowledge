CO2 concentration data with high resolution in large venues is highly required during indoor sport events for in-time environment adjustment to guarantee the athlete performances and audience experience. However, the limited battery energy of the wireless sensors cannot support high data resolution and long time coverage simultaneously. Besides, there also lacks effective embedded methods to clean anomaly data caused by the human and environmental factors probably occurring in large venues. Thus, in this paper, we propose C-RIDGE, a low-power sensing system for high resolution CO2 data collection in large venues. Based on prior knowledge, firstly, an adaptive sampling rate adjustment policy is developed for lower energy consumption to extend the time coverage of data. Secondly, CO2 physical property (CPP) aided data cleaning algorithm is designed to improve data quality as well, using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and standard deviation with sliding windows. C-RIDGE has been deployed in one venue during a world-class event. The experiments and collected data have shown the system power consumption can be reduced by 36.1%, with measurement error less than 10.2%. The outliers and anomaly trends can also be detected and calibrated effectively via CPP algorithm. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7160830.
