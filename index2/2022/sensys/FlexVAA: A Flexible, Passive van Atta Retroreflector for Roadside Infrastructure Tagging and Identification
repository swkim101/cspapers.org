We propose FlexVAA, a system for identifying roadside infrastructure using flexible, passive wireless retroreflectors. FlexVAA can be easily attached to any surface, allowing roadside infrastructure to be upgraded for autonomous systems without impairing existing operations. Preliminary results show that attaching FlexVAA to a surface reflects more power than without FlexVAA attached. In the future, we plan to arrange multiple FlexVAA elements in order to embed data in the passively reflected signal, allowing identification for multiple unique tags.
