The promise of individualized care for improving animal welfare demands real-time continuous monitoring of animals. While technology has helped crop agriculture realize the goals of precision care, animal agriculture is still lacking domain-adapted technology. In this work, we present a novel Criticality-Aware Self-Powered in-vivo sensing Edge for pRecision animal agriculture, CASPER. Enabling real-time monitoring of a suite of biomarkers while scavenging power from both thermal and physiological sources, CASPER promises unprecedented adaptability, range, and life-cycle for such an edge node. Field deployments show that CASPER generates 30mW of power with a surplus of 9.08mW, during the ultra-low power mode. The criticality-aware control is proven to capture deviation in trends of biomarker activity that would be missed in fixed-interval transmission. Hence proving the validity and effectiveness of CASPER.
