In this paper, I pose a major challenge for AI researchers: to develop
systems that learn in a human-like manner. I briefly review the
history of machine learning, noting that early work made close contact
with results from cognitive psychology but that this is no longer the
case. I identify seven characteristics of human behavior that, if
reproduced, would offer better ways to acquire expertise than
statistical induction over massive training sets. I illustrate these
points with two domains - mathematics and driving - where people
are effective learners and review systems that address them. In
closing, I suggest ways to encourage more research on human-like
learning.
