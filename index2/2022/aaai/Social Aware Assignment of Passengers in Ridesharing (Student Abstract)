We analyze the assignment of passengers in a shared ride, which considers the social relationship among the passengers. Namely, there is a fixed number of passengers in each vehicle, and the goal is to recommend an assignment of the passengers such that the number of friendship relations is maximized. We show that the problem is computationally hard, and we provide an approximation algorithm.
