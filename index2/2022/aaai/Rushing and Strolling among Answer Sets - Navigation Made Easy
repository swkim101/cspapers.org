Answer set programming (ASP) is a popular declarative programming paradigm
 with a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence. Oftentimes,
 when modeling an AI problem with ASP, and in particular when we are interested
 beyond simple search for optimal solutions, an actual solution, differences
 between solutions, or number of solutions of the ASP program matter. For
 example, when a user aims to identify a specific answer set according to her
 needs, or requires the total number of diverging solutions to comprehend
 probabilistic applications such as reasoning in medical domains. Then, there
 are only certain problem specific and handcrafted encoding techniques
 available to navigate the solution space of ASP programs, which is oftentimes
 not enough. In this paper, we propose a formal and general framework for
 interactive navigation toward desired subsets of answer sets analogous to
 faceted browsing. Our approach enables the user to explore the solution space
 by consciously zooming in or out of sub-spaces of solutions at a certain
 configurable pace. We illustrate that weighted faceted navigation is
 computationally hard. Finally, we provide an implementation of our approach
 that demonstrates the feasibility of our framework for incomprehensible
 solution spaces.
