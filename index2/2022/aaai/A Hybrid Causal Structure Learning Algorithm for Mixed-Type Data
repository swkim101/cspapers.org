Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables is a crucial problem in many disciplines of science. Over the past two decades, various approaches have been pro- posed for causal discovery from observational data. How- ever, most of the existing methods are designed for either purely discrete or continuous data, which limit their practical usage. In this paper, we target the problem of causal structure learning from observational mixed-type data. Although there are a few methods that are able to handle mixed-type data, they suffer from restrictions, such as linear assumption and poor scalability. To overcome these weaknesses, we formulate the causal mechanisms via mixed structure equation model and prove its identifiability under mild conditions. A novel locally consistent score, named CVMIC, is proposed for causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure learning. Moreover, we propose an efficient conditional independence test, named MRCIT, for mixed-type data, which is used in causal skeleton learning and final pruning to further improve the computational efficiency and precision of our model. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed hybrid model outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.
