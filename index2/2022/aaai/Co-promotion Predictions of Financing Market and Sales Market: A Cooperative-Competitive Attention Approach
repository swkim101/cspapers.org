Market popularity prediction has always been a hot research topic, such as sales prediction and crowdfunding prediction. Most of these studies put the perspective on isolated markets, relying on the knowledge of certain market to maximize the prediction performance. However, these market-specific approaches are restricted by the knowledge limitation of isolated markets and incapable of the complicated and potential relations among different markets, especially some with strong dependence such as the financing market and sales market. Fortunately, we discover potentially symbiotic relations between the financing market and the sales market, which provides us with an opportunity to co-promote the popularity predictions of both markets. Thus, for bridgly learning the knowledge interactions between financing market and sales market, we propose a cross-market approach, namely CATN: Cooperative-competitive Attention Transfer Network, which could effectively transfer knowledge of financing capability from the crowdfunding market and sales prospect from the E-commerce market. Specifically, for capturing the complicated relations especially the cooperation or complement of items and enhancing the knowledge transfer between the two heterogeneous markets, we design a novel Cooperative Attention; meanwhile, for finely computing the relations of items especially the competition in specific same market, we further design Competitive Attentions for the two markets respectively. Besides, we also distinguish aligned features and unique features to adapt the cross-market predictions. With the real-world datasets collected from Indiegogo and Amazon, we construct extensive experiments on three types of datasets from the two markets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our CATN model.
