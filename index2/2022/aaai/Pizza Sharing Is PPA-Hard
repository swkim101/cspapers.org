We study the computational complexity of computing solutions for the
 straight-cut and square-cut pizza sharing problems. We show that finding an
 approximate solution is PPA-hard for the straight-cut problem, and
 PPA-complete for the square-cut problem, while finding an exact solution for
 the square-cut problem is FIXP-hard and in BU. Our PPA-hardness results apply
 even when all mass distributions are unions of non-overlapping squares, and our
 FIXP-hardness result applies even when all mass distributions are unions of
 weighted squares and right-angled triangles. We also prove that decision variants
 of the square-cut problem are hard: the approximate problem is
 NP-complete, and the exact problem is ETR-complete.
