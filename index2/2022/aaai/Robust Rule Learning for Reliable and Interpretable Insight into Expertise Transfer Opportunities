Intensive care in hospitals is distributed to different units that care for patient populations reflecting specific comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Unit expertise can be shared to potentially improve the quality of methods and outcomes for patients across units. We propose an algorithmic rule pruning approach for use in building short lists of human-interpretable rules that reliably identify patient beneficiaries of expertise transfers in the form of machine learning risk models. Our experimental results, obtained with two intensive care monitoring datasets, demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed method in practice.
