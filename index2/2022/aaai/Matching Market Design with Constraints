Two-sided matching is an important research area that has had a major impact on the design of real-world matching markets. One consistent feature in many of the real-world applications is that they impose new feasibility constraints that lead to research challenges. We survey developments in the field of two-sided matching with various constraints, including those based on regions, diversity, multi-dimensional capacities, and matroids.
