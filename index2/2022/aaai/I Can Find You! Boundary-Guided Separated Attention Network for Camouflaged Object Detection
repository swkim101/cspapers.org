Can you find me? By simulating how humans to discover the so-called 'perfectly'-camouflaged object, we present a novel boundary-guided separated attention network (call BSA-Net). Beyond the existing camouflaged object detection (COD) wisdom, BSA-Net utilizes two-stream separated attention modules to highlight the separator (or say the camouflaged object's boundary) between an image's background and foreground: the reverse attention stream helps erase the camouflaged object's interior to focus on the background, while the normal attention stream recovers the interior and thus pay more attention to the foreground; and both streams are followed by a boundary guider module and combined to strengthen the understanding of boundary. The core design of such separated attention is motivated by the COD procedure of humans: find the subtle difference between the foreground and background to delineate the boundary of a camouflaged object, then the boundary can help further enhance the COD accuracy. We validate on three benchmark datasets that the proposed BSA-Net is very beneficial to detect camouflaged objects with the blurred boundaries and similar colors/patterns with their backgrounds. Extensive results exhibit very clear COD improvements on our BSA-Net over sixteen SOTAs.
