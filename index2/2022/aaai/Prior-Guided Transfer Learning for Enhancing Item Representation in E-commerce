Item representation learning is crucial for search and recommendation tasks in e-commerce. In e-commerce, the instances (e.g., items, users) in different domains are always related. Such instance relationship across domains contains useful local information for transfer learning. However, existing transfer learning based approaches did not leverage this knowledge. In this paper, we report on our experience designing and deploying Prior-Guided Transfer Learning (PGTL) to bridge this gap. It utilizes the instance relationship across domains to extract prior knowledge for the target domain and leverages it to guide the fine-grained transfer learning for e-commerce item representation learning tasks. Rather than directly transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, the prior knowledge can serve as a bridge to link both domains and enhance knowledge transfer, especially when the domain distribution discrepancy is large. Since its deployment on the Taiwanese portal of Taobao in Aug 2020, PGTL has significantly improved the item exposure rate and item click-through rate compared to previous approaches
