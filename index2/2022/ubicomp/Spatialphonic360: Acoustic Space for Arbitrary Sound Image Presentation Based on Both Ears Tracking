Conventional stereophonic sound fixed the sweet spot or limited only the front sound image. Therefore, there is a problem that it cannot cover interactivity, such as the listener’s movement or turning around. In this study, we developed an interactive stereo system that can present a 360° sound image in any position and direction regardless of the direction of the listener’s face. User experiments were conducted in an anechoic chamber at representative points and head directions. The results show that the system can present the sound image with a maximum perceived error of 32.6° and 23.1° for the average, maintaining approximate accuracy in presenting the sound image.
