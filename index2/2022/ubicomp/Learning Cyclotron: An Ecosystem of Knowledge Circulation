The circulation of knowledge is an important function for enriching our social life. Knowledge circulation, which has traditionally been conducted manually, is undergoing a transformation in the age of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we describe our project called “Learning Cyclotron (LeCycl),” which was initiated to accelerate the circulation of knowledge for building a knowledge ecosystem based on artificial intelligence technology. The three functions of sensing, mastering, and transferring knowledge are effectively operated through the power of AI-empowered digital nudging strategies. We outline what has been accomplished to date and summarize future directions for the ultimate goal of LeCycl.
