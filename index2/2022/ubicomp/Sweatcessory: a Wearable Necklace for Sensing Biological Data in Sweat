Sweat contains various analytes (biochemical data) that can be used to monitor health. Electrochemical sweat biosensors non-invasively monitor analytes via an electrode in contact with the skin. We introduce Sweatcessory, a novel form factor (a wearable necklace) with a sodium-detecting sweat biosensor whose data can be viewed in a Bluetooth web app. We present a design rationale for sweat biosensor form factors, our implementation process for Sweatcessory, an app for visualization, and an electrode functional evaluation.
