The introduction of wearable sleep trackers, such as the Oura Ring, allow users to monitor the duration and quality of their sleep. For researchers in the fields of education and cognitive sciences, these wearables promise a new source of valuable data, especially if the wearables can be used outside of the laboratory. A problem in validating the wearable data for daily life is that it is difficult to give tasks which are both effective enough challenging users, but simple and quick enough that they can be completed by participants daily. In this poster, we present and in-the-wild study which employs a simple arithmetic task. The results indicate that sleep quality data from a wearable sleep trackers can be used to gauge performance.
