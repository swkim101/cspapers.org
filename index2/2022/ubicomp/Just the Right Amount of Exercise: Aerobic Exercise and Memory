A popular perception is that aerobic exercises are effective for improving performance on memory tasks. However, previous studies have not yet explored the effectiveness of aerobic exercise for individuals. We investigate the effects of aerobic exercise on English vocabulary learning by managing the conditions under which aerobic exercise is effective for individuals. We use a heart-rate sensor to control the amount of exertion a participant made on a treadmill while learning the vocabulary words. The results show this method can improve memory retention. This indicates that close monitoring of individual aerobic exertion through physiological sensing can make improved learning with exercise a reality.
