IMU data have shown promising results in the past to pervasively monitor usersâ€™ body language, including the determination of various bodily gestures, postures, and facial expressions. This paper demonstrates how earables could help address the stated problem. We provide a motivational study to assess earables for detecting body language corresponding to involved listeners. We further compare it with other sensing modalities like smartwatches and smartphones and accordingly develop a platform called enVolve. A lab-scale study with 17 participants demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed system with an average F1 score of more than .
