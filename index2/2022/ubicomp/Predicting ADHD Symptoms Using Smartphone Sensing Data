Adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an impairing disorder that affects multiple domains of functioning and manifests itself in the daily lives of adults with the disorder in far-reaching ways. ADHD affects a substantial minority of college-age students. Current diagnostic methods rely on self-report, which may introduce recall and other biases, and collateral reports may suffer from their own sources of bias. In addition, tracking treatment related change across time can be difficult. Smartphones are ubiquitous for many populations and can function as human sensors that generate a wealth of behavioral data; for example, GPS, SMS/call, and app usage data. In a pilot study, we explore the feasibility of using smartphone sensing data collected passively from an android app to predict ADHD symptoms. Our results indicate that specific ADHD inattention, sluggish cognitive tempo and hyperactivity symptoms could be predicted fairly accurately using the smartphone data collected from college students in a pilot study, with F1 score as high as 0.75.
