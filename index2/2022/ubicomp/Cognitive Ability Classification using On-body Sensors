This work presents an on-body sensor setup to keep track of the learning progress while performing cognitive activities in formal education. The proposed approach uses the sensor collected data for cognitive ability classification, i.e., confidence score, cognitive load, and expertise, while attempting to solve physics-related problems. Data is collected using a combination of instruction material, an eye-tracker, and a sensor pen to capture the cognition progress. The collected data is processed and transformed to feature representation using a novel feature-set presented in this paper for learning analytics. The used features help to highlight the difference in learnerâ€™s cognitive abilities and enable teachers to cater to individual needs and requirements, an essential aspect of need-based learning.
