With the actual development in urban life by the emerging trends around the smart city, along with cars yet considered as the primary source for commuting by city visitors, the parking infrastructures and parking lots management recreates a role in providing an easy mobility service with the sustainability of land use for the city. This ultimately impacted the driver well being. This work provides a foundation for measuring the Parking Wellbeing Index as a tailored refocus of the sustainability society index that takes into account the car parking experience. The framework makes use of the Occupancy rate of the parking site and traffic flow in the vicinity of the parking site, as well as the environmental aspect, which includes both the business/economical dimension and the Green (nature) dimension. We demonstrated how the developed index could be applied in Oulu City center, where a set of experiments have been conducted and tested. Especially, software architecture has been devised to automatically retrieve traffic and parking occupancy using the City of Oulu open data platform. While land use classification has been used to assess the Green and Business aspects of the parking area. The results could help the municipality better manage the buildings and the landscape in a way to maximize community wellbeing.
