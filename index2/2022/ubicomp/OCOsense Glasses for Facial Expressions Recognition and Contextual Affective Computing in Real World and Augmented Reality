The paper presents the novel OCOSenseTM smart glasses with integrated sensors, primarily non-contact optomyographic (OMG) OCOTM sensors, 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an altimeter. The glasses connect with a smartphone application, which facilitates the continuous and real-time measurements of facial-muscles activation and head movement, thus allowing for the detection of facial expressions and the activities of the user in real-time. We will demonstrate how the system is used in practice, i.e., a participant will wear the OCOSenseTM glasses, which will stream the sensor data to a tablet, where the real-time visualization of the sensor data and the data interpretation will be presented such as facial expressions (smile, frown, surprise) and activities. We believe that the OCOSenseTM glasses are the next big thing in wearables, which will allow for better understanding of the user's context, activities, emotional state, and more, which can be easily coupled within Augmented and Extended Reality environments.
