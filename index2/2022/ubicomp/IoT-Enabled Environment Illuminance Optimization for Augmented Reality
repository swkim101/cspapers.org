In order to provide high quality augmented reality (AR) experiences, environmental conditions such as light level must be conducive to a high level of virtual content stability, accurate eye tracking and good virtual content visibility. This is challenging due to the dynamic nature of environmental conditions and AR application requirements. In this poster we present the first automatic environment optimization system for AR which adapts to both environment lighting and texture. First we conduct experiments that demonstrate the effect of light level on virtual object stability and eye tracking. We then detail our edge computing system architecture which uses IoT devices to sense and adjust environment conditions, and lays the foundation for future environment-aware AR applications.
