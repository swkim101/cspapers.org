Wireless key generation is promising in establishing a pair of secret keys for ubiquitous Wi-Fi networks. However, existing Wi-Fi-based key generation systems are not always applicable in dynamic mobile wireless environments because they are completed on static personal computers. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel key generation system for dynamic mobile devices, named MobileKey. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to explore the feasibility of wireless key generation for mobile devices. Furthermore, we propose a fast and robust key generation scheme suitable for mobile devices. Evaluation in real-world environments shows that our system can achieve up to 5000 bit/s key generation rate and 99.1% key matching rate. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, MobileKey improves the key generation rate by 25 Ã—.
