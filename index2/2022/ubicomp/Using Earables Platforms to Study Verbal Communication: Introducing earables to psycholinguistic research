Earables provide a new opportunity to study conversation in the wild. They uniquely allow (i) accurate head motion tracking recorded synchronously with the speech signal and (ii) multiple people to simultaneously receive and stream conversational speech that is unconstrained by body movement. Here, our general aim is to introduce the use of earables for conducting psycholinguistic studies requiring audio and movement data jointly collected during verbal interaction in a natural setting. Specifically, we propose using earables platforms to address the relationship between head movement, speech and meaning transmission from single and multiple-person perspectives.
