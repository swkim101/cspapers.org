In this demonstration, we present a system design that helps to reduce the split attention effect in multimedia learning by providing an interactive environment with augmented reality support for elementary physics education. The system consists of three main components: smart boxes, smart cables, and visualization app. Each smart box contains an input to plug different electrical components (bulb, battery, and switches) and two sockets to interconnect the boxes with each other using smart cables. These boxes are equipped with various sensor modalities that provide information related to connected cable identifications and the physical status of the boxes. This information is shared through a Bluetooth Low Energy interface with the connected visualization device. Visualization devices range between handheld tablets with augmented reality capabilities and headwear smart glasses. These devices are used to run the supportive app. The app is responsible to track the smart boxes using markers and provide a 3D augmented visualization of information coming from them. This system targets introductory physics education, in addition holds the potential to provide assistance for more advanced electrical circuits in secondary or higher physics education.
