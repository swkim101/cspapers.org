Previous work by Li et al.[5] has shown promising results in sensing blood glucose levels using polarized light. In this paper, we miniaturize the glucose sensing prototype into a portable device. The process of prototype miniaturization has revealed challenges in dealing with specular reflected light caused by multiple reflections within the sensing box. We propose a new structural design that traps the light inside a chamber. Our preliminary results with a single user without diabetes over 5 days showed a 9.5% mean absolute relative difference (MARD). For this participant, 92% of our results are clinically accurate (within Zone A) and the remaining are clinically acceptable (within Zone B) of the Clarke Error Grid.
