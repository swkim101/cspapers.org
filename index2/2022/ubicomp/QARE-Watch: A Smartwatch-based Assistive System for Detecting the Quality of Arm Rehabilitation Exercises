Patients as well as healthy individuals often have to follow an exercise regimen at home that requires interactive support from a physical therapist. Although smartwatches have emerged as a great way for assisting daily exercises, existing systems do not focus on the quality factors of these exercises, such as, missed repetitions, missed steps, and duration. Towards addressing this notable gap in the literature, we present QARE-Watch, a smartwatch based system that efficiently measures these factors and assists the user accordingly. We conduct real life data collection from 12 participants and a preliminary evaluation in different settings to demonstrate the value of QARE-Watch for potential real life use.
