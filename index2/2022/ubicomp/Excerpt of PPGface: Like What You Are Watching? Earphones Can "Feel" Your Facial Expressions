Facial expression recognition has been widely explored to demonstrate peopleâ€™s emotional states. However, existing systems primarily rely on external devices which seems less accessible and efficient. To this end, we propose PPGface, a ubiquitous facial expression recognition platform that leverages earable devices with built-in PPG sensor. PPGface understands the facial expressions through the dynamic PPG patterns resulting from facial muscle movements. Through several comprehensive studies, this work validates a great potential to be employed in future commodity earable devices.
