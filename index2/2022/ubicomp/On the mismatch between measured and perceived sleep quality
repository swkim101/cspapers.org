Sleep quality has a significant impact on human’s physical and mental well-being. While there exist several definitions of what makes a good quantity and quality of sleep, such measures are not always in agreement with each other. Further, they often do not match with the human perception of a restorative sleep. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between objective sleep quality measurements – which can be sensed using wearable devices – and the sleeper’s subjective – i.e., self-reported – sleep quality. We analyze the M2Sleep dataset, which contains sleep data of 16 participants over one month, and show that only few sensor-based measures (sleep duration, skin temperature, tonic component of electrodermal activity, acceleration skewness and kurtosis) and personality-based features (extroversion, agreeableness, PSQI score) correlate with self-reported sleep quality. These results may inform the design of future studies on sleep quality assessment.
