Mindfulness has been actively investigated in HCI. While its positive effects on our cognitive functions are reported, carrying out mindfulness activities, in general, requires self-discipline to get its reported benefits. Our study aims to integrate a visual guide of breathing into computer-assisted learning to help the learner achieve better performance. We present within-subject research with 10 participants who learned sets of Croatian vocabulary with a multiple-choice interface showing either for 10 seconds: (a) guided-breath or (b) break instruction after every question. Our hypothesis was that (a) brings a better learner’s score than (b). However, statistical analysis of learners’ quiz scores did not support our hypothesis, which brought us two lessons for future improvements of our work-in-progress research. Such intervention (i) could lead to distraction rather than concentration without careful quantity and quality, and (ii) might need personalization depending on individual mindfulness levels.
