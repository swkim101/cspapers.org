Smart glasses and VR goggles are becoming more and more popular. In these products, the home screen is displayed without user authentication after the power is turned on. While using the device, the user may be asked to enter passwords when logging in to applications or making payments, and it is common to use the attached touchpad or to use a handheld controller to enter information from the software keyboard on the screen. There are also eyeglass-type devices without displays, however, they generally do not authenticate the user. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically and periodically identify individuals by applying active acoustic sensing technology with a speaker and a microphone mounted on the nose pad. In the proposed method, an acoustic signal is played from a speaker in the nose pads of an eyeglass device, and the acoustic signal that passes through the nose in contact with the device is acquired from a microphone, and the individual is recognized by analyzing the frequency characteristics of the acoustic signal. The proposed method takes advantage of the fact that the nose pad of the eyeglass device always makes natural contact with the nose of the user to be recognized, and that the shape of the userâ€™s nose has its own acoustic characteristics. We implemented a prototype eyeglass-type device equipped with a microphone and speaker, conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method that involved 11 participants, and confirmed that the proposed method can recognize individuals with an average equal error rate of 0.09. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal through changes in the external and internal states of the nose.
