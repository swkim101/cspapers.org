The explosion of media choices promotes "selective exposure;" entertainment-oriented people tend to consume only the information tied to their interests. It reduces their consumption and knowledge of broad info, including social issues. We consider putting information devices all around the house and proactively providing impartial news so that the residents could be incidentally exposed to broad knowledge while doing daily routines. A key to the success of the proactive presentation is providing information appropriately according to user contexts. Thus, we conducted field experiments with four participants to evaluate what user context suits incidental exposure. First, we implemented a tablet-based news app that continuously provides daily news from conspicuous locations in their homes. Experimental systems were installed in each participant's home where they spent about 10 days for the experiment. Before and after the experiment, participants answered questionnaires and participated in interviews. The results suggest features of the user context where the participants accept incidental exposure. Further, viewing content during daily routines could expand the news genres consumed by participants.
