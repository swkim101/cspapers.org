This study presents an algorithmic concept that allows obtaining higher-quality tomographic images. The method solves the problem of imaging the interior of industrial tanks, reactors, or pipes. Research focuses on how to solve the inverse problem, which is converting measurements to images. Hybrid tomography combined electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) measurements. The measurement vector was converted into images in two steps. In the first phase, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used, thanks to which raw reconstructions were obtained. A second network was then trained to convert the images obtained in the first step into enhanced images. The new method is effective and universal because its use is not limited to one type of tomography.
