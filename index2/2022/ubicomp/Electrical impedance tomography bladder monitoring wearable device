In this short abstract, we report the recent progress of our bladder monitoring device using electrical impedance tomography. The deviceâ€™s design and image reconstruction algorithms monitor and diagnose lower urinary tract problems. The device is being prepared to the clinical trials, which are planned to start at the end of this year.
