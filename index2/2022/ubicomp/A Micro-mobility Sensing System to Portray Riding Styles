Riding style concerns the way a micro-mobility rider chooses to ride, and it plays a significant role in traffic safety. Portraying a rider’s riding style is a useful way to guide them towards safer riding behaviors, and offer fine-grained information for insurance companies and bike-sharing companies to provide better services. To this end, we propose a micro-mobility sensing system to portray riding styles. Utilizing helmet-mounted and bicycle handle-mounted inertial sensors, our sensing system is able to monitor the micro-mobility movement status, detect the maneuver behaviors, and the safety check condition of riders. With 10 participants’ experimental data, we present the feasibility of detecting maneuver behavior and recording the data that characterize the rider’s riding style with our sensing system, and therefore make it a viable addition to the micro-mobility.
