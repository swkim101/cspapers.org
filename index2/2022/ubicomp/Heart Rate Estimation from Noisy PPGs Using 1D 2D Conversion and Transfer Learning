In this article, we introduce a new approach for estimating the heart rate from noisy photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We propose the use of two-dimensional representations of signals that are fed into a residual deep neural network that performs the regression task. Our approach leverages transfer learning and pre-trained models to further reduce the prediction error, resulting in state-of-the-art results in a challenging benchmark dataset.
