The last decade saw the proliferation of smartwatches as health devices. Coupled with increased ambient air pollution, there is a growing interest in interfacing air quality data with smartwatches. In real-world scenarios, how and through which interaction users benefit from such interfaces is insufficiently investigated. We implement and test myAQM, a ubiquitous computing system which integrates data from a portable air quality monitor into the Apple Watchâ€™s interfaces. Early qualitative findings suggest the Watch is capable of providing timely indication of air pollution events and glanceable data. This suggests smartwatches as a potential add-on in communicating air quality data compared to smartphones alone, to be investigated in future studies through quantitative methods.
