This paper investigates the use of augmented reality (AR) technology to deliver augmented lectures to support students in acquiring the curricular competency of using spatial imagination in mathematics education. As a very important stage in education to develop spatial abilities this paper focuses on elementary school children. Due to the challenges of working with children in experimental studies, this education level has received comparatively little attention in terms of support through ubiquitous technology. A theory-driven design approach was adopted in the development of an AR-based learning environment to visualize various virtual 3D cube buildings aligned with real blueprints. The designed environment was evaluated by a group of 1st and 2nd grade students in terms of system usability. The results showed that the theory-driven design was successful with a score of 86.56 on the System Usability test. In our future work, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed AR environment in terms of learning gains by performing more task-focused studies before and after experiment and comparing the results with the traditional teaching methods.
