As an important component of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), wireless sensor network faces challenges of computation, communication and privacy. For employing DNN with large capacity in CPS, splitting computing (SC) is proposed, in which transmitting intermediate data is the bottleneck of system efficiency. In this paper, targeting to the compression and privacy limitations occur in the original extracted feature data, we proposed a privacy-preserved intermediate feature compression framework. Therein, a hybrid feature compression module composed of a knowledge-based adaptor network and a traditional video codec is proposed. A noise-based privacy enhancement and domain-concentration cooperative privacy preserving approach is developed. Evaluations are conducted on two DNN models among two datasets, proving the proposed method can achieve better analysis accuracy as well as higher degree of privacy preserving than HEVC.
