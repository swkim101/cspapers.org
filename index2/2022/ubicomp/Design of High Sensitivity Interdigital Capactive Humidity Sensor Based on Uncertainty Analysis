Humidity sensors have been widely used in various fields of life, among which sensitivity is one of the most important indicators for its evaluation. Quantitatively analyzing the effect of structural errors on sensitivity is a big challenge in sensor design. To address this problem, this paper proposes a structural uncertainty analysis method. By establishing the mathematical model and uncertainty propagation model, the influence of the interdigital capacitive humidity sensorâ€™s structural uncertainty on the sensitivity is quantitatively analyzed. The accuracy and superiority of the proposed method are also verified by finite element simulation.
