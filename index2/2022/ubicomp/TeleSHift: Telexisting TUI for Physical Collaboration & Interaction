Current workflow on co-editing and simultaneous presentation of 3-D shapes is confined to on-screen manipulation, which causes loss of perceived information when presenting perceptual concepts or complex shapes between members. Thus, we create TeleSHift, a 3-D tangible user interface (TUI) with a telexisting communication framework for group-based collaboration and demonstration. In this work, we present a larger-scaled proof-of-concept prototype providing hands-on operation for shape-based interactions including multi-sided collaboration and one-to-many presentation. In contrast to previous works, we further extend the use of TUIs to support cooperative tasks with telexistence while enabling the linkage of manipulable bits to provide a better user experience and interactivity.
