Reducing the amount of sugar consumed from daily beverages is essential for well-being. However, since a sudden reduction in intake is mentally painful for those who prefer sweetened beverages, solutions are needed to help them gradually become accustomed to non-sweetened drinks. In this paper, we propose Aromug, a mug-type olfactory interface that amplifies the userâ€™s perceived sweetness by providing a sweet scent along with the action of drinking. Through user studies, we investigated the effect of the information presented by Aromug on the taste of iced coffee. The experiment results showed that the sugar-free coffee and chocolate aroma might enhance the perceived sweetness compared to the no-scent case. In addition, it was suggested that there were differences in preference for sweetness depending on age and frequency of coffee drinking.
