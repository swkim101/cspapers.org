The paper studies preferences of agents about other agents in a social network. It proposes a logical system that captures the properties of such preferences, called "likes". The system can express nested constructions "agent likes humbled people", "agent likes those who like humbled people", etc. The main technical results are a model checking algorithm and a sound, complete, and decidable axiomatization of the proposed system.
