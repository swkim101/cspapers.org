In this paper we investigate pure exploration problem in Multinomial Logit bandit(MNL-bandit) under fixed budget settings, a problem motivated by real-time applications in online advertising and retailing. Given an MNL-bandit instance and a fixed exploration budget, our goal is to minimize the misidentification error of the optimal assortment. Towards such an end we propose an algorithm that achieve gap-dependent complexities, and complement our investigation with a discussion on recent studies and a minimax lower bound on misidentification probability. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to address the recently proposed open problem of fixed-budget pure exploration problem for MNL-bandits.
