Due to the increasing demand in films and games, synthesizing 3D avatar animation has attracted much attention recently. In this work, we present a production-ready text/speech-driven full-body animation synthesis system. Given the text and corresponding speech, our system synthesizes face and body animations simultaneously, which are then skinned and rendered to obtain a video stream output. We adopt a learning-based approach for synthesizing facial animation and a graph-based approach to animate the body, which generates high-quality avatar animation efficiently and robustly. Our results demonstrate the generated avatar animations are realistic, diverse and highly text/speech-correlated.
