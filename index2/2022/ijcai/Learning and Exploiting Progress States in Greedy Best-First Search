Previous work introduced the concept of progress

states. After expanding a progress state, a greedy

best-first search (GBFS) will only expand states

with lower heuristic values. Current methods can

identify progress states only for a single task and

only after a solution for the task has been found.

We introduce a novel approach that learns a description

logic formula characterizing all progress

states in a classical planning domain. Using the

learned formulas in a GBFS to break ties in favor

of progress states often significantly reduces the

search effort.
