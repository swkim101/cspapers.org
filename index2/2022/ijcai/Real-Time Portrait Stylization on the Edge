In this work we demonstrate real-time portrait stylization, specifically, translating self-portrait into cartoon or anime style on mobile devices. 

We propose a latency-driven differentiable architecture search method, maintaining realistic generative quality. 

With our framework, we obtain 10Ã— computation reduction on the generative model and achieve real-time video stylization on off-the-shelf smartphone using mobile GPUs.
