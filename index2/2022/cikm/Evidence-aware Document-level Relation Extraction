Document-level Relation Extraction (RE) is a promising task aiming at identifying relations of multiple entity pairs in a document. However, in most cases, a relational fact can be expressed enough via a small subset of sentences from the document, namely evidence sentence. Moreover, there often exist strong semantic correlations between evidence sentences that collaborate together to describe a specific relation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel evidence-aware model for document-level RE. Particularly, we formulate evidence sentence selection as a sequential decision problem through a crafted reinforcement learning mechanism. Considering the explosive search space of our agent, an efficient path searching strategy is executed on the converted document graph to heuristically obtain hopeful sentences and feed them to reinforcement learning. Finally, each entity pair owns a customized-filtered document for further inferring the relation between them. We conduct various experiments on two document-level RE benchmarks and achieve a remarkable improvement over previous competitive baselines, verifying the effectiveness of our method.
