Energy markets enable matching supply and demand through inter- and intra-region electricity trading. Due to the interconnected nature of the energy markets, the supply-demand constraints in one region can impact prices in another connected region. To incorporate these spatiotemporal relationships, we propose a novel graph neural network architecture incorporating multidimensional time-series features to forecast price (node attribute) and energy flow (edge attribute) between regions simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to combine node and edge level forecasting in energy markets. We show that our proposed approach has a mean absolute prediction percentage error of 12.8%, which significantly beats the state-of-the-art baseline techniques.
