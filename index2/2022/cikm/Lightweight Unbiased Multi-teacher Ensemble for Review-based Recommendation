Review-based recommender systems (RRS) have received an increasing interest since reviews greatly enhance recommendation quality and interpretability. However, existing RRS suffer from high computational complexity, biased recommendation and poor generalization. The three problems make them inadequate to handle real recommendation scenarios. Previous studies address each issue separately, while none of them consider solving three problems together under a unified framework. This paper presents LUME (a Lightweight Unbiased Multi-teacher Ensemble) for RRS. LUME is a novel framework that addresses the three problems simultaneously. LUME uses multi-teacher ensemble and debiased knowledge distillation to aggregate knowledge from multiple pretrained RRS, and generates a small, unbiased student recommender which generalizes better. Extensive experiments on various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LUME successfully tackles the three problems and has superior performance than state-of-the-art RRS and knowledge distillation based RS.
