The ubiquity of mobile devices and the accompanying deployment of sensing technologies have resulted in a massive amount of trajectory data. One important fundamental task is trajectory similarity computation, which is to determine how similar two trajectories are. To enable effective and efficient trajectory similarity computation, we propose a novel robust model, namely Contrastive Learning based Trajectory Similarity Computation (CL-TSim). Specifically, we employ a contrastive learning mechanism to learn the latent representations of trajectories and then calculate the dissimilarity between trajectories based on these representations. Compared with sequential auto-encoders that are the mainstream deep learning architectures for trajectory similarity computation, CL-TSim does not require a decoder and step-by-step reconstruction, thus improving the training efficiency significantly. Moreover, considering the non-uniform sampling rate and noisy points in trajectories, we adopt two type of augmentations, i.e., point dowm-sampling and point distorting, to enhance the robustness of the proposed model. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used real-world datasets, i.e., Porto and ChengDu, which demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.
