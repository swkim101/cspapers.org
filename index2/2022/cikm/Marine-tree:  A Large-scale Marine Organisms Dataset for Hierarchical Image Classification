This paper presents Marine-tree, a large-scale hierarchical annotated dataset for marine organism classification. Marine-tree contains more than 160k annotated images divided into 60 classes organised in a hierarchy-tree structure using an adapted CATAMI (Collaborative and Automated Tools for the Analysis of Marine Imagery and video) classification scheme. Images were meticulously collected by scuba divers using the RLS (Reef Life Survey) methodology and later annotated by experts in the field. We also propose a hierarchical loss function that can be applied to any multi-level hierarchical classification model, which takes into account the parent-child relationship between predictions and uses it to penalize inconsistent predictions. Experimental results demonstrate thatMarine-tree and the proposed hierarchical loss function are a good contribution for both research in underwater imagery and hierarchical classification.
