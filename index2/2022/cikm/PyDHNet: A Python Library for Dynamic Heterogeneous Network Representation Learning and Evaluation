Network representation learning and its applications have received increasing attention. Due to their various application areas, many research groups have developed a diverse range of software tools and techniques to learn representation for different types of networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited works that support representation learning for dynamic heterogeneous networks. The work presented in this demonstration paper attempts to fill the gap in this space by developing and publicly releasing an open-source Python library known as, PyDHNet, a Python Library for Dynamic Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning and Evaluation. PyDHNet consists of two main components: dynamic heterogeneous network representation learning and task-specific evaluation. In our paper, we demonstrate that PyDHNet has an extensible architecture, is easy to install (through PIP) and use, and integrates quite seamlessly with other Python libraries. We also show that the implementation for PyDHNet is efficient and enjoys a competitive execution time.
