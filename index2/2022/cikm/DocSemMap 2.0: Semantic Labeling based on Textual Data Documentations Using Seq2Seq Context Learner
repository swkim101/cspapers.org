Methods for automated semantic labeling of data are an indispensable basis for increasing the usability of data. On the one hand, they contribute to the homogenization of the annotations and thus to the increase in quality; on the other hand, they reduce the modeling effort, provided that the quality of the used methodology is sufficient. In the past, research has focused primarily on data- and label-based methods. Another approach that has received recent attention is the incorporation of textual data documentations to support the automatic mapping of datasets to a knowledge graph. However, upon deeper analysis, our recent approach called DocSemMap gives away potential in a number of places. In this paper, we extend the current state of the art approach by uncovering existing shortcomings and presenting our own improvements. Using a sequence-to-sequence model (Seq2Seq), we exploit the context of datasets. An additional introduced classifier provides the linkage of documentation and labels for prediction. Our extended approach achieves a sustainable improvement in comparison to the reference approach.
