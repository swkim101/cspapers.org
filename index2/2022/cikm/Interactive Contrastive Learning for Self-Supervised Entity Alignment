Self-supervised entity alignment (EA) aims to link equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs) without the use of pre-aligned entity pairs. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised EA approach draws inspiration from contrastive learning, originally designed in computer vision based on instance discrimination and contrastive loss, and suffers from two shortcomings. Firstly, it puts unidirectional emphasis on pushing sampled negative entities far away rather than pulling positively aligned pairs close, as is done in the well-established supervised EA. Secondly, it advocates the minimum information requirement for self-supervised EA, while we argue that self-described KG's side information (e.g., entity name, relation name, entity description) shall preferably be explored to the maximum extent for the self-supervised EA task. In this work, we propose an interactive contrastive learning model for self-supervised EA. It conducts bidirectional contrastive learning via building pseudo-aligned entity pairs as pivots to achieve direct cross-KG information interaction. It further exploits the integration of entity textual and structural information and elaborately designs encoders for better utilization in the self-supervised setting. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the previous best self-supervised method by a large margin (over 9% Hits@1 absolute improvement on average) and performs on par with previous SOTA supervised counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interactive contrastive learning for self-supervised EA.
