Recently, sequential recommendation has become a research hotspot while multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) that exploits users' heterogeneous interactions in sequences has received relatively little attention. Existing works often overlook the complementary effect of different perspectives when addressing the MBSR problem. In addition, there are two specific challenges remained to be addressed. One is the heterogeneity of a user's intention and the context information, the other one is the sparsity of the interactions of target behavior. To release the potential of multi-behavior interaction sequences, we propose a novel framework named NextIP that adopts a dual-task learning strategy to convert the problem to two specific tasks, i.e., next-item prediction and purchase prediction. For next-item prediction, we design a target-behavior aware context aggregator (TBCG), which utilizes the next behavior to guide all kinds of behavior-specific item sub-sequences to jointly predict the next item. For purchase prediction, we design a behavior-aware self-attention (BSA) mechanism to extract a user's behavior-specific interests and treat them as negative samples to learn the user's purchase preferences. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets show that our NextIP performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.
