Despite the recent success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their learning pipeline is guided only by the input graph and the desired output of certain tasks, failing to capture useful patterns when not enough data are presented. Existing attempts incorporate auxiliary knowledge to mitigate this issue, most of which are not in a unified structure or hard to obtain. Noticing that nodes in graphs usually form implicit hierarchical structures, we proposed to integrate category taxonomies into the learning process of GNNs. A category taxonomy is a form of domain knowledge with a hierarchical tree structure, which is widely adopted in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Taxonomy-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (Taxo-GNN). Specifically, we jointly optimize the taxonomy representation and node representation tasks, where categories in taxonomy are mapped to Gaussian distributions and nodes are embedded with the GNN framework. To characterize the bidirectional interaction between the taxonomy and the graph, the model is comprised of two modules, namely information distillation for taxonomy and knowledge fusion to graph. Information is first distilled from the graph and aligned with the hierarchical structure of the taxonomy in a bottom-to-top mechanism.After that, knowledge brought by the taxonomy is in turn fused to the graph convolution process, in the form of taxonomy-aware aggregation weights and taxonomy-augmented contexts. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets in multiple downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of our model.
