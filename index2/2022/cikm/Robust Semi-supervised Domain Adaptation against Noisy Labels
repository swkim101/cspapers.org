Built upon clean/correct labels, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a well-explored task, which, however, may not be easily obtained. This paper considers a challenging but practical scenario, i.e., the noisy SSDA with polluted labels. Specifically, it is observed that abnormal samples appear to have more randomness and inconsistency among the various views. To this end, we have devised an anomaly score function to detect noisy samples based on the similarity of differently augmented instances. The noisy labeled target samples are re-weighted according to such anomaly scores where the abnormal data contribute less to model training. Moreover, pseudo labeling usually suffers from confirmation bias. To remedy it, we have introduced the adversarial disturbance to raise the divergence across differently augmented views. The experimental results on the contaminated SSDA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over the baselines in both robustness and accuracy.
