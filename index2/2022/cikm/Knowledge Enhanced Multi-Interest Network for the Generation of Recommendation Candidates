Candidate generation task requires that candidates related to user interests need to be extracted in realtime. Previous works usually transform a user's behavior sequence to a unified embedding, which can not reflect the user's multiple interests. Some recent works like Comirec and Octopus use multi-channel structures to capture users' diverse interests. They cluster users' historical behaviors into several groups, claiming that one group represents one interest. However, these methods have some limitations. First, an item may correspond to multiple interests of users, thereby simply allocating it to just one interest group will make the modeling of users' interests coarse-grained and inaccurate. Second, explaining user interests at the level of items is rather vague and not convincing. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Enhanced Multi-Interest Network: KEMI, which exploits knowledge graphs to help learn users' diverse interest representations via heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) and a novel dual memory network. Specifically, we use HGNNs to capture the semantic representation of knowledge entities and a novel dual memory network to learn a user's diverse interests from his behavior sequence. Through memory slots of the user memory network and the item memory network, we can learn multiple interests for each user and each item. Meanwhile, by binding the entities to the channels of memory networks, we enable it to be explained from the perspective of the knowledge graph, which enhances the interpretability and understanding of user interests. We conduct extensive experiments on two industrial and publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline models.
