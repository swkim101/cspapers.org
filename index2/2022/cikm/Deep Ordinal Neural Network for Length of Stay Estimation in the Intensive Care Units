Length of Stay (LoS) estimation is important for efficient healthcare resource management. Since the distribution of LoS is highly skewed, some previous works frame the LoS estimation as a multi-class classification problem by dividing the range of LoS into buckets. However, they ignore the ordinal relationship between labels. The distribution of bucketed LoS, with a heavy head and a heavy tail, is still imbalanced since the long tail is grouped into the last bucket. This paper proposes a Deep Ordinal neural network for Length of stay Estimation in the intensive care units (DOSE). DOSE can exploit the ordinal relationship and mitigate the skewness. The ordinal classification problem is decomposed into a series of binary classification sub-problems by using multiple binary classifiers. To maintain consistency among binary classifiers, the monotonicity constraint penalty is proposed. The number of samples whose labels are higher or lower than a given threshold is at the same level due to the heavy head and tail of the distribution. Therefore, the training data of each binary classifier are balanced. Experiments are conducted on the real-world healthcare dataset. DOSE outperforms all baseline methods in all metrics. The distribution of the prediction of DOSE is more aligned with the ground truth.
