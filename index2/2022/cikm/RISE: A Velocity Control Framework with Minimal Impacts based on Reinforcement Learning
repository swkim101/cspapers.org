Velocity control in autonomous driving is an emerging technology that has achieved rapid progress over the last decade. However, existing velocity control models are developed in single-lane scenarios and ignore the negative impacts caused by harsh velocity changes. In this work, we propose a velocity control framework based on reinforcement learning, called RISE (contRol velocIty for autonomouS vEhicle). In multi-lane circumstances, RISE improves velocity decisions regarding the autonomous vehicle itself, while minimizing impacts on rear vehicles. To achieve multiple objectives, we propose a hybrid reward function to rate each velocity decision from four aspects: safety, efficiency, comfort, and negative impact to guide the autonomous vehicle. Among these reward factors, the negative impact is used to penalize the harsh actions of the autonomous vehicle, thus prompting it to reduce the negative impacts on its rear vehicles. To detect the latent perturbations among surrounding vehicles in multiple lanes, we propose an attention-based encoder to learn the positions and interactions from an impact graph. Extensive experiments evidence that RISE enables safe driving, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, comfort, and alleviating negative impacts.
