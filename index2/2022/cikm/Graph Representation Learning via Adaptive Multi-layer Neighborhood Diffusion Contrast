In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) has become the most important method for graph representation learning. However, most GNNs focus on using the message passing mechanism to guide the information aggregation between neighbors, which results in the over-smoothing and weak robustness. To address the above issues, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework via Adaptive Multi-layer Neighborhood Diffusion Contrast, called AM-NDC in this paper. Without using the message passing mechanism, AM-NDC can still capture the complex structural information between nodes through a neighborhood diffusion contrast loss. Experimental results show that AM-NDC outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models in both node classification and robustness against adversarial attacks. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/YJ199804/AM-NDC.
