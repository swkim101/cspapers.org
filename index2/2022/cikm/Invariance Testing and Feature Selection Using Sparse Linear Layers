Machine learning testing and evaluation are largely overlooked by the community. In many cases, the only way to conduct testing is through formula-based scores, e.g., accuracy, f1, etc. However, these simple statistical scores cannot fully represent the performance of the ML model. Therefore, new testing frameworks are attracting more attention. In this work, we propose a novel invariance testing approach that does not utilise traditional statistical scores. Instead, we train a series of sparse linear layers which are more easily to be compared due to their sparsity. We then use different divergence functions to numerically compare them and fuse the difference scores into a visual matrix. Additionally, testing using sparse linear layers allows us to conduct a novel testing oracle: associativity: by comparing merged weights and weights obtained by combined augmentation. We then assess whether a model is invariant by checking the visual matrix, the associativity, and its sparse layers. Finally, we also show that this testing approach can potentially provide an actionable item for feature selection.
