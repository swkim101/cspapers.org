In recent years, short-form video platforms have emerged rapidly and attracted a large and wide variety of users, with the help of advanced recommendation algorithms. Despite the great success, the algorithms have caused some negative effects, such as information cocoon, algorithm unfairness,etc. In this work, we focus on theinformation cocoon that measures overwhelmingly homogeneity of users' video consumption. Specifically, we conduct an exploratory study of this phenomenon on a top short-form video platform, with one-year behavioral records of new users. First, we evaluate the evolution of users' information cocoons and find the limitation of the diversity of video content that users consume. In addition, we further explore user cocoons via the correlation analysis from three aspects, including user demographics, video content, and user-recommender interactions driven by algorithms and user preferences. Correspondingly, we observe that video content plays a more significant role in affecting user cocoons than demographics does. In terms of user-recommender interactions, more accurate personalization does not contribute to more severe information cocoons necessarily, while users with narrow preferences are more likely to be trapped. In summary, our study illuminates the current concern of information cocoons that may hurt user experience on short-form video platforms, and offers potential directions for mitigation implied by the correlation analysis.
