The demand for satisfactory dental care management has attracted a great deal of attention from both dentists and patients. Reviews of existing systems and approaches reveal that they either fail to take into account patients' daily diets that are a significant risk factor for dental decay, or are too complicated for patients. To facilitate patients' tracking and management of their dietary risk factors for dental decay, and improve dentists' identification of decay-related dietary patterns, we develop a system called eDental, in collaboration with dentists and oral surgeons, as a mechanism to record users' detailed daily diet diaries by snapping food photos. The system identifies the food using a state-of-the-art deep learning model and analyzes patients' dental care conditions and potential dental risks. eDental is a full-fledged oral care system with easy-to-use user interfaces. In this demonstration, we showcase eDental's key functionalities for managing patients' dental care via diet diaries.
