Recommendation technologies have been playing an instrumental role for promoting both physical and digital content across several global platforms (Amazon, Apple, Netflix). Here we provide a study on the benefits of recommendation technologies in an educational platform with a focus on music learning. There are several characteristics present in this educational platform that make this recommendation problem particularly interesting, namely: a) the few but highly repetitive interactions, b) the existence of multiple versions of the same content across many difficulty levels, orchestrations, and musical instruments, and c) the user's expertise in a musical instrument which is essential for making appropriate recommendations. We highlight the unique dataset characteristics and compare them to those of other widely-used recommendation datasets. To alleviate the very high data sparsity due to the multi-instantiation of songs, we use entity resolution principles to embed songs in a new space. Using this lightweight entity resolution step on song data, in combination with neural recommendation architectures, we can double the predictive accuracy compared to techniques based on matrix factorization.
