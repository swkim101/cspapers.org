Existing algorithms for sequential patterns do not address data heterogeneity. These algorithms can mine unusual patterns in the database and use them for the prediction. Traditional mining methods ignore pattern usefulness concerning heterogeneity and uncertainty. Some patterns may often exist in the database but may not add to its overall usefulness. Due to the changing database, this field can undertake more effective mining and prediction. Data security has become a priority with more data and user privacy problems. Laws and regulations help develop a safe data society, but performing pattern analysis without sharing data presents a new problem. Now, legally mandated data protection rules create issues with new data regulations and laws that require more attention. First, we have investigated conventional sequential mining methods that can improve effectiveness and efficiency in a heterogeneous environment. Second, we investigate learning and evolution methods for privacy protection. In the following, we briefly describe the insights we gained by publishing the defined research.
