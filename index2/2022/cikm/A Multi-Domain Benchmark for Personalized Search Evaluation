Personalization in Information Retrieval has been a hot topic in both academia and industry for the past two decades. However, there is still a lack of high-quality standard benchmark datasets for conducting offline comparative evaluations in this context. To mitigate this problem, in the past few years, approaches to derive synthetic datasets suited for evaluating Personalized Search models have been proposed. In this paper, we put forward a novel evaluation benchmark for Personalized Search with more than 18 million documents and 1.9 million queries across four domains. We present a detailed description of the benchmark construction procedure, highlighting its characteristics and challenges. We provide baseline performance including pre-trained neural models, opening room for the evaluation of personalized approaches, as well as domain adaptation and transfer learning scenarios. We make both datasets and models available for future research.
