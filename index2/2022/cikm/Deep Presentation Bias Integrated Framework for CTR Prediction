In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) prediction typically utilizes click data to train models for estimating the probability of a user clicking on an item. However, the different presentations of an item, including its position and contextual items, etc., will affect the user's attention and lead to different click propensities, thus the presentation bias arises. Most previous works generally consider position bias and pay less attention to overall presentation bias including context. Simultaneously, since the final presentation list is unreachable during online inference, the bias independence assumption is adopted so that the debiased relevance can be directly used for ranking. But this assumption is difficult to hold because the click propensity to the item presentation varies with user intent. Therefore, predicted CTR with personalized click propensity rather than debiased relevance should be closer to real CTR. In this work, we propose a Deep Presentation Bias Integrated Framework (DPBIF). With DPBIF, the presentation block containing item and contextual items on the same screen is introduced into user behavior sequence and predicted target item for personalizing the integration of presentation bias caused by different click propensities into CTR prediction network. While avoiding modeling with the independence assumption, the network is capable of estimating multiple integrated CTRs under different presentations for each item. The multiple CTRs are used to transform the ranking problem into an item-to-position assignment problem so that the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm is employed to optimize the global benefit of the presentation list. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests are performed in a real-world system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
