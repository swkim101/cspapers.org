Hardware security has been an ever-growing concern of the integrated circuit (IC) designers. Through different stages in the IC design and life cycle, an adversary can extract sensitive design information and private data stored in the circuit using logical, physical, and structural weaknesses. Besides, in recent times, ML-based attacks have become the new de facto standard in hardware security community. Contemporary defense strategies are often facing unforeseen challenges to cope up with these attack schemes. Additionally, the high overhead of the CMOS-based secure add-on circuitry and intrinsic limitations of these devices indicate the need for new nano-electronics. Emerging reconfigurable devices like Reconfigurable Field Effect transistors (RFETs) provide unique features to fortify the design against various threats at different stages in the IC design and life cycle. In this manuscript, we investigate the applications of the RFETs for securing the design against traditional and machine learning (ML)-based intellectual property (IP) piracy techniques and side-channel attacks (SCAs).
