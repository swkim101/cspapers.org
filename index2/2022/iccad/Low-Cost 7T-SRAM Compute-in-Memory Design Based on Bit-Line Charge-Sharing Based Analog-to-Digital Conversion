Although compute-in-memory (CIM) is considered as one of the promising solutions to overcome memory wall problem, the variations in analog voltage computation and analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) cost still remain as design challenges. In this paper, we present a 7T SRAM CIM that seamlessly supports multiply-accumulation (MAC) operation between 4-bit inputs and 8-bit weights. In the proposed CIM, highly parallel and robust MAC operations are enabled by exploiting the bit-line charge-sharing scheme to simultaneously process multiple inputs. For the readout of analog MAC values, instead of adopting the conventional ADC structure, the bit-line charge-sharing is efficiently used to reduce the implementation cost of the reference voltage generations. Based on the in-SRAM reference voltage generation and the parallel analog readout in all columns, the proposed CIM efficiently reduces ADC power and area cost. In addition, the variation models from Monte-Carlo simulations are also used during training to reduce the accuracy drop due to process variations. The implementation of 256Ã—64 7T SRAM CIM using 28nm CMOS process shows that it operates in the wide voltage range from 0.6V to 1.2V with energy efficiency of 45.8-TOPS/W at 0.6V.
