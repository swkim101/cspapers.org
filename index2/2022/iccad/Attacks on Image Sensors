This paper provides a taxonomy of security vulnerabilities of smart image sensor systems. Image sensors form an important class of sensors. Many image sensors include computation units that can provide traditional algorithms such as image or video compression along with machine learning tasks such as classification. Some attacks rely on the physics and optics of imaging. Other attacks take advantage of the complex logic and software required to perform imaging systems.
