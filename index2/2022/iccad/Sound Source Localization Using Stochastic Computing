Stochastic computing (SC) is an alternative computing paradigm that processes data in the form of long uniform bit-streams rather than conventional compact weighted binary numbers. SC is fault-tolerant and can compute on small, efficient circuits, promising advantages over conventional arithmetic for smaller computer chips. SC has been primarily used in scientific research, not in practical applications. Digital sound source localization (SSL) is a useful signal processing technique that locates speakers using multiple microphones in cell phones, laptops, and other voice-controlled devices. SC has not been integrated into SSL in practice or theory. In this work, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we implement an SSL algorithm in the stochastic domain and develop a functional SC-based sound source localizer. The developed design can replace the conventional design of the algorithm. The practical part of this work shows that the proposed stochastic circuit does not rely on conventional analog-to-digital conversion and can process data in the form of pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signals. The proposed SC design consumes up to 39% less area than the conventional baseline design. The SC-based design can consume less power depending on the computational accuracy, for example, 6% less power consumption for 3-bit inputs. The presented stochastic circuit is not limited to SSL and is readily applicable to other practical applications such as radar ranging, wireless location, sonar direction finding, beamforming, and sensor calibration.
