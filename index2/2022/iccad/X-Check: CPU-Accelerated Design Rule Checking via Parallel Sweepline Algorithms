Design rule checking (DRC) is essential in physical verification to ensure high yield and reliability for VLSI circuit designs. To achieve reasonable design cycle time, acceleration for computationally intensive DRC tasks has been demanded to accommodate the ever-growing complexity of modern VLSI circuits. In this paper, we pro-pose X-Check, a GPU-accelerated design rule checker. X-Check integrates novel parallel sweepline algorithms, which are both efficient in practice and with nontrivial theoretical guarantees. Experimental results have demonstrated significant speedup achieved by X-Check compared with a multi-threaded CPU checker.
