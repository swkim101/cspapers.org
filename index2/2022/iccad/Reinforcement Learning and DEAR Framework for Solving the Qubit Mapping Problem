Quantum computing is gaining more and more attention due to its huge potential and the constant progress in quantum computer development. IBM and Google have released quantum architectures with more than 50 qubits. However, in these machines, the physical qubits are not fully connected so that two-qubit interaction can only be performed between specific pairs of the physical qubits. To execute a quantum circuit, it is necessary to transform it into a functionally equivalent one that respects the constraints imposed by the target architecture. Quantum circuit transformation inevitably introduces additional gates which reduces the fidelity of the circuit. Therefore, it is important that the transformation method completes the transformation with minimal overheads. It consists of two steps, initial mapping and qubit routing. Here we propose a reinforcement learning-based model to solve the initial mapping problem. Initial mapping is formulated as sequence-to-sequence learning and self- attention network is used to extract features from a circuit. For qubit routing, a DEAR (Dynamically-Extract-and-Route) framework is proposed. The framework iteratively extracts a subcircuit and uses A* search to determine when and where to insert additional gates. It helps to preserve the lookahead ability dynamically and to provide more accurate cost estimation efficiently during A* search. The experimental results show that our RL-model generates better initial mappings than the best known algorithms with 12% fewer additional gates in the qubit routing stage. Furthermore, our DEAR- framework outperforms the state-of-the-art qubit routing approach with 8.4% and 36.3% average reduction in the number of additional gates and execution time starting from the same initial mapping.
