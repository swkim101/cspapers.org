The complexity of modern integrated circuits (ICs) necessitates collaboration between multiple distrusting parties, including third-party intellectual property (3PIP) vendors, design houses, CAD/EDA tool vendors, and foundries, which jeopardizes confidentiality and integrity of each partyâ€™s IP. IP protection standards and the existing techniques proposed by researchers are ad hoc and vulnerable to numerous structural, functional, and/or side-channel attacks. Our framework, Garbled EDA, proposes an alternative direction through formulating the problem in a secure multi-party computation setting, where the privacy of IPs, CAD tools, and process design kits (PDKs) is maintained. As a proof-of-concept, Garbled EDA is evaluated in the context of simulation, where multiple IP description formats (Verilog, C, S) are supported. Our results demonstrate a reasonable logical-resource cost and negligible memory overhead. To further reduce the overhead, we present another efficient implementation methodology, feasible when the resource utilization is a bottleneck, but the communication between two parties is not restricted. Interestingly, this implementation is private and secure even in the presence of malicious adversaries attempting to, e.g., gain access to PDKs or in-house IPs of the CAD tool providers.
