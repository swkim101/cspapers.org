The DNN inferences are often batched for better utilizing the hardware in existing DNN serving systems. However, DNN serving exhibits diversity in many aspects, such as input, operator, and load. The unawareness of these diversities results in inefficient processing. Our investigation shows that the inefficiency roots in the feature of existing batching mechanism: one entry and one exit. Therefore, we propose DVABatch, a runtime batching system that enables the multi-entry multi-exit batching scheme for existing DNN serving system. We first abstract three meta operations for adjusting the ongoing batch of queries to achieve the multi-entry multi-exit scheme. The meta operations could be used to form different scheduling logics for different diversities. To deliver the meta operations to an ongoing batch, we slice the DNN models into multiple stages. Each stage corresponds to one executor, which is managed by a state transition diagram. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, our experimental results show that DVABatch reduces 46.4% average latency and achieves up to 2.12Ã— throughput improvement.
