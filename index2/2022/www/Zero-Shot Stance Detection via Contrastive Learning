Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) is challenging as it requires detecting the stance of previously unseen targets during the inference stage. Being able to detect the target-related transferable stance features from the training data is arguably an important step in ZSSD. Generally speaking, stance features can be grouped into target-invariant and target-specific categories. Target-invariant stance features carry the same stance regardless of the targets they are associated with. On the contrary, target-specific stance features only co-occur with certain targets. As such, it is important to distinguish these two types of stance features when learning stance features of unseen targets. To this end, in this paper, we revisit ZSSD from a novel perspective by developing an effective approach to distinguish the types (target-invariant/-specific) of stance features, so as to better learn transferable stance features. To be specific, inspired by self-supervised learning, we frame the stance-feature-type identification as a pretext task in ZSSD. Furthermore, we devise a novel hierarchical contrastive learning strategy to capture the correlation and difference between target-invariant and -specific features and further among different stance labels. This essentially allows the model to exploit transferable stance features more effectively for representing the stance of previously unseen targets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in ZSSD.
