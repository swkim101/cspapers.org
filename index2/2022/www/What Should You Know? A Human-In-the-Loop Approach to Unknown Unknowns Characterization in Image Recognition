Unknown unknowns represent a major challenge in reliable image recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on unknown unknowns identification, leveraging human intelligence to gather images that are potentially difficult for the machine. To drive a deeper understanding of unknown unknowns and more effective identification and treatment, this paper focuses on unknown unknowns characterization. We introduce a human-in-the-loop, semantic analysis framework for characterizing unknown unknowns at scale. We engage humans in two tasks that specify what a machine should know and describe what it really knows, respectively, both at the conceptual level, supported by information extraction and machine learning interpretability methods. Data partitioning and sampling techniques are employed to scale out human contributions in handling large data. Through extensive experimentation on scene recognition tasks, we show that our approach provides a rich, descriptive characterization of unknown unknowns and allows for more effective and cost-efficient detection than the state of the art.
