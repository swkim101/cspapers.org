With the prosperity of recommender systems, the biases existing in user behaviors, which may lead to inconsistency between user preference and behavior records, have attracted wide attention. Though large efforts have been made to infer user preference from biased data with learning to debias, unfortunately, they mainly focus on the effect of one specific item attribute, e.g., position or modality which may affect usersâ€™ click probability on items. However, the comprehensive description for potential interactions between multiple items with various attributes, namely the context bias between items, may not be fully summarized. To that end, in this paper, we design a novel Context Bias aware Recommendation (CBR) model for describing and debiasing the context bias caused by comprehensive interactions between multiple items. Specifically, we first propose a content encoder and a bias encoder based on multi-head self-attention to embed the latent interactions between items. Then, we calculate the biased representation for users based on an attention network, which will be further utilized to infer the negative preference, i.e., the dislikes of users based on the items the user never clicked. Finally, the real user preference will be captured based on the negative preference to estimate the click prediction score. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the competitiveness of our CBR framework compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.
