Typical recommender systems try to mimic the past behaviors of users to make future recommendations. For example, in food recommendations, they tend to recommend the foods the user prefers. While the recommended foods may be easily accepted by the user, it cannot improve the userâ€™s dietary habits for a specific goal such as weight control. In this paper, we build a food recommendation system that can be used on the web or in a mobile app to help users meet their goals on body weight, while also taking into account their health information (BMI) and the nutrition information of foods (calories). Instead of applying dietary guidelines as constraints, we build recommendation models from the successful behaviors of comparable users: the weight loss model is trained using the historical food consumption data of similar users who successfully lost weight. By combining such a goal-oriented recommendation model with a general model, the recommendations can be smoothly tuned toward the goal without disruptive food changes. We tested the approach on real data collected from a popular weight management app. It is shown that our recommendation approach can better predict the foods for test periods where the user truly meets the goal, than the typical existing approaches.
