 Seasonal-trend decomposition is one of the most fundamental concepts in time series analysis that supports various downstream tasks, including time series anomaly detection and forecasting. However, existing decomposition methods rely on batch processing with a time complexity of
 O
 (
 W
 ), where
 W
 is the number of data points within a time window. Therefore, they cannot always efficiently support real-time analysis that demands low processing delay. To address this challenge, we propose OneShotSTL, an efficient and accurate algorithm that can decompose time series online with an update time complexity of
 O
 (1). OneShotSTL is more than 1, 000 times faster than the batch methods, with accuracy comparable to the best counterparts. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets for downstream time series anomaly detection and forecasting tasks demonstrate that OneShotSTL is from 10 to over 1, 000 times faster than the state-of-the-art methods, while still providing comparable or even better accuracy.
