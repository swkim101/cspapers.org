The emergence of digital asset applications, driven by Web 3.0 and powered by blockchain technology, has led to a growing demand for blockchain-specific graph analytics to unearth the insights. However, current blockchain data analytics systems are unable to perform efficient ad-hoc graph analytics over both live and past time windows due to their inefficient data synchronization and slow graph snapshots retrieval capability. To address these issues, we propose ChainDash, a blockchain data analytics system that dedicates a highly-parallelized data synchronization component and a retrieval-optimized temporal graph store. By leveraging these techniques, ChainDash supports efficient ad-hoc graph analytics of smart contract activities over arbitrary time windows. In the demonstration, we showcase the interactive visualization interfaces of ChainDash, where attendees will execute customized queries for ad-hoc graph analytics of blockchain data.
