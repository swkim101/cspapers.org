There is a renewed interest in data marketplaces with cloud data warehouses that make sharing and accessing data on-demand and extremely easy. However, analyzing marketplace datasets is challenge since current tools for creating the data models are manual and slow. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate a learning-based approach to discover, deploy, and optimize data models. We present the resulting system, PikePlace, show an evaluation over Snowflake marketplace and TPC-H datasets, and describe several demonstration scenarios that the audience can play with.
