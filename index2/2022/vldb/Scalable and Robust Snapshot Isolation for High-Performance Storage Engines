MVCC-based snapshot isolation promises that read queries can proceed without interfering with concurrent writes. However, as we show experimentally, in existing implementations a single long-running query can easily cause transactional throughput to collapse. Moreover, existing out-of-memory commit protocols fail to meet the scalability needs of modern multi-core systems. In this paper, we present three complementary techniques for robust and scalable snapshot isolation in out-of-memory systems. First, we propose a commit protocol that minimizes cross-thread communication for better scalability, avoids touching the write set on commit, and enables efficient fine-granular garbage collection. Second, we introduce the Graveyard Index, an auxiliary data structure that moves logically-deleted tuples out of the way of operational transactions. Third, we present an adaptive version storage scheme that enables fast garbage collection and improves scan performance of frequently-modified tuples. All techniques are engineered to scale well on multi-core processors, and together enable robust performance for complex hybrid workloads.
