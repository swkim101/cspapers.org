Over the past eight decades, computer science has advanced as a field, and the computing profession has matured by establishing professional codes of conduct, fostering best practices, and establishing industry standards to support the proliferation of technologies and services. Research and applications of digital computation continue to change all aspects of human endeavor through new waves of innovation. While it is clear that different research advances fuel innovation, the ways they come together to make an impact vary. In contrast to highly regulated sectors such as pharma, medicine and law, the process of transforming research into widely deployed technologies is not regulated. We reflect on collective practices, from discovery by scientists and engineers to market delivery by entrepreneurs, industry leaders, and practitioners. We consider ecosystem changes that are required to sustain the transformational effects of new technologies and enable new practices to take root. Every such transformation ruptures in the existing socio-technical fabric and requires a concerted effort to remedy this through effective policies and regulations. Computing experts are involved in all phases and must match the transformational power of their innovation with the highest standard of professional conduct. We highlight the principles of responsible innovation and discuss three waves of digital innovation. We use wide and uncontrolled generative AI deployments to illustrate risks from the implosion of digital media due to contamination of digital records, removal of human agency, and risk to an individual's personhood.
