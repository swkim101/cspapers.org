Countrywide and worldwide business, like gaming and social networks, drives the popularity of inter-data-center transactions. To support inter-data-center transaction processing and data center fault tolerance simultaneously, existing protocols suffer from significant performance degradation due to high-latency and unstable networks. In this paper, we propose RedT, a novel distributed transaction processing protocol that works in heterogeneous networks. In detail, nodes within a data center are inter-connected via the RDMA-capable network and nodes across data centers are inter-connected via TCP/IP networks. RedT extends two-phase commit (2PC) by decomposing transactions into sub-transactions in terms of the data center granularity, and proposing a pre-write-log mechanism that is able to reduce the number of inter-data-center round-trips from a maximal of 6 to 2. Extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art protocols shows that RedT can achieve up to 1.57× higher throughputs and 0.56× lower latency.
