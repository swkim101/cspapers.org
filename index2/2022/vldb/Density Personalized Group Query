 Research on new queries for finding dense subgraphs and groups has been actively pursued due to their many applications, especially in social network analysis and graph mining. However, existing work faces two major weaknesses: i) incapability of supporting personalized neighborhood density, and ii) inability to find sparse groups. To tackle the above issues, we propose a new query, called Density-Customized Social Group Query (DCSGQ), that accommodates the need for
 personalized density
 by allowing individual users to flexibly configure their social tightness (and sparseness) for the target group. The proposed DCSGQ is general due to flexible in configuration of neighboring social density in queries. We prove the NP-hardness and inapproximability of DCSGQ, formulate an Integer Program (IP) as a baseline, and propose an efficient algorithm, FSGSel-RR, by relaxing the IP. We then propose a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with a performance guarantee, named FSGSel-TD, and further combine it with FSGSel-RR into a hybrid approach, named FSGSel-Hybrid, in order to strike a good balance between solution quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple large real datasets demonstrate the superior solution quality and efficiency of our approaches over existing subgraph and group queries.
