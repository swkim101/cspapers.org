In this demonstration, we will present EVA, an end-to-end AI-Relational database management system. We will demonstrate the capabilities and utility of EVA using three usage scenarios: (1) EVA serves as a backend for an exploratory video analytics interface developed using Streamlit and React, (2) EVA seamlessly integrates with the Python and Data Science ecosystems by allowing users to access EVA in a Python notebook alongside other popular libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, and (3) EVA facilitates bulk labeling with Label Studio, a widely-used labeling framework. By optimizing complex vision queries, we illustrate how EVA allows a wide range of application developers to harness the recent advances in computer vision.
