Serverless applications spanning the cloud and edge require flexible programming frameworks for expressing compositions across the different levels of deployment. Another critical aspect for applications with state is failure resilience beyond the scope of a single dataflow graph that is the current standard in data streaming systems. This paper presents Portals, an interactive, stateful dataflow composition framework with strong end-to-end guarantees. Portals enables event-driven, resilient applications that span across dataflow graphs and serverless deployments. The demonstration exhibits three scenarios in our multi-dataflow streaming-based system: dynamically composing a stateful serverless application; an interactive cloud and edge serverless application; and a Portals browser playground.
