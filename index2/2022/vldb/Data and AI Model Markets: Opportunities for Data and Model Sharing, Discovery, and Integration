The markets for data and AI models are rapidly emerging and increasingly significant in the realm and the practices of data science and artificial intelligence. These markets are being studied from diverse perspectives, such as e-commerce, economics, machine learning, and data management. In light of these developments, there is a pressing need to present a comprehensive and forward-looking survey on the subject to the database and data management community. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a comprehensive and interdisciplinary introduction to data and AI model markets. Unlike a few recent surveys and tutorials that concentrate only on the economics aspect, we take a novel perspective and examine data and AI model markets as grand opportunities to address the long-standing problem of data and model sharing, discovery, and integration. We motivate the importance of data and model markets using practical examples, present the current industry landscape of such markets, and explore the modules and options of such markets from multiple dimensions, including assets in the markets (e.g., data versus models), platforms, and participants. Furthermore, we summarize the latest advancements and examine the future directions of data and AI model markets as mechanisms for enabling and facilitating sharing, discovery, and integration.
