The GraphLab project spanned almost a decade and had profound academic and industrial impact on large-scale machine learning and graph processing systems. There were numerous papers written describing the innovations in GraphLab including the original vertex-centric [8] and edge-centric [3] programming abstractions, high-performance asynchronous execution engines [9], out-of-core graph computation [6], tabular graph-systems [4], and even new statistical inference algorithms [2] enabled by the GraphLab project. This work became the basis of multiple PhD theses [1, 5, 7]. The GraphLab open-source project had broad academic and industrial adoption and ultimately lead to the launch of Turi.
 In this talk, we tell the story of GraphLab, how it began and the key ideas behind it. We will focus on the approach to achieving scalable asynchronous systems in machine learning. During our talk, we will explore the impact that GraphLab has had on the development of graph processing systems, graph databases, and AI/ML; Additionally, we will share our insights and opinions into where we see the future of these fields heading. In the process, we highlight some of the lessons we learned and provide guidance for future students.
