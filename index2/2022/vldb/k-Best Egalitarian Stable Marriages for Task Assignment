 In a two-sided market with each agent ranking individuals on the other side according to their preferences, such as location or incentive, the
 stable marriage
 problem calls to find a
 perfect matching
 among the two sides such that no pair of agents prefers each other to their assigned matches. Recent studies show that the number of solutions can be large in practice. Yet the classic solution by the Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm is
 optimal
 for agents on the one side and
 pessimal
 for those on the other side. Some algorithms find a stable marriage that optimizes a measure of the cumulative satisfaction of all agents, such as
 egalitarian cost.
 However, in many real-world circumstances, a decision-maker needs to examine a set of solutions that are stable and attentive to both sides and choose among them based on expert knowledge. With such a disposition, it is necessary to identify a set of high-quality stable marriages and provide transparent explanations for any reassigned matches to the decision-maker. In this paper, we provide efficient algorithms that find the
 k
 -best stable marriages by
 egalitarian cost.
 Our exhaustive experimental study using real-world data and realistic preferences demonstrates the efficacy and efficiency of our solution.
