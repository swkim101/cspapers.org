The tutorial focuses on Private Information Retrieval (PIR), which allows clients to privately query public or server-owned databases without disclosing their queries. The tutorial covers the basic concepts of PIR such as its types, construction, and critical building blocks, including homomorphic encryption. It also discusses the performance of PIR, existing optimizations for scalability, real-life applications of PIR, and ways to extend its functionalities.
