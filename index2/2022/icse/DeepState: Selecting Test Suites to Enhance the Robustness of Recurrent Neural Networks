Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved tremendous success in various software applications. However, accompanied by outstanding effectiveness, DNN-driven software systems could also exhibit incorrect behaviors and result in some critical accidents and losses. The testing and optimization of DNN-driven software systems rely on a large number of labeled data that often require many human efforts, resulting in high test costs and low efficiency. Although plenty of coverage-based criteria have been proposed to assist in the data selection of convolutional neural networks, it is difficult to apply them on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models due to the difference between the working nature. In this paper, we propose a test suite selection tool DeepState towards the particular neural network structures of RNN models for reducing the data labeling and computation cost. DeepState selects data based on a stateful perspective of RNN, which identifies the possibly misclassified test by capturing the state changes of neurons in RNN models. We further design a test selection method to enable testers to obtain a test suite with strong fault detection and model improvement capability from a large dataset. To evaluate DeepState, we conduct an extensive empirical study on popular datasets and prevalent RNN models containing image and text processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepState outperforms existing coverage-based techniques in selecting tests regarding effectiveness and the inclusiveness of bug cases. Meanwhile, we observe that the selected data can improve the robustness of RNN models effectively.
