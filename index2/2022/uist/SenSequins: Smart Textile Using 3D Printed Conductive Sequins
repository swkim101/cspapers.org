In this research, we used traditional sequin embroidery as the basis and a 3D printer to expand the design space of sequin materials and structures, by developing a new 2.5D smart conductive sequin textile with multiple sensing and interactions as well as providing users with a customizing system for automated design and manufacturing. Through 3D printing, we have developed a variety of 3D sequins. We used each sequin as an individual design unit to realize various circuit designs and sensing functions by adjusting the design primitives such as conductivity, shape, and arrangement. We also designed applications such as motion sensing of body movements, and posture detection of the ankle. In addition, we surveyed user requirements through user testing to optimize the design space. This paper describes the design space, design software, automation, application, and user study of various smart sequin textiles.
