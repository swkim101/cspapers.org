In this paper, we propose NFCStack, which is a physical building block system that supports stacking and frictionless interaction and is based on near-field communication (NFC). This system consists of a portable station that can support and resolve the order of three types of passive identifiable stackable: bricks, boxes, and adapters. The bricks support stable and sturdy physical construction, whereas the boxes support frictionless tangible interactions. The adapters provide an interface between the aforementioned two types of stackable and convert the top of a stack into a terminal for detecting interactions between NFC-tagged objects. In contrast to existing systems based on NFC or radio-frequency identification technologies, NFCStack is portable, supports simultaneous interactions, and resolves stacking and interaction events responsively, even when objects are not strictly aligned. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed system effectively supports 12 layers of rich-ID stacking with the three types of building block, even if every box is stacked with a 6-mm offset. The results also indicate possible generalized applications of the proposed system, including 2.5-dimensional construction. The interaction styles are described using several educational application examples, and the design implications of this research are explained.
