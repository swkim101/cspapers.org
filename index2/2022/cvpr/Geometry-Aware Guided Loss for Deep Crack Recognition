Despite the substantial progress of deep models for crack recognition, due to the inconsistent cracks in varying sizes, shapes, and noisy background textures, there still lacks the discriminative power of the deeply learned features when supervised by the cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we propose the geometry-aware guided loss (GAGL) that enhances the discrimination ability and is only applied in the training stage without extra computation and memory during inference. The GAGL consists of the feature-based geometry-aware projected gradient descent method (FGA-PGD) that approximates the geometric distances of the features to the class boundaries, and the geometry-aware update rule that learns an anchor of each class as the approximation of the feature expected to have the largest geometric distance to the corresponding class boundary. Then the discriminative power can be enhanced by minimizing the distances between the features and their corresponding class anchors in the feature space. To address the limited availability of related benchmarks, we collect a fully annotated dataset, namely, NPP2021, which involves inconsistent cracks and noisy backgrounds in real-world nuclear power plants. Our proposed GAGL outperforms the state of the arts on various benchmark datasets including CRACK2019, SDNET2018, and our NPP2021.
