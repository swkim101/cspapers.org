The objective of this paper is a temporal alignment network that ingests long term video sequences, and associated text sentences, in order to: (1) determine if a sentence is alignable with the video; and (2) if it is alignable, then determine its alignment. The challenge is to train such networks from large-scale datasets, such as HowTo100M, where the associated text sentences have significant noise, and are only weakly aligned when relevant. Apart from proposing the alignment network, we also make four contributions: (i) we describe a novel co-training method that enables to denoise and train on raw instructional videos without using manual annotation, de-spite the considerable noise; (ii) to benchmark the align-ment performance, we manually curate a 10-hour subset of HowTo100M, totalling 80 videos, with sparse temporal de-scriptions. Our proposed model, trained on HowTo100M, outperforms strong baselines (CLIP, MIL-NCE) on this alignment dataset by a significant margin; (iii) we ap-ply the trained model in the zero-shot settings to mul-tiple downstream video understanding tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, including text-video retrieval on YouCook2, and weakly supervised video action segmentation on Breakfast-Action. (iv) we use the automatically-aligned HowTo100M annotations for end-to-end finetuning of the backbone model, and obtain improved performance on downstream action recognition tasks.
