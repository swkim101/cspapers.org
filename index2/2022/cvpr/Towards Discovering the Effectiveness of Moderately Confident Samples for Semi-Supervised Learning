Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been studied for a long time to solve vision tasks in data-efficient application scenarios. SSL aims to learn a good classification model using a few labeled data together with large-scale unlabeled data. Recent advances achieve the goal by combining multiple SSL techniques, e.g., self-training and consistency regularization. From unlabeled samples, they usually adopt a confidence filter (CF) to select reliable ones with high prediction confidence. In this work, we study whether the moderately confident samples are useless and how to select the useful ones to improve model optimization. To answer these problems, we propose a novel Taylor expansion inspired filtration (TEIF) framework, which admits the samples of moderate confidence with similar feature or gradient to the respective one averaged over the labeled and highly confident unlabeled data. It can produce a stable and new information induced network update, leading to better generalization. Two novel filters are derived from this framework and can be naturally explained in two perspectives. One is gradient synchronization filter (GSF), which strengthens the optimization dynamic of fully-supervised learning; it selects the samples whose gradients are similar to classwise majority gradients. The other is prototype proximity filter (PPF), which involves more prototypical samples in training to learn better semantic representations; it selects the samples near classwise prototypes. They can be integrated into SSL methods with CF. We use the state-of-the-art Fix-Match as the baseline. Experiments on popular SSL benchmarks show that we achieve the new state of the art.
