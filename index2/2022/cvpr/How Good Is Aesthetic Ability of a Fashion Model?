We introduce A100 (Aesthetic 100) to assess the aesthetic ability of the fashion compatibility models. To date, it is the first work to address the AI model's aesthetic ability with detailed characterization based on the professional fashion domain knowledge. A100 has several desirable characteristics: 1. Completeness. It covers all types of standards in the fashion aesthetic system through two tests, namely LAT (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and AAT (Academicism Aesthetic Test); 2. Reliability. It is training data agnostic and consistent with major indicators. It provides a fair and objective judgment for model comparison. 3. Explainability. Better than all previous indicators, the A100 further identifies essential characteristics of fashion aesthetics, thus showing the model's performance on more fine-grained dimensions, such as Color, Balance, Material, etc. Experimental results prove the advance of the A100 in the aforementioned aspects.
