Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to detect objects and predict their pairwise relationships within an image. Current SGG methods typically utilize graph neural net-works (GNNs) to acquire context information between ob-jects/relationships. Despite their effectiveness, however, current SGG methods only assume scene graph homophily while ignoring heterophily. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterophily Learning Network (HL-Net) to comprehensively explore the homophily and heterophily be-tween objects/relationships in scene graphs. More specif-ically, HL-Net comprises the following 1) an adaptive reweighting transformer module, which adaptively inte-grates the information from different layers to exploit both the heterophily and homophily in objects; 2) a relation-ship feature propagation module that efficiently explores the connections between relationships by considering het-erophily in order to refine the relationship representation; 3) a heterophily-aware message-passing scheme to fur-ther distinguish the heterophily and homophily between ob-jects/relationships, thereby facilitating improved message passing in graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets: Visual Genome (VG) and Open Images (OI). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HL-Net over existing state-of-the-art approaches. In more detail, HL-Net outperforms the second-best competitors by 2.1% on the VG datasetfor scene graph classification and 1.2% on the IO dataset for the final score.
