Human-Object Interactions (HOI) detection, which aims to localize a human and a relevant object while recognizing their interaction, is crucial for understanding a still image. Recently, tranformer-based models have significantly advanced the progress of HOI detection. However, the capability of these models has not been fully explored since the Object Query of the model is always simply initialized as just zeros, which would affect the performance. In this paper, we try to study the issue of promoting transformer-based HOI detectors by initializing the Object Query with category-aware semantic information. To this end, we innovatively propose the Category-Aware Transformer Network (CATN). Specifically, the Object Query would be initialized via category priors represented by an external object detection model to yield a better performance. Moreover, such category priors can be further used for enhancing the representation ability of features via the attention mechanism. We have firstly verified our idea via the Oracle experiment by initializing the Object Query with the groundtruth category information. And then extensive experiments have been conducted to show that a HOI detection model equipped with our idea outperforms the baseline by a large margin to achieve a new state-of-the-art result.
