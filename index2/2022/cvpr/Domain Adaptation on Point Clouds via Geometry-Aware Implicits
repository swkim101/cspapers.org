As a popular geometric representation, point clouds have attracted much attention in 3D vision, leading to many applications in autonomous driving and robotics. One important yet unsolved issue for learning on point cloud is that point clouds of the same object can have significant geometric variations if generated using different procedures or captured using different sensors. These inconsistencies induce domain gaps such that neural networks trained on one domain may fail to generalize on others. A typical technique to reduce the domain gap is to perform adversarial training so that point clouds in the feature space can align. However, adversarial training is easy to fall into degenerated local minima, resulting in negative adaptation gains. Here we propose a simple yet effective method for unsupervised domain adaptation on point clouds by employing a self-supervised task of learning geometry-aware implicits, which plays two critical roles in one shot. First, the geometric information in the point clouds is preserved through the implicit representations for downstream tasks. More importantly, the domain-specific variations can be effectively learned away in the implicit space. We also propose an adaptive strategy to compute unsigned distance fields for arbitrary point clouds due to the lack of shape models in practice. When combined with a task loss, the proposed outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods that rely on adversarial domain alignment and more complicated self-supervised tasks. Our method is evaluated on both PointDA-10 and GraspNet datasets. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Jhonve/ImplicitPCDA.
