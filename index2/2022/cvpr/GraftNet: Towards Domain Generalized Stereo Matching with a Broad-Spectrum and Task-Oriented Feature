Although supervised deep stereo matching networks have made impressive achievements, the poor generalization ability caused by the domain gap prevents them from being applied to real-life scenarios. In this paper, we propose to leverage the feature of a model trained on large-scale datasets to deal with the domain shift since it has seen various styles of images. With the cosine similarity based cost volume as a bridge, the feature will be grafted to an ordinary cost aggregation module. Despite the broad-spectrum representation, such a low-level feature contains much general information which is not aimed at stereo matching. To recover more task-specific information, the grafted feature is further input into a shallow network to be transformed before calculating the cost. Extensive experiments show that the model generalization ability can be improved significantly with this broad-spectrum and task-oriented feature. Specifically, based on two well-known architectures PSMNet and GANet, our methods are superior to other robust algorithms when transferring from SceneFlow to KITTI 2015, KITTI 2012, and Middlebury.
