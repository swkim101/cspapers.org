Deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods aim to utilize abundant unlabeled data to improve the seen-class classification. However, in the open-world scenario, collected unlabeled data tend to contain unseen-class data, which would degrade the generalization to seen-class classification. Formally, we define the problem as safe deep semi-supervised learning with unseen-class unlabeled data. One intuitive solution is removing these unseen-class instances after detecting them during the SSL process. Nevertheless, the performance of unseen-class identification is limited by the lack of suitable score function, the uncalibrated model, and the small number of labeled data. To this end, we propose a safe SSL method called SAFE<bold>R</bold>-STUDENT from the teacher-student view. First, to enhance the ability of teacher model to identify seen and unseen classes, we propose a general scoring framework called <underline>D</underline>iscrepancy with <underline>R</underline>aw (DR). Second, based on unseen-class data mined by teacher model from unlabeled data, we calibrate student model by newly proposed <underline>U</underline>nseen-class <underline>E</underline>nergy-bounded <underline>C</underline>alibration (UEC) loss. Third, based on seen-class data mined by teacher model from unlabeled data, we propose <underline>W</underline>eighted <underline>C</underline>onfirmation <underline>B</underline>ias <underline>E</underline>limination (WCBE) loss to boost seen-class classification of student model. Extensive studies show that SAFE<bold>R</bold>-STUDENT remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art, verifying the effectiveness of our method in the under-explored problem.
