Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify objects that are perfectly embedded in their environment, which has various downstream applications in fields such as medicine, art, and agriculture. However, it is an extremely challenging task to spot camouflaged objects with the perception ability of human eyes. Hence, we claim that the goal of COD task is not just to mimic the human visual ability in a single RGB domain, but to go beyond the human biological vision. We then introduce the frequency domain as an additional clue to better detect camouflaged objects from backgrounds. To well involve the frequency clues into the CNN models, we present a powerful network with two special components. We first design a novel frequency enhancement module (FEM) to dig clues of camouflaged objects in the frequency domain. It contains the offline discrete cosine transform followed by the learnable enhancement. Then we use a feature alignment to fuse the features from RGB domain and frequency domain. Moreover, to further make full use of the frequency information, we propose the high-order relation module (HOR) to handle the rich fusion feature. Comprehensive experiments on three widely-used COD datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.
