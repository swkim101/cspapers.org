Neuromorphic cameras or event cameras mimic human vision by reporting changes in the intensity in a scene, instead of reporting the whole scene at once in a form of an image frame as performed by conventional cameras. Events are streamed data that are often dense when either the scene changes or the camera moves rapidly. The rapid movement causes the events to be overridden or missed when creating a tensor for the machine to learn on. To alleviate the event missing or overriding issue, we propose to learn to concentrate on the dense events to produce a compact event representation with high details for depth estimation. Specifically, we learn a model with events from both past and future but infer only with past data with the predicted future. We initially estimate depth in an event-only setting but also propose to further incorporate images and events by a hier-archical event and intensity combination network for better depth estimation. By experiments in challenging real-world scenarios, we validate that our method outperforms prior arts even with low computational cost. Code is available at: https://github.com/yonseivnl/se-cff.
