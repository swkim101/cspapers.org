In this paper, we are concerned with enhancing the generalization capability of object detectors. And we consider a realistic yet challenging scenario, namely Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), which aims to learn an object detector that performs well on many unseen target domains with only one source domain for training. Towards Single-DGOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant representations (DIR) containing intrinsical object characteristics, which is beneficial for improving the robustness for unseen domains. Thus, we present a method, i.e., cyclic-disentangled self-distillation, to disentangle DIR from domain-specific representations without the supervision of domain-related annotations (e.g., domain labels). Concretely, a cyclic-disentangled module is first proposed to cyclically extract DIR from the input visual features. Through the cyclic operation, the disentangled ability can be promoted without the reliance on domain-related annotations. Then, taking the DIR as the teacher, we design a self-distillation module to further enhance the generalization ability. In the experiments, our method is evaluated in urban-scene object detection. Experimental results of five weather conditions show that our method obtains a significant performance gain over baseline methods. Particularly, for the night-sunny scene, our method outperforms baselines by 3%, which indicates that our method is instrumental in enhancing generalization ability.
