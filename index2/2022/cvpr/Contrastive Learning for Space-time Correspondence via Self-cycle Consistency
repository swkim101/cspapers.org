We propose a novel probabilistic method employing Bayesian Model Averaging and self-cycle regularization for spatio-temporal correspondence learning in videos within a self-supervised learning framework. Most existing methods for self-supervised correspondence learning suffer from noisy labels that come with the data for free, and the presence of occlusion exacerbates the problem. We tackle this issue within a probabilistic framework that handles model uncertainty inherent in the path selection problem built on a complete graph. We propose a self-cycle regularization to consider a cycle-consistency property on individual edges in order to prevent converging on noisy matching or trivial solutions. We also utilize a mixture of sequential Bayesian filters to estimate posterior distribution for targets. In addition, we present a domain contrastive loss to learn discriminative representation among videos. Our algorithm is evaluated on various datasets for video label propagation tasks including DAVIS2017, VIP and JHMDB, and shows outstanding performances compared to the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning based video correspondence algorithms. Moreover, our method converges significantly faster than previous methods.
