Long-term action quality assessment is a task of evaluating how well an action is performed, namely, estimating a quality score from a long video. Intuitively, long-term actions generally involve parts exhibiting different levels of skill, and we call the levels of skill as performance grades. For example, technical highlights and faults may appear in the same long-term action. Hence, the final score should be determined by the comprehensive effect of different grades exhibited in the video. To explore this latent relationship, we design a novel Likert scoring paradigm in-spired by the Likert scale in psychometrics, in which we quantify the grades explicitly and generate the final quality score by combining the quantitative values and the corresponding responses estimated from the video, instead of performing direct regression. Moreover, we extract grade-specific features, which will be used to estimate the responses of each grade, through a Transformer decoder architecture with diverse learnable queries. The whole model is named as Grade-decoupling Likert Transformer (GDLT), and we achieve state-of-the-art results on two long-term action assessment datasets.11Project page https://isee-ai.cn/-angchi/CVPR22_GDLT.html
