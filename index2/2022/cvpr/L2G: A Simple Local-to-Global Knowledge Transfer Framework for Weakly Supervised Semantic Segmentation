Mining precise class-aware attention maps, a.k.a, class activation maps, is essential for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In this paper, we present L2G, a simple online local-to-global knowledge transfer framework for high-quality object attention mining. We observe that classification models can discover object regions with more details when replacing the input image with its local patches. Taking this into account, we first leverage a local classification network to extract attentions from multiple local patches randomly cropped from the input image. Then, we utilize a global network to learn complementary attention knowledge across multiple local attention maps online. Our framework conducts the global network to learn the captured rich object detail knowledge from a global view and thereby produces high-quality attention maps that can be directly used as pseudo annotations for semantic segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method attains 72.1% and 44.2% mIoU scores on the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014, respectively, setting new state-of-the-art records.
