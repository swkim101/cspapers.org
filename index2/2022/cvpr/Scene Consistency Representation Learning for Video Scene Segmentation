A long-term video, such as a movie or TV show, is composed of various scenes, each of which represents a series of shots sharing the same semantic story. Spotting the correct scene boundary from the long-term video is a challenging task, since a model must understand the storyline of the video to figure out where a scene starts and ends. To this end, we propose an effective Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework to learn better shot representations from unlabeled long-term videos. More specifically, we present an SSL scheme to achieve scene consistency, while exploring considerable data augmentation and shuffling methods to boost the model generalizability. Instead of explicitly learning the scene boundary features as in the previous methods, we introduce a vanilla temporal model with less inductive bias to verify the quality of the shot features. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the task of Video Scene Segmentation. Additionally, we suggest a more fair and reasonable benchmark to evaluate the performance of Video Scene Segmentation methods. The code is made available.11https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/SceneSegmentation-SCRL.
