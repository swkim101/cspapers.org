Owing to security implications of adversarial vulnerability, adversarial robustness of deep metric learning models has to be improved. In order to avoid model collapse due to excessively hard examples, the existing defenses dismiss the min-max adversarial training, but instead learn from a weak adversary inefficiently. Conversely, we propose Hardness Manipulation to efficiently perturb the training triplet till a specified level of hardness for adversarial training, according to a harder benign triplet or a pseudo-hardness function. It is flexible since regular training and min-max adversarial training are its boundary cases. Besides, Gradual Adversary, a family of pseudo-hardness functions is proposed to gradually increase the specified hardness level during training for a better balance between performance and robustness. Additionally, an Intra-Class Structure loss term among benign and adversarial examples further improves model robust-ness and efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that the proposed method, although simple in its form, overwhelmingly outperforms the state-of-the-art de-fenses in terms of robustness, training efficiency, as well as performance on benign examples.
