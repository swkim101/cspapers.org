Due to the constraints of the imaging device and high cost in operation time, computer tomography (CT) scans are usually acquired with low within-slice resolution. Improving the inter-slice resolution is beneficial to the disease diagnosis for both human experts and computer-aided systems. To this end, this paper builds a novel medical slice synthesis to increase the inter-slice resolution. Considering that the groundtruth intermediate medical slices are always absent in clinical practice, we introduce the incremental cross-view mutual distillation strategy to accomplish this task in the self-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we model this problem from three different views: slice-wise interpolation from axial view and pixel-wise interpolation from coronal and sagittal views. Under this circumstance, the models learned from different views can distill valuable knowledge to guide the learning processes of each other. We can repeat this process to make the models synthesize intermediate slice data with increasing between-slice resolution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a large-scale $CT$ dataset. Quantitative and qualitative comparison results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by clear margins.
