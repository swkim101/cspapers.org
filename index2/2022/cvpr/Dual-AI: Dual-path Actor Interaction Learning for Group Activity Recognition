Learning spatial-temporal relation among multiple actors is crucial for group activity recognition. Different group activities often show the diversified interactions between actors in the video. Hence, it is often difficult to model complex group activities from a single view of spatial-temporal actor evolution. To tackle this problem, we propose a distinct Dual-path Actor Interaction (Dual-AI) framework, which flexibly arranges spatial and temporal transformers in two complementary orders, enhancing actor relations by integrating merits from different spatio-temporal paths. Moreover, we introduce a novel Multi-scale Actor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) between two interactive paths of Dual-AI. Via self-supervised actor consistency in both frame and video levels, MAC-Loss can effectively distinguish individual actor representations to reduce action confusion among different actors. Consequently, our Dual-AI can boost group activity recognition by fusing such discriminative features of different actors. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely used benchmarks, including Volleyball [21], Collective Activity [II], and NBA datasets [49]. The proposed Dual-AI achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets. It is worth noting the proposed Dual-AI with 50% training data outperforms a number of recent approaches with 100% training data. This confirms the generalization power of Dual-AI for group activity recognition, even under the challenging scenarios of limited supervision.
