Weakly supervised object localization aims to find a target object region in a given image with only weak supervision, such as image-level labels. Most existing methods use a class activation map (CAM) to generate a localization map; however, a CAM identifies only the most discriminative parts of a target object rather than the entire object region. In this work, we find the gap between classification and localization in terms of the misalignment of the directions between an input feature and a class-specific weight. We demonstrate that the misalignment suppresses the activation of CAM in areas that are less discriminative but belong to the target object. To bridge the gap, we propose a method to align feature directions with a class-specific weight. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art localization performance on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks.
