Adapting to a continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably faced by all autonomous-driving systems. Existing image- and video-based driving datasets, however, fall short of capturing the mutable nature of the real world. In this paper, we introduce the largest multi-task synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, SHIFT. It presents discrete and continuous shifts in cloudiness, rain and fog intensity, time of day, and vehicle and pedestrian density. Featuring a comprehensive sensor suite and annotations for several mainstream perception tasks, SHIFT allows to investigate how a perception systems' performance degrades at increasing levels of domain shift, fostering the development of continuous adaptation strategies to mitigate this problem and assessing the robustness and generality of a model. Our dataset and benchmark toolkit are publicly available at www.vis.xyz/shift.
