Network verification often requires analyzing properties across different spaces (header space, failure space, or their product) under different failure models (deterministic and/or probabilistic). Existing verifiers efficiently cover the header or failure space, but not both, and efficiently reason about deterministic or probabilistic failures, but not both. Consequently, no single verifier can support all analyses that require different space coverage and failure models. This paper introduces Symbolic Router Execution (SRE), a general and scalable verification engine that supports various analyses. SRE symbolically executes the network model to discover what we call packet failure equivalence classes (PFECs), each of which characterises a unique forwarding behavior across the product space of headers and failures. SRE enables various optimizations during the symbolic execution, while remaining agnostic of the failure model, so it scales to the product space in a general way. By using BDDs to encode symbolic headers and failures, various analyses reduce to graph algorithms (e.g., shortest-path) on the BDDs. Our evaluation using real and synthetic topologies show SRE achieves better or comparable performance when checking reachability, mining specifications, etc. compared to state-of-the-art methods.
