On-boarding new devices into an existing SDN network is a pain for network operations (NetOps) teams, because much expert effort is required to bridge the gap between the configuration models of the new devices and the unified data model in the SDN controller. In this work, we present an assistant framework NAssim, to help NetOps accelerate the process of assimilating a new device into a SDN network. Our solution features a unified parser framework to parse diverse device user manuals into preliminary configuration models, a rigorous validator that confirm the correctness of the models via formal syntax analysis, model hierarchy validation and empirical data validation, and a deep-learning-based mapping algorithm that uses state-of-the-art neural language processing techniques to produce human-comprehensible recommended mapping between the validated configuration model and the one in the SDN controller. In all, NAssim liberates the NetOps from most tedious tasks by learning directly from devices' manuals to produce data models which are comprehensible by both the SDN controller and human experts. Our evaluation shows, NAssim can accelerate the assimilation process by 9.1x. In this process, we also identify and correct 243 errors in four mainstream vendors' device manuals, and release a validated and expert-curated dataset of parsed manual corpus for future research.
