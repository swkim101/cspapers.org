Digital resources (streaming services, banking accounts, collaborative documents, etc.)  are commonly shared among small, social groups. Yet, the security and privacy (S&P) controls for these resources map poorly onto the reality of shared access and ownership (e.g., one shared Netflix password for roommates). One challenge is that the design space for social S&P controls remains unclear. We bridged this gap by engaging end-users in participatory design workshops to envision social solutions to S&P challenges common to their groups. In analyzing the generated ideas and group discussions, we identified four design considerations salient to social S&P controls: social transparency; structures of governance; stakes and responsibility; and, promoting pro-group S&P behaviors. Additionally, we discovered trade-offs and challenges that arise when designing social S&P controls: balancing group security versus individual privacy; combating social friction; mitigating social herding behaviors; and, minimizing coordination costs.
