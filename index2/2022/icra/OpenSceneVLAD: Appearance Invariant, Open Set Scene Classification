Scene classification is a well-established area of computer vision research that aims to classify a scene image into pre-defined categories such as playground, beach and airport. Recent work has focused on increasing the variety of pre-defined categories for classification, but so far failed to consider two major challenges: changes in scene appearance due to lighting and open set classification (the ability to classify unknown scene data as not belonging to the trained classes). Our first contribution, SceneVLAD, fuses scene classification and visual place recognition CNNs for appearance invariant scene classification that outperforms state-of-the-art scene classification by a mean F1 score of up to 0.1. Our second contribution, OpenSceneVLAD, extends the first to an open set classification scenario using intra-class splitting to achieve a mean increase in F1 scores of up to 0.06 compared to using state-of-the-art openmax layer. We achieve these results on three scene class datasets extracted from large scale outdoor visual localisation datasets, one of which we collected ourselves.
