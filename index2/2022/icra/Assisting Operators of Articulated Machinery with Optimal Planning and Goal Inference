Operating an articulated machine is a complex and hierarchical task, involving several levels of decision making. Motivated by the timber-harvesting applications of these machines, we are interested in developing a collaborative framework for operating an articulated machine/robot in order to increase its level of autonomy. In this paper, we consider two problems in the context of collaborative operation of a feller-buncher: first, the problem of planning a sequence of cut/grasp/bunch tasks for the trees in the vicinity of the machine. Here we propose a human-inspired planning algorithm based on our observations of the operators in the field. Then, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is provided, which enables us to obtain an optimal sequence of tasks. We provide numerical illustrations of how our MDP framework works. Second is the problem of inferring the operator's goal from the motions of the machine. The goal inference algorithm presented here enables the robot equipped with the planning intelligence to perceive the human's intent in real-time. We evaluate the performance of our goal inference algorithm through a user-study with a feller-buncher simulator. The results show the benefits of our algorithm over a robot that assumes the human is moving to the closest target.
