This paper mathematically conceives a novel walking support device that leverages passive dynamics and coupling effects. In this model, a passive human walker is flexibly connected to an active humanoid, where the coupling effect induces a stable walking gait of the human. To understand the key mechanism of such indirect gait regulation, different actuation modes are designed for the humanoid and compared via phase-plane analysis of the steady-state gaits. Moreover, stability analysis is conducted via Poincar√© map. The results show that it is difficult to enhance the human walker's stability when coupled to a humanoid robot using additional sensory information, compared to using a humanoid robot actuated with a predetermined force that employs no state feedback. The present mathematical model and our theoretical findings contribute to analysis and control design for locomotion systems with robot-human or inter-robots cooperation.
