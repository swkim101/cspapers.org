The problem addressed in this work is the arbitration of the role between a robot and a human during physical Human-Robot Interaction, sharing a common task. The system is modeled as a Cartesian impedance, with two separate external forces provided by the human and the robot. The problem is then reformulated as a Cooperative Differential Game, which possibly has multiple solutions on the Pareto frontier. Finally, the bargaining problem is addressed by proposing a solution depending on the interaction force, interpreted as the human will to lead or follow. This defines the arbitration law and assigns the role of leader or follower to the robot. Experiments show the feasibility and capabilities of the proposed control in managing the human-robot arbitration during a shared- trajectory following task.
