Existing navigation policies for autonomous robots tend to focus on collision avoidance while ignoring human-robot interactions in social life. For instance, robots can pass along the corridor safer and easier if pedestrians notice them. Sounds have been considered as an efficient way to attract the attention of pedestrians, which can alleviate the freezing robot problem. In this work, we present a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based social navigation approach for autonomous robots to move in pedestrian-rich environments with interaction capacity. Most existing DRL based methods intend to train a general policy that outputs both navigation actions, i.e., expected robot's linear and angular velocities, and interaction actions, i.e., the beep action, in the context of reinforcement learning. Different from these methods, we intend to train the policy via both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In specific, we first train an interaction policy in the context of supervised learning, which provides a better understanding of the social situation, then we use this interaction policy to train the navigation policy via multiple reinforcement learning algorithms. We evaluate our approach in various simulation environments and compare it to other methods. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms others in terms of the success rate. We also deploy the trained policy on a real-world robot, which shows a nice performance in crowded environments.
