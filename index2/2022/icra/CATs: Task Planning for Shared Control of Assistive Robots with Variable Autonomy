From robotic space assistance to healthcare robotics, there is increasing interest in robots that offer adaptable levels of autonomy. In this paper, we propose an action representation and planning framework that is able to generate plans that can be executed with both shared control and supervised autonomy, even switching between them during task execution. The action representation - Constraint Action Templates (CATs) - combine the advantages of Action Templates [1] and Shared Control Templates [2]. We demonstrate that CATs enable our planning framework to generate goal-directed plans for variations of a typical task of daily living, and that users can execute them on the wheelchair-robot EDAN in shared control or in autonomous mode.
