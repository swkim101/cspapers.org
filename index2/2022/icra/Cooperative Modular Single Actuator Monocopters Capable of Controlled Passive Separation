In this paper, we introduce a Modular Single Actuator Monocopter (M-SAM), which is capable of flying in both singular configuration and cooperative configuration. From singular mode, M-SAMs can be manually assembled into cooperative mode, using magnetic connectors built into the body of each M-SAM unit. The design of the connectors allow for passive separation of the units without the need for a dedicated separating actuator, by harnessing the variable centrifugal force from controlled adjustment of the rotating speed of the craft. To achieve control in both configurations, we firstly studied and analyzed their full dynamic models by introducing equilibrium state and relaxed hovering condition. Next, we derived a reduced model to approximate the dynamical behavior of both singular and cooperative configuration in flight to design a generalized cyclic-based cascaded flight controller. Finally, we validated the proposed controller and separation mechanism by conducting several flight experiments for two M-SAMs in singular mode, cooperative mode as well as mid-air separating under motion capture system.
