Prehensile object rearrangement in cluttered and confined spaces has broad applications but is also challenging. For instance, rearranging products in a grocery shelf means that the robot cannot directly access all objects and has limited free space. This is harder than tabletop rearrangement where objects are easily accessible with top-down grasps, which simplifies robot-object interactions. This work focuses on problems where such interactions are critical for completing tasks. It proposes a new efficient and complete solver under general constraints for monotone instances, which can be solved by moving each object at most once. The monotone solver reasons about robot-object constraints and uses them to effectively prune the search space. The new monotone solver is integrated with a global planner to solve non-monotone instances with high-quality solutions fast. Furthermore, this work contributes an effective pre-processing tool to significantly speed up online motion planning queries for rearrangement in confined spaces. Experiments further demonstrate that the proposed monotone solver, equipped with the pre-processing tool, results in 57.3% faster computation and 3 times higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods. Similarly, the resulting global planner is computationally more efficient and has a higher success rate, while producing high-quality solutions for non-monotone instances (i.e., only 1.3 additional actions are needed on average).
