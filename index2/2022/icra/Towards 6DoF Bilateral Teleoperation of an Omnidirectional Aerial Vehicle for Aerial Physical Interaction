Bilateral teleoperation offers an intriguing solution towards shared autonomy with aerial vehicles in contact-based inspection and manipulation tasks. Omnidirectional aerial robots allow for full pose operations, making them particularly attractive in such tasks. Naturally, the question arises whether standard bilateral teleoperation methodologies are suitable for use with these vehicles. In this work, a fully decoupled 6DoF bilateral teleoperation framework for aerial physical interaction is designed and tested for the first time. The method is based on the well established rate control, recentering and interaction force feedback policy. However, practical experiments evince the difficulty of performing de-coupled motions in a single axis only. As such, this work shows that the trivial extension of standard methods is insufficient for omnidirectional teleoperation, due to the operator's physical inability to properly decouple all input DoFs. This suggests that further studies on enhanced haptic feedback are necessary.
