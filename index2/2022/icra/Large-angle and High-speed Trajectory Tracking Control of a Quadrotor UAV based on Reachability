This paper solves the tracking control problem for a quadrotor system under the tasks of large-angle rotation and high-speed trajectory tracking. A quadrotor dynamic model is presented taking both disturbances and drag force into account. A reachability control strategy is developed for a quadrotor to track the planned attitude and position. Outdoor experiments of a circle trajectory tracking at different flight speeds validate the robustness of the proposed method. A task of flip is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller under a large tilt angle.
