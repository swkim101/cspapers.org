Depth information is considered valuable as it describes geometric structures, which benefits various robotic tasks. However, the depth acquired by RGB-D sensors still suffers from two deficiencies, i.e., incompletion and noises. Previous methods complete depth by exploring hand-tuned models or raising surface assumptions, while nowadays, deep approaches intend to solve this problem with rendered image pairs. For depth denoising, as a consequence of different sensor mechanisms, most methods can only work under specific devices. With existing methods, three challenges emerge: the onerous training set collecting process, the mismatch between existing models and present RGB-D sensors, and the non-real-time computation. In this paper, we first state depth completion and denoising are inherently different and without the need to collect or render complete and noiseless ground truths. We address all mentioned challenges with two separate un-supervised learning procedures. The completion network takes color and incomplete depth as input and predicts values to the unobserved area, which combines prior knowledge and color-depth correlations. The denoising step exploits image sequences to construct noise models in a self-supervised manner with the ability to cater to different sensors. Experimental comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that even without human-labeled ground truths, the proposed method could produce better completion results and also reduce noises in real-time.
