In this paper, a novel adjustable-stiffness force sensor is developed for multitask measurements requiring different force resolutions and ranges. The applied force of the force sensor is indirectly measured through the linear deformation instead of the structure strain through an optical linear encoder. The main structure of the force sensor is actually a linear variable stiffness mechanism with a compact size and a large stiffness change. Its stiffness can be continuously adjusted by changing the effective second moment of area of the structure. Thus, the force sensor has an adjustable range and resolution since the displacement resolution of the optical linear encoder is constant. The stiffness modeling of the sensor is performed based on the matrix method, which is then evaluated by the finite element analysis. A principle prototype is finally fabricated for the adjustable-stiffness test and a concrete application example. The testing results show that the stiffness and resolution of the force sensor can be changed by the proposed stiffness adjustment. Moreover, it is effective to measure different-resolution forces. This adjustable-stiffness approach can be also extended to the design of a torque sensor or a force/torque sensor.
