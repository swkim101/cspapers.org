We introduce FIM, an open-source toolkit for automated fault injection and mutant generation in Simulink models. FIM allows the injection of faults into specific parts, supporting common types of faults and mutation operators whose parameters can be customized to control the time of fault actuation and persistence. Additional flags allow the user to activate the individual fault blocks during testing to observe their effects on the overall system reliability. We provide insights into the design and architecture of FIM, and evaluate its performance on a case study from the avionics domain.
