Mobile applications, Internet of Things devices and web services are pervasive and they all encrypt the communications between servers and clients to not have information leakages. While the network traffic is encrypted, packet sizes and timings are still visible to an eavesdropper and these properties can leak information and sacrifice user privacy. We present TSA, a black box network side-channel analysis tool which detects and quantifies side-channel information leakages. TSA provides the users with the means to automate trace gathering by providing a framework in which the users can write mutators for the inputs to the system under analysis. TSA can also take as input traces directly for analysis if the user prefers to gather them separately. TSA is open-source and available as a Python package and a command-line tool. TSA demo, tool and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/kadron/tsa-tool.
