To facilitate newcomer onboarding, GitHub recommends the use of "good first issue" (GFI) labels to signal issues suitable for newcomers to resolve. However, previous research shows that manually labeled GFIs are scarce and inappropriate, showing a need for automated recommendations. In this paper, we present GFI-Bot (accessible at https://gfibot.io), a proof-of-concept machine learning powered bot for automated GFI recommendation in practice. Project maintainers can configure GFI-Bot to discover and label possible GFIs so that newcomers can easily locate issues for making their first contributions. GFI-Bot also provides a high-quality, up-to-date dataset for advancing GFI recommendation research.
