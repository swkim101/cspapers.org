It is difficult to quickly locate and search for specific vulnerabilities and their solutions because vulnerability information is scattered in the existing vulnerability management library. To alleviate this problem, we extract knowledge from vulnerability reports and organize the vulnerability information into the form of a knowledge graph. Then, we implement a tool for knowledge-driven vulnerability searching, KVS. This tool mainly uses the BERT model to realize the vulnerability named entity recognition and construct the vulnerability knowledge graph (VulKG). Finally, we can search vulnerabilities of interest-based on VulKG. The URL of this tool is https://cinnqi.github.io/Neo4j-D3-VKG/. Video of our demo is available at https://youtu.be/FT1BaLUGPk0.
