Design-by-contract as a programming technique is becoming popular in Python community as various tools have been developed for automatically testing the code based on the contracts. However, there is no sufficiently large and representative Python code base with contracts to evaluate these different testing tools. We present Python-by-contract dataset containing 514 Python functions annotated with contracts using icontract library. We show that our Python-by-contract dataset can be easily used by existing testing tools that take advantage of contracts. The demo video can be found at https://youtu.be/08wZN-xh6mY.
