We propose Veksel, a simple generic paradigm for constructing efficient non-interactive coin mixes. The central component in our work is a concretely efficient proof π1-many that a homomorphic commitment c* is a rerandomization of a commitment c ∈ {c1, …,cℓ} without revealing c. We formalize anonymous account-based cryptocurrency as a universally composable functionality and show how to efficiently instantiate it using π1-many in a straightforward way. We instantiate and implement π1-many from Strong-RSA, DDH and random oracles targeting ≈ 112 bits of security. The resulting NIZK has constant size (|π1-many| = 5.3 KB) and constant proving/verification time (≈ 90 ms), on an already accumulated set. Compared to ZCash---which offers comparable marginal verification cost and an anonymity set consisting of every existing transaction---our transactions are larger (6.2 KB) and verification is slower. On the other hand, Veksel relies on better studied assumptions, has no expensive trusted setup for proofs and is arguably simpler to implement. Additionally we think that π1-many might be interesting in other applications, e.g. proving possession of some credential posted on-chain. The efficiency of our concrete NIZK relies on a new Ristretto-friendly elliptic curve, Jabberwock, that is of independent interest: it can be used to efficiently prove statements on "committments on commitments'' in Bulletproofs.
