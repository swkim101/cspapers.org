As Point Clouds (PCs) gain popularity in processing millions of data points for 3D rendering in many applications, efficient data compression becomes a critical issue. This is because compression is the primary bottleneck in minimizing the latency and energy consumption of existing PC pipelines. Data compression becomes even more critical as PC processing is pushed to edge devices with limited compute and power budgets. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two complementary schemes, intra-frame compression and inter-frame compression, to speed up the PC compression, without losing much quality or compression efficiency. Unlike existing techniques that use sequential algorithms, our first design, intra-frame compression, exploits parallelism for boosting the performance of both geometry and attribute compression. The proposed parallelism brings around $43.7 \times$ performance improvement and 96.6% energy savings at a cost of $1.01 \times$ larger compressed data size. To further improve the compression efficiency, our second scheme, inter-frame compression, considers the temporal similarity among the video frames and reuses the attribute data from the previous frame for the current frame. We implement our designs on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge GPU board. Experimental results with six videos show that the combined compression schemes provide $34.0 \times$ speedup compared to a state-of-the-art scheme, with minimal impact on quality and compression ratio.
