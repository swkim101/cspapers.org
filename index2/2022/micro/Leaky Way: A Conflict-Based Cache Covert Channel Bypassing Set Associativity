Modern $\times$86 processors feature many prefetch instructions that developers can use to enhance performance. However, with some prefetch instructions, users can more directly manipulate cache states which may result in powerful cache covert channel and side channel attacks. In this work, we reverse-engineer the detailed cache behavior of PREFETCHNTA on various Intel processors. Based on the results, we first propose a new conflict-based cache covert channel named NTP+NTP. Prior conflict-based channels often require priming the cache set in order to cause cache conflicts. In contrast, in NTP+NTP, the data of the sender and receiver can compete for one specific way in the cache set, achieving cache conflicts without cache set priming for the first time. As a result, NTP+NTP has higher bandwidth than prior conflict-based channels such as Prime+Probe. The channel capacity of NTP+NTP is 302 KB/s. Second, we found that PREFETCHNTA can also be used to boost the performance of existing side channel attacks that utilize cache replacement states, making those attacks much more efficient than before.
