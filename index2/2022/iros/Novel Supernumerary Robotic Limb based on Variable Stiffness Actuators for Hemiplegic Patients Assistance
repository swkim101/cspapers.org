Loss of upper extremity motor control and function is an unremitting symptom in post-stroke patients. This would impose hardships on accomplishing their daily life activities. Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) were introduced as a solution to regain the lost Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) by introducing an independent new limb. The actuation systems in SRL can be categorized into rigid and soft actuators. Soft actuators have proven advantageous over their rigid counterparts through intrinsic safety, cost, and energy efficiency. However, they suffer from low stiffness, which jeopardizes their accuracy. Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) are newly developed technologies that have been proven to ensure accuracy and safety. In this paper, we introduce the novel Supernumerary Robotic Limb based on Variable Stiffness Actuators. Based on our knowledge, the proposed proof-of-concept SRL is the first that utilizes Variable Stiffness Actuators. The developed SRL would assist post-stroke patients in bi-manual tasks, e.g., eating with a fork and knife. The modeling, design, and realization of the system are illustrated. The proposed SRL was evaluated and verified for its accuracy via predefined trajectories. The safety was verified by utilizing the momentum observer for collision detection, and several post-collision reaction strategies were evaluated through the Soft Tissue Injury Test. The assistance process is qualitatively verified through standard user-satisfaction questionnaire.
