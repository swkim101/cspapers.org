Virtual Fixtures facilitate teleoperation, for in-stance by guiding the human operator. Developing these Virtual Fixtures in tasks with tight tolerances remains challenging. Fixtures with a high stiffness allow for more precise guidance, whereas a lower stiffness is required to allow for corrections. We observed that many assembly operations can be split into different phases - approaching, positioning, in-contact manipulation - each with different accuracy requirements. Therefore, we propose to use multi-modal fixtures, satisfying the different requirements of these phases: i.e. a position-based Trajectory Fixture for approaching and a more accurate Visual Servoing Fixture for the positioning phase. A state estimation and arbitration component ensures smooth transitions between the fixtures to provide optimal support for the operator and to achieve global availability paired with local precision at the same time. It also allows a high stiffness to be used throughout, thus achieving good guidance for all phases. The approach is validated in an application from a space scenario, consisting of the assembly of a CubeSat subsystem. The empirical results from a pilot study on this task show that our approach is faster and requires less interaction force from the operator than the baseline method.
