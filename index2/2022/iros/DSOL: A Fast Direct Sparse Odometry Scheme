In this paper, we describe Direct Sparse Odometry Lite (DSOL), an improved version of Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) [1]. We propose several algorithmic and implementation enhancements which speed up computation by a significant factor (on average 5x) even on resource-constrained platforms. The increase in speed allows us to process images at higher frame rates, which in turn provides better results on rapid motions. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/versatran01/dso1.
