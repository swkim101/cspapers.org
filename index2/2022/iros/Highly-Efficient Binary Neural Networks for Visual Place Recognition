VPR is a fundamental task for autonomous navigation as it enables a robot to localize itself in the workspace when a known location is detected. Although accuracy is an essential requirement for a VPR technique, computational and energy efficiency are not less important for real-world applications. CNN-based techniques archive state-of-the-art VPR performance but are computationally intensive and energy demanding. Binary neural networks (BNN) have been recently proposed to address VPR efficiently. Although a typical BNN is an order of magnitude more efficient than a CNN, its processing time and energy usage can be further improved. In a typical BNN, the first convolution is not completely binarized for the sake of accuracy. Consequently, the first layer is the slowest network stage, requiring a large share of the entire computational effort. This paper presents a class of BNNs for VPR that combines depthwise separable factorization and binarization to replace the first convolutional layer to improve computational and energy efficiency. Our best model achieves higher VPR performance while spending considerably less time and energy to process an image than a BNN using a non-binary convolution as a first stage.
