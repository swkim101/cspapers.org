Humans are able to manipulate Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) such as cables and wires, with little or no visual information, relying mostly on force sensing. In this work, we propose a reduced DLO model which enables such blind manipulation by keeping the object under tension. Further, an online model estimation procedure is also proposed. A set of elementary sliding and clipping manipulation primitives are defined based on our model. The combination of these primitives allows for more complex motions such as winding of a DLO. The model estimation and manipulation primitives are tested individually but also together in a real-world cable harness production task, using a dual-arm YuMi, thus demonstrating that force-based perception can be sufficient even for such a complex scenario.
