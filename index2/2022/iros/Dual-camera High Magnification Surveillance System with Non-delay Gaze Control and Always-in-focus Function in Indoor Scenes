This study proposes a dual-camera system for indoor high magnification surveillance which is capable of achieving always-in-focus and non-delay gaze control based on high-speed vision. The users are enabled to move the mouse freely on the wide-view screen while observing its in-focal zoom-in monitoring video in real-time. The proposed system consists of a wide-angle camera for wide-view and a Galvano mirror-enabled ultra-fast pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera for zoom-in view. To achieve always-in-focus, a high-speed focus scanning system is proposed that is comprised of a high-speed camera, a parfocal zoom lens, and a gear mechanism. Through continuously reciprocating rotational motion of the focusing ring driven by the servo motor, the high-speed camera captures sets of images with varying focal distances. Moreover, we proposed a most-in-focus (MIF) frame extraction algorithm to select the sharpest images as output. The experimental results are obtained to confirm the effectiveness of our system.
