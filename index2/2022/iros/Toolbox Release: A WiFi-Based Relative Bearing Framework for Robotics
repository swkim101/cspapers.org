This paper presents the WiFi-Sensor-for-Robotics (WSR) open-source toolbox111Code: https://github.com/Harvard-REACT/WSR-Toolbox Dataset: https://github.com/Harvard-REACT/WSR-Toolbox-Dataset Demo: https://github.com/Harvard-REACT/WSR-Toolbox/wiki/Demo. It enables robots in a team to obtain relative bearing to each other, even in nonline-of-sight (NLOS) settings which is a very challenging problem in robotics. It does so by analyzing the phase of their communicated WiFi signals as the robots traverse the environment. This capability, based on the theory developed in our prior works, is made available for the first time as an open-source toolbox. It is motivated by the lack of easily deployable solutions that use robots' local resources (e.g WiFi) for sensing in NLOS. This has implications for multi-robot mapping and rendezvous, ad-hoc robot networks, and security in multi-robot teams, amongst other applications. The toolbox is designed for distributed and online deployment on robot platforms using commodity hardware and on-board sensors. We also release datasets demonstrating its performance in NLOS and line-of-sight (LOS) settings and for a multi-robot localization use case. Empirical results for hardware experiments show that the bearing estimation from our toolbox achieves accuracy with mean and standard deviation of 1.13 degrees, 11.07 degrees in LOS and 6.04 degrees, 26.4 degrees for NLOS, respectively, in an indoor office environment.
