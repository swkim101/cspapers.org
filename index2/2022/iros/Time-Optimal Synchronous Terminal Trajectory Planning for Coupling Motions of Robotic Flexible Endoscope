The robotic flexible endoscope is developed rapidly in the field of surgery robots due to its high flexibility and safety. However, some inherent features, e.g., high nonlinearity, material creep, complex dynamic hysteresis behaviors, and the unknown coupling effects between bending and twisting motions, can lead to the significant degradation on three-dimensional (3-D) positioning performance of the endoscope. Aiming at these challenges, this paper built a practical multi-motion hysteresis phenomenon model for the bending and twisting motions of the robotic flexible endoscope with consideration of the coupling effects. Then, the time-optimal synchronous terminal motion planner is first proposed for the 3-D motions of the robotic endoscope to decouple the coupling effects in an intuitive separate control scheme. Finally, a series of hardware experiments are conducted on a robotic flexible ureteroscope platform. The accuracy of the proposed model and the trajectory-planning-based decoupling strategy is comprehensively validated. Particularly, the experimental results with the proposed trajectory planner show the satisfactory performance of vibration suppression and over-shoot suppression.
