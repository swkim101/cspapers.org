In biomedical engineering, robotic implants provide new methods to restore and improve bodily function, and regenerate tissue. A significant challenge with the design of these devices is to safely actuate them for weeks or months, while they are residing in a patient's body. Magnetic, and other force-at-distance actuation methods, allow mechanisms to be controlled remotely and without contact or line of sight to the device. In this paper, we present a novel magnetic field driven wireless motor. The motor drives a robotic implant for the treatment of long gap esophageal atresia and short bowel syndrome. The motor is equipped with two oppositely oriented permanent magnets which experience forces in opposite directions when a magnetic field is applied tangential to the magnets' directions. The implant can produce a force of 2 N. It is demonstrated with an ex vivo porcine esophagus.
