We present our framework Behaviors, Objectives and Binary states for Coordinated Autonomous Tasks (BOBCAT), a multi-agent decision making and task management system for autonomous robots. BOBCAT builds on behavior-based systems and the Belief-Desire-Intention model for decision-making, by using mission objectives as the basis for selecting tasks, or behaviors. We describe how BOBCAT is formulated and present the results of a real-world implementation in the context of exploring austere underground environments in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.
