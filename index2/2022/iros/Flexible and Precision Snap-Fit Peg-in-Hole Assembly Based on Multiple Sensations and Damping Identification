Snap-fit peg-in-hole assembly widely exists in both industry and daily life, especially for consumer electronics. The buckle mechanism leads to a damping zone inside the port where insertion force needs to be increased. It is much difficult to automate this process by robots, for size and clearance of the components are always small, and the damping buckle should be perceived and distinguished from solid inner walls of the port. End-effector position control might be invalid, since grasping error will make it difficult to locate the plug accurately. In this article, we undertake this assembly challenge by taking advantage of fingertip tactile perception combined with visual images and force feedback. Raw sensor data is collected, processed, and fused together to be state input of a reinforcement learning network, generating continuous action vectors. We also propose a novel damping zone predictor through feature extraction and multimodal fusion, which is able to identify whether the plug has touched the buckle mechanism, so as to adjust the insertion force. The whole framework is implemented through a common USB Type-C insertion experiment on Franka Panda robot platform, reaching a success rate of 88%. Furthermore, system robustness is verified, and comparisons of different modalities are also conducted.
