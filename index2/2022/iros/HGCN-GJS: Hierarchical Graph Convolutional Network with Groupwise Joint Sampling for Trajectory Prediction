Pedestrian trajectory prediction is of great importance for downstream tasks, such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. Realistic models of the social interactions within the crowd is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. However, most existing methods do not capture group level interactions well, focusing only on pairwise interactions and neglecting group-wise interactions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical graph convolutional network, HGCN-GJS, for trajectory prediction which well leverages group level interactions within the crowd. Furthermore, we introduce a joint sampling scheme that captures co-dependencies between pedestrian trajectories during trajectory generation. Based on group information, this scheme ensures that generated trajectories within each group are consistent with each other, but enables different groups to act more independently. We demonstrate that our proposed network achieves state of the art performance on all datasets we have considered.
