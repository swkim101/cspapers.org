Research attention on natural user interfaces (NUIs) for drone flights are rising. Nevertheless, NUIs are highly diversified, and primarily evaluated by different physical environments leading to hard-to-compare performance between such solutions. We propose a virtual environment, namely VRFlightSim, enabling comparative evaluations with enriched drone flight details to address this issue. We first replicated a state-of-the-art (SOTA) interface and designed two tasks (crossing and pointing) in our virtual environment. Then, two user studies with 13 participants demonstrate the necessity of VRFlightSim and further highlight the potential of open-data interface designs.
