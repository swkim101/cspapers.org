The recent trend towards low reduction gearing in robotic actuation has revitalised the need for high-performance gearing concepts. In this work we propose compact low-reduction cycloidal gearing, that is 3D-printable and combined with off-the-shelf components. This approach presents an enormous potential for high performance-to-cost implementations. After discussing parameter selection and design considerations, we present a prototype that is combined with a low-cost brushless motor to demonstrate its potential. Extensive experimental results demonstrate high performance, including >40Nm torque, low friction and play, and high impact robustness. The results show that the proposed approach can yield viable gearbox designs.
