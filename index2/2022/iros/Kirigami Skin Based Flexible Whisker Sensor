Whiskers are widely used by animals for sensing physical interactions with their environments. By combining the Kirigami skin pop-up feature and flexible conducting layer, we designed a deployable Kirigami whisker sensor. The sensor can deploy from a flat state to a sensing state while whisker stiffness and initial pop-up angle can be tuned by adjusting the pre-stretch strain. Preliminary results show that the sensor works well both in air and underwater. The sensor is capable of measuring both externally applied forces and water flow.
