In-hand pivoting is one of the important manipulation skills that leverage robot grippers' extrinsic dexterity to perform repositioning tasks to compensate for environmental uncertainties and imprecise motion execution. Although many researchers have been trying to solve pivoting problems using mathematical modeling or learning-based approaches, the problems remain as open challenges. On the other hand, humans perform in-hand manipulation with remarkable precision and speed. Hence, the solution could be provided by making full use of this intrinsic human skill through dexterous teleoperation. For dexterous teleoperation to be successful, interfaces that enhance and complement haptic feedback are of great necessity. In this paper, we propose a cutaneous feedback interface that complements the somatosensory information humans rely on when performing dexterous skills. The interface is designed based on five-bar link mechanisms and provides two contact points in the index finger and thumb for cutaneous feedback. By integrating the interface with a commercially available haptic device, the system can display information such as grasping force, shear force, friction, and grasped object's pose. Passive pivoting tasks inside a numerical simulator Isaac Sim is conducted to evaluate the effect of the proposed cutaneous feedback interface.
