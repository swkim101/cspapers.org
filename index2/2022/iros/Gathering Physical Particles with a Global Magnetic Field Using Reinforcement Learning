For biomedical applications in targeted therapy delivery and interventions, a large swarm of micro-scale particles (“agents”) has to be moved through a maze-like environment (“vascular system”) to a target region (“tumor”). Due to limited on-board capabilities, these agents cannot move autonomously; instead, they are controlled by an external global force that acts uniformly on all particles. In this work, we demonstrate how to use a time-varying magnetic field to gather particles to a desired location. We use reinforcement learning to train networks to efficiently gather particles. Methods to overcome the simulation-to-reality gap are explained, and the trained networks are deployed on a set of mazes and goal locations. The hardware experiments demonstrate fast convergence, and robustness to both sensor and actuation noise. To encourage extensions and to serve as a benchmark for the reinforcement learning community, the code is available at Github.
