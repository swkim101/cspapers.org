Wearable robots have been developed to aid or substitute the gait locomotion of humans. To assist gait locomotion based on the intention of a wearer, a gait pattern analysis is required with a wearable sensor by measuring body information, i.e., a joint angular velocity. However, measuring a precise joint angular velocity is difficult because the attachment position of a sensor has a curvature and an anatomical joint axis which is invisible. Therefore, a sensor calibration algorithm, which aligns a sensor axis into an anatomical joint axis, is required to provide an optimal assist for a wearer. Hence, in this paper, a new and simple sensor calibration algorithm is proposed with a unit sensor. Since a wearer shakes the body or collides with the ground when walking, the attachment position of a sensor may be changed. Thus, a continuous sensor compensation algorithm is also proposed. Additionally, the effectiveness of this new algorithm is demonstrated by gait locomotion experiments on various paths.
