In this paper, we propose a novel Voting based Grasp Pose Network (VGPN) to detect 6-DoF grasps in cluttered scenes. The motivation of this paper is that local object geometry can provide useful clues about where the object can be grasped. Generated by the sampled seed points from raw point cloud, the votes allow seed points in different object regions to contribute to locations where the object can be grasped. Geometric features from various local regions are aggregated to generate grasps in a more confident and dense space, which enables grasp prediction utilizing more global context features. The search space of grasp pose detection is also greatly reduced. Experimental results on both simulation and real-world environments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both success rate and coverage of the ground truth grasps. The objects can be grasped with fewer attempts which is critical in real-world applications.
