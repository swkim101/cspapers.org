This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning based navigation approach in which we define the occu-pancy observations as heuristic evaluations of motion primitives, rather than using raw sensor data. Our method enables fast mapping of the occupancy data, generated by multi-sensor fusion, into trajectory values in 3D workspace. The computationally efficient trajectory evaluation allows dense sampling of the action space. We utilize our occupancy observations in different data structures to analyze their effects on both training process and navigation performance. We train and test our methodology on two different robots within challenging physics-based simulation environments including static and dy-namic obstacles. We benchmark our occupancy representations with other conventional data structures from state-of-the-art methods. The trained navigation policies are also validated successfully with physical robots in dynamic environments. The results show that our method not only decreases the required training time but also improves the navigation performance as compared to other occupancy representations.
