We study concrete sheaf models for a call-by-value higher-order language with recursion. Our family of sheaf models is a generalization of many examples from the literature, such as models for probabilistic and differentiable programming, and fully abstract logical relations models. We treat recursion in the spirit of synthetic domain theory. We provide a general construction of a lifting monad starting from a class of admissible monomorphisms in the site of the sheaf category. In this way, we obtain a family of models parametrized by a concrete site and a class of monomorphisms, for which we prove a general computational adequacy theorem.
