Smart factory automation has an ongoing trend to employ high-speed real-time wireless technologies to interconnect heterogeneous industrial assets to perform various sensing and control services, and support mobile equipment to conduct designated tasks in a collaborative fashion. Applications in automation industries usually have stringent requirements on both high data rates and deterministic real-time performance. Existing efforts, however, either cannot meet the performance requirements or are based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and cannot provide full-stack configurability [1].
