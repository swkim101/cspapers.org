Information integration from different modalities is an active area of research. Human beings and, in general, biological neural systems are quite adept at using a multitude of signals from different sensory perceptive fields to interact with the environment and each other. Recent work in deep fusion models via neural networks has led to substantial improvements over unimodal approaches in areas like speech recognition, emotion recognition and analysis, captioning and image description. However, such research has mostly focused on architectural changes allowing for fusion of different modalities while keeping the model complexity manageable.Inspired by neuroscientific ideas about multisensory integration and processing, we investigate the effect of introducing neural dependencies in the loss functions. Experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis tasks with different models show that our approach provides a consistent performance boost.
