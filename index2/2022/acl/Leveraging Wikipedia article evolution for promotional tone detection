Detecting biased language is useful for a variety of applications, such as identifying hyperpartisan news sources or flagging one-sided rhetoric. In this work we introduce WikiEvolve, a dataset for document-level promotional tone detection. Unlike previously proposed datasets, WikiEvolve contains seven versions of the same article from Wikipedia, from different points in its revision history; one with promotional tone, and six without it. This allows for obtaining more precise training signal for learning models from promotional tone detection. We adapt the previously proposed gradient reversal layer framework to encode two article versions simultaneously and thus leverage this additional training signal. In our experiments, our proposed adaptation of gradient reversal improves the accuracy of four different architectures on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation.
