When quantum programs are executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, they experience hardware noise; consequently, the program outputs are often erroneous. To mitigate the adverse effects of hardware noise, it is necessary to understand the effect of hardware noise on the program output and more fundamentally, understand the impact of hardware noise on specific regions within a quantum program. Identifying and optimizing regions that are more noise-sensitive is the key to expanding the capabilities of NISQ computers. Toward achieving that goal, we propose Charter, a novel technique to pinpoint specific gates and regions within a quantum program that are the most affected by the hardware noise and that have the highest impact on the program output. Using Charter's methodology, programmers can obtain a precise understanding of how different components of their code affect the output and optimize those components without the need for non-scalable quantum simulation on classical computers.
