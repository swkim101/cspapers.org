With ever-increasing execution scale of the high performance computing (HPC) applications, vast amount of data are being produced by scientific research every day. Error-bounded lossy compression has been considered a very promising solution to address the big-data issue for scientific applications, because it can significantly reduce the data volume with low time cost meanwhile allowing users to control the compression errors with a specified error bound. The existing error-bounded lossy compressors, however, are all developed based on inflexible designs or compression pipelines, which cannot adapt to diverse compression quality requirements/metrics favored by different application users. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic quality metric oriented error-bounded lossy compression frame-work, namely QoZ. The detailed contribution is three fold. (1) We design a novel highly-parameterized multi-level interpolation-based data predictor, which can significantly improve the overall compression quality with the same compressed size. (2) We design the error bounded lossy compression framework QoZ based on the adaptive predictor, which can auto-tune the critical parameters and optimize the compression result according to user-specified quality metrics during online compression. (3) We evaluate QoZ carefully by comparing its compression quality with multiple state-of-the-arts on various real-world scientific application datasets. Experiments show that, compared with the second best lossy compressor, QoZ can achieve up to 70% compression ratio improvement under the same error bound, up to 150% compression ratio improvement under the same PSNR, or up to 270% compression ratio improvement under the same SSIM.
