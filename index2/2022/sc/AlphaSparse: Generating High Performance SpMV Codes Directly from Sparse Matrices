Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication (SpMV) is an essential computational kernel in many application scenarios. Tens of sparse matrix formats and implementations have been proposed to compress the memory storage and speed up SpMV performance. We develop AlphaSparse, a superset of all existing works that goes beyond the scope of human-designed format(s) and implementation(s). AlphaSparse automatically creates novel machine-designed formats and SpMV kernel implementations en-tirely from the knowledge of input sparsity patterns and hard-ware architectures. Based on our proposed Operator Graph that expresses the path of SpMV format and kernel design, AlphaS-parse consists of three main components: Designer, Format & Kernel Generator, and Search Engine. It takes an arbitrary sparse matrix as input while outputs the performance machine-designed format and SpMV implementation. By extensively evaluating 843 matrices from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, AlphaSparse achieves significant performance improvement by 3.2 × on average compared to five state-of-the-art artificial formats and 1.5 × on average (up to 2.7×) over the up-to-date implementation of traditional auto-tuning philosophy.
