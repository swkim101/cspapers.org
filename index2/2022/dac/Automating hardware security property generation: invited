Security verification is an important part of the hardware design process. Security verification teams can uncover weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and flaws. Unfortunately, the verification process involves substantial manual analysis to create the threat model, identify important security assets, articulate weaknesses, define security requirements, and specify security properties that formally describe security requirements upon the hardware. This work describes current hardware security verification practices. Many of these rely on manual analysis. We argue that the property generation process is a first step towards scalable and reproducible hardware security verification.
