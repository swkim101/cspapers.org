The rise in the development of complex and application-specific commercial and open-source hardware and the shrinking verification time are causing numerous hardware-security vulnerabilities. Traditional verification techniques are limited in both scalability and completeness. Research in this direction is hindered due to the lack of robust testing benchmarks. In this paper, in collaboration with our industry partners, we built an ecosystem mimicking the hardware-development cycle where we inject bugs inspired by real-world vulnerabilities into RISC-V SoC design and organized an open-to-all bug-hunting competition. We equipped the participating researchers with industry-standard static and dynamic verification tools in a ready-to-use environment. The findings from our competition shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing verification tools and highlight the potential for future research in developing new vulnerability detection techniques.
