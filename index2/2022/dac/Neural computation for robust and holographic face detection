Face detection is an essential component of many tasks in computer vision with several applications. However, existing deep learning solutions are significantly slow and inefficient to enable face detection on embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose HDFace, a novel framework for highly efficient and robust face detection. HDFace exploits HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) as a neurally-inspired computational paradigm that mimics important brain functionalities towards high-efficiency and noise-tolerant computation. We first develop a novel technique that enables HDC to perform stochastic arithmetic computations over binary hypervectors. Next, we expand these arithmetic for efficient and robust processing of feature extraction algorithms in hyperspace. Finally, we develop an adaptive hyperdimensional classification algorithm for effective and robust face detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of HDFace on large-scale emotion detection and face detection applications. Our results indicate that HDFace provides, on average, 6.1X (4.6X) speedup and 3.0X (12.1X) energy efficiency as compared to neural networks running on CPU (FPGA), respectively.
