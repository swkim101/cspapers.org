Approximate computing is an emerging computing paradigm to design energy-efficient systems. Many greedy approximate logic synthesis (ALS) methods have been proposed to automatically synthesize approximate circuits. They typically need to consider all local approximate changes (LACs) in each iteration of the ALS flow to select the best one, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose SEALS, a Sensitivity-driven Efficient ALS method to speed up a greedy ALS flow. SEALS centers around a newly proposed concept called sensitivity, which enables a fast and accurate error estimation method and an efficient method to filter out unpromising LACs. SEALS can handle any statistical error metric. The experimental results show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art ALS method in runtime by 12X to 15X without reducing circuit quality.
