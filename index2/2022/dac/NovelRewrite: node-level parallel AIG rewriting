Logic rewriting is an important part in logic optimization. It rewrites a circuit by replacing local subgraphs with logically equivalent ones, so that the area and the delay of the circuit can be optimized. This paper introduces a parallel AIG rewriting algorithm with a new concept of logical cuts. Experiments show that this algorithm implemented with one GPU can be on average 32X faster than the logic rewriting in the logic synthesis tool ABC on large benchmarks. Compared with other logic rewriting acceleration works, ours has the best quality and the shortest running time.
