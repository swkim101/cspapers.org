File storage system (FSS) uses multi-caches to accelerate data accesses. Unfortunately, efficient FSS cache allocation remains extremely difficult. First, as the key of cache allocation, existing miss ratio curve (MRC) constructions are limited to LRU. Second, existing techniques are suitable for same-layer caches but not for hierarchical ones. We present a Learned MRC Profiling based Cache Allocation (LPCA) scheme for FSS. To the best of our knowledge, LPCA is the first to apply machine learning to model MRC under non-LRU, LPCA also explores optimization target for hierarchical caches, in that LPCA can provide universal and efficient cache allocation for FSSs.
