Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is widely used for associative search tasks in advanced machine learning models and data-intensive applications due to the highly parallel pattern matching capability. Most state-of-the-art CAM designs focus on reducing the CAM cell area by exploiting the nonvolatile memories (NVMs). There exists only little research on optimizing the design and energy efficiency of NVM based CAMs for practical deployment in edge devices and AI hardware. In this paper, we propose a general compact and energy efficient CAM design scheme that alleviates the design overhead by employing just one NVM device in the cell. We also propose an adaptive matchline (ML) precharge and discharge scheme that further optimizes the search energy by fully reducing the ML voltage swing. We consider Ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) as the representative NVM, and present a 2T-1FeFET CAM array including a sense amplifier implementing the proposed ML scheme. Evaluation results suggest that our proposed 2T-1FeFET CAM design achieves 6.64×/4.74×/9.14×/3.02× better energy efficiency compared with CMOS/ReRAM/STT-MRAM/2FeFET CAM arrays. Benchmarking results show that our approach provides 3.3×/2.1× energy-delay product improvement over the 2T-2R/2FeFET CAM in accelerating query processing applications.
