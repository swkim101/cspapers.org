Hybrid flash based storage constructed with high-density and low-cost flash memory are becoming increasingly popular in consumer devices during the last decade. However, to protect critical data, existing methods are designed for improving reliability of consumer devices with non-hybrid flash storage. Based on evaluations and analysis, these methods will result in significant performance and lifetime degradation in consumer devices with hybrid storage. The reason is that different kinds of memory in hybrid storage have different characteristics, such as performance and access granularity. To address the above problems, a critical data backup (CDB) method is proposed to backup designated critical data with making full use of different kinds of memory in hybrid storage. Experiment results show that compared with the state-of-the-arts, CDB achieves encouraging performance and lifetime improvement.
