Booming data volume has become an important challenge for data center storage and bandwidth resources. Consequently, fast and efficient compression architecture is becoming the most fundamental design in data centers. However, the compression ratio (CR) and compression throughput are often difficult to achieve at the same time on existing computing platforms. DEFLATE is a widely used compression format in data centers, which is an ideal case for hardware acceleration. Unfortunately, Deflate has an inherent connection among its special memory access pattern, which limits a higher throughput. In this paper, we propose MetaZip, a high-throughput and scalable data-compression architecture, which is targeted for FPGA-enabled data centers. To improve the compression throughput within the constraints of FPGA resources, we propose an adaptive parallel-width pipeline, which can be fed 64bytes per cycle. To balance the compression quality, we propose a series of sub-modules (e.g. 8-bytes MetaHistory, Seed Bypass, Serialization Predictor). Experimental results show that MetaZip achieves the throughput of 15.6GB/s with a single engine, which is 234X/2.78X than a CPU gzip baseline and FPGA based architecture, respectively.
