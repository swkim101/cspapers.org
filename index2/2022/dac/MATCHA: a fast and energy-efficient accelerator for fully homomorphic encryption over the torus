Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) allows arbitrary computations to happen directly on ciphertexts using homomorphic logic gates. However, each TFHE gate on state-of-the-art hardware platforms such as GPUs and FPGAs is extremely slow (> 0.2ms). Moreover, even the latest FPGA-based TFHE accelerator cannot achieve high energy efficiency, since it frequently invokes expensive double-precision floating point FFT and IFFT kernels. In this paper, we propose a fast and energy-efficient accelerator, MATCHA, to process TFHE gates. MATCHA supports aggressive bootstrapping key unrolling to accelerate TFHE gates without decryption errors by approximate multiplication-less integer FFTs and IFFTs, and a pipelined datapath. Compared to prior accelerators, MATCHA improves the TFHE gate processing throughput by 2.3x, and the throughput per Watt by 6.3x.
