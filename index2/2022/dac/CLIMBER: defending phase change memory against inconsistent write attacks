Non-volatile Memories (NVMs) usually demonstrate vast endurance variation due to Process Variation (PV). They are vulnerable to an Inconsistent Write Attack (IWA) which reverses the write intensity distribution in two adjacent wear leveling windows. In this paper, we propose CLIMBER, a defense mechanism to neutralize IWA for NVMs. CLIMBER dynamically changes harmful address mappings so that intensive writes to weak cells are still redirected to strong cells. CLIMBER also conceals weak NVM cells from attackers by randomly mapping cold addresses to weak NVM regions. Experimental results show that CLIMBER can reduce maximum page wear rate by 43.2% compared with the state-of-the-art Toss-up Wear Leveling and prolong NVM lifetime from 4.19 years to 7.37 years with trivial performance/hardware overhead.
