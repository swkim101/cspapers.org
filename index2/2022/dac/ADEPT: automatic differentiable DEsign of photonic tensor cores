Photonic tensor cores (PTCs) are essential building blocks for optical artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators based on programmable photonic integrated circuits. PTCs can achieve ultra-fast and efficient tensor operations for neural network (NN) acceleration. Current PTC designs are either manually constructed or based on matrix decomposition theory, which lacks the adaptability to meet various hardware constraints and device specifications. To our best knowledge, automatic PTC design methodology is still unexplored. It will be promising to move beyond the manual design paradigm and "nurture" photonic neurocomputing with AI and design automation. Therefore, in this work, for the first time, we propose a fully differentiable framework, dubbed ADEPT, that can efficiently search PTC designs adaptive to various circuit footprint constraints and foundry PDKs. Extensive experiments show superior flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed ADEPT framework to explore a large PTC design space. On various NN models and benchmarks, our searched PTC topology outperforms prior manually-designed structures with competitive matrix representability, 2×-30× higher footprint compactness, and better noise robustness, demonstrating a new paradigm in photonic neural chip design. The code of ADEPT is available at link using the TorchONN library.
