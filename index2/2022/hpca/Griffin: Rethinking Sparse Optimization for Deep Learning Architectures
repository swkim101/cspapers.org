This paper examines the design space trade-offs of DNNs accelerators aiming to achieve competitive performance and efficiency metrics for all four combinations of dense or sparse activation/weight tensors. To do so, we systematically examine the overheads of supporting sparsity on top of an optimized dense core. These overheads are modeled based on parameters that indicate how a multiplier can borrow a nonzero operation from the neighboring multipliers or future cycles. As a result of this exploration, we identify a few promising designs that perform better than prior work. Our findings suggest that even the best design targeting dual sparsity yields a 20%-30% drop in power efficiency when performing on single sparse models, i.e., those with only sparse weight or sparse activation tensors. We found that one can reuse resources of the same core to maintain high performance and efficiency when running single sparsity or dense models. We call this hybrid architecture Griffin. Griffin is 1.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 1.4x more power-efficient than state-of-the-art sparse architectures, for dense, weight-only sparse, activation-only sparse, and dual sparse models, respectively.
