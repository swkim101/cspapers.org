Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) superconducting technology provides significant power and performance benefits in the era of diminishing CMOS scaling. Recent advances in design tools and fabrication facilities have brought SFQ based computing to the forefront. One challenge faced by SFQ technology is to have a compact and robust on-chip memory, which can be used for implementing register files and cache memory. While dense memories are being investigated through the development of three-terminal devices such as Nanocryotrons, in this work, we build on a novel memory cell built using traditional Josephson junctions (JJs). In particular, we design a high capacity register file, called HiPerRF, that builds on a High Capacity Destructive ReadOut (HC-DRO) cell in SFQ technology. HC-DRO design can store up to three fluxon pulses, thereby providing the equivalent of 2-bit storage in a single cell. However, these cells provide only destructive readout capability, namely each value can be read only once. However, CPU register file contents are read multiple times in any program, and hence a destructive readout complicates register file design. HiPerRF provides the non-destructive property using a loopback write mechanism, thereby preserving the higher density of HC-DRO cells without compromising the multi-read demands of a register file. HiPerRF reduces the JJ count of the register file design, after accounting for all the peripheral access circuitry costs, by 56.1% and reduces the static power by 46.2%. Furthermore, HiPerRF reduces the JJ count by 16.3% even when considering an entire in-order RISC-V CPU core.
