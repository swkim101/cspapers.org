Despite all the efforts and considerable improvements in the infrastructure and policies, urban air pollution still remains a major concern all over the world. One way to lower the personal exposure to air pollutants is to choose a health-optimal route to the destination. Current navigation systems include shortest path or paths with low traffic and least expensive [1] (fuel costs, tolls) paths. The availability of fine grained air quality data enables a wide range of application frameworks. In this work, we demonstrate a route recommendation system which considers environmental factors like PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) concentration to compute shortest health-optimal path to the destination. The proposed system has two major components. One is the CAR (Cleanest Air Routing) algorithm and the other is an application for route visualization on a map. The CAR algorithm provides path navigation with minimal PM2.5 exposure on the move. The PM2.5 values for various road intersections are used as the cost function to find the best route from the origin to the destination. In order to efficiently use the PM2.5 data, it is first spatially and temporally interpolated on the study area i.e. Taiwan. The model is then implemented for real-world travel scenarios with transport modes like driving, cycling, riding a motorbike and walking. Also, a visualization on the map is also provided where a user can easily differentiate between the shortest path and the health-optimal path. We found that by considering the shortest health-optimal path, the users could reduce the overall exposure to PM2.5. For some of the test cases there is a slight increase in the path length and the journey time but our main objective of reducing the PM2.5 exposure is achieved in most of the cases. In some cases, the shortest route is also the least PM2.5 exposure route. In those scenarios, our algorithmâ€™s performance is similar to Google Maps 1. Figure 1-(A) shows the current interface of the application for finding the health-optimal path to the destination. We have performed extensive experiments which show the comparison between
