Multi-carrier cellular access dynamically selects a preferred wireless carrier by leveraging the availability and diversity of multiple carrier networks at a location. It offers an alternative to the dominant single-carrier paradigm, and shows early signs of success through the operational Project Fi by Google. In this paper, we study the important, yet largely unexplored, problem of inter-carrier switching for multi-carrier access. We show that policy conflicts can arise between inter- and intra-carrier switching, resulting in oscillations among carriers in the worst case akin to BGP looping. We derive the conditions under which such oscillations occur for three categories of popular policy, and validate them with Project Fi whenever possible. We provide practical guidelines to ensure loop-freedom and assess them via trace-driven emulations.
