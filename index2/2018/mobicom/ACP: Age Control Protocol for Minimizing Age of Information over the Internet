Real-time monitoring is characterized by a source repeatedly sending updates over the Internet to a monitor, which desires the sensed information at it to be as fresh (of small age) as possible, given network constraints. We propose the Age Control Protocol (ACP), which, in a network-transparent manner, enables a source to keep the age at the monitor small. We evaluate it using simulations and real-world experiments.
