A novel Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) system based on a distributed network of implantable wireless sensors was proposed. Small CMOS "Neurograin" chips (0.5x0.5 mm2) with on-chip antenna are designed to harvest near-field RF energy at ~1 GHz, and backscatter 10 Mbps BPSK modulated data asynchronously and periodically. A "Skinpatch" software-defined radio (SDR) receiver is realized on a commercial USRP running GNU Radio programs. It down-converts the reflected waves from the Neurograins and performs data recovery. In this BMI prototype demonstration, 32 Neurograins will be wirelessly powered, while a Skinpatch USRP will recover their backscattered packets in real-time.
