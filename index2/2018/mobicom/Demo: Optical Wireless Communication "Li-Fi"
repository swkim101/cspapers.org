The Single Chip micro Mote, SCµM, is designed for building small footprint micro robots. The localization and inter-individual communication are prerequisites for swarm robots to achieve collaboration. SCµM features a 2.4 GHz wireless transceiver, which relies on its internal oscillator circuit, without an external crystal. The chip is embedded with an optical receiver, and supports optical programming functionality. Meanwhile, the optical receiver can detect infrared light, enabling low-power localization of the SCµM with the assistance of a lighthouse positioning base station. For the communication, the inaccurate internal oscillator of SCµM requires calibration before communicating with other commercial off-the-shelf wireless products, such as a Bluetooth device. Clock calibration and localization for SCµM were two separated topics in the previous studies. In this paper, our preliminary work achieves both with the lighthouse base stations. By utilizing the two different functions of infrared light emitted by the base station, we can calibrate the oscillator and the position information at the same time.
