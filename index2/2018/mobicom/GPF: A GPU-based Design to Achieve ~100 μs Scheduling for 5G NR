5G New Radio (NR) is designed to operate under a broad range of frequency bands and support new applications with ultra-low latency. To support its diverse operating conditions, a set of different OFDM numerologies has been defined in the standards body. Under this numerology, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of ∼100 μs. This requirement poses a new challenge that does not exist in LTE and cannot be supported by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF -- a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler that can meet the ∼100 μs time requirement. The key ideas include decomposing the scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF on an off-the-shelf Nvidia Quadro P6000 GPU, we show that GPF is able to achieve near-optimal performance while meeting the ∼100 $\mathrmμs time requirement. GPF represents the first successful design of a GPU-based PF scheduler that can meet the new time requirement in NR.
