The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications brings about the increasingly dense deployments of various wireless devices (e.g., Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, etc.). The coexistence of heterogeneous wireless devices puts forward more stringent requirements for the adaptability and flexibility of the backscatter design [1]. In order to integrate seamlessly into heterogeneous wireless networks, the backscatter radio should be able to interplay directly with different technologies while maintaining ultra-low power consumption [2].
