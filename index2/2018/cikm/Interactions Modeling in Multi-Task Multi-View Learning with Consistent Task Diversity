Multi-task Multi-view (MTMV) learning has recently undergone noticeable development for dealing with heterogeneous data. To exploit information from both related tasks and related views, a common strategy is to model task relatedness and view consistency separately. The drawback of this strategy is that it did not consider the interactions between tasks and views. To remedy this, we propose a novel method, racBFA, by adding rank constraints to asymmetric bilinear factor analyzers (aBFA). We then adapt racBFA to our MTMV learning problem and design a new MTMV learning algorithm, racMTMV. We evaluated racMTMV on 3 real-world data sets. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.
