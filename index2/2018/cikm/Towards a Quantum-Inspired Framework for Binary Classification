Machine Learning models learn the relationship between input and output by examples and then apply the learned models to relate unseen input. Although ML has successfully been used in almost every field, there is always room for improvement. To this end, researchers have recently been trying to implement Quantum Mechanics(QM) in ML, since it is believed that quantum-inspired ML can enhance learning rate and effectiveness. In this paper, we address a specific task of ML and present a binary classification model inspired by the quantum detection framework. We compared the model to the state of the art. Our experimental results suggest that the use of the quantum detection framework in binary classification can improve effectiveness for a number of topics of the RCV-1 test collection and that it may still provide ways to improve effectiveness for the other topics.
