Topic detection and tracking in document streams is a critical task in many important applications, hence has been attracting research interest in recent decades. With the large size of data streams, there have been a number of works from different approaches that propose automatic methods for the task. However, there is only a few small benchmark datasets that are publicly available for evaluating the proposed methods. The lack of large datasets with fine-grained groundtruth implicitly restrains the development of more advanced methods. In this work, we address this issue by collecting and publishing W2E - a large dataset consisting of news articles from more than 50 prominent mass media channels worldwide. The articles cover a large set of popular events within a full year. W2E is more than 15 times larger than TREC's TDT2 dataset, which is widely used in prior work. We further conduct exploratory analysis to examine the dynamics and diversity of W2E and propose potential uses of the dataset in other research.
