The problem of inferring unknown parameters of a networked social system is of considerable practical importance. We consider this problem for the independent cascade model using an active query framework. More specifically, given a network whose edge probabilities are unknown, the goal is to infer the probability value on each edge by querying the system. The optimization objective is to use as few queries as possible in carrying out the inference. We present approximation algorithms that provide provably good estimates of edge probabilities. We also present results from an experimental evaluation of our algorithms on several real-world networks.
