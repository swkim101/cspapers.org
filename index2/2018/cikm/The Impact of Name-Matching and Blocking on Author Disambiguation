In this work, we address the problem of blocking in the context of author name disambiguation. We describe a framework that formalizes different ways of name-matching to determine which names could potentially refer to the same author. We focus on name variations that follow from specifying a name with different completeness (i.e. full first name or only initial). We extend this framework by a simple way to define traditional, new and custom blocking schemes. Then, we evaluate different old and new schemes in the Web of Science. In this context we define and compare a new type of blocking schemes. Based on these results, we discuss the question whether name-matching can be used in blocking evaluation as a replacement of annotated author identifiers. Finally, we argue that blocking can have a strong impact on the application and evaluation of author disambiguation.
