A growing number of domains (finance, seismology, internet-of-things, etc.) collect massive time series. When the number of series grow to the hundreds of millions or even billions, similarity queries become intractable on a single machine. Further, naive (quadratic) parallelization won't work well. So, we need both efficient indexing and parallelization. We propose a demonstration of Spark-parSketch, a complete solution based on sketches / random projections to efficiently perform both the parallel indexing of large sets of time series and a similarity search on them. Because our method is approximate, we explore the tradeoff between time and precision. A video showing the dynamics of the demonstration can be found by the link http://parsketch.gforge.inria.fr/video/parSketchdemo_720p.mov.
