We consider a scenario that occurs often in the auto insurance industry. We are given a large collection of trajectories that stem from many different drivers. Only a small number of the trajectories are labeled with driver identifiers, and only some drivers are used in labels. The problem is to label correctly the unlabeled trajectories with driver identifiers. This is important in auto insurance to detect possible fraud and to identify the driver in, e.g., pay-as-you-drive settings when a vehicle has been involved in an incident. To solve the problem, we first propose a Trajectory-to-Image( T2I) encoding scheme that captures both geographic features and driving behavior features of trajectories in 3D images. Next, we propose a multi-task, deep learning model called T2INet for estimating the total number of drivers in the unlabeled trajectories, and then we partition the unlabeled trajectories into groups so that the trajectories in a group belong to the same driver. Experimental results on a large trajectory data set offer insight into the design properties of T2INet and demonstrate that T2INet is capable of outperforming baselines and the state-of-the-art method.
