Given a large number of low-level heterogeneous categorical alerts from an anomaly detection system, how to characterize complex relationships between different alerts, filter out false positives, and deliver trustworthy rankings and suggestions to end users? This problem is motivated by and generalized from applications in enterprise security and attack scenario reconstruction. While existing techniques focus on either reconstructing abnormal scenarios or filtering out false positive alerts, it can be more advantageous to consider the two perspectives simultaneously in order to improve detection accuracy and better understand anomaly behaviors. In this paper, we propose CAR, a collaborative alerts ranking framework that exploits both temporal and content correlations from heterogeneous categorical alerts. CAR first builds a tree-based model to capture both short-term correlations and long-term dependencies in each alert sequence, which identifies abnormal action sequences. Then, an embedding-based model is employed to learn the content correlations between alerts via their heterogeneous categorical attributes. Finally, by incorporating both temporal and content dependencies into one optimization framework, CAR ranks both alerts and their corresponding alert patterns. Our experiments, using real-world enterprise monitoring data and real attacks launched by professional hackers, show that CAR can accurately identify true positive alerts and successfully reconstruct attack scenarios at the same time.
