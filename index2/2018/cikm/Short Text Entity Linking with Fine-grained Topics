A wide range of web corpora are in the form of short text, such as QA queries, search queries and news titles. Entity linking for these short texts is quite important. Most of supervised approaches are not effective for short text entity linking. The training data for supervised approaches are not suitable for short text and insufficient for low-resourced languages. Previous unsupervised methods are incapable of handling the sparsity and noisy problem of short text. We try to solve the problem by mapping the sparse short text to a topic space. We notice that the concepts of entities have rich topic information and characterize entities in a very fine-grained granularity. Hence, we use the concepts of entities as topics to explicitly represent the context, which helps improve the performance of entity linking for short text. We leverage our linking approach to segment the short text semantically, and build a system for short entity text recognition and linking. Our entity linking approach exhibits the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets for the realistic short text entity linking problem.
