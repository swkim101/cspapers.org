Industrial telecommunication applications prefer to run at the optimal capacity configuration to achieve the required Quality of Service (QoS) at the minimum cost. The optimal capacity configuration is usually achieved through the selection of cell towers capacities and locations. Given a set of service providers (e.g., cell towers) and a set of customers (e.g., major residential areas), where each customer has an amount of demand and each provider has multiple candidate capacities and corresponding costs, the optimal capacity selection is configured through spatial matching to satisfy the demand of each customer at the minimum cost. However, existing solutions developed for spatial matching, in which each provider's capacity is fixed, cannot be directly applied to the capacity configuration problem with multiple capacities and location selections. In this paper, we are the first to study Service Provider Configuration and Planning with Optimal Spatial Matching (SPC-POSM) problem, in which the objectives are 1) to select the proper capacity for each provider at the minimum total cost and 2) to assign providers' service to satisfy the demand of each customer on a condition that the matching distance is no more than service quality requirement. We prove that SPC-POSM problem is NP-hard and design an efficient two-layer meta-heuristic framework to solve the problem. Unsupervised learning technique is designed to accelerate the calculation and a novel local search mechanism is embedded to further improve solution quality. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.
