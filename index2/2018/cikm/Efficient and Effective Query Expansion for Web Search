Query Expansion (QE) techniques expand the user queries with additional terms, e.g., synonyms and acronyms, to enhance the system recall. State-of-the-art solutions employ machine learning methods to select the most suitable terms. However, most of them neglect the cost of processing the expanded queries, thus selecting effective, yet very expensive, terms. The goal of this paper is to enable QE in scenarios with tight time constraints proposing a QE framework based on structured queries and efficiency-aware term selection strategies. In particular, the proposed expansion selection strategies aim at capturing the efficiency and the effectiveness of the expansion candidates, as well as the dependencies among them. We evaluate our proposals by conducting an extensive experimental assessment on real-world search engine data and public TREC data. Results confirm that our approach leads to a remarkable efficiency improvement w.r.t. the state-of-the-art: a reduction of the retrieval time up to 30 times, with only a small loss of effectiveness.
