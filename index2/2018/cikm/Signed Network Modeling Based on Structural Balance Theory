The modeling of networks, specifically generative models, has been shown to provide a plethora of information about the underlying network structures, as well as many other benefits behind their construction. There has been a considerable increase in interest for the better understanding and modeling of networks, and the vast majority of existing work has been for unsigned networks. However, many networks can have positive and negative links (or signed networks), especially in online social media. It is evident from recent work that signed networks present unique properties and principles from unsigned networks due to the added complexity, which pose tremendous challenges on existing unsigned network models. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the problem of modeling signed networks. In particular, we provide a principled approach to capture important properties and principles of signed networks and propose a novel signed network model guided by Structural Balance Theory. Empirical experiments on three real-world signed networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
