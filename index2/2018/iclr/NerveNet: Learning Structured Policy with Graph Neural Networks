We address the problem of learning structured policies for continuous control. In traditional reinforcement learning, policies of agents are learned by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) which take the concatenation of all observations from the environment as input for predicting actions. In this work, we propose NerveNet to explicitly model the structure of an agent, which naturally takes the form of a graph. Speciﬁcally, serving as the agent’s policy network, NerveNet ﬁrst propagates information over the structure of the agent and then predict actions for different parts of the agent. In the experiments, we ﬁrst show that our NerveNet is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on standard MuJoCo environments. We further propose our customized reinforcement learning environments for benchmarking two types of structure transfer learning tasks, i.e., size and disability transfer , as well as multi-task learning . We demonstrate that policies learned by NerveNet are signiﬁcantly more transferable and generalizable than policies learned by other models and are able to transfer even in a zero-shot setting.
