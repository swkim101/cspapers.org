In this paper, we propose a dynamic analysis technique that diagnoses various kinds of deadlocks of embedded devices by OS-level analysis. Especially, we focus on minimizing performance overhead while inspecting deadlocks, because embedded applications run with limited system resources. Our experimental results show that our scheme detects all deadlocks which are induced in our test cases and incurs reasonable performance overhead (up to 16%), compared with the conventional scheme.
