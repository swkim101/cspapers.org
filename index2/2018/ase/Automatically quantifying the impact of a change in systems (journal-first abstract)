Software maintenance is becoming more challenging with the increased complexity of the software and the frequently applied changes. Performing impact analysis before the actual implementation of a change is a crucial task during system maintenance. While many tools and techniques are available to measure the impact of a change at the code level, only a few research work is done to measure the impact of a change at an earlier stage in the development process. This work introduces an approach to measure the impact of a change at the model level.
