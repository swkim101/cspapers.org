Android applications (apps) represent an ever increasing portion of the software market. Automated test input generators are the state of the art for testing and security analysis. We introduceDroidMate-2 (DM-2), a platform to easily assist both developers and researchers to customize, develop and test new test generators. DM-2 can be used without app instrumentation or operating system modifications, as a test generator on real devices and emulators for app testing or regression testing. Additionally, it provides sensitive resource monitoring or blocking capabilities through a lightweight app instrumentation, out-of-the-box statement coverage measurement through a fully-fledged app instrumentation and native experiment reproducibility. In our experiments we compared DM-2 against Droid-Bot, a state-of-the-art test generator by measuring statement coverage. Our results show that DM-2 reached 96% of its peak coverage in less than 2/3 of the time needed by Droid-Bot, allowing for better and more efficient tests. On short runs (5 minutes) DM-2 outperformed Droid-Bot by 7% while in longer runs (1 hour) this difference increases to 8%. ACM DL Artifact: https://www.doi.org/10.1145/3264864.
