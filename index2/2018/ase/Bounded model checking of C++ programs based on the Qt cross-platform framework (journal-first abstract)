This work proposes an abstraction of the Qt framework, named as Qt Operational Model (QtOM), which is integrated into two different verification approaches: explicit-state model checking and symbolic (bounded) model checking. The proposed methodology is the first one to formally verify Qt-based applications, which has the potential to devise new directions for software verification of portable code.
