Automatic evaluation systems in the field of automatic summarization have been relying on the availability of gold standard summaries for over ten years. Gold standard summaries are expensive to obtain and often require the availability of domain experts to achieve high quality. In this paper, we propose an alternative evaluation approach based on pairwise preferences of sentences. In comparison to gold standard summaries, they are simpler and cheaper to obtain. In our experiments, we show that humans are able to provide useful feedback in the form of pairwise preferences. The new framework performs better than the three most popular versions of ROUGE with less expensive human input. We also show that our framework can reuse already available evaluation data and achieve even better results.
