Under such circumstances, it is essential to identify the importance of different categories and thus assign different misclassification losses in many applications, such as medical diagnosis, saliency detection and software defect prediction. However, we note that it is infeasible to determine the accurate cost value without great domain knowledge. In most common cases, we may just have the information that which category is more important than the other categories, i.e., the identification of defect-prone softwares is more important than that of defect-free. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a hypergraph learning method with cost interval optimization, which is able to handle cost interval when data is formulated using the high-order relationships. In this way, data correlations are modeled by a hypergraph structure, which has the merit to exploit the underlying relationships behind the data. With a cost-sensitive hypergraph structure, in order to improve the performance of the classifier without precise cost value, we further introduce cost interval optimization to hypergraph learning. In this process, the optimization on cost interval achieves better performance instead of choosing uncertain fixed cost in the learning process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments on two groups of dataset, i.e., the NASA Metrics Data Program (NASA) dataset and UCI Machine Learning Repository (UCI) dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have exhibited better performance of our proposed method.
