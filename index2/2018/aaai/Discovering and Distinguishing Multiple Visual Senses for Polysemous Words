One issue that limits their performance is the problem of polysemy. To solve this problem, in this work, we present a novel framework that solves the problem of polysemy by allowing sense-specific diversity in search results. Specifically, we first discover a list of possible semantic senses to retrieve sense-specific images. Then we merge visual similar semantic senses and prune noises by using the retrieved images. Finally, we train a visual classifier for each selected semantic sense and use the learned sense-specific classifiers to distinguish multiple visual senses. Extensive experiments on classifying images into sense-specific categories and re-ranking search results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.
