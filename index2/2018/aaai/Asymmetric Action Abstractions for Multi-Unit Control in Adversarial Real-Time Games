Optimal strategies derived from un-abstracted spaces are guaranteed to be no worse than optimal strategies derived from action-abstracted spaces. In practice, however, due to real-time constraints and the state space size, one is only able to derive good strategies in un-abstracted spaces in small-scale games. In this paper we introduce search algorithms that use an action abstraction scheme we call asymmetric abstraction. Asymmetric abstractions retain the un-abstracted spaces' theoretical advantage over regularly abstracted spaces while still allowing the search algorithms to derive effective strategies, even in large-scale games. Empirical results on combat scenarios that arise in a real-time strategy game show that our search algorithms are able to substantially outperform state-of-the-art approaches.
