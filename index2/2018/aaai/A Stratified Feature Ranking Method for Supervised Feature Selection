In this paper, we propose a Stratified Feature Ranking (SFR) method for supervised feature selection. In the new method, a Subspace Feature Clustering (SFC) is proposed to identify feature clusters, and a stratified feature ranking method is proposed to rank the features such that the high rank features are lowly correlated. Experimental results show the superiority of SFR.
