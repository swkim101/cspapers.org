 
 Quantum Theory (QT) has been applied in a number of fields outside physics, e.g. Information Retrieval (IR). A series of pioneering works have verified the necessity to employ QT in IR user models. In this paper, we explore the process of relevance judgement from a novel perspective of the two state vector quantum weak measurement (WM) by considering context information in time domain. Experiments are carried out to verify our arguments.
