A surprising result is the undecidability of satisfiability for SPARQL 1.1 patterns when only AND and MINUS are expressible. Also, it is shown that any fragment of SPARQL 1.1 without expressing both AND and MINUS is decidable. These results provide a guideline for future SPARQL query language design and implementation.
