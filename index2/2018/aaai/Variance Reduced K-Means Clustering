One of the reasons is that k-means needs to scan a batch of training data to update the cluster centers at every iteration, which is time-consuming. In the paper, we propose a variance reduced k-mean VRKM, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method, and obtain 4Ã— speedup for large-scale clustering.
