In this paper, we focus on compressing and accelerating deep models with network weights represented by very small numbers of bits, referred to as extremely low bit neural network. We model this problem as a discretely constrained optimization problem. Borrowing the idea from Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we decouple the continuous parameters from the discrete constraints of network, and cast the original hard problem into several subproblems. We propose to solve these subproblems using extragradient and iterative quantization algorithms that lead to considerably faster convergency compared to conventional optimization methods. Extensive experiments on image recognition and object detection verify that the proposed algorithm is more effective than state-of-the-art approaches when coming to extremely low bit neural network.
