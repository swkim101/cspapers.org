In recent years, extensive research has been completed to develop reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to play various Atari 2600 games, resulting in new applications of algorithms such as Deep Q-Learning or Policy Gradient that outperform humans. However, games from Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) are far more complicated than Atari 2600 games as many of these state-of-the-art algorithms still struggle to perform on this platform. In this paper, we present a new platform to research algorithms on SNES games and investigate NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) as a possible approach to develop algorithms that outperform humans in SNES games.
