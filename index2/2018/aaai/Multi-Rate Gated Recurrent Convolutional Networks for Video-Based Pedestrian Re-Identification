We employ a convolutional network to extract the appearance and motion features from raw video sequences, and then feed them into a multi-rate recurrent network to exploit the temporal correlations, and more importantly, to take into account the fact that pedestrians, sometimes even the same pedestrian, move in different speeds across different camera views. The combined network is trained in an end-to-end fashion, and we further propose an initialization strategy via context reconstruction to largely improve the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the iLIDS-VID and PRID-2011 datasets, and our experimental results confirm the effectiveness and the generalization ability of our model.
