Recent years, end-to-end SRL with recurrent neural networks (RNN) has gained increasing attention. However, it remains a major challenge for RNNs to handle structural information and long range dependencies. In this paper, we present a simple and effective architecture for SRL which aims to address these problems. Our model is based on self-attention which can directly capture the relationships between two tokens regardless of their distance. Our single model achieves F1=83.4 on the CoNLL-2005 shared task dataset and F1=82.7 on the CoNLL-2012 shared task dataset, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results by 1.8 and 1.0 F1 score respectively. Besides, our model is computationally efficient, and the parsing speed is 50K tokens per second on a single Titan X GPU.
