Highly-configurable systems encompass thousands of interdependent configuration options, which require a non-trivial configuration process. Decision propagation enables a backtracking-free configuration process by computing values implied by user decisions. However, employing decision propagation for large-scale systems is a time-consuming task and, thus, can be a bottleneck in interactive configuration processes and analyses alike. We propose modal implication graphs to improve the performance of decision propagation by precomputing intermediate values used in the process. Our evaluation results show a significant improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms for 120 real-world systems.
