We present AlloyInEcore, a tool for specifying metamodels with their static semantics to facilitate automated, formal reasoning on models. Software development projects require that software systems be specified in various models (e.g., requirements models, architecture models, test models, and source code). It is crucial to reason about those models to ensure the correct and complete system specifications. AlloyInEcore~allows the user to specify metamodels with their static semantics, while, using the semantics, it automatically detects inconsistent models, and completes partial models. It has been evaluated on three industrial case studies in the automotive domain (https://modelwriter.github.io/AlloyInEcore/).
