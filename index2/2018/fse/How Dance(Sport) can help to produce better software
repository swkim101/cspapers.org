Dancing and dancesport have a long tradition of instructions and development. Furthermore, there are many aspects of them that resemble the software development process. This work analyses their features with the intent to explore what of them is already applied in software development and what could be borrowed and applied in the future. Additionally, an investigation of the associated brain activities could be performed to gather a deeper understanding of analogies and differences.
