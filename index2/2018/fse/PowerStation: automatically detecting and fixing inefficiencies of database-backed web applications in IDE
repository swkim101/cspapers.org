Modern web applications are built using a myriad of software components, and each of them exposes different programming models (e.g., application logic expressed in an imperative language, database queries expressed using declarative SQL). To improve programmer productivity, Object Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks have been developed to allow developers build web applications in an object-oriented manner. Despite such frameworks, prior work has found that developers still struggle in developing performant ORM-based web applications. This paper presents PowerStation, a RubyMine IDE plugin for optimizing web applications developed using the Ruby on Rails ORM. Using automated static analysis, PowerStation detects ORM-related inefficiency problems and suggests fixes to developers. Our evaluation using 12 real-world applications shows that PowerStation can automatically detects 1221 performance issues across them.
