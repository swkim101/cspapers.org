Repairing broken web element locators represents the major main- tenance cost of web test cases. To detect possible repairs, testers typically inspect the testsâ€™ interactions with the application under test through the GUI. Existing automated test repair techniques focus instead on the code and ignore visual aspects of the applica- tion. In this demo paper, we give an overview of Vista, a novel test repair technique that leverages computer vision and local crawling to automatically suggest and apply repairs to broken web tests.
