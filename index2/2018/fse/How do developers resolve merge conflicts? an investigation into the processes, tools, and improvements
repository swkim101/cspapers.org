Most software development is done in teams. When more than one developer is modifying the source code, there is a change that their changes will conflict. When this happens, developers have to interrupt their workflow in order to resolve the merge conflict. This interruption can lead to frustration and lost productivity. This makes collaboration, and the problems associated with it, an important aspect of software development. Merge conflicts are some of the more difficult issues that arise when working in a team. We plan to bring in more information about the strategies developers use when resolving merge conflicts. We will gather information through in-situ observations and interviews of developers resolving conflicts when working on real development tasks, combined with analytical methods. The information obtained can then be used to improve the existing tools and make it easier for developers when working in a collaborative environment.
