Developers report testing their regular expressions less than the rest of their code. In this work, we explore how thoroughly tested regular expressions are by examining open source projects. Using standard metrics of coverage, such as line and branch coverage, gives an incomplete picture of the test coverage of regular expressions. We adopt graph-based coverage metrics for the DFA representation of regular expressions, providing fine-grained test coverage metrics. Using over 15,000 tested regular expressions in 1,225 Java projects on GitHub, we measure node, edge, and edge-pair coverage. Our results show that only 17% of the regular expressions in the repositories are tested at all. For those that are tested, the median number of test inputs is two. For nearly 42% of the tested regular expressions, only one test input is used. Average node and edge coverage levels on the DFAs for tested regular expressions are 59% and 29%, respectively. Due to the lack of testing of regular expressions, we explore whether a string generation tool for regular expressions, Rex, achieves high coverage levels. With some exceptions, we found that tools such as Rex can be used to write test inputs with similar coverage to the developer tests.
