The Ethereum ecosystem has created a prosperity of smart contract applications in public blockchains, with transparent, traceable and programmable transactions. However, the flexibility that everybody can write and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum causes a large collection of similar contracts, i.e., clones. In practice, smart contract clones may amplify severe threats like security attacks, resource waste etc. In this paper, we have developed EClone, a semantic clone detector for Ethereum. The key insight of our clone detection is Symbolic Transaction Sketch, i.e., a set of critical semantic properties generated from symbolic transaction. Sketches of two smart contracts will be normalized into numeric vectors with a same length. Then, the clone detection problem is modeled as a similarity computation process where sketches and other syntactic information are combined. We have applied EClone in identifying semantic clones of deployed Ethereum smart contracts and achieved an accuracy of 93.27%. A demo video of EClone is at https://youtu.be/IRasOVv6vyc.
