The Sense of Agency (SoA) refers to our capability to control our own actions and influence the world around us. Recent research in HCI has been investigating SoA to provide users an instinctive sense of "I did that" as opposed to "the system did that". However, current agency measurements are limited. The Intentional Binding (IB) paradigm provides an implicit measure of the SoA, however, it is constrained by requiring high visual attention to a "Libet clock" on-screen. In this paper, we extended the timing stimuli through auditory and tactile cues. Our results demonstrate that audio timing through voice commands and haptic timing through tactile cues on the hand, are an effective alternative measure of the SoA using the IB paradigm. They both address current limitations of the traditional method such as visual attention overload and lack of engagement. We discuss how our results can be applied to measure SoA in tasks involving different interactive scenarios such as in Mixed/Virtual Reality.
