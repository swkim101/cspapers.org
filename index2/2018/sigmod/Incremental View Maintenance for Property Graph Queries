Graph processing challenges are common in modern database systems, with the property graph data model gaining widespread adoption. Due to the novelty of the field, graph databases and frameworks typically provide their own query language, such as Cypher for Neo4j, Gremlin for TinkerPop and GraphScript for SAP HANA. These languages often lack a formal background for their data model and semantics. To address this, the openCypher initiative aims to standardise a subset of the Cypher language, for which it currently provides grammar specification and a set of acceptance tests to allow vendors to implement their openCypher compatible engine.
