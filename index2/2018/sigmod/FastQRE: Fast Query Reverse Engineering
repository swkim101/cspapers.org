We study the problem of Query Reverse Engineering (QRE), where given a database and an output table, the task is to find a simple project-join SQL query that generates that table when applied on the database. This problem is known for its efficiency challenge due to mainly two reasons. First, the problem has a very large search space and its various variants are known to be NP-hard. Second, executing even a single candidate SQL query can be very computationally expensive. In this work we propose a novel approach for solving the QRE problem efficiently. Our solution outperforms the existing state of the art by 2-3 orders of magnitude for complex queries, resolving those queries in seconds rather than days, thus making our approach more practical in real-life settings.
