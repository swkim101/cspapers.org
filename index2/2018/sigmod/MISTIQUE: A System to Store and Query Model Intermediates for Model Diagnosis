Model diagnosis is the process of analyzing machine learning (ML) model performance to identify where the model works well and where it doesn't. It is a key part of the modeling process and helps ML developers iteratively improve model accuracy. Often, model diagnosis is performed by analyzing different datasets or intermediates associated with the model such as the input data and hidden representations learned by the model (e.g., [4, 24, 39,]). The bottleneck in fast model diagnosis is the creation and storage of model intermediates. Storing these intermediates requires tens to hundreds of GB of storage whereas re-running the model for each diagnostic query slows down model diagnosis. To address this bottleneck, we propose a system called MISTIQUE that can work with traditional ML pipelines as well as deep neural networks to efficiently capture, store, and query model intermediates for diagnosis. For each diagnostic query, MISTIQUE intelligently chooses whether to re-run the model or read a previously stored intermediate. For intermediates that are stored in MISTIQUE, we propose a range of optimizations to reduce storage footprint including quantization, summarization, and data de-duplication. We evaluate our techniques on a range of real-world ML models in scikit-learn and Tensorflow. We demonstrate that our optimizations reduce storage by up to 110X for traditional ML pipelines and up to 6X for deep neural networks. Furthermore, by using MISTIQUE, we can speed up diagnostic queries on traditional ML pipelines by up to 390X and 210X on deep neural networks.
