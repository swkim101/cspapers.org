In recent data management ecosystem, one of the greatest challenges is the data variety. Data varies in multiple formats such as relational and (semi-)structured data. Traditional database handles a single type of data format and thus its ability to deal with different types of data formats is limited. To overcome such limitation, we propose a multi-model processing framework for relational and semi-structured data (i.e. XML), and design a worst-case optimal join algorithm. The salient feature of our algorithm is that it can guarantee that the intermediate results are no larger than the worst-case join results. Preliminary results show that our multi-model algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline join methods in terms of running time and intermediate result size.
