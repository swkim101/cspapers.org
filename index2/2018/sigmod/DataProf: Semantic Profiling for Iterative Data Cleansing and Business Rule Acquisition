We showcase the first semantic data profiler, DataProf. For the constraint class of interest, current profilers compute all constraints that hold on the given data set. DataProf also computes perfect sample records that together satisfy the same constraints as the given data set. Such perfect samples make it easier to spot violations of business rules, which experts can cleanse. This novel iterative process of discovery and sampling facilitates the interaction of experts with the data, and provides the key to improving data quality and business rule acquisition. The demonstration will exemplify the process on a real-world data set and the novel class of embedded uniqueness constraints. The audience will experience how DataProf guides them in cleansing data and discovering business rules.
