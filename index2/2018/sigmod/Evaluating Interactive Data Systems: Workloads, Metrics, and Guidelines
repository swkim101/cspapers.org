Highly interactive query interfaces have become a popular tool for ad-hoc data analysis and exploration, posing a new kind of workload to the underlying data infrastructure. Compared with traditional systems that are optimized for throughput or batched performance, ad-hoc and interactive data exploration systems focus more on user-centric interactivity, which raises a new class of performance challenges. Further, with the advent of new interaction devices~(e.g., touch, gesture) and different query interface paradigms~(e.g., sliders), maintaining interactive performance becomes even more challenging. Thus, when building interactive data systems, there is a clear need to articulate the design space. In this tutorial, we will describe unique characteristics of interactive workloads for a variety of user input devices and query interfaces. We will catalog popular metrics based on an extensive survey of current literature. Through two case studies, we will not only walk through previously defined metrics using real-world user traces but also highlight where these defined metrics are inadequate. Further, we will introduce some new metrics that are required to capture a complete picture of interactivity. In each case study, we also demonstrate how the behavior analyses on users' trace and performance experiments can provide guidelines to help researchers and developers design better interactive data systems.
