In recent years, many tracking algorithms achieve impressive performance via fusing multiple types of features, however, most of them fail to fully explore the context among the adopted multiple features and the strength of them. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-cue analysis framework for robust visual tracking. By combining different types of features, our approach constructs multiple experts through Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) and each of them tracks the target independently. With the proposed robustness evaluation strategy, the suitable expert is selected for tracking in each frame. Furthermore, the divergence of multiple experts reveals the reliability of the current tracking, which is quantified to update the experts adaptively to keep them from corruption. Through the proposed multi-cue analysis, our tracker with standard DCF and deep features achieves outstanding results on several challenging benchmarks: OTB-2013, OTB-2015, Temple-Color and VOT 2016. On the other hand, when evaluated with only simple hand-crafted features, our method demonstrates comparable performance amongst complex non-realtime trackers, but exhibits much better efficiency, with a speed of 45 FPS on a CPU.
