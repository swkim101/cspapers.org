We propose an end-to-end network for visual illustration of a sequence of sentences forming a story. At the core of our model is the ability to model the inter-related nature of the sentences within a story, as well as the ability to learn coherence to support reference resolution. The framework takes the form of an encoder-decoder architecture, where sentences are encoded using a hierarchical two-level sentence-story GRU, combined with an encoding of coherence, and sequentially decoded using a predicted feature representation into a consistent illustrative image sequence. We optimize all parameters of our network in an end-to-end fashion with respect to order embedding loss, encoding entailment between images and sentences. Experiments on the VIST storytelling dataset [9] highlight the importance of our algorithmic choices and efficacy of our overall model.
