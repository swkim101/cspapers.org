Research on learning suitable feature descriptors for Computer Vision has recently shifted to deep learning where the biggest challenge lies with the formulation of appropriate loss functions, especially since the descriptors to be learned are not known at training time. While approaches such as Siamese and triplet losses have been applied with success, it is still not well understood what makes a good loss function. In this spirit, this work demonstrates that many commonly used losses suffer from a range of problems. Based on this analysis, we introduce mixed-context losses and scale-aware sampling, two methods that when combined enable networks to learn consistently scaled descriptors for the first time.
