Videos captured by outdoor surveillance equipments sometimes contain unexpected rain streaks, which brings difficulty in subsequent video processing tasks. Rain streak removal from a video is thus an important topic in recent computer vision research. In this paper, we raise two intrinsic characteristics specifically possessed by rain streaks. Firstly, the rain streaks in a video contain repetitive local patterns sparsely scattered over different positions of the video. Secondly, the rain streaks are with multiscale configurations due to their occurrence on positions with different distances to the cameras. Based on such understanding, we specifically formulate both characteristics into a multiscale convolutional sparse coding (MS-CSC) model for the video rain streak removal task. Specifically, we use multiple convolutional filters convolved on the sparse feature maps to deliver the former characteristic, and further use multiscale filters to represent different scales of rain streaks. Such a new encoding manner makes the proposed method capable of properly extracting rain streaks from videos, thus getting fine video deraining effects. Experiments implemented on synthetic and real videos verify the superiority of the proposed method, as compared with the state-of-the-art ones along this research line, both visually and quantitatively.
