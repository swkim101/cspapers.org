As compared with traditional video retargeting, stereo video retargeting poses new challenges because stereo video contains the depth information of salient objects and its time dynamics. In this work, we propose a depth-aware stereo video retargeting method by imposing the depth fidelity constraint. The proposed depth-aware retargeting method reconstructs the 3D scene to obtain the depth information of salient objects. We cast it as a constrained optimization problem, where the total cost function includes the shape, temporal and depth distortions of salient objects. As a result, the solution can preserve the shape, temporal and depth fidelity of salient objects simultaneously. It is demonstrated by experimental results that the depth-aware retargeting method achieves higher retargeting quality and provides better user experience.
