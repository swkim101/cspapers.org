Facial action units (AUs) play an important role in human emotion understanding. One big challenge for data-driven AU recognition approaches is the lack of enough AU annotations, since AU annotation requires strong domain expertise. To alleviate this issue, we propose a knowledge-driven method for jointly learning multiple AU classifiers without any AU annotation by leveraging prior probabilities on AUs, including expression-independent and expression-dependent AU probabilities. These prior probabilities are drawn from facial anatomy and emotion studies, and are independent of datasets. We incorporate the prior probabilities on AUs as the constraints into the objective function of multiple AU classifiers, and develop an efficient learning algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Experimental results on five benchmark expression databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially its generalization ability, and the power of the prior probabilities.
