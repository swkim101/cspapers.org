The last decade has seen an astronomical shift from imaging with DSLR and point-and-shoot cameras to imaging with smartphone cameras. Due to the small aperture and sensor size, smartphone images have notably more noise than their DSLR counterparts. While denoising for smartphone images is an active research area, the research community currently lacks a denoising image dataset representative of real noisy images from smartphone cameras with high-quality ground truth. We address this issue in this paper with the following contributions. We propose a systematic procedure for estimating ground truth for noisy images that can be used to benchmark denoising performance for smartphone cameras. Using this procedure, we have captured a dataset - the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) - of ~30,000 noisy images from 10 scenes under different lighting conditions using five representative smartphone cameras and generated their ground truth images. We used this dataset to benchmark a number of denoising algorithms. We show that CNN-based methods perform better when trained on our high-quality dataset than when trained using alternative strategies, such as low-ISO images used as a proxy for ground truth data.
