There is growing interest in artificial intelligence to build socially intelligent robots. This requires machines to have the ability to "read" people's emotions, motivations, and other factors that affect behavior. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel dataset called MovieGraphs which provides detailed, graph-based annotations of social situations depicted in movie clips. Each graph consists of several types of nodes, to capture who is present in the clip, their emotional and physical attributes, their relationships (i.e., parent/child), and the interactions between them. Most interactions are associated with topics that provide additional details, and reasons that give motivations for actions. In addition, most interactions and many attributes are grounded in the video with time stamps. We provide a thorough analysis of our dataset, showing interesting common-sense correlations between different social aspects of scenes, as well as across scenes over time. We propose a method for querying videos and text with graphs, and show that: 1) our graphs contain rich and sufficient information to summarize and localize each scene; and 2) subgraphs allow us to describe situations at an abstract level and retrieve multiple semantically relevant situations. We also propose methods for interaction understanding via ordering, and reason understanding. MovieGraphs is the first benchmark to focus on inferred properties of human-centric situations, and opens up an exciting avenue towards socially-intelligent AI agents.
