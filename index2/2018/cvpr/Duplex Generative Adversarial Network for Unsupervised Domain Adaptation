Domain adaptation attempts to transfer the knowledge obtained from the source domain to the target domain, i.e., the domain where the testing data are. The main challenge lies in the distribution discrepancy between source and target domain. Most existing works endeavor to learn domain invariant representation usually by minimizing a distribution distance, e.g., MMD and the discriminator in the recently proposed generative adversarial network (GAN). Following the similar idea of GAN, this work proposes a novel GAN architecture with duplex adversarial discriminators (referred to as DupGAN), which can achieve domain-invariant representation and domain transformation. Specifically, our proposed network consists of three parts, an encoder, a generator and two discriminators. The encoder embeds samples from both domains into the latent representation, and the generator decodes the latent representation to both source and target domains respectively conditioned on a domain code, i.e., achieves domain transformation. The generator is pitted against duplex discriminators, one for source domain and the other for target, to ensure the reality of domain transformation, the latent representation domain invariant and the category information of it preserved as well. Our proposed work achieves the state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised domain adaptation of digit classification and object recognition.
