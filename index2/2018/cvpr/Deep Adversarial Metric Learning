Learning an effective distance metric between image pairs plays an important role in visual analysis, where the training procedure largely relies on hard negative samples. However, hard negatives in the training set usually account for the tiny minority, which may fail to fully describe the distribution of negative samples close to the margin. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial metric learning (DAML) framework to generate synthetic hard negatives from the observed negative samples, which is widely applicable to supervised deep metric learning methods. Different from existing metric learning approaches which simply ignore numerous easy negatives, the proposed DAML exploits them to generate potential hard negatives adversarial to the learned metric as complements. We simultaneously train the hard negative generator and feature embedding in an adversarial manner, so that more precise distance metrics can be learned with adequate and targeted synthetic hard negatives. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets including CUB-200-2011, Cars196 and Stanford Online Products show that DAML effectively boosts the performance of existing deep metric learning approaches through adversarial learning.
