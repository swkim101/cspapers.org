Text detection and recognition in natural images have long been considered as two separate tasks that are processed sequentially. Jointly training two tasks is non-trivial due to significant differences in learning difficulties and convergence rates. In this work, we present a conceptually simple yet efficient framework that simultaneously processes the two tasks in a united framework. Our main contributions are three-fold: (1) we propose a novel text-alignment layer that allows it to precisely compute convolutional features of a text instance in arbitrary orientation, which is the key to boost the performance; (2) a character attention mechanism is introduced by using character spatial information as explicit supervision, leading to large improvements in recognition; (3) two technologies, together with a new RNN branch for word recognition, are integrated seamlessly into a single model which is end-to-end trainable. This allows the two tasks to work collaboratively by sharing convolutional features, which is critical to identify challenging text instances. Our model obtains impressive results in end-to-end recognition on the ICDAR 2015 [19], significantly advancing the most recent results [2], with improvements of F-measure from (0.54, 0.51, 0.47) to (0.82, 0.77, 0.63), by using a strong, weak and generic lexicon respectively. Thanks to joint training, our method can also serve as a good detector by achieving a new state-of-the-art detection performance on related benchmarks.
