In this work we introduce a time- and memory-efficient method for structured prediction that couples neuron decisions across both space at time. We show that we are able to perform exact and efficient inference on a densely-connected spatio-temporal graph by capitalizing on recent advances on deep Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRFs). Our method, called VideoGCRF is (a) efficient, (b) has a unique global minimum, and (c) can be trained end-to-end alongside contemporary deep networks for video understanding. We experiment with multiple connectivity patterns in the temporal domain, and present empirical improvements over strong baselines on the tasks of both semantic and instance segmentation of videos. Our implementation is based on the Caffe2 framework and will be available at https://github.com/siddharthachandra/gcrf-v3.0.
