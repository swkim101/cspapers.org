Synthesized medical images have several important applications, e.g., as an intermedium in cross-modality image registration and as supplementary training samples to boost the generalization capability of a classifier. Especially, synthesized computed tomography (CT) data can provide X-ray attenuation map for radiation therapy planning. In this work, we propose a generic cross-modality synthesis approach with the following targets: 1) synthesizing realistic looking 3D images using unpaired training data, 2) ensuring consistent anatomical structures, which could be changed by geometric distortion in cross-modality synthesis and 3) improving volume segmentation by using synthetic data for modalities with limited training samples. We show that these goals can be achieved with an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) composed of mutually-beneficial generators and segmentors for image synthesis and segmentation tasks. The generators are trained with an adversarial loss, a cycle-consistency loss, and also a shape-consistency loss, which is supervised by segmentors, to reduce the geometric distortion. From the segmentation view, the segmentors are boosted by synthetic data from generators in an online manner. Generators and segmentors prompt each other alternatively in an end-to-end training fashion. With extensive experiments on a dataset including a total of 4,496 CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cardiovascular volumes, we show both tasks are beneficial to each other and coupling these two tasks results in better performance than solving them exclusively.
