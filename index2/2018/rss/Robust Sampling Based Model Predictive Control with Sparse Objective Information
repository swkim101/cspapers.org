—We present an algorithmic framework for stochastic model predictive control that is able to optimize non-linear systems with cost functions that have sparse, discontinuous gradient information. The proposed framework combines the beneﬁts of sampling-based model predictive control with linearization-based trajectory optimization methods. The resulting algorithm consists of a novel utilization of Tube-based model predictive control. We demonstrate robust algorithmic performance on a variety of simulated tasks
