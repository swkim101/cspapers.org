This article reports an adaptive sensor bias observer and attitude observer operating directly on SO ( 3 ) for true-north gyrocompass systems that utilize six-degree-of-freedom inertial measurement units (IMUs) with three-axis accelerometers and three-axis angular rate gyroscopes (without magnetometers). Most present-day low-cost robotic vehicles employ attitude estimation systems that employ microelectromechanical system (MEMS) magnetometers, angular rate gyros, and accelerometers to estimate magnetic attitude (roll, pitch, and magnetic heading) with limited heading accuracy. Present-day MEMS gyros are not sensitive enough to dynamically detect the Earth’s rotation, and thus cannot be used to estimate true-north geodetic heading. Relying on magnetic compasses can be problematic for vehicles that operate in environments with magnetic anomalies and those requiring high-accuracy navigation as the limited accuracy ( > 1 ° error) of magnetic compasses is typically the largest error source in underwater vehicle navigation systems. Moreover, magnetic compasses need to undergo time-consuming recalibration for hard-iron and soft-iron errors every time a vehicle is reconfigured with a new instrument or other payload, as very frequently occurs on oceanographic marine vehicles. In contrast, the gyrocompass system reported herein utilizes fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) IMU angular rate gyro and MEMS accelerometer measurements (without magnetometers) to dynamically estimate the instrument’s time-varying true-north attitude (roll, pitch, and geodetic heading) in real-time while the instrument is subject to a priori unknown rotations. This gyrocompass system is immune to magnetic anomalies and does not require recalibration every time a new payload is added to or removed from the vehicle. Stability proofs for the reported bias and attitude observers, preliminary simulations, and a full-scale vehicle trial are reported that suggest the viability of the true-north gyrocompass system to provide dynamic real-time true-north heading, pitch, and roll utilizing a comparatively low-cost FOG IMU.
