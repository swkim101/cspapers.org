In addition to the conventional PVT (Process, Voltage and Temperature) variation, time-dependent current fluctuation such as random telegraph noise (RTN) poses a new challenge on VLSI reliability. In this paper, we show that compared with the static random variation, RTN amplitude of a particular device is not constant across supply voltages and temperatures. A device may show large RTN amplitude at one operating condition and small amplitude at another operating condition. As a result, RTN amplitude distribution becomes uncorrelated across a wide range of voltage and temperature. The emergence of uncorrelated distribution causes significant degradation of worst-case values. Analysis results based on variability models from a 65 nm silicon-on-insulator process show that uncorrelated RTN degrades the worst-case threshold voltage value significantly compared with that where RTN is not considered. Delay variation analysis shows that consideration of RTN in the statistical analysis have little impact at high supply voltage. However, at low voltage operation, RTN can degrade the worst-case value by more than 5%.
