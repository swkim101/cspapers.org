We provide a systemization of knowledge of the recent progress made in addressing the crucial problem of deep learning on encrypted data. The problem is important due to the prevalence of deep learning models across various applications, and privacy concerns over the exposure of deep learning IP and user's data. Our focus is on provably secure methodologies that rely on cryptographic primitives and not trusted third parties/platforms. Computational intensity of the learning models, together with the complexity of realization of the cryptography algorithms hinder the practical implementation a challenge. We provide a summary of the state-of-the-art, comparison of the existing solutions, as well as future challenges and opportunities.
