RAPID is a low-overhead critical-word-first read acceleration architecture for improved performance and endurance in MLC/TLC non-volatile memories (NVMs). RAPID encodes the critical words in a cache line using only the most significant bits (MSbs) of the MLC/TLC NVM cells. Since the MSbs of an NVM cell can be decoded using a single read strobe, the data (i.e., critical words) encoded using the MSbs can be decoded with low latency. System-level SPEC CPU2006 workload evaluations of a TLC RRAM architecture show that RAPID improves read latency by 21%, energy by 24%, and endurance by 2-4Ã— over state-of-the-art striped NVM.
