High power Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery packs used in stationary Electrical Energy Storage (EES) systems and Electric Vehicle (EV) applications require a sophisticated Battery Management System (BMS) in order to maintain safe operation and improve their performance. With the increasing complexity of these battery packs and their demand for shorter time-to-market, decentralized approaches for battery management, providing a high degree of modularity, scalability and improved control performance are typically preferred. However, manual design approaches for these complex distributed systems are time consuming and are error-prone resulting in a reduced energy efficiency of the overall system. Here, special design automation techniques considering all abstraction-levels of the battery system are required to obtain highly optimized battery packs. This paper presents from a design automation perspective the recent advances in the domain of battery systems that are a combination of the electrochemical cells and their associated management modules. Specifically, we classify the battery systems into three abstraction levels, cell-level (battery cells and their interconnection schemes), module-level (sensing and charge balancing circuits) and pack-level (computation and control algorithms). We provide an overview of challenges that exist in each abstraction layer and give an outlook towards future design automation techniques that are required to overcome these limitations.
