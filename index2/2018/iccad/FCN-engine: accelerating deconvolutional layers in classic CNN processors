Unlike standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with fully-connected layers, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) are prevalent in computer vision applications such as object detection, semantic/image segmentation, and the most popular generative tasks based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In an FCN, traditional convolutional layers and deconvolutional layers contribute to the majority of the computation complexity. However, prior deep learning accelerator designs mostly focus on CNN optimization. They either use independent compute-resources to handle deconvolution or convert deconvolutional layers (Deconv) into general convolution operations, which arouses considerable overhead. To address this problem, we propose a unified fully convolutional accelerator aiming to handle both the deconvolutional and convolutional layers with a single processing element (PE) array. We re-optimize the conventional CNN accelerator architecture of regular 2D processing elements array, to enable it more efficiently support the data flow of deconvolutional layer inference. By exploiting the locality in deconvolutional filters, this architecture reduces the consumption of on-chip memory communication from 24.79 GB to 6.56 GB and improves the power efficiency significantly. Compared to prior baseline deconvolution acceleration scheme, the proposed accelerator achieves 1.3Xâ€“44.9X speedup and reduces the energy consumption by 14.60/0-97.6% on a set of representative benchmark applications. Meanwhile, it keeps similar CNN inference performance to that of an optimized CNN-only accelerator with negligible power consumption and chip area overhead.
