Memristor-based deep learning accelerators provide a promising solution to improve the energy efficiency of neuromorphic computing systems. However, the electrical properties and crossbar structure of memristors make these accelerators error-prone. To enable reliable memristor-based accelerators, a simulation platform is needed to precisely analyze the impact of non-ideal circuit and device properties on the inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a flexible simulation framework, DL-RSIM, to tackle this challenge. DL-RSIM simulates the error rates of every sum-of-products computation in the memristor-based accelerator and injects the errors in the targeted TensorFlow-based neural network model. A rich set of reliability impact factors are explored by DL-RSIM, and it can be incorporated with any deep learning neural network implemented by TensorFlow. Using three representative convolutional neural networks as case studies, we show that DL-RSIM can guide chip designers to choose a reliability-friendly design option and develop reliability optimization techniques.
