As data security has become the major concern in modern storage systems with low-cost multi-level-cell (MLC) flash memories, it is not trivial to realize data sanitization in such a system. Even though some existing works employ the encryption or the built-in erase to achieve this requirement, they still suffer the risk of being deciphered or the issue of performance degradation. In contrast to the existing work, a fast sanitization scheme is proposed to provide the highest degree of security for data sanitization; that is, every old version of data could be immediately sanitized with zero live-data-copy overhead once the new version of data is created/written. In particular, this scheme further considers the reliability issue of MLC flash memories; the proposed scheme includes a one-shot sanitization design to minimize the disturbance during data sanitization. The feasibility and the capability of the proposed scheme were evaluated through extensive experiments based on real flash chips. The results demonstrate that this scheme can achieve the data sanitization with zero live-data-copy, where performance overhead is less than 1%.
