The rapid improvement in computation capability has made convolutional neural networks (CNNs) a great success in recent years on image classification tasks, which has also prospered the development of objection detection algorithms with significantly improved accuracy. However, during the deployment phase, many applications demand low latency processing of one image with strict power consumption requirement, which reduces the efficiency of GPU and other general-purpose platform, bringing opportunities for specific acceleration hardware, e.g. FPGA, by customizing the digital circuit specific for the inference algorithm. Therefore, this work proposes to customize the detection algorithm, e.g. SSD, to benefit its hardware implementation with low data precision at the cost of marginal accuracy degradation. The proposed FPGA-based deep learning inference accelerator is demonstrated on two Intel FPGAs for SSD algorithm achieving up to 2.18 TOPS throughput and up to 3.3Ã— superior energy-efficiency compared to GPU.
