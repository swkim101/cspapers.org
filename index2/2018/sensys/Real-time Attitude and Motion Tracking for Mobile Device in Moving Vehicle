Recently a class of new in-vehicle technologies based on off-the-shelf mobile devices have been developed to improve driver safety and driving experience. For instance, smartwatches are utilized to monitor driving performance and detect possible secondary tasks of drivers such as texting, operating the in-vehicle infotainment, or eating. However, a key challenge for these systems is to track the real-time attitude of mobile devices in a driving vehicle. This demo presents a novel system called Real-time Attitude and Motion Tracking (RAMT) that can enable a mobile device to accurately learn the coordinate system of the moving vehicle, and hence track the attitude and the motion of the device in real time.
