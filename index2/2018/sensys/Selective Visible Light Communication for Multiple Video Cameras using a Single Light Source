In this paper, we propose a selective visible light communication method using a single light source and multiple video cameras by using their differences in reception sensitivity between carrier waves composed of OFDM signals. In our evaluation experiments, the transmitted signals were composed of 50th, 75th, 78th, and 80th order carrier waves encoding symbols modulated by 4, 8, and 16 PSK. The exposure time ratio for each camera was set to different values so that symbols encoded in one of the carrier waves could be decoded successfully, but erroneously in the other waves. The selectivity of individual carrier waves as theoretically derived was confirmed through the experimental results.
