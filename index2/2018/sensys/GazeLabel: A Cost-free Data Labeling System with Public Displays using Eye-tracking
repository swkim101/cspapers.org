In this paper, we introduce GazeLabel: a cost-free data labeling system with public displays (at bus stops, metro stations, shopping malls, etc.) using eye-tracking technology. With built-in cameras, the proposed system captures pedestrians' gaze points on the screen, from which we can extract information and get a substantial amount of free labeled data. Based on this idea, we implemented a prototype eye-tracking data-labeling system for binary image classifications. A pilot study demonstrated the potential and practicability in a data labeling process using GazeLabel.
