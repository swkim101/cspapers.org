The 14th Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE’18) was held from Saturday December 15 to Monday December 17, 2018, in Oxford at St. Anne’s College. This conference brought together researchers in theoretical computer science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, and economics to exchange ideas and results on problems involving incentives and computation. These problems are of particular importance in application areas like the Web and the Internet that involve large and diverse populations. As the guest editors of this special issue of ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation (TEAC), we are pleased to present extended versions of papers presented at WINE’18. We invited authors of a small set of papers that received extremely positive conference reviews to submit their extended work to TEAC. Each submission went through TEAC’s own rigorous review process. This has led to nine excellent articles that appear in two parts. The second part comprises the following five articles: • Anshelevich and Zhu, “Ordinal Approximation for Social Choice, Matching, and Facility Location Problems Given Candidate Positions” • Cheng, Gravin, Munagala, and Wang, “A Simple Mechanism for a Budget-Constrained Buyer” • Chawla, Naor, Panigrahi, Singh, and Umboh, “Timing Matters: Online Dynamics in Broadcast Games” • Li and Vetta, “The Fair Division of Hereditary Set Systems” • Gölz, Kahng, Mackenzie, and Procaccia, “The Fluid Mechanics of Liquid Democracy”
