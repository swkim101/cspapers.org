Existing review-aware recommendation methods represent users (or items) through the concatenation of the reviews written by (or for) them, and depend entirely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful features for modeling users (or items). However, understanding reviews based only on the raw words of reviews is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity contained in them originated from the users' different tendency in writing. Moreover, it is inefficient in time and memory to model users/items by the concatenation of their associated reviews owing to considerably large inputs to CNNs. In this work, we present a scalable review-aware recommendation method, called SentiRec, that is guided to incorporate the sentiments of reviews when modeling the users and the items. SentiRec is a two-step approach composed of the first step that includes the encoding of each review into a fixed-size review vector that is trained to embody the sentiment of the review, followed by the second step that generates recommendations based on the vector-encoded reviews. Through our experiments, we show that SentiRec not only outperforms the existing review-aware methods, but also drastically reduces the training time and the memory usage. We also conduct a qualitative evaluation on the vector-encoded reviews trained by SentiRec to demonstrate that the overall sentiments are indeed encoded therein.
