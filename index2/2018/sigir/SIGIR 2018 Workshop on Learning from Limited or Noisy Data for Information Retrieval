In recent years, machine learning approaches, and in particular deep neural networks, have yielded significant improvements on several natural language processing and computer vision tasks; however, such breakthroughs have not yet been observed in the area of information retrieval. Besides the complexity of IR tasks, such as understanding the user's information needs, a main reason is the lack of high-quality and/or large-scale training data for many IR tasks. This necessitates studying how to design and train machine learning algorithms where there is no large-scale or high-quality data in hand. Therefore, considering the quick progress in development of machine learning models, this is an ideal time for a workshop that especially focuses on learning in such an important and challenging setting for IR tasks. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from industry---where data is plentiful but noisy---with researchers from academia---where data is sparse but clean to discuss solutions to these related problems.
