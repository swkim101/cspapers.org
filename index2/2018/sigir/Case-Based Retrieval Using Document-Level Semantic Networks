We propose a research that aims at improving the effectiveness of case-based retrieval systems through the use of automatically created document-level semantic networks. The proposed research leverages the recent advancements in information extraction and relational learning to revisit and advance the core ideas of concept-centered hypertext models. The automatic extraction of semantic relations from documents --- and their centrality in the creation and exploitation of the documents' semantic networks --- represents our attempt to go one step further than previous approaches.
