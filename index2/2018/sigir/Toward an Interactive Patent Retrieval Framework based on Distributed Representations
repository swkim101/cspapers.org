We present a novel interactive framework for patent retrieval leveraging distributed representations of concepts and entities extracted from the patents text. We propose a simple and practical interactive relevance feedback mechanism where the user is asked to annotate relevant/irrelevant results from the top n hits. We then utilize this feedback for query reformulation and term weighting where weights are assigned based on how good each term is at discriminating the relevant vs. irrelevant candidates. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of the distributed representations on the CLEF-IP 2010 dataset where we achieve significant improvement of 4.6% in recall over the keyword search baseline. Second, we simulate interactivity to demonstrate the efficacy of our interactive term weighting mechanism. Simulation results show that we can achieve significant improvement in recall from one interaction iteration outperforming previous semantic and interactive patent retrieval methods.
