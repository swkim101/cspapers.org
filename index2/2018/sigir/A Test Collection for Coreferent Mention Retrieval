This paper introduces the coreferent mention retrieval task, in which the goal is to retrieve sentences that mention a specific entity based on a query by example in which one sentence mentioning that entity is provided. The development of a coreferent mention retrieval test collection is then described. Results are presented for five coreferent mention retrieval systems, both to illustrate the use of the collection and to specify the results that were pooled on which human coreference judgments were performed. The new test collection is built from content that is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium; the partitioning and human annotations used to create the test collection atop that content are being made freely available.
