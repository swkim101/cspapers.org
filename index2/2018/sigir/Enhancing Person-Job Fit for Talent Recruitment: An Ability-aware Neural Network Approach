The wide spread use of online recruitment services has led to information explosion in the job market. As a result, the recruiters have to seek the intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right job seekers to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit have a focus on measuring the matching degree between the talent qualification and the job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts despite of the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of the human judgement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end A bility-aware P erson-J ob F it N eural N etwork (APJFNN) model, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labour and can provide better interpretation about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available at abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers' experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, four hierarchical ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measuring the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world data set clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the APJFNN framework compared with several baselines.
