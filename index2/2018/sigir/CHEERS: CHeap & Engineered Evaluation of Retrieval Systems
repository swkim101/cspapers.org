In test collection based evaluation of retrieval effectiveness, many research investigated different directions for an economical and a semi-automatic evaluation of retrieval systems. Although several methods have been proposed and experimentally evaluated, their accuracy seems still limited. In this paper we present our proposal for a more engineered approach to information retrieval evaluation.
