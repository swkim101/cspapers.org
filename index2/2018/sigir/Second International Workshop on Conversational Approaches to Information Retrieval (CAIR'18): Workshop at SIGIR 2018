The CAIR'18 workshop will bring together academic and industrial researchers to create a forum for research on conversational approaches to search and recommendation. A specific focus will be on techniques that support complex and multi-turn user-machine dialogues for information access and retrieval, and multi-modal interfaces for interacting with such systems.
