Retrieval systems have greatly improved over the last half century, estimating relevance to a latent user need in a wide variety of areas. One common task in e-commerce and science that has not enjoyed such advancements is searching through a catalog of items. Finding a desirable item in such a catalog requires that the user specify desirable item properties, specifically desirable attribute values. Existing item retrieval systems assume the user can formulate a good Boolean or SQL-style query to retrieve items, as one would do with a database, but this is often challenging, particularly given multiple numeric attributes. Such systems avoid inferring query intent, instead requiring the user to precisely specify what matches the query. A contrasting approach would be to estimate how well items match the user's latent desires and return items ranked by this estimation. Towards this end, we present a retrieval model inspired by multi-criteria decision making theory, concentrating on numeric attributes. In two user studies (choosing airline tickets and meal plans) using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluate our novel approach against the de facto standard of Boolean retrieval and several models proposed in the literature. We use a novel competitive game to motivate test subjects and compare methods based on the results of the subjects' initial query and their success in the game. In our experiments, our new method significantly outperformed the others, whereas the Boolean approaches had the worst performance.
