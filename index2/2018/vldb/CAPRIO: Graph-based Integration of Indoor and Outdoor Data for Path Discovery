Recently, navigation and localization systems have emerged to support queries like the shortest distance in either indoor or outdoor with additional constraints. These systems, however, neither combine the indoor and outdoor information nor consider the external natural conditions like the weather that one may face across an outdoor path. In this demonstration paper we present CAPRIO , which proposes and implements a novel graph representation that integrates indoor and outdoor information to discover paths that personalize outdoor exposure while minimizes the over-all path length. We also demonstrate how unifying the graph algorithms for indoor and outdoor navigation enables signi-Ô¨Åcant optimizations that would not be possible otherwise
