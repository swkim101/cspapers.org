The system is able to predict online real-time transaction fraud in mere milliseconds. We present the problem definition, feature extraction, detection methods, implementation and deployment of the system, as well as empirical effectiveness. Extensive experiments have been conducted on large real-world transaction data to show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed system.
