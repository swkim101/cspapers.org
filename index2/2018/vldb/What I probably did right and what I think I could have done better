They say a lot of good things in life are not free. Success is one of them. Successful research requires an immense amount of hard work and dedication over a long period of time. For better or worse, hard work alone does not guarantee success. In my experience, success is a marathon of hard work and some luck along the way. What is often forgotten is that it is important to enjoy the journey of hard work and appreciate many experiences and relationships along the way. I am deeply honored to receive the 2019 VLDB Women in Database Research Award. In the talk, I will share with you a retrospective of my journey so far, what I probably did right along the way, and perhaps more importantly, the many things I think I could have done better as a computer scientist and especially a female computer scientist.
