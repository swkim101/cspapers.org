Counting the fraction of a population having an input within a specified interval i.e. range count query is a fundamental database operation. Range count queries can also be used to compute other interesting statistics such as quantiles. The framework of differential privacy [6] (DP) is becoming a standard for privacy-preserving data analysis [1]. While many works address the problem of range counting queries in the trusted aggregation model, surprisingly, this problem has not been addressed specifically under untrusted aggregation (local DP [10]). In this work we study the problem of answering 1-dimensional range count queries under the constraint of LDP.
