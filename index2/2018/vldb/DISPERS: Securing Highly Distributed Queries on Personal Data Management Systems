Personal Data Management Systems (PDMS) advance at a rapid pace allowing us to integrate all our personal data in a single place and use it for our benefit and for the benefit of the community. This leads to a significant paradigm shift since personal data become massively distributed and opens an important question: how to query this massively distributed data in an efficient, pertinent and privacy-preserving way? This demonstration proposes a fully-distributed PDMS called DISPERS, built on top of SEP2P [11], allowing users to securely and efficiently share and query their personal data. The demonstration platform graphically illustrates the query execution in details, showing that DISPERS leads to maximal system security with low and scalable overhead. Attendees are welcome to challenge the security provided by DISPERS using the proposed hacking tools.
