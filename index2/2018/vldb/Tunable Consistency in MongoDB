Distributed databases oﬀer high availability but can impose high costs on client applications in order to maintain strong consistency at all times. MongoDB is a document oriented database whose replication system provides a variety of consistency levels allowing client applications to select the trade-oﬀs they want to make when it comes to consistency and latency, at a per operation level. In this paper we discuss the tunable consistency models in MongoDB replication and their utility for application developers. We discuss how the MongoDB replication system’s speculative execution model and data rollback protocol help make this spectrum of consistency levels possible. We also present case studies of how these consistency levels are used in real world applications, along with a characterization of their performance beneﬁts and trade-oﬀs.
