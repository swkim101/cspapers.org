 In this paper, we present STAR, a new distributed in-memory database with asymmetric replication. By employing a single-node non-partitioned architecture for some replicas and a partitioned architecture for other replicas, STAR is able to efficiently run both highly partitionable workloads and workloads that involve cross-partition transactions. The key idea is a new
 phase-switching
 algorithm where the execution of single-partition and cross-partition transactions is separated. In the partitioned phase, single-partition transactions are run on multiple machines in parallel to exploit more concurrency. In the single-master phase, mastership for the entire database is switched to a single designated master node, which can execute these transactions without the use of expensive coordination protocols like two-phase commit. Because the master node has a full copy of the database, this phase-switching can be done at negligible cost. Our experiments on two popular benchmarks (YCSB and TPC-C) show that high availability via replication can coexist with fast serializable transaction execution in distributed in-memory databases, with STAR outperforming systems that employ conventional concurrency control and replication algorithms by up to one order of magnitude.
