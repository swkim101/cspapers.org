In recent years, encrypted databases have emerged as a promising direction that provides data confidentiality without sacrificing functionality: queries are executed on encrypted data. However, many practical proposals rely on a set of weak encryption schemes that have been shown to leak sensitive data. In this paper, we propose Arx, a practical and functionally rich database system that encrypts the data only with semantically secure encryption schemes. We show that Arx supports real applications such as ShareLaTeX with a modest performance overhead.
