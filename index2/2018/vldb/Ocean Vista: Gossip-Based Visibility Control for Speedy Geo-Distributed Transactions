 Providing ACID transactions under conflicts across globally distributed data is the Everest of transaction processing protocols. Transaction processing in this scenario is particularly costly due to the high latency of cross-continent network links, which inflates concurrency control and data replication overheads. To mitigate the problem, we introduce Ocean Vista - a novel distributed protocol that guarantees
 strict serializability
 . We observe that concurrency control and replication address different aspects of resolving the visibility of transactions, and we address both concerns using a multi-version protocol that tracks visibility using version watermarks and arrives at correct visibility decisions using efficient gossip. Gossiping the watermarks enables asynchronous transaction processing and acknowledging transaction visibility in batches in the
 concurrency control
 and
 replication
 protocols, which improves efficiency under high cross-datacenter network delays. In particular, Ocean Vista can process
 conflicting
 transactions in parallel, and supports efficient
 write-quorum / read-one
 access using one round trip in the common case. We demonstrate experimentally in a multi-data-center cloud environment that our design outperforms a leading distributed transaction processing engine (TAPIR) more than 10-fold in terms of peak throughput, albeit at the cost of additional latency for gossip. The latency penalty is generally bounded by one wide area network (WAN) round trip time (RTT), and in the best case (i.e., under light load) our system nearly breaks even with TAPIR by committing transactions in around one WAN RTT.
