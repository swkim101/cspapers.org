In this demo paper, we introduce Trinity , a general-purpose framework that can be used to quickly build domain-speciﬁc program synthesizers for automating many tedious tasks that arise in data science. We illustrate how Trinity can be used by three diﬀerent users: First, we show how end-users can use Trinity ’s built-in synthesizers to automate data wrangling tasks. Second, we show how advanced users can easily extend existing synthesizers to support additional functionalities. Third, we show how synthesis experts can change the underlying search engine in Trinity . Overall, this paper is intended to demonstrate how users can quickly use, modify, and extend the Trinity framework with the goal of automating many tasks that are considered to be the “janitor” work of data science.
