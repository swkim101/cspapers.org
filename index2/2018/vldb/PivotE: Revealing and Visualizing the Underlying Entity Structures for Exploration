A Web-scale knowledge graph (KG) typically contains millions of entities and thousands of entity types. Due to the lack of a pre-defined data schema such as the ER model, entities in KGs are loosely coupled based on their relationships, which brings challenges for effective accesses of the KGs in a structured manner like SPARQL. This demonstration presents an entity-oriented exploratory search prototype system that is able to support search and explore KGs in a exploratory search manner, where local structures of KGs can be dynamically discovered and utilized for guiding users. The system applies a path-based ranking method for recommending similar entities and their relevant information as exploration pointers. The interface is designed to assist users to investigate a domain (particular type) of entities, as well as to explore the knowledge graphs in various relevant domains. The queries are dynamically formulated by tracing the usersâ€™ dynamic clicking (exploration) behaviors. In this demonstration, we will show how our system visualize the underlying entity structures, as well as explain the semantic correlations among them in a unified interface, which not only assist users to learn about the properties of entities in many aspects but also guide them to further explore the information space.
