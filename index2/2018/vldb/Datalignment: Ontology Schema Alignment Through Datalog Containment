We focus on the problem of aligning ontology relations, namely ﬁnding relation names that correspond to the same or related concepts. Such alignment is a prerequisite to the integration of the multiple available Knowledge Bases many of which include similar concepts, diﬀerently termed. We propose a novel approach for this problem, by leveraging association rules – originally mined in order to enrich the ontological content. Here, we treat the rules as Datalog programs and look for bounded-depth sub-programs that are contained in (or equivalent to) each other. Heads of such programs intuitively correspond to related concepts, and we propose them as candidates for alignment. The candidate alignments require further veriﬁcation by experts; to this end we accompany each aligned pair with explanations based on the provenance of each relation according to its sub-program. We have implemented our novel solution in a system called Datalignment . We propose to demonstrate Datalignment , presenting the aligned pairs that it ﬁnds, and the computed explanations, in context of real-life Knowledge Bases.
