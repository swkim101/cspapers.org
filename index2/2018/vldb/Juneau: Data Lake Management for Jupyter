In collaborative settings such as multi-investigator laboratories, data scientists need improved tools to manage not their data records but rather their data sets and data products , to facilitate both provenance tracking and data (and code) reuse within their data lakes and ﬁle systems. We demonstrate the Juneau System, which extends computational notebook software (Jupyter Notebook) as an instrumentation and data management point for overseeing and facilitating improved dataset usage, through capabilities for indexing, searching, and recommending “complementary” data sources, previously extracted machine learning features, and additional training data. This demonstration focuses on how we help the user ﬁnd re-lated datasets via search
