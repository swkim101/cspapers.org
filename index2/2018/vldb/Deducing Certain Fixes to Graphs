 This paper proposes to deduce
 certain fixes
 to graphs
 G
 based on data quality rules Σ and ground truth Γ (
 i.e.,
 validated attribute values and entity matches). We fix errors detected by Σ in
 G
 such that the fixes are assured correct as long as Σand Γ are correct. We deduce certain fixes in two paradigms. (a) We interact with users and "incrementally" fix errors online. Whenever users pick a small set
 V
 0
 of nodes in
 G
 , we fix all errors pertaining to
 V
 0
 and accumulate ground truth in the process. (b) Based on accumulated Γ, we repair the entire graph
 G
 offline; while this may not correct all errors in
 G
 , all fixes are guaranteed certain.
 
 
 We develop techniques for deducing certain fixes. (1) We define data quality rules to support conditional functional dependencies, recursively defined keys and negative rules on graphs, such that we can deduce fixes by combining data repairing and object identification. (2) We show that deducing certain fixes is Church-Rosser,
 i.e.,
 the deduction converges at the same fixes regardless of the order of rules applied. (3) We establish the complexity of three fundamental problems associated with certain fixes. (4) We provide (parallel) algorithms for deducing certain fixes online and offline, and guarantee to reduce running time when given more processors. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of our methods.
