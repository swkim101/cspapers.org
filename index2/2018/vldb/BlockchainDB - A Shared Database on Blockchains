In this paper we present BlockchainDB , which leverages blockchains as a storage layer and introduces a database layer on top that extends blockchains by classical data management techniques (e.g., sharding) as well as a standardized query interface to facilitate the adoption of blockchains for data sharing use cases. We show that by introducing the additional database layer, we are able to improve the performance and scalability when using blockchains for data sharing and also massively decrease the complexity for organizations intending to use blockchains for data sharing.
