Storage and memory systems for modern data analytics are heavily layered, managing shared persistent data, cached data, and nonshared execution data in separate systems such as a distributed file system like HDFS, an in-memory file system like Alluxio, and a computation framework like Spark. Such layering introduces significant performance and management costs. In this paper we propose a single system called Pangea that can manage all data---both intermediate and long-lived data, and their buffer/caching, data placement optimization, and failure recovery---all in one monolithic distributed storage system, without any layering. We present a detailed performance evaluation of Pangea and show that its performance compares favorably with several widely used layered systems such as Spark.
