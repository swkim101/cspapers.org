Data storage in the Cloud needs to be scalable and fault-tolerant. Atomic commitment protocols such as Two Phase Commit (2PC) provide ACID guarantees for transactional access to sharded data and help in achieving scalability. Whereas consensus protocols such as Paxos consistently replicate data across different servers and provide fault tolerance. Cloud based datacenters today typically treat the problems of scalability and fault-tolerance disjointedly. In this work, we propose a unification of these two different paradigms into one framework called Consensus and Commitment (C&C) framework. The C&C framework can model existing and well known data management protocols as well as propose new ones. We demonstrate the advantages of the C&C framework by developing a new atomic commitment protocol, Paxos Atomic Commit (PAC), which integrates commitment with recovery in a Paxos-like manner. We also instantiate commit protocols from the C&C framework catered to different Cloud data management techniques. In particular, we propose a novel protocol, Generalized PAC (G-PAC) that integrates atomic commitment and fault tolerance in a cloud paradigm involving both sharding and replication of data. We compare the performance of G-PAC with a Spanner-like protocol, where 2PC is used at the logical data level and Paxos is used for consistent replication of logical data. The experimental results highlight the benefits of combining consensus along with commitment into a single integrated protocol.
