A matrix M: A × X → {−1,1} corresponds to the following learning problem: An unknown element x ∈ X is chosen uniformly at random. A learner tries to learn x from a stream of samples, (a1, b1), (a2, b2) …, where for every i, ai ∈ A is chosen uniformly at random and bi = M(ai,x). Assume that k, l, r are such that any submatrix of M of at least 2−k · |A| rows and at least 2−l · |X| columns, has a bias of at most 2−r. We show that any learning algorithm for the learning problem corresponding to M requires either a memory of size at least Ω(k · l ), or at least 2Ω(r) samples. The result holds even if the learner has an exponentially small success probability (of 2−Ω(r)). In particular, this shows that for a large class of learning problems, any learning algorithm requires either a memory of size at least Ω((log|X|) · (log|A|)) or an exponential number of samples, achieving a tight Ω((log|X|) · (log|A|)) lower bound on the size of the memory, rather than a bound of Ω(min{(log|X|)2,(log|A|)2}) obtained in previous works by Raz [FOCS’17] and Moshkovitz and Moshkovitz [ITCS’18]. Moreover, our result implies all previous memory-samples lower bounds, as well as a number of new applications. Our proof builds on the work of Raz [FOCS’17] that gave a general technique for proving memory samples lower bounds.
