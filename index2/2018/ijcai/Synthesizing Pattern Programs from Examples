We describe a programming-by-example system that automatically generates pattern programs from examples. Writing pattern programs, which produce various patterns of characters, is one of the most popular programming exercises for entry-level students. However, students often find it difficult to write correct solutions by themselves. In this paper, we present a method for synthesizing pattern programs from examples, allowing students to improve their programming skills efficiently. To that end, we first design a domain-specific language that supports a large class of pattern programs that students struggle with. Next, we develop a synthesis algorithm that efficiently finds a desired program by combining enumerative search, constraint solving, and program analysis. We implemented the algorithm in a tool and evaluated it on 40 exercises gathered from online forums. The experimental results and user study show that our tool can synthesize instructive solutions from 1â€“3 example patterns in 1.2 seconds on average.
