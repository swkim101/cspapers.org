Integrated task planning and execution is a challenging problem with several applications in AI and robotics. In this work we consider the problem of generating and executing optimal plans for multi-robot systems under temporal and ordering constraints. More specifically, we propose an approach that unites the power of Optimization Modulo Theories with the flexibility of an on-line executive, providing optimal solutions for task planning, and runtime feedback on their execution.
