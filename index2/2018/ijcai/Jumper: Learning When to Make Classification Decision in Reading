In early years, text classification is typically accomplished by feature-based classifiers; recently, neural networks, as powerful classifiers, make it possible to work with raw input as the text stands. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Jumper, inspired by the cognitive process of text reading, that models text classification as a sequential decision process. Basically, Jumper is a neural system that can scan a piece of text sequentially and make classification decision at the time it chooses. Both the classification and when to make the classification are part of the decision process which are controlled by the policy net and trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the overall classification accuracy. Experimental results show that a properly trained Jumper has the following properties: (1) It can make decisions whenever the evidence is enough, therefore reducing the total text reading by 30~40% and often finding the key rationale of prediction. (2) It can achieve classification accuracy better or comparable to state-of-the-art model in several benchmark and industrial datasets.
