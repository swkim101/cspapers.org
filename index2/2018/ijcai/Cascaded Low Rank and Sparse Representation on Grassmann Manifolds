Inspired by low rank representation and sparse subspace clustering acquiring success, ones attempt to simultaneously perform low rank and sparse constraints on the affinity matrix to improve the performance. However, it is just a trade-off between these two constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascaded Low Rank and Sparse Representation (CLRSR) method for subspace clustering, which seeks the sparse expression on the former learned low rank latent representation. To make our proposed method suitable to multi-dimension or imageset data, we extend CLRSR onto Grassmann manifolds. An effective solution and its convergence analysis are also provided. The excellent experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is more robust than other state-of-the-art clustering methods on imageset data.
