A procedure is proposed to efficiently generate sets of ground implicates of 

first-order formulas with equality. It is based on a tuning of the superposition

calculus, enriched with rules 

that add new hypotheses on demand during the proof search.

Experimental results are presented, showing that the proposed

approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art systems.
