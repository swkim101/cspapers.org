We study pseudo-Boolean constraints (PBC) and

their special case cardinality constraints (CARD)

from the perspective of knowledge representation.

To this end, the succinctness of PBC and CARD

is compared to that of many standard propositional

languages. Moreover, we determine which queries

and transformations are feasible in polynomial time

when knowledge is represented by PBC or CARD,

and which are not (unconditionally or unless P =

NP). In particular, the advantages and disadvantages

compared to CNF are discussed.
