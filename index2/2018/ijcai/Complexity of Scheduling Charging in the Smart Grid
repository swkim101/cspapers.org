The problem of optimally scheduling the charging demand of electric vehicles within the constraints of the electricity infrastructure is called the charge scheduling problem. The models of the charging speed, horizon, and charging demand determine the computational complexity of the charge scheduling problem. We show that for about 20 variants the problem is either in P or weakly NP-hard and dynamic programs exist to compute optimal solutions. About 10 other variants of the problem are strongly NP-hard, presenting a potentially significant obstacle to their use in practical situations of scale. An experimental study establishes up to what parameter values the dynamic programs can determine optimal solutions in a couple of minutes.
