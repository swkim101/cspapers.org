We study the problem of determining the robustness of a multi-agent system of unbounded size against specifications expressed in a temporal-epistemic logic. We introduce a procedure to synthesise automatically the maximal ratio of faulty agents that may be present at runtime for a specification to be satisfied in a multi-agent system. We show the procedure to be sound and amenable to symbolic implementation. We present an implementation and report the experimental results obtained by running this on a number of protocols from swarm robotics.
