This paper presents an effective multi-robot motion planner that

enables each robot to reach its desired location while avoiding

collisions with the other robots and the obstacles. The approach takes

into account the differential constraints imposed by the underlying

dynamics of each robot and generates dynamically-feasible motions that

can be executed in the physical world. The crux of the approach is

the sampling-based expansion of a motion tree in the continuous state

space of all the robots guided by multi-agent search over a discrete

abstraction. Experiments using vehicle models with nonlinear dynamics

operating in complex environments show significant speedups over

related work.
