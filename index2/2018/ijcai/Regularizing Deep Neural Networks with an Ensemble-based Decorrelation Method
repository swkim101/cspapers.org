Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance in many tasks, improving the generalization capacity of DNNs still remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel regularizer named Ensemble-based Decorrelation Method (EDM), which is motivated by the idea of the ensemble learning to improve generalization capacity of DNNs. EDM can be applied to hidden layers in fully connected neural networks or convolutional neural networks. We treat each hidden layer as an ensemble of several base learners through dividing all the hidden units into several non-overlap groups, and each group will be viewed as a base learner. EDM encourages DNNs to learn more diverse representations by minimizing the covariance between all base learners during the training step. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR datasets demonstrate that EDM can effectively reduce the overfitting and improve the generalization capacity of DNNs
