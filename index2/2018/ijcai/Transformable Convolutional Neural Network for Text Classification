Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown their promising performance for natural language processing tasks, which extract n-grams as features to represent the input. However, n-gram based CNNs are inherently limited to fixed geometric structure and cannot proactively adapt to the transformations of features. In this paper, we propose two modules to provide CNNs with the flexibility for complex features and the adaptability for transformation, namely, transformable convolution and transformable pooling. Our method fuses dynamic and static deviations to redistribute the sampling locations, which can capture both current and global transformations. Our modules can be easily integrated by other models to generate new transformable networks. We test proposed modules on two state-of-the-art models, and the results demonstrate that our modules can effectively adapt to the feature transformation in text classification.
