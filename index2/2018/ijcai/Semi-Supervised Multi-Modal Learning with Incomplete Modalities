In real world applications, data are often with multiple modalities. Researchers proposed the multi-modal learning approaches for integrating the information from different modalities. Most of the previous multi-modal methods assume that training examples are with complete modalities. However, due to the failures of data collection, self-deficiencies and other various reasons, multi-modal examples are usually with incomplete feature representation in real applications. In this paper, the incomplete feature representation issues in multi-modal learning are named as incomplete modalities, and we propose a semi-supervised multi-modal learning method aimed at this incomplete modal issue (SLIM). SLIM can utilize the extrinsic information from unlabeled data against the insufficiencies brought by the incomplete modal issues in a semi-supervised scenario. Besides, the proposed SLIM forms the problem into a unified framework which can be treated as a classifier or clustering learner, and integrate the intrinsic consistencies and extrinsic unlabeled information. As SLIM can extract the most discriminative predictors for each modality, experiments on 15 real world multi-modal datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.
