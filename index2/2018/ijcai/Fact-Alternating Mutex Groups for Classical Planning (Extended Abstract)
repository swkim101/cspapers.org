In this paper, we focus on the inference of mutex groups in the lifted (PDDL) representation. We formalize the inference and prove that the most commonly used translator from the Fast Downward (FD) planning system infers a certain subclass of mutex groups, called fact-alternating mutex groups (fam-groups). Based on that, we show that the previously proposed fam-groups-based pruning techniques for the STRIPS representation can be utilized during the grounding process with lifted fam-groups, i.e., before the full STRIPS representation is known. Furthermore, we propose an improved inference algorithm for lifted fam-groups that produces a richer set of fam-groups than the FD translator and we demonstrate a positive impact on the number of pruned operators and overall coverage.
