This paper shows that in the presence of data prefetchers, cache replacement policies are faced with a large unexplored design space. In particular, we observe that while Belady's MIN algorithm minimizes the total number of cache misses—including those for prefetched lines—it does not minimize the number of demand misses. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Demand-MIN, a variant of Belady's algorithm that minimizes the number of demand misses at the cost of increased prefetcher traffic. Together, MIN and Demand-MIN define the boundaries of an important design space, with many intermediate points lying between them. To reason about this design space, we introduce a simple conceptual framework, which we use to define a new cache replacement policy called Harmony. Our empirical evaluation shows that for a mix of SPEC 2006 benchmarks running on a 4-core system with a stride prefetcher, Harmony improves IPC by 7.7% over an LRU baseline, compared to 3.7% for the previous state-of-the-art. On an 8-core system, Harmony improves IPC by 9.4% compared to 4.4% for the previous state-of-the-art.
