Field multi-robot missions face numerous unavoidable disturbances, such as delays in executing tasks and intermittent communications. Coping with such disturbances requires to endow the robots with high-level decision skills. We present a distributed decision architecture based first on a hybrid planner that can manage decentralized repairs with partial communication, and secondly on a distributed execution algorithm that efficiently propagates delays. This architecture has been successfully experimented on the field for the achievement of surveillance missions involving eight (8) real autonomous aerial and ground robots.
