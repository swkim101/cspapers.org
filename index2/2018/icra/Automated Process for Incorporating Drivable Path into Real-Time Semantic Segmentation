Vision systems are widely used in autonomous vehicle systems due to the rich information that camera sensors provide of the surrounding environment. This paper presents an automatic algorithm to obtain the drivable path of a vehicle operating in urban roads with or without clear lane markings. The developed system projects trajectories obtained during human operation of the vehicle and utilizes these to generate automatic labels for training a semantic based path prediction model. The system segments an urban scenario into 13 categories including vehicles, pedestrian, undrivable road, other categories relevant to urban roads, and a new class for a path proposal. The drivable path information is essential particularly in unstructured scenarios, and is critical for an intelligent vehicle system to make sound driving decisions. The path proposal category is a car-width drivable lane estimated to be safe to drive for the vehicle under consideration. The data collection, model training and inference process requires only images from a monocular camera and odometry from a low-cost IMU combined with a wheel encoder. The algorithm has been successfully demonstrated on the Sydney University campus, which is a challenging environment without clear road markings. The algorithm was demonstrated to run in real-time, proving its applicability for intelligent vehicles.
