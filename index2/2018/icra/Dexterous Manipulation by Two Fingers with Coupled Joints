This paper studies dexterous manipulation in the plane by a two-fingered hand in the plane. The dynamics of each finger, which consists of two links with coupled joints, are derived based on Lagrangian mechanics. As an object is being manipulated, its orientation and the two independent joint angles of the hand constitute the state of the entire system. Contact kinematics, accounting for both stick and slip modes, are combined with dynamics to establish a dependence of the object's linear and angular accelerations on joint accelerations. This allows control of joint torques, under a proportional-derivative (PD) law, to move the object to a target position in a desired orientation.
