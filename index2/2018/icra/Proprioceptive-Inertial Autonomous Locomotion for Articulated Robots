Inspired by the ability of animals to rely on proprioception and vestibular feedback to adapt their gait, we propose a modular framework for autonomous locomotion that relies on force sensing and inertial information. A first controller exploits anti-compliance, a new application of positive force feedback, to quickly react against obstacles upon impact. We hypothesize that, in situations where a robot experiences occasional impacts with the environment, anti-compliance can help negotiate unknown obstacles, similar to biological systems where positive feedback enables fast responses to external stimuli. A novel parallel controller, based on a bi-stable dynamical system, continuously adjusts the robot's direction of locomotion, and reverts it in reaction to major swerves. We present experimental results, demonstrating how our framework allows a snake robot to autonomously locomote through a row of unevenly-spaced obstacles. Finally, we extend our proprioceptive controller to legged locomotion, showing how a hexaprint robot can adapt its motion to climb over obstacles.
