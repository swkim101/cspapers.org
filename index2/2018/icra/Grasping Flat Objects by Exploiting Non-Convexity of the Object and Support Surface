In this paper we propose a grasp strategy which exploits environmental contact for grasping domestic flat objects placed or hinged on support surfaces. The proposed grasp strategy considers the non-convex geometry of the object-surface combination, as this appears in objects like plates on tables or handles on cupboards. Following the fact that state-of-the-art grasp planners fail to produce candidate grasps for flat objects due to the environmental constraint of the support surface, this work utilizes compliant interaction of the hand with the support surface, inspired by human grasp strategies.
