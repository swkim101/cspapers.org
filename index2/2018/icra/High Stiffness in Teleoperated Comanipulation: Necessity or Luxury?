The present paper investigates if and in which conditions does the implementation of high stiffness controllers increase the performances of human dyads during comanipulative tasks in physical Human-Human Interaction (pHHI) settings. Two experiments are conducted which cover two fundamental aspects of pHHI: low-level interactions allowing interpersonal coordination, and high-level interactions allowing common decision-making and negotiation of strategies. The results of these experiments show that high stiffness is not necessary for good performances when the task only requires low-level interactions. On the contrary, when dealing with high-level interactions, higher stiffness increases task performance. The results presented highlight the importance of the quality of teleoperated control in setups used for the study of pHHI.
