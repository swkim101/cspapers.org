Duchenne muscular dystrophy leaves patients with severe dependency on health care. In an effort to increase independence and quality of life, active exoskeletons are developed to support activities of daily living. This study is dedicated to the development and assessment of three different admittance control algorithms for a trunk supporting robot; a law with constant parameters, a law with added feed-forward force, and a law with variable parameters. A Fitts'-like experiment with 12 healthy subjects was performed to compare the control laws. The results show decreased movement times for the feedforward and variable admittance controllers with respect to the standard admittance.
