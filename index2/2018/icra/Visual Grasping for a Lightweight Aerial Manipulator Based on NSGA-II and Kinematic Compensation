The grasping control of an aerial manipulator in practical environments is challenging due to its complex kinematics/dynamics and motion constraints. This paper introduces a lightweight aerial manipulator, which is combined with an X8 coaxial octocopter and a 4-DoF manipulator. To address the grasping control problem, we develop an efficient scheme containing trajectory generation, visual trajectory tracking, and kinematic compensation. The NSGA-II method is utilized to implement the multiobjective optimization for trajectory planning. Motion constraints and collision avoidance are also considered in the optimization. A kinematic compensation-based visual trajectory tracking is introduced to address the coupled nature between manipulator and VAV body. No dynamic parameter calibration is needed. Finally, several experiments are performed to verify the stability and feasibility of the proposed approach.
