We present the Signature of Topologically Persistent Points (STPP), a global descriptor that encodes topological invariants of 3D point cloud data. These topological invariants include the zeroth and first homology groups and are computed using persistent homology, a method for finding the features of a topological space at different spatial resolutions. STPP is a competitive 3D point cloud descriptor when compared to the state of art and is resilient to noisy sensor data. We demonstrate experimentally on a publicly available RGB-D dataset that STPP can be used as a distinctive signature, thus allowing for 3D point cloud processing tasks such as object detection and classification.
