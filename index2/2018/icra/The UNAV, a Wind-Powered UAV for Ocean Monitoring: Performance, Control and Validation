Wind power is the source of propulsive energy for sailboats and albatrosses. We present the UNAv, an Unmanned Nautical Air-water vehicle, that borrows features from both. It is composed of a glider-type airframe fitted with a vertical wing-sail extending above the center of mass of the system and a vertical surface-piercing hydrofoil keel extending below. The sail and keel are both actuated in pitch about their span-wise axes. Like an albatross, the UNAv is fully streamlined, high lift-to-drag ratio and generates the gravity-cancelling force by means of its airborne wings. Like a sailboat, the UNAv interacts with water and may access the full magnitude of the wind. A trim analysis predicts that a 3.4-meter span, 3 kg system could stay airborne in winds as low as 2.8 m/s (5.5 knots), and travel several times faster than the wind speed. Trim flight requires the ability to fly at extreme low height with the keel immersed in water. For that purpose, a multi-input longitudinal flight controller that leverages fast flap actuation is presented. The flight maneuver is demonstrated experimentally.
