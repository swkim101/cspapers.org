Companion robots are more and more taking the role of caregivers for elderly people. Elderly people sometimes take the advice given by their family members or caregivers as a criticism. In this context, persuasive communication skills could be helpful. A social psychology theory called Regulatory Focus states that people have one of two inclinations when taking decisions: Promotion or Prevention Focus. Also, based on these inclinations, people can be influenced by the way the message is sent, including the speed of the speech and the amplitude of body gestures. In this paper, we analyze the influence of Regulatory Focus on a negotiation scenario, using 3 conditions: (1) a robot with a promotion behavior, (2) a robot with a prevention behavior, and (3) a robot with a neutral behavior. Our results support the results found in the psychology literature related to Regulatory Focus, suggesting that Promotion participants were more influenced by the robot showing a Promotion based behavior. Moreover, Prevention participants were more relaxed on the condition with the robot showing a Prevention based behavior, and accepted the biggest concession between the initial and final offer.
