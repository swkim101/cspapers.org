In this paper, a geometric and unified model of soft-rigid multi-body systems is presented, based on a discrete Cosserat approach of the soft-body dynamics. The model is in fact a generalization to soft and hybrid systems of the geometric theory of rigid robotics characterized by the exponential map. A generalization of the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm is also presented, able to solve inverse and forward dynamic problems with linear $O(N)$ complexity. The proposed model provides several improvements with respect to the existing flexible multi-body models, which make it particularly suitable to study the dynamics of modern soft robots as shown for a multi-body system inspired by motile bacteria.
