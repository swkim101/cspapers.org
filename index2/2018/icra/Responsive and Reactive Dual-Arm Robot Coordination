The need for temporal and spatial coordination of two robot arms moving independently in a shared workspace frequently arises in industrial and service-oriented robotics alike. Today, this problem is often solved manually, leading to a negative impact on user experience as well as on execution performance. In this paper, we present an algorithm that is able to automatically coordinate independently planned motions of a dual-arm manipulator during execution. In addition, the algorithm is capable of refining the plan upon receiving new motion commands during the robot motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on an ABB YuMi robot working on an industrial palletizing task.
