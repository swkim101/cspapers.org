Balance control to recover from a wide range of disturbances is an important skill for humanoid robots. Traditionally, researchers have often designed a balance controller by applying optimal control theory on a simplified model that abstracts the full-body dynamics. However, the resulting controller may not be able to recover from unexpected scenarios such as non-planar pushes, or fail to exploit full-body actions such as balancing with arm movements. This paper presents a learning framework for enhancing the performance of a model-based optimal controller by expanding the region of attraction (RoA). We train a control policy that generates additional control signals on top of the model-based controller using deep reinforcement learning techniques. Instead of relying on standard reinforcement learning formulations, we explicitly model the region of attraction and continuously adjust it during the training. By drawing the training disturbances at the boundary of the RoA, we can effectively expand the RoA while avoiding local minima. We test our learning framework for in-place balancing as well as balancing with stepping on a humanoid model in simulation.
