Fabrication of vascular network is an important research for transporting required nutrients and oxygen to the artificial tissues. In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a hepatic lobule-like vascular network in a 3D cellular structure. The network is simply constructed by three types of veins, central vein, portal vein, and sinusoids. To realize these kinds veins, we utilize two different sizes of steel rods and magnetic fibers for delivering nutrients in 3D cellular structure. Alginate gel fibers embedding ferrite particles are prepared as the same length and are magnetized by magnetizer at 3T. A magnetic tweezer with seven poles is proposed to generate sufficient forces that can manipulate magnetized fibers. Here, two types of rods are magnetized to different magnetic poles in order to attract opposite the end of fibers. This manipulation process is performed in fibrinogen and thrombin solution with liver cells (RLC-18). After solidification of the solution, we deposit solutions with cells and fibers repeatedly, and therefore, a multi-layered structure can be constructed. In addition, we investigate cell a viability in fibrin gel according to the depth of the gel. The result is that the deeper the depth of the gel is, the lower the cell viability is. The cell viability is conducted in several condition. As a result, at the low temperature (here at 22 Â°C), the viability of cell is increased.
