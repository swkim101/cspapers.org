This paper is concerned with system identification and the calibration of parameters of dynamic models used in different robotic platforms. A constant time algorithm has been developed in order to automatically calibrate the parameters of a high-fidelity dynamical model for a robotic platform. The presented method is capable of choosing informative motion segments in order to calibrate model parameters in constant time while also calculating a confidence level on each estimated parameter. Simulations and experiments with a â…› th scale four wheel drive vehicle are performed to calibrate two of the parameters of test vehicle which demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the approach.
