Let u, v ε R^Ω_+ be positive unit vectors and Sε R^Ω×Ω_+ be a symmetric substochastic matrix. For an integer t≥ 0, let m_t = 〈 v, S^t u〉, which we view as the heat measured by v after an initial heat configuration u is let to diffuse for t time steps according to S. Since S is entropy improving, one may intuit that m_t should not change too rapidly over time. We give the following formalizations of this intuition. We prove that m_t+2 ≥ m_t^1+2/t, an inequality studied earlier by Blakley and Dixon (also Erdos and Simonovits) for u=v and shown true under the restriction m_t≥ e-4t. Moreover we prove that for any ε>0, a stronger inequality m_t+2 ≥ t^1-ε ⋅ m_t^1+2/t holds unless m_t+2m_t-2≥ δ m_t^2 for some δ that depends on ε only. Phrased differently, ∀ ε> 0, ∃δ> 0 such that ∀S, u, v m_t+2/m_t^1+2/t≥ min{t^1-ε}, δm_t^1-2/t/m_t-2}, ∀t ≥ 2, which can be viewed as a truncated log-convexity statement. Using this inequality, we answer two related open questions in complexity theory: Any property tester for k-linearity requires Ω(klog k). queries and the randomized communication complexity of the k-Hamming distance problem is Ω(k log k). Further we show that any randomized parity decision tree computing k-Hamming weight has size exp(Ω(k log k)).
