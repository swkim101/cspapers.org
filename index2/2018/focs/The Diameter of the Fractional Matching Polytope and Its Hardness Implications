The (combinatorial) diameter of a polytope P ⊆ ⊆ R^d is the maximum value of a shortest path between a pair of vertices on the 1-skeleton of P, that is the graph where the nodes are given by the 0-dimensional faces of P, and the edges are given the 1-dimensional faces of P. The diameter of a polytope has been studied from many different perspectives, including a computational complexity point of view. In particular, [Frieze and Teng, 1994] showed that computing the diameter of a polytope is (weakly) NP-hard. In this paper, we show that the problem of computing the diameter is strongly NP-hard even for a polytope with a very simple structure: namely, the fractional matching polytope. We also show that computing a pair of vertices at maximum shortest path distance on the 1-skeleton of this polytope is an APX-hard problem. We prove these results by giving an exact characterization of the diameter of the fractional matching polytope, that is of independent interest.
