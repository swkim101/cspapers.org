From a pragmatic perspective: In practice, under-fitted samples are often more problematic than those over-fitted samples. As such, one may consider introducing some re-weighting mechanism, or something equivalent (as we did implicitly in the present work), to encourage the model to focus more on the low evidence samples. From a mathematical perspective: Existing evidence bounds are almost exclusively based on the Jensen inequality, which implies the variational gap can be improved with a less convex transform. From a physical perspective: Many physical systems respect the maximal entropy principle, that the most probable system state is the one with the highest entropy (largest uncertainty) under the constrains. Intuitively, a system with a more balance likelihood configuration yields higher entropy. Generalized Evidence Lower Bounds (GLBO)
