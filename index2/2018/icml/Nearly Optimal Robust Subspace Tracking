In recently submitted work, we studied the robust subspace tracking (RST) problem and obtained one of the first two provable guarantees for it. The goal of RST is to track sequentially arriving data vectors that lie in a slowly changing low-dimensional subspace, while being robust to corruption by additive sparse outliers. It can also be interpreted as a dynamic (time-varying) extension of robust PCA (RPCA), with the minor difference that RST also requires a short tracking delay. We proposed a recursive projected compressive sensing (ReProCS) based algorithm called Nearly Optimal RST via Re-ProCS (ReProCS-NORST) because it could track a changing subspace with near-optimal delay. We proved that it solves both the RST and the dynamic RPCA problems under weakened standard RPCA assumptions, two simple extra assumptions (slow subspace change and most outlier magnitudes lower bounded), and a few minor statistical assumptions. In earlier work, we studied another ReProCS based algorithm that needed a stronger slow subspace change assumption (allowed only one subspace direction to change at each change time), but a weaker lower bound on outlier magnitudes. In this work, we prove a generalization of our earlier guarantee for NORST that includes both the previous guarantees as special cases.
