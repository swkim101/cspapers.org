Cyber-physical systems such as autonomous vehicles need to process and analyze multiple simultaneous streams of sensor data in real-time. Therefore, these systems require powerful multi-core platforms with hardware accelerators such as GP-GPUs. These accelerators generally consume significant amounts of power. Therefore, power management is required to ensure that task deadlines are met while staying within the energy and thermal constraints of the system. In these systems, most tasks execute using a combination of CPU and accelerator resources. Hence, the power of the CPU and the accelerator needs to be managed in tandem. To reduce energy consumption, commercially-available accelerators such as GP-GPUs and DSPs expose interfaces to scale their operating voltage and frequency. Hence, we propose the CycleTandem static frequency-scaling technique to co-optimize the operating frequencies of both the CPU and the hardware accelerator. Based on practical considerations of real-world platforms, we consider various energy-management scenarios where the accelerator or CPU frequencies may or may not be adjustable, and propose the CycleSolo family of algorithms for such contexts. Furthermore, we also study partitioning techniques to reduce the operating frequency when multi-core processors are used in conjunction with hardware accelerators. Experimental evaluations indicate that our proposed techniques can yield significant energy savings. We also present a case-study on the NVIDIA TX2 embedded platform to illustrate the energy savings delivered by our proposed techniques.
