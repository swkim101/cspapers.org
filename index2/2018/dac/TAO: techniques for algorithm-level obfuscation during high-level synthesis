Intellectual Property (IP) theft costs semiconductor design companies billions of dollars every year. Unauthorized IP copies start from reverse engineering the given chip. Existing techniques to protect against IP theft aim to hide the ICâ€™s functionality, but focus on manipulating the HDL descriptions. We propose TAO as a comprehensive solution based on high-level synthesis to raise the abstraction level and apply algorithmic obfuscation automatically. TAO includes several transformations that make the component hard to reverse engineer during chip fabrication, while a key is later inserted to unlock the functionality. Finally, this is a promising approach to obfuscate large-scale designs despite the hardware overhead needed to implement the obfuscation.
