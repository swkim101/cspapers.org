Modern high-level languages bring compelling productivity benefits to hardware design and verification. For example, hardware generation and simulation frameworks (HGSFs) use a single “host” language for parameterization, static elaboration, test bench generation, behavioral modeling, and simulation. Unfortunately, HGSFs often suffer from slow simulator performance which undermines their potential productivity benefits. In this paper, we introduce Mamba, a new Python-based HGSF that co-optimizes both the framework and a general-purpose just-in-time compiler. We conduct a quantitative comparison of Mamba vs. traditional and emerging hardware development frameworks across both simple and complex designs. Our results suggest Mamba is able to match the performance of commercial Verilog simulators and is 10 × faster than existing HGSFs while still maintaining the productivity of using a high-level language in hardware design.
