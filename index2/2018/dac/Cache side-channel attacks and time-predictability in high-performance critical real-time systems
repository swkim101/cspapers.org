Embedded computers control an increasing number of systems directly interacting with humans, while also manage more and more personal or sensitive information. As a result, both safety and security are becoming ubiquitous requirements in embedded computers, and automotive is not an exception to that. In this paper we analyze time-predictability (as an example of safety concern) and side-channel attacks (as an example of security issue) in cache memories. While injecting randomization in cache timing-behavior addresses each of those concerns separately, we show that randomization solutions for time-predictability do not protect against side-channel attacks and vice-versa. We then propose a randomization solution to achieve both safety and security goals.
