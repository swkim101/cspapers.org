The increasingly high display resolution of mobile devices imposes a further burden on energy consumption. Existing schemes manage either OLED or GPU power to save energy. This paper presents the design, algorithm, and implementation of a co-managing scheme called Duet, which automatically trades off perceptual quality for energy efficiency in accordance with static and dynamic visual acuity when users interact with mobile applications. The results of experiments conducted on a commercial smartphone with popular interactive apps show that Duet saves more energy while retaining better visual quality, compared with a joint scheme that simultaneously uses dynamic pixel disabling and dynamic resolution scaling to save OLED and GPU energy in isolation.
