In order to inform ongoing efforts to broaden participation in computing, this study examines a CS initiative which provides a three summer sequence of rigorous, culturally relevant, and project based exposure opportunities for underrepresented secondary school students of color. Previous studies demonstrated that the CS initiative increased the rate of majoring in CS in college more than eight fold. This study uses quantitative data from the summer 2017 CS program and subsequent CS academic year data to examine persistence in CS on a more granular scale. In particular, instructional practices, social and emotional learning outcomes, and course taking data are examined to understand the factors which increase student persistence in taking secondary computer science courses. Findings include a significant relationship between social and emotional learning outcomes and persistence in CS for underrepresented students of color and the importance of student participation and relevant assignments to the development of resilience in CS. A handout will also be given to poster audiences in order to stimulate discussion, exchange best practices within the CS education research community, and to contribute to the growing evidence base to broaden participation in CS.
