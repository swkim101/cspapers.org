This lighting talk provides a literature review that supports the concept that small failures can have a positive effect on learning compared with more traditional scaffolding techniques that prevent students from failing. From a sociocultural approach to education, scaffolding is provided through mediated dialogue within the students' zone of proximal development (ZDP) to minimize failure. However, productive failure has been found to promote wider exploration and to provide deeper learning experiences by assisting learners to self-identify knowledge gaps. Related to the idea of scaffolding in teaching, is the concept of task difficulty. Selecting problem-solving tasks that are neither too difficult nor too easy is critical in assisting learning as this reduces learner frustration and can foster development of learner self-efficacy. Many issues need to be addressed when exploring the ideal mediated task difficulty including: (1) how to assess learners' ZDP, (2) how to find an adequate balance between challenging tasks that seek to traverse learners' ZPD and the degree and type of failure they can trigger, and (3) how to provide support to learn from experienced failure. Our first goal, in collaboration with interdisciplinary multi-institutional partners, is to design sequenced activities that ask students to attempt a problem-solving task prior to any instruction/scaffolding activities usually provided to guide task completion. This will trigger foreseeable small failures, which can be used as learning opportunities. Note that this approach may not only foster learning, as observed at high school level, but also build resilience.
