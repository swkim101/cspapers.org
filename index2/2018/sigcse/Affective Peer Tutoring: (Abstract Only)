Increasing women's representation in computer science (CS) has become a national priority. One of the many reasons female students nationwide choose not to finish their study in CS is that they do not feel a deep sense of belonging in the major. To foster the sense of belonging among female CS students, the affective learning outcomes, which are adapted from Bloom's Taxonomy on human learning, are integrated into the context of peer tutoring as five successive stages. Through the five stages of affective peer tutoring, students gradually deepen their sense of belonging in CS by: (1) being aware of the tutoring services; (2) proactively seeking answers to their programming questions; (3) recognizing the value of self-efficacy; (4) discussing learning issues in a supportive environment; and (5) contributing to a peer-led learning program to help others. Our data indicate that affective peer tutoring has resulted in an increased level of peer-to-peer interaction outside of the classrooms, significantly better grade performance in introductory programming courses, and improved retention rate among female CS students. Therefore, this poster may be of interest to any CS educator who wishes to improve the interaction, performance, and retention among female CS students while sustaining a peer-led learning program at their institution.
