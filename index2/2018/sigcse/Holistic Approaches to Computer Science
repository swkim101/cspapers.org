Computer science curricula has been well defined for many years through the publication of the Computer Science Curricula reports developed jointly by the two major professional societies, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society. These documents define computer science curricula by providing knowledge areas and course exemplars. The most recent curriculum report, the Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CSC13 [1]), provides 18 knowledge areas (KAs). Though it stresses that KAs do not necessary represent courses, computer science departments have traditionally created courses around the KAs. Indeed, the course exemplars presented in the CSC13 report, for the most part, center around KAs.
