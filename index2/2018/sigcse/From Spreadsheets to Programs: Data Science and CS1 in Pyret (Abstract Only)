Data Science is at the center of many current curricular efforts. It is emerging as an integrated field that has far-reaching and important applications, from news media to policy making to business. While these applications can provide compelling uses of computer science techniques, an introduction to one is not an introduction to the other. How do topics like data structures and program design emerge from data science applications? How do we transition from data science applications to computer science topics? How can data science be integrated into other contexts with little overhead? This workshop presents assignments and curricula designed to answer these questions, and tools that support them.
