There is no doubt that Computer Organization (Comp Org) is not as central a topic as it once was. In the ACM's curricular guidelines, the number of hours devoted to Computer Architecture and Organization has fallen from 36 core hours in 2001 and 2008 to 16 tier 2 hours in 2013, and, incredibly, students are not always as enthralled with the subject as their instructor. Therefore, we are compelled to ask? what to do about Comp Org? How might we revamp it to make it more relevant and appealing? Should we concentrate on one ISA? Use CISC, RISC, or both? Do we need to use real, contemporary hardware, or stick with simulators? More radically, can micro-controllers, used for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, be used to broaden the course, to weave together both traditional Comp Org topics and IoT?
