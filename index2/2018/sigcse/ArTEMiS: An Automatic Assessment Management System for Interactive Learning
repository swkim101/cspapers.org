The increasing number of students in computer science courses leads to high efforts in manual assessment of exercises. Existing assessment systems are not designed for exercises with immediate feedback in large classes. In this paper, we present an AuTomated assEssment Management System for interactive learning. ArTEMiS assesses solutions to programming exercises automatically and provides instant feedback so that students can iteratively solve the exercise. It is open source and highly scalable based on version control, regression testing and continuous integration. ArTEMiS offers an online code editor with interactive exercise instructions, is programming language independent and applicable to a variety of computer science courses. By using it, students gain experiences in version control, dependency management and continuous integration. We used ArTEMiS in 3 university and 1 online courses and report about our experiences. We figured out that ArTEMiS is suitable for beginners, helps students to realize their progress and to gradually improve their solutions. It reduces the effort of instructors and enhances the learning experience of students.
