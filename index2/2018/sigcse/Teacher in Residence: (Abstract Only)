As CS for All initiatives expand in K-12 districts across the country, there is a need to create ongoing teacher support and training. Cornell Tech's Teacher in Residence program builds computational agency. Agency is often defined as the power to freely act and make choices. The Teacher in Residence program seeks to build the agency of school administrators, teachers, and students to make choices about CS education and to act on them based on a foundation of content knowledge rather than programs bound to specific tools or individuals. The Teacher in Residence program is grounded in evidence-based practices, but has made unique adaptations in order to support teachers who are new to CS content. The writers will share practices, learnings, and preliminary outcomes from the first year and a half of the program. His data includes qualitative measures of teacher confidence, agency, and accuracy as well as initial data on student engagement and generalization. The Teacher in Residence program includes K-8 teachers who are incorporating CS instruction into their classrooms. In this program, a master teacher is embedded in a school community for a limited amount of time to coach teachers, offer professional development, and consult with the administration about implementation. It focuses on three elements: content proficiency, appropriate pedagogy, and giving equitable access to all students. Handouts will be provided.
