Due to the ongoing demand for cybersecurity professionals, universities have begun to step up to the challenge of providing degrees in cybersecurity or related disciplines. However, growth in academic programs has been unfocused, in part because there is no standard definition of what a cybersecurity undergraduate program should contain and no cohesive community of practice with which those programs are aligned. This session is intended to establish dialog intended to lead to a community of practice for undergraduate cybersecurity education. The presenters will briefly review prior efforts in defining cybersecurity at the collegiate level, including the Centers for Academic Excellence (CAE), National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), Cyber Education Project, CSEC2017 curricular guidelines and ABET cybersecurity accreditation. Session participants will examine current efforts, explore the development of a cybersecurity community of practice, and get clarity about where their own efforts fit into overall computing education.
