Spatial reasoning skills are highly predictive of STEM achievement and self-efficacy, yet they are not often part of computer science curricula. In an effort to support spatial reasoning and STEM development, we have created several activities using SASÂ® CodeSnaps, a free coding environment that brings coding to the physical world through 3-dimensional problem solving and tangible coding blocks. In these activities students represent and navigate real-world obstacle courses in order to solve coding challenges. Tangible coding blocks allow students to organize and interact with code in ways that both build upon and use spatial reasoning skills. These blocks are then scanned and executed by a robot -- bringing their code, and any mistakes, off the screen and into the real world. Together these features offer opportunities for developing spatial reasoning while using existing skills in support of CS learning. This approach meets students where they are; thinking, engaging and interacting with the physical world.
