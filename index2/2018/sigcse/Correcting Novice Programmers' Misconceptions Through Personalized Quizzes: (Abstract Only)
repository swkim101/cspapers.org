Introductory programming students unable to grasp and apply abstract concepts are known to become disengaged and drop out of the course. The large class sizes, increasing diversity and inadequate teaching support have exacerbated the problems leading to failure rates as high as 50% in exams. To address this issue, we employed a novel learning analytics technique named Personalized Prescriptive Quiz (PPQ). Our approach combined the rich metadata captured for each question including topic, cognitive level, difficulty index, and the underlying concepts(s) with individual student performance in the past to arrive at personalized learning pathways designed to correct the root-causes for their misunderstandings. Over 90% of surveyed students agreed that the PPQ has been effective in clarifying their misconceptions before the final exam. Following our experiments, the exam pass rate has gone up by over 40%.
