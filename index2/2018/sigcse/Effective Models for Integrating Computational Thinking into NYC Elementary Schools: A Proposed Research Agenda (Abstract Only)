Initial research shows the promise of instructional and learning benefits for students when computational thinking is effectively integrated across the curriculum. Benefits include building higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills, creating real-world applied contexts, and enabling students to create, produce and interact with information. These are critical levers to wide adoption. To address this challenge, in partnership with the Education Development Center, we have developed a three-year study in which we will work closely with five high-poverty New York City elementary schools that, with the help of an external implementation partner, are trying out distinctly different approaches to integrating CT into elementary instruction, in order to understand how those models work in various contexts, and which models may be particularly effective.Our poster will display the proposed integration model of our first demonstration site as well as the indicators and instruments we are using to understand how this model works.
