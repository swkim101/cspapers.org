Broadening participation in computing education for K-12 students requires all levels of the education system to collaborate on five critical needs: 1) creating diverse student opportunities and access to CS activities; 2) empowering highly qualified, highly skilled CS teachers; 3) developing relevant and accessible CS courses and curricula; 4) establishing CS policy and leadership at the local and state levels; and 5) engaging communities and industry partners in broadening participation in CS.
