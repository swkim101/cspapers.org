What is needed to help CS professors teach their students about the fundamental concepts of accessible design? How can every CS student become competent in the development of mainstream technologies that meet the needs of people with disabilities? Society is demanding such capabilities and companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Oath (Yahoo), Adobe, and Google are today working with major universities to assure that new hires graduate college with this essential skillset. The Teach Access project is actively addressing the barriers, incentives and mechanisms through curriculum change, influencing accreditation, faculty bootcamps, industry guest lectures, online tutorials, and student engagement programs. What works for you and how can more university and faculty champions be engaged?
