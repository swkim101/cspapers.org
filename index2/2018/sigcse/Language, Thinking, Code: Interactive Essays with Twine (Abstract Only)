Bard College introduces all incoming students to computing through a coding module in its long established writing-intensive program, Language and Thinking (L&T). The L&T program is a mandatory three-week experience for first-year students that has taken place every year at the college since 1981. We present a new version of the computing module that focuses on introducing all first-year students to computer programming through the lens of literature and creative writing. We designed and implemented an interactive text-based game that taught the basics of computer programming using Twine. After playing the game, students attended an undergraduate-led workshop where they transformed paper-based writing pieces into interactive essays in Twine that execute code. We discuss the outcomes of the module and also evaluate the design of a coding experience designed to meet the needs of a writing-intensive course.
