1.SUMMARY This special session will focus on a multi-year project based on an AAC&U Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM (TIDES) grant focused on integrating Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) in Computer Science courses at Montgomery College, a highly diverse urban-suburban community college in Maryland. The presenters will discuss the project's development of a CRT model based on a "Discover-Adjust-Assess" process that took into account the realities of the college's faculty and student contexts. Attendees will participate in awareness-raising activities, analyze case studies involving common teaching-learning challenges using CRT-based concepts and tools, and be presented with sample data in the form of student/faculty survey results and interview responses. Several CRT resources created as part of the project will also be presented.
