This panel will include experience reports from five computer science faculty members who have team-taught courses with professors from outside the sciences. Specifically, we will discuss lessons learned and best practices with collaborating with faculty from the arts and humanities. Courses that look outward have the potential to broaden participation and promote computing's role in the broader world beyond software engineering concerns. The panelists will highlight how to: find a topic, find a collaborator(s), design the course, maintain rigor in both disciplines, target the right audience, assess how well it worked, and do it more than once.
