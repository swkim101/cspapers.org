Experience for yourself an unplugged active learning experience to understand how arrays are stored in memory differently than linked-lists. You will participate in a short demo just as my students experience this exercise, to gain a fuller understanding of how to apply this in your own classroom. Each student receives a card with a memory address. Inside the card, if it is allocated for a linked list then there is a letter and a next pointer; if it is part of an array there is just the letter. First the students with addresses for the array stand up; acknowledge how they are all contiguous in memory. Next, the student with a head pointer stands up and calls out the address they are pointing to. The student with that address on their card stands up, and calls out the address of their pointer. This continues until a student calls out their pointer is NULL. Now acknowledge how distributed through memory a linked-list can be! Come see how powerful learning can be with this physically engaging exercise! Successfully used in classes up to 200 students.
