Across the world there has been a paradigm shift in school education, as many countries are incorporating Computer Science (CS), programming, and Computational Thinking (CT), into their K-12 curriculums for the first time. In 2018 these subjects will be introduced to the New Zealand (NZ) Digital Technologies curriculum under the subject of "Computational Thinking". Like the majority of countries who have introduced these topics, NZ faces challenges in preparing teachers, and in successfully implementing a curriculum which achieves its educational goals. To support this curriculum, we have been conducting studies in primary schools across NZ, trialing resources with teachers and students. Building on a 2014 exploratory study on CS and programming in intermediate school, this project investigates the existing assumptions around CT education in K-12. It aims to address the specific questions: How do we teach CT concepts and approaches to primary aged students? If they learn CT, does it have the expected positive impacts on students learning? And, what other positive and negative impacts does this have? Throughout 2015 and 2016 a study was conducted with 18 primary school teachers from across NZ, who used CS Unplugged and educational programming languages in their classrooms. Teachers submitted feedback on these classes through an online form, and participated in semi-structured interviews. The feedback responses and interview transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach, which revealed many positive impacts on students general learning, minimal negative impacts, and observations of CT development.
