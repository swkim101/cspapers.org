Current tools required for teaching computer science at any level of education are expensive and require a dedicated lab. With an increasing desire for early computer science education, pairing with the expensive costs for computers, there is an increasing need for a solution. In this paper, I will investigate a mobile-based solution to more effectively, both educationally and financially, solve this problem. I will describe the system and how it could be used as an effective solution.
