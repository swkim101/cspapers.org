ntroductory computer networks courses often include descriptive coverage of the network protocol headers. A straightforward listing of the headers and their meanings can lead to questions like "Will this be on the test"? Programming exercises may involve selecting values for some aspects of a protocol but tend to abstract away the details, and depend on prior programming skills. In addition, campuses without dedicated network lab facilities may have limited ability to experiment with protocols on an existing institutional network. The Python-based Scapy package provides explicit, detailed control of the contents of header fields, and includes graphical visualization features that offer easy feedback. Programming ability is helpful but not necessary; the interactive Python environment permits step-by-step and guided exploration of the various protocols. Effective use of scapy requires root (administrator) privileges; a virtual machine environment such as that provided by Oracle VirtualBox allows complete control and access to the operating system. This talk is about scapy-based lab modules that the author is developing, which provide active, hands-on exposure to and manipulation of network headers. So far, a Transport-layer activity and a preliminary Link-layer activity have been written. The current activities will be discussed, along with ideas for additional modules.
