Computing is not neutral. The way that we collect and manipulate data, the decisions that are programmed into autonomous devices, even the ways that we use each other's code reflects someone's values. Because technology has more and more influence in society, consideration of these values should be a part of a Computer Science student's education. The ACM/IEEE 2013 Curricula Guidelines for Computer Science programs reflects this imperative. The writers of the document suggest that between 11 and 16 of the core hours be devoted to Social Issues and Professional Practice. Where and how should we include the essential discussions of values, ethical considerations, social issues, and professional practice in the curricula? Should a whole course be devoted to the topic? If so, when in the program should it appear? Should we instead incorporate values topics related to the subject matter in each computing course? If so how? Perhaps we should leave the discussion to the philosophers or ethicists on campus. Will our students then be able to make the connection between computing and general ethics/values frameworks? Which aspects of values judgments should be addressed? Can we generalize in a way that will still apply to future advances in our fields? We'd like to hear from you.
