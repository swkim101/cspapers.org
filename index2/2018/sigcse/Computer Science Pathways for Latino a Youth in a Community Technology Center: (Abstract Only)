Latino/a youth are interested in computer science, but studies show they have less access to computers and role models, and lower confidence to pursue computer science activities than their peers in the US. Little is known about how to create learning environments outside of school that attract and retain Latino/a youth who come with a range of computer science interest, preparation, and resources. This poster will describe how one community technology center in a low income rural community provides opportunities and supports for students to pursue technical education and work experiences, and the role it plays in creating computer science (CS) pathways. Survey data from 97 high school students were used to describe variations in students' motivation to participate at the center, how those motivations change over time, and the factors that contribute to students entering a CS pathway. Interviews with 20 students were used to identify the different ways that students entered a CS pathway, including the influence of natural mentors, relationships with peers, and digital badges, as well as the factors that prevent them from participating in computational activities. The data were used to generate case studies that provide an in-depth look at the factors that promote or undermine CS pathways over time. The findings have implications for designing learning ecologies that support high school students from under resourced communities to enter and stay on computer science pathways.
