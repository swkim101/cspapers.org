The underrepresentation of women, students of color, and people from lower-SES (socio-economic-status) backgrounds within computer science remains a national issue. Recent studies demonstrate one reason: persistent stereotypes about "who does computer science" can cause minority groups to preclude interest in the field. Unfortunately, these stereotypes are not the only threat to diversifying the discipline. Engaging a diverse group of individuals in computer science is unlikely so long as computing curriculum is perceived as "irrelevant" and "asocial/". Confronting the stigma of triviality applied to computer science, much like approaching student perceptions about who can do computer science, is a necessary step for increasing the perceived applicability of the discipline. As a step in combating the perception that programming curriculum is irrelevant, we developed and ran a week-long summer coding camp for local middle school students that camp applied principles of computing for social good with data science approaches to encourage campers to consider how computing could help them explore societal issues. Throughout the week, campers learned how to extract meaning from their work and gained experience collaborating in pairs to solve problems. In this poster, we discuss the camp curriculum and its emphasis on the applications of computing. We consider the effects of the camp on the self-efficacy of campers and their perceptions of computer science. We then present some recommendations for those intending to conduct similar camps.
