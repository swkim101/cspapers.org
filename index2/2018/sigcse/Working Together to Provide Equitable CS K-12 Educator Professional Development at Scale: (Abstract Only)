The demand for CS teacher professional development (PD) is increasing rapidly, but not all education stakeholders are equipped to identify CS PD needs, evaluate CS PD options, and track teacher and student outcomes. In this BOF, representatives of Google's CS educator PD grant program (formerly CS4HS) will share conclusions from the 2016 PD grant cycle and a recent literature review. Participants will discuss how the CS education community can disseminate knowledge about CS PD to the communities that need it most. At SIGCSE 2017, Google discussed CS PD best practices and common successes and challenges in creating sustainable PD programs. This year, we will discuss how to equitably scale these best practices so that education stakeholders are equipped to implement quality CS education, ensuring all students have quality CS learning experiences. This session is intended to be highly interactive and solution-oriented. Discussion themes and outcomes will be documented and shared with attendees.
