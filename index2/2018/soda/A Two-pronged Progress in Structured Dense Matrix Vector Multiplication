Matrix-vector multiplication is one of the most fundamental computing primitives. Given a matrix A ∈ F N × N and a vector b ∈ F N , it is known that in the worst case Θ(N 2) operations over F are needed to compute Ab. Many types of structured matrices do admit faster multiplication. However, even given a matrix A that is known to have this property, it is hard in general to recover a representation of A exposing the actual fast multiplication algorithm. Additionally, it is not known in general whether the inverses of such structured matrices can be computed or multiplied quickly. A broad question is thus to identify classes of structured dense matrices that can be represented with O(N) parameters, and for which matrix-vector multiplication (and ideally other operations such as solvers) can be performed in a sub-quadratic number of operations. One such class of structured matrices that admit near-linear matrix-vector multiplication are the orthogonal polynomial transforms whose rows correspond to a family of orthogonal polynomials. Other well known classes include the Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, Cauchy matrices and their extensions (e.g. confluent Cauchy-like matrices) that are all special cases of a low displacementrank property. In this paper, we make progress on two fronts: Our work unifies, generalizes, and simplifies existing state-of-the-art results in structured matrix-vector multiplication. Finally, we show how applications in areas such as multipoint evaluations of multivariate polynomials can be reduced to problems involving low recurrence width matrices.
