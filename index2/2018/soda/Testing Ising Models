Given samples from an unknown multivariate distribution <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, is it possible to distinguish whether <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the product of its marginals versus <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula> being far from every product distribution? Similarly, is it possible to distinguish whether <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula> equals a given distribution <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula> versus <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula> being far from each other? These problems of testing independence and goodness-of-fit have received enormous attention in statistics, information theory, and theoretical computer science, with sample-optimal algorithms known in several interesting regimes of parameters. Unfortunately, it has also been understood that these problems become intractable in large dimensions, necessitating exponential sample complexity. Motivated by the exponential lower bounds for general distributions as well as the ubiquity of Markov random fields (MRFs) in the modeling of high-dimensional distributions, we initiate the study of distribution testing on <italic>structured</italic> multivariate distributions, and in particular, the prototypical example of MRFs: <italic>the Ising Model</italic>. We demonstrate that, in this structured setting, we can avoid the curse of dimensionality, obtaining sample, and time efficient testers for independence and goodness-of-fit. One of the key technical challenges we face along the way is bounding the variance of functions of the Ising model.
