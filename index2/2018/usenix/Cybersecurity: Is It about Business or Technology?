If recent events involving the security of information and operations have taught us anything, it is that cybersecurity and the way cybersecurity risks are managed are no longer solely the domain of computer scientists.  Cybersecurity risk management issues are becoming increasingly familiar topics in C-suites and boardrooms. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began its program almost 50 years ago focusing on both advanced technologies as well as cybersecurity risk management. Today, NIST conducts foundational and applied cybersecurity research to produce and advance cybersecurity standards, best practices, measurements, and reference resources to address this fundamental question—is cybersecurity about business or technology?
