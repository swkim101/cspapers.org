Investigating attacks across multiple hosts is challenging.  The true dependencies between security-sensitive
files, network endpoints, or memory objects from different  hosts can be easily concealed by dependency explosion  or undefined program behavior (e.g., memory
corruption). Dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT is a potential solution to this problem, but, existing DIFT techniques only track information flow within a single host and lack an efficient mechanism to maintain and synchronize the data flow tags globally across multiple hosts.In this paper, we propose RTAG, an efficient data flow tagging and tracking mechanism that enables practical cross-host attack investigations. RTAG is based on three novel techniques. First, by using a record-and-replay technique,  it decouples the dependencies between different
data flow tags from the analysis, enabling lazy synchronization  between independent and parallel DIFT instances
of different hosts. Second, it takes advantage of system call-level provenance information to calculate and allocate the optimal tag map in terms of memory consumption Third, it embeds tag information into network packets to track cross-host data flows with less than 0.05% network bandwidth overhead. Evaluation results show that RTAG is able to recover the true data flows of realistic cross-hos attack scenarios. Performance wise, RTAG reduces the memory consumption of DIFT-based analysis by up to 90% and decreases the overall analysis time by 60%â€“90% compared with previous investigation systems.
