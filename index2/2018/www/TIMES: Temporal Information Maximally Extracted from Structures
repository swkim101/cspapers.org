Aiming at the in-depth cognition for comprehensive armaments knowledge, an LLM-based construction framework for armament portrait systems is proposed in this study. From massive multi-source data, a large number of static attributes as well as dynamic events are obtained using data crawling technology. Information extraction technology based on LLM is then used to extract numerous structured spatio-temporal information from the raw data. To discover the potential patterns from the structured information, three improved data mining algorithms based on embedding representation are implemented to obtain dynamic labels. This integrated framework combining static labels with dynamic labels provides effective and deep knowledge cognition in various realistic scenarios.
