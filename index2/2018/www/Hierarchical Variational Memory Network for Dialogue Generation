Dialogue systems help various real applications interact with humans in an intelligent natural way. In dialogue systems, the task of dialogue generation aims to generate utterances given previous utterances as contexts. Among various spectrums of dialogue generation approaches, end-to-end neural generation models have received an increase of attention. These end-to-end neural generation models are capable of generating natural-sounding sentences with a unified neural encoder-decoder network structure. The end-to-end structure sequentially encodes each word in an input context and generates the response word-by-word deterministically during decoding. However, lack of variation and limited ability in capturing long-term dependencies between utterances still challenge existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical variational memory network (HVMN), by adding the hierarchical structure and the variational memory network into a neural encoder-decoder network. By emulating human-to-human dialogues, our proposed method can capture both the high-level abstract variations and long-term memories during dialogue tracking, which enables the random access of relevant dialogue histories. Extensive experiments conducted on three large real-world datasets verify a significant improvement of our proposed model against state-of-the-art baselines for dialogue generation.
