Understanding conversations is crucial to enabling conversational search in technologies such as chatbots, digital assistants, and smart home devices that are becoming increasingly popular. Conventional search engines are powerful at answering open domain queries but are mostly capable of stateless search. In this paper, we define a conversational query as a query that depends on the context of the current conversation, and we formulate the conversational query understanding problem as context-aware query reformulation, where the goal is to reformulate the conversational query into a search engine friendly query in order to satisfy usersÂ» information needs in conversational settings. Such context-aware query reformulation problem lends itself to sequence to sequence modeling. We present a large scale open domain dataset of conversational queries and various sequence to sequence models that are learned from this dataset. The best model correctly reformulates over half of all conversational queries, showing the potential of sequence to sequence modeling for this task.
