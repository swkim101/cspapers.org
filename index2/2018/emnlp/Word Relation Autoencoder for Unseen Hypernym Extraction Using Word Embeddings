Lexicon relation extraction given distributional representation of words is an important topic in NLP. We observe that the state-of-the-art projection-based methods cannot be generalized to handle unseen hypernyms. We propose to analyze it in the perspective of pollution and construct the corresponding indicator to measure it. We propose a word relation autoencoder (WRAE) model to address the challenge. Experiments on several hypernym-like lexicon datasets show that our model outperforms the competitors significantly.
