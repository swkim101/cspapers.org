This panel will explore how security topics are integrated into academic programs and future directions for improvements. It will address how early in time security should be introduced in programs like computer science and software engineering; and identify the critical takeaways that each graduating student should learn. We will try to separate out the important, practical concepts from the purely academic ones. We will also consider how well security programs translate to industry-focused needs: do students emerge with an understanding that is both deep and broad enough to be useful? In general, we will try to identify the pitfalls of current security education and how we can move forward as an academic community, in tandem with industry and government.
