We present an approach for simultaneously separating and localizing multiple sound sources using recorded microphone data. Inspired by topic models, our approach is based on a probabilistic model of inter-microphone phase differences, and poses separation and localization as a Bayesian inference problem. We assume sound activity is locally smooth across time, frequency, and location, and use the known position of the microphones to obtain a consistent separation. We compare the performance of our method against existing algorithms on simulated anechoic voice data and find that it obtains high performance across a variety of input conditions.
