We introduce the factored bandits model, which is a framework for learning with limited (bandit) feedback, where actions can be decomposed into a Cartesian product of atomic actions. Factored bandits incorporate rank-1 bandits as a special case, but significantly relax the assumptions on the form of the reward function. We provide an anytime algorithm for stochastic factored bandits and up to constants matching upper and lower regret bounds for the problem. Furthermore, we show how a slight modification enables the proposed algorithm to be applied to utility-based dueling bandits. We obtain an improvement in the additive terms of the regret bound compared to state-of-the-art algorithms (the additive terms are dominating up to time horizons that are exponential in the number of arms).
