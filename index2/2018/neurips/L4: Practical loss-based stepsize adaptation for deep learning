We propose a stepsize adaptation scheme for stochastic gradient descent. It operates directly with the loss function and rescales the gradient in order to make fixed predicted progress on the loss. We demonstrate its capabilities by strongly improving the performance of Adam and Momentum optimizers. The enhanced optimizers with default hyperparameters consistently outperform their constant stepsize counterparts, even the best ones, without a measurable increase in computational cost. The performance is validated on multiple architectures including ResNets and the Differential Neural Computer. A prototype implementation as a TensorFlow optimizer is released.
