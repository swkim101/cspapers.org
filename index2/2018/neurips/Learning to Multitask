Multitask learning has shown promising performance in many applications and many multitask models have been proposed. In order to identify an effective multitask model for a given multitask problem, we propose a learning framework called learning to multitask (L2MT). To achieve the goal, L2MT exploits historical multitask experience which is organized as a training set consists of several tuples, each of which contains a multitask problem with multiple tasks, a multitask model, and the relative test error. Based on such training set, L2MT first uses a proposed layerwise graph neural network to learn task embeddings for all the tasks in a multitask problem and then learns an estimation function to estimate the relative test error based on task embeddings and the representation of the multitask model based on a unified formulation. Given a new multitask problem, the estimation function is used to identify a suitable multitask model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed L2MT framework.
