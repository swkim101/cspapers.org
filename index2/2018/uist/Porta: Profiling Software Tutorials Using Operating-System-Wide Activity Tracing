It can be hard for tutorial creators to get fine-grained feedback about how learners are actually stepping through their tutorials and which parts lead to the most struggle. To provide such feedback for technical software tutorials, we introduce the idea of tutorial profiling, which is inspired by software code profiling. We prototyped this idea in a system called Porta that automatically tracks how users navigate through a tutorial webpage and what actions they take on their computer such as running shell commands, invoking compilers, and logging into remote servers. Porta surfaces this trace data in the form of profiling visualizations that augment the tutorial with heatmaps of activity hotspots and markers that expand to show event details, error messages, and embedded screencast videos of user actions. We found through a user study of 3 tutorial creators and 12 students who followed their tutorials that Porta enabled both the tutorial creators and the students to provide more specific, targeted, and actionable feedback about how to improve these tutorials. Porta opens up possibilities for performing user testing of technical documentation in a more systematic and scalable way.
