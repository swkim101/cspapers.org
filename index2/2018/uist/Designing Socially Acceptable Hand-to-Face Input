Wearable head-mounted displays combine rich graphical output with an impoverished input space. Hand-to-face gestures have been proposed as a way to add input expressivity while keeping control movements unobtrusive. To better understand how to design such techniques, we describe an elicitation study conducted in a busy public space in which pairs of users were asked to generate unobtrusive, socially acceptable hand-to-face input actions. Based on the results, we describe five design strategies: miniaturizing, obfuscating, screening, camouflaging and re-purposing. We instantiate these strategies in two hand-to-face input prototypes, one based on touches to the ear and the other based on touches of the thumbnail to the chin or cheek. Performance assessments characterize time and error rates with these devices. The paper closes with a validation study in which pairs of users experience the prototypes in a public setting and we gather data on the social acceptability of the designs and reflect on the effectiveness of the different strategies.
