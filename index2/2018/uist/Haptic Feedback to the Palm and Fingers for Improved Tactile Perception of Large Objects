When one manipulates a large or bulky object, s/he utilizes tactile information at both fingers and the palm. Our goal is to efficiently convey contact information to a user's hand during interaction with a virtual object. We propose a haptic system that can provide haptic feedback to thumb/middle finger/index finger and on a palm. Our interface design utilizes a novel compact mechanism to provide haptic information to the palm. Also, we propose a haptic rendering strategy to calculate haptic feedback continuously. We demonstrate that cutaneous feedback on the palm improves the haptic perception of a large virtual object compared to when there is only kinesthetic feedback to the fingers.
