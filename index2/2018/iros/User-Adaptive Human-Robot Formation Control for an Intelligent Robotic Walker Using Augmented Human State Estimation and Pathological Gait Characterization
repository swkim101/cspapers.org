In this paper we describe a control strategy for a user-adaptive human-robot system for an intelligent robotic Mobility Assistive Device (MAD)using raw data from a single laser-range-finder (LRF)mounted on the MAD and scanning the walking area. The proposed control architecture consists of three modules. In the first module, a previously proposed methodology (termed IMM-PDA-PF)delivers the augmented human state estimation of the user by providing robust leg tracking and on-line estimation of the human gait phases. This information is processed at the next module for providing the pathological gait parametrization and characterization, by computing specific gait parameters for each gait cycle. These gait parameters form the feature vector that classifies the user in a certain class related to risk of fall. Those are of particular significance to the system, since the gait parameters and the respective class are used in the third module, i.e. the human-robot formation controller, in order to adapt the desired formation of the human-robot system, by selecting the appropriate control variables. The experimental evaluation comprises gait data from real patients, and demonstrates the stability of the human-robot formation control, indicating the importance of incorporating an on-line gait characterization of the user, using non-wearable and non-invasive methods, in the context of a robotic MAD.
