We present a novel approach to automatically identify driver behaviors from vehicle trajectories and use them for safe navigation of autonomous vehicles. We propose a novel set of features that can be easily extracted from car trajectories. We derive a data-driven mapping between these features and six driver behaviors using an elaborate web-based user study. We also compute a summarized score indicating a level of awareness that is needed while driving next to other vehicles. We also incorporate our algorithm into a vehicle navigation simulation system and demonstrate its benefits in terms of safer realtime navigation, while driving next to aggressive or dangerous drivers.
