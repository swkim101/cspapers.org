In recent years, we have observed a clear trend in the rapid rise of autonomous vehicles and robotics. One of the core technologies enabling these applications, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), imposes two main challenges: first, these workloads are computationally intensive and they often have real-time requirements; second, these workloads run on battery-powered mobile devices with limited energy budget. Hence, performance should be improved while simultaneously reducing energy consumption, two rather contradicting goals by conventional wisdom. Previous attempts to optimize SLAM performance and energy efficiency usually involve optimizing one function and fail to approach the problem systematically. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of visual inertial SLAM workloads on existing heterogeneous SoCs. Then based on the initial findings, we propose Ï€-SoC, a heterogeneous SoC design that systematically optimize the IO interface, the memory hierarchy, as well as the the hardware accelerator. We implemented this system on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale MPSoC and was able to deliver over 60 FPS performance with average power less than 5 W.
