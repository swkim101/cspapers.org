Fast inspection and light maintenance capability is already a clear demand to control the tokamak condition and improve the efficiency of the experimental campaigns. EAST remote maintenance system has been developed to implement inspection and grasping tasks during plasma. The paper presents design description of EAMA (EAST articulated maintenance arm) robot, the gripper and the CASK. The field commissioning was performed both in mockup and EAST tokamak to demonstrate the availability and functionalities of EAMA system. To be able to realize fully routine operation on EAST, improvement of EAMA control system was proposed with integration developed algorithm, such as the robot flexible model modeling, vision servo, motion planning, etc. Finally, thoughts for CFETR In-Vessel Inspection System (CIVIS) are given.
