Wheel-legged hybrid robot with multi-modal locomotion can efficiently adapt to different terrain environments, as well as realize rapid maneuver on flat ground. We have developed a novel hydraulic wheel-legged robot (WLR) combined with a humanoid structural design. This robot can assist to emergency scenarios where the high mobility, adaptability and robustness are required. The paper introduces the details of the WLR, highlighting the innovative design and optimization of physical construction which is considered to maximize the mobile abilities, enhance the environmental adaptability and improve the reliability of hydraulic system. Firstly, maximizing the mobile abilities includes optimizing the configuration of each actuator and integrating them with the structure, so as to achieve a large range of movement and also reduce the mass and inertia of the legs. Secondly, the environmental adaptability can be ensured with a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based damper and direct-drive wheels. Thirdly, improving the reliability of hydraulic system involves using the selective laser melting (SLM) technology to integrate hydraulic system and reducing the number of exposed tubes. The maneuverability of the WLR is demonstrated with a series of experiments. At present, the WLR can perform the following operations, including moving on the flat ground, squatting, and picking up a heavy load.
