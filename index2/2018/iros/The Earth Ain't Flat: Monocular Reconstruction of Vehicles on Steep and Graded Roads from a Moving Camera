Accurate localization of other traffic participants is a vital task in autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art systems employ a combination of sensing modalities such as RGB cameras and LiDARs for localizing traffic participants, but monocular localization demonstrations have been confined to plain roads. We demonstrate - to the best of our knowledge - the first results for monocular object localization and shape estimation on surfaces that are non-coplanar with the moving ego vehicle mounted with a monocular camera. We approximate road surfaces by local planar patches and use semantic cues from vehicles in the scene to initialize a local bundle-adjustment like procedure that simultaneously estimates the 3D pose and shape of the vehicles, and the orientation of the local ground plane on which the vehicle stands. We also demonstrate that our approach transfers from synthetic to real data, without any hyperparameter-/fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed approach on the KITTI and SYNTHIA-SF benchmarks, for a variety of road plane configurations. The proposed approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art for monocular object localization on arbitrarily-shaped roads.
