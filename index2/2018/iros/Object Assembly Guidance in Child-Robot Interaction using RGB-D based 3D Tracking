This work examines how and to what benefit an autonomous humanoid robot can supervise a child in an object assembly task. In order to understand the child's actions, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm for RGB-D data is employed. The tracker consists of two stages: the first performs a tracking-by-detection scheme on the color stream, to locate the objects on the image plane, while the second uses a particle filter that operates on the depth data stream to refine the first stage output and infer the objects' rotations. Given the six degrees-of-freedom of the assembly part poses, the system is able to recognize which connections have been completed at any given time. This information is then used to select an appropriate verbal or gestural response for the robot. Experimental results show that (a) the tracking algorithm is accurate, fast and robust to severe occlusions and fast movements, (b) the proposed method of assembly state estimation is indeed effective, and (c) the resulting Child-Robot Interaction scenario is educational and enjoyable for the children involved.
