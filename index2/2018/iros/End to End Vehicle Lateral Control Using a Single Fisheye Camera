Convolutional neural networks are commonly used to control the steering angle for autonomous cars. Most of the time, multiple long range cameras are used to generate lateral failure cases. In this paper we present a novel model to generate this data and label augmentation using only one short range fisheye camera. We present our simulator and how it can be used as a consistent metric for lateral end-to-end control evaluation. Experiments are conducted on a custom dataset corresponding to more than 10000 km and 200 hours of open road driving. Finally we evaluate this model on real world driving scenarios, open road and a custom test track with challenging obstacle avoidance and sharp turns. In our simulator based on real-world videos, the final model was capable of more than 99% autonomy on urban road.
