In this paper, we address the challenge of robotic manipulation of elastically deforming objects. To this end, we model elastic objects using the Finite Element Method. Through a quasi-static assumption, we leverage sensitivity analysis to mathematically model how changes in the robot's configuration affect the deformed shape of the object being manipulated. This enables an interactive, simulation-based control methodology, wherein user-specified deformations for the elastic objects are automatically mapped to joint angle commands. The optimization formulation we introduce is general, operates directly within a robot's workspace and can readily incorporate joint limits as well as collision avoidance between the links. We validate our control methodology on a YuMiÂ® IRB 14000, which we use to manipulate a variety of elastic objects.
