This paper presents a novel sliding mode controller for trajectory tracking of the piezo-driven stage. The tracking performance of piezoelectric actuator is mainly affected by the hysteresis nonlinearity. Sliding mode control is a possible solution to achieve better tracking performance. However, conventional sliding mode control generates discontinuous control signal which results in chattering. Hence, the hysteresis nonlinearity is first compensated with a hysteresis model, and an uncertainty and disturbance estimator is designed and included to devise a smooth control action. The stability of the proposed method is demonstrated via Lyapunov analysis. Both simulation and experiment are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results are compared with a conventional sliding mode controller and a proportional-integral control with notch filter (PIC-NF).
