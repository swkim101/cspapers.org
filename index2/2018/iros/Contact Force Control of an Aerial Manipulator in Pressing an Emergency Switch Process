The dangerous work situation in industrial leakage accidents urgently needs a flexible and small robot to help workers perform operations and to protect them from being injured. An aerial manipulator system consisting of a hexa-rotor UAV and a one-DOF manipulator is developed, and is used to press an emergency switch to shut off machinery in an emergency. In practical application, an aerial manipulator usually performs contact operations as the UAV platform is in hover flight. The hovering UAV acting as a spring-mass-damper system is firstly proved. Then, based on the derived spring-mass-damper system model and the impedance control algorithm, the force-sensorless contact force control method is presented. That is, the force is indirectly controlled through controlling the UAV's position error and pitch angle simultaneously. The practical operation experiment of pressing an emergency button shows that the proposed method is able to control the contact force as the aerial manipulator interacts with the external environment.
