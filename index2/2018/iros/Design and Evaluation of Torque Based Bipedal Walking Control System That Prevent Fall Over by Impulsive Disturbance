In this paper, we develop a bipedal robot control system that has an ability to perform instantaneous high power and flexibility to absorb an impulsive disturbance. We utilize a sensor-less whole body torque control method executed in a high responsive realtime distributed system. This system also includes a robust online walking controller that can avoid fall over caused by a strong collision with the robot's legs. We evaluated the proposed control system by hitting a rubber ball or adding a leg sweep disturbance and verified the functionality of the absorbing motion and the balance restoring motion.
