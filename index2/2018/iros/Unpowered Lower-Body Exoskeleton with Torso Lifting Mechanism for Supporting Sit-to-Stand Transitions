In this paper, we propose the design of an exoskeleton with support at the knee joint and lower torso for sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit (STS) posture transitions; devised for users with spinal cord injury and other complete lower-body impairments. The STS transitions assistance is achieved through a power transfer mechanism that synchronizes knees and lumbar motion through a cable-driven pulley system. We analyze the human body dynamics in the posture transition with a rigid link model and the interaction interface with the exoskeleton through an impedance model for producing a passive system voluntarily controlled by natural motions of the upper body. Therefore, allowing the potential users to achieve STS transitions with their body residual capabilities without an external power source. Instead, transferring power from their upper-body to lower-body, herewith, controlling a passive energy storage. A prototype was constructed and evaluated with seven healthy subjects observing the proposed motion and muscle activity during the STS transitions. The results show a significant reduction in the muscle activity evaluated, at the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and rectus femoris, with reductions between 30% to 50% at the $p < 0.01$ level comparing STS transitions with and without the exoskeleton support. Concluding that the STS transitions support is feasible with the passive exoskeleton envisioned for applications in upright locomotion, STS training, and rehabilitation.
