Semantic navigation is the navigation paradigm in which environmental semantic concepts and their relationships are taken into account to plan the route of a mobile robot. This paradigm facilitates the interaction with humans and the understanding of human environments in terms of navigation goals and tasks. At the high level, a semantic navigation system requires two main components: a semantic representation of the environment, and a reasoning system. This paper is focused on develop a model of the environment using semantic concepts. This paper presents two solutions for the semantic navigation paradigm. Both systems implement an ontological model. Whilst the first one uses a relational database, the second one is based on KnowRob. Both systems have been integrated in a semantic navigator. We compare both systems at the qualitative and quantitative levels, and present an implementation on a mobile robot as a proof of concept.
