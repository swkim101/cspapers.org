Recent advances in monocular SLAM have enabled real-time capable systems which run robustly under the assumption of a static environment, but fail in presence of dynamic scene changes and motion, since they lack an explicit dynamic outlier handling. We propose a semantic monocular SLAM framework designed to deal with highly dynamic environments, combining feature-based and direct approaches to achieve robustness under challenging conditions. The proposed approach exploits semantic information extracted from the scene within an explicit probabilistic model, which maximizes the probability for both tracking and mapping to rely on those scene parts that do not present a relative motion with respect to the camera. We show more stable pose estimation in dynamic environments and comparable performance to the state of the art on static sequences on the Virtual KITTI and Synthia datasets.
