Motion planning for fast locomotion of compliantly actuated robotic legs is generally considered to be a challenging issue, posing considerable real-time problems. This is at least the case if time-continuous trajectories need to be generated online. In this paper we take advantage of a simple controller structure, which reduces the motion planning to a discrete-time planning problem, in which only a small set of input parameters need to be determined for each step. We show that for a planar leg with serial elastic actuation, hopping on a ground with stairs of irregular length and height can be planned online, based on a parameter mapping which has been learned in a data-driven manner by performing hopping trials with an adaptive exploration algorithm to evenly sample the parameter space. Experiments on a planar hopping leg prototype validate the approach.
