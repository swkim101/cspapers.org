Traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches build maps based on points, lines or planes. These maps visually resemble the environment but without any semantic or information about the objects in the environment. Recent advancements in machine learning have made object detection highly accurate and reliable with large set of objects. Object detection can effectively help SLAM to incorporate semantics in the mapping process. One of the main obstacles is data association between detected objects over time. We demonstrate a nonparametric statistical approach to solve the data association between detected objects over consecutive frames. Then we use an unsupervised clustering method to identify the existence of objects in the map. The complete process can be run in parallel with SLAM. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on several public datasets, which shows promising results in locating objects in SLAM.
