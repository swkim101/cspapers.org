Limitations with the on-board computational resources installed on untethered robots such as humanoids and mobile robots in general affects significantly the performance and capabilities of these machines. An approach to address this issue is to make use of the cloud robotics concept and take advantage of the extensive computational resources of the cloud. XBotCloud is a recently developed component of the XBot framework. It tackles the above challenges by introducing the tools and mechanisms to enable users and robots to exploit the computational resources of the cloud allowing the execution of services with low, soft or hard Real-Time execution/communication performance. The latter is ensured thanks to the functionality provided by the XBotCore Real-Time cross-robot software component of the XBot framework. XBotCloud addresses also one of the main challenges related with cloud robotics: security. To avoid remote attacks it takes advantage of the Amazon Web Services (AWS)Cloud Security and it uses an internal VPN Network to handle the connectivity between the robot and the cloud server. The full implementation of the framework is presented and its functionality is demonstrated in realistic tasks involving pipelines that mix the execution of cloud services with moderate execution time constraints and Real-Time modules running on the robot local control unit. XBotCloud performances and cross-robot flexibility are experimentally validated on two different robotic platforms, the WALK-MAN humanoid and the CENTAURO upper body / full-body.
