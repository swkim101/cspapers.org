Virtual reality (VR)systems let users intuitively interact with 3D environments and have been used extensively for robotic teleoperation tasks. While more immersive than their 2D counterparts, early VR systems were expensive and required specialized hardware. Fortunately, there has been a recent proliferation of consumer-grade VR systems at affordable price points. These systems are inexpensive, relatively portable, and can be integrated into existing robotic frameworks. Our group has designed a VR teleoperation package for the Robot Operating System (ROS), ROS Reality, that can be easily integrated into such frameworks. ROS Reality is an open-source, over-the-Internet teleoperation interface between any ROS-enabled robot and any Unity-compatible VR headset. We completed a pilot study to test the efficacy of our system, with expert human users controlling a Baxter robot via ROS Reality to complete 24 dexterous manipulation tasks, compared to the same users controlling the robot via direct kinesthetic handling. This study provides insight into the feasibility of robotic teleoperation tasks in VR with current consumer-grade resources and exposes issues that need to be addressed in these VR systems. In addition, this paper presents a description of ROS Reality, its components, and architecture. We hope this system will be adopted by other research groups to allow for easy integration of VR teleoperated robots into future experiments.
