A number of researches have been focusing on the development and control of robots with soft structures such as flexible musculoskeletal systems. Thus far, it has been reported that these robots can achieve high adaptability to environments despite their extremely simple controllers. However, because these robots are difficult to model mathematically, there is still no systematic design policy, in which control theory has been playing a role in conventional robotics, for constituting simple controllers. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach using a neural network to obtain mathematical models. In particular, with this method, the control theory is applied to linear system models extracted from a network trained to express the forward dynamics of a robot. Through simulations, the validity and advantage of the proposed method was successfully confirmed.
