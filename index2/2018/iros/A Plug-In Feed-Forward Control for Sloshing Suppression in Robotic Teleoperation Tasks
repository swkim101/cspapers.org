In this paper, the problem of suppressing sloshing dynamics in liquid handling robotic systems has been faced by designing a dynamic filter that starting from the desired motion of the liquid container calculates the complete position/orientation trajectory for the robot end-effector. Specifically, a design philosophy mixing a filtering technique that suppresses the frequency contributions of the reference motion that may cause liquid oscillations and an active compensation of lateral accelerations by a proper container re-orientation has been adopted. In principle, the latter contribution requires the knowledge of acceleration of the reference trajectory, but because of the use of an harmonic smoother that performs a shaping of the original motion, it is possible to obtain the value of the acceleration in runtime. In this way, the proposed methods can be applied also to reference motions that are not known in advance, e.g. commands directly provided by a human operator. This possibility has been demonstrated by means of a number of experimental tests in which the user teleoperates the robot carrying the container with the liquid by simply moving in the free space its hand, whose 3D position is detected by a motion capture system.
