Collecting 3D object data sets involves a large amount of manual work and is time consuming. Getting complete models of objects either requires a 3D scanner that covers all the surfaces of an object or one needs to rotate it to completely observe it. We present a system that incrementally builds a database of objects as a mobile agent traverses a scene. Our approach requires no prior knowledge of the shapes present in the scene. Object-like segments are extracted from a global segmentation map, which is built online using the input of segmented RGB-D images. These segments are stored in a database, matched among each other, and merged with other previously observed instances. This allows us to create and improve object models on the fly and to use these merged models to reconstruct also unobserved parts of the scene. The database contains each (potentially merged) object model only once, together with a set of poses where it was observed. We evaluate our pipeline with one public dataset, and on a newly created Google Tango dataset containing four indoor scenes with some of the objects appearing multiple times, both within and across scenes.
