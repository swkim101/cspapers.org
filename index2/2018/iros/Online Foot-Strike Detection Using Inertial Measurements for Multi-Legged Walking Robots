Proprioceptive terrain sensing is essential for rough terrain traversal because it helps legged robots to negotiate individual steps by reacting to terrain irregularities. In this work, we propose to utilize inertial data in the detection of the contact between the leg and the terrain during the stride phase of the leg. We show that relatively cheap accelerometers can be utilized to reliably detect a foot-strike, and thus allow the robot to crawl irregular terrains. The continuous data processing is compared with the interrupt mode in which data are provided only around the foot-strike event. The interrupt mode exhibits significantly better performance, and it also supports generalization of the foot-strike event detector learned from data collected in slow locomotion to faster locomotion where the signals slightly change. The proposed solution is experimentally validated using a real hexapod walking robot for which the walking speed has been improved in comparison to the previous adaptive motion gait based on a force threshold-based position controller for the foot-strike detection.
