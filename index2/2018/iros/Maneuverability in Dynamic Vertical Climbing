In this paper, we examine the reduced order pendular dynamic climbing model with the addition of attachment windows based on prescribed body roll. With this model and on the new dynamic climbing platform, TAILS, we demonstrate dynamic downward climbing as well as identify distinct dynamic gaits within downward climbing. This, combined with the application of an asymmetric configuration of the rear legs enables strafing motions and thus dynamic maneuverability on walls in the vertical domain.
