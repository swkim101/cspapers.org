Collaborative robots are often designed with limited power and force capacity, with the aim to provide affordable solutions and ensure human safety in case of accidental collisions and impacts. If a task requires a power beyond this capacity, or is performed repeatedly over long periods, such limits may be exceeded, which can cause inevitable robot damage and contribute to the lost productivity. In such cases, where hardware solutions and improvements are not applicable, effective software frameworks can prolong robot productivity and lifetime. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel technique for the monitoring and management of robot fatigue in repetitive or high-effort task execution scenarios. The robot fatigue is estimated by the measured temperature of motors in the joints. The proposed fatigue management system is composed of two-stage reaction process that is triggered by different levels of the estimated fatigue. The first stage exploits the kinematic redundancy of robot structure in attempt to minimise the load in the specific joints that under fatigue by reconfiguration in the joint space through the null space of the Cartesian task production. If the first stage is not successful in reducing the fatigue, the second stage is activated that gradually reduces the forces of hybrid controller. At that point, the human co-worker can temporarily take over the task execution until the robot will be recovered from the excessive fatigue. To validate the proposed approach we conducted experiments on KUKA Lightweight Robot performing two interaction tasks: autonomous surface wiping and collaborative human-robot surface polishing.
