The effectiveness of the robot locomotion can be measured using the cost of transport (CoT) which represents the amount of energy that is needed for traversing from one place to another. Terrains excerpt different mechanical properties when crawled by a multi-legged robot, and thus different values of the CoT. It is therefore desirable to estimate the CoT in advance and plan the robot motion accordingly. However, the CoT might not be known prior the robot deployment, e.g., in extraterrestrial missions; hence, a robot has to learn different terrains as it crawls through the environment incrementally. In this work, we focus on estimating the CoT from visual and geometrical data of the crawled terrain. A thorough analysis of different terrain descriptors within the context of incremental learning is presented to select the best performing approach. We report on the achieved results and experimental verification of the selected approaches with a real hexapod robot crawling over six different terrains.
