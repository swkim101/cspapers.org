As modern robots become more intelligent, also their use will broaden in public and professional areas. While the aim is to make robots beneficial to humans and society, using those complex machines in complex environments will eventually lead to incidents. To enable forensic investigations, ethical evaluations and transparent function of intelligent robots in a society, we contribute the concept of a secure robot data recorder that is similar to a flight data recorder in airplanes. However, since robots work in a highly networked and uncontrolled environment, our concept pays special attention to security and tamper proofness. In addition, we extend the concept with an approach inspired by cockroaches to increase the functional integrity of the robot. We present a prototype implementation along with discussions on the required properties and limits of secure data recording.
