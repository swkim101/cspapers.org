Swing Leg Retraction (SLR) is observed in human walking and running. Previous studies have concluded that SLR improves the stability and robustness of biped walking. But this conclusion was based on analysis of robot models that can only walk at a very small range of step-lengths and slow or fixed speeds. By contrast, humans can walk with a large range of speeds and step-lengths. Moreover, human walking patterns have a special feature that has not been considered in the previous studies on SLR effects: At a given walking speed, v, humans prefer a step-length, s, which satisfies the power law, s-vÎ². Therefore, previous studies on SLR can't tell us whether their conclusion will still hold in the full range of human walking patterns (i.e., various walking speeds and step-lengths). This is the question we want to answer in this paper. In this study, using a simple biped model, we studied how the SLR affects the walking stability in the full range of human walking speeds/step-lengths. Preliminary analysis of both models suggests the same conclusion: (1) SLR improves the stability more evidently in human-preferred walking patterns than in other walking patterns. (2) In walking patterns that are very unlike human-preferred ones, the SLR improves the stability very little, or even deteriorates it drastically. Therefore, the new finding of our study is that how the SLR affects the biped walking stability depends on the walking speed and step-length. SLR does not always improve the stability of biped walking.
