This work proposes the utilization of sinc functions as kernels of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) models for encoding point-to-point kinematic behaviors. The proposed method presents a number of advantages with respect to the state of the art, as it (i) involves a simple learning technique, (ii) provides a method to determine the minimum required number of basis functions, based on the frequency content of the demonstrated motion and (iii) provides the ability to pre-define the reproduction accuracy of the learned behavior. The ability of the proposed model to accurately reproduce the behavior is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Comparisons with the Gaussian-based DMP model show the proposed method's superiority in terms of computational complexity of learning and accuracy for a specific number of kernels.
