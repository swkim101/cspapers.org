We propose the Dexterous Manipulation Graph as a tool to address in-hand manipulation and reposition an object inside a robot's end-effector. This graph is used to plan a sequence of manipulation primitives so to bring the object to the desired end pose. This sequence of primitives is translated into motions of the robot to move the object held by the end-effector. We use a dual arm robot with parallel grippers to test our method on a real system and show successful planning and execution of in-hand manipulation.
