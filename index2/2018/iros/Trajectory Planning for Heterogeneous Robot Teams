We describe a trajectory planning method for heterogeneous mobile robot teams in known environments. We consider two core problems that arise with heterogeneous robot teams: asymmetric inter-robot collision constraints and varying dynamic limits. Asymmetric collision constraints are important for close-proximity flight of rotorcraft due to the downwash effect, which complicates spatial coordination. Varying dynamic limits complicate temporal coordination between robots and must be taken into account during planning. Our method builds upon a hybrid planner that combines graph-planning techniques with trajectory optimization and scales well to large homogeneous robot teams. We extend the hybrid planning approach to include the additional spatial and temporal coordination to support heterogeneous teams. Our method scales well with the number of robots and robot types and we demonstrate our approach on a team of 15 physical robots of 4 different types, including quadrotors and differential drive robots.
