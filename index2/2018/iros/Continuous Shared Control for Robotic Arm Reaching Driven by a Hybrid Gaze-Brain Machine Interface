The brain-machine interface (BMI) has been reported to offer the potential for controlling the assistive robot for the motor impaired people, using the non-invasively obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the EEG based BMI may not be sufficient and stable to drive the robot moving freely in its 2D or 3D workspace. The robot autonomy may provide assistance for the BMI users with the shared control paradigm. Nevertheless, users suffers from several limitations of the current shared control paradigms applied on BMI, e.g., loss of sense of control, high mental workload due to unintuitive control with the human-robot interface and fixed level of assistance. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new control paradigm for the robotic arm reaching task where the robot autonomy is dynamically blended with the gaze-BMI control from a user. In this paradigm, the hybrid gaze-BMI constitutes an intuitive and effective input to continuously control the robotic arm end-effector moving freely in its 2D workspace, with an adjustable speed proportional to the motion intention strength. Furthermore, the adjustable level of assistance by our paradigm allows the system to balance the user's capabilities and feelings of control while compensating for the reaching task's difficulty. The proposed paradigm is verified in the task where a healthy subject utilizes the hybrid gaze-BMI to control the robotic arm end-effector reaching for a target object while avoiding the obstacle in the path. The experimental results demonstrate that the movements with our shared control paradigm are safer, more efficient and less difficult than those without shared control.
