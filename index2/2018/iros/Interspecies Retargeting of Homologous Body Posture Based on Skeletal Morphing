The paper aims to develop a methodology of transferring the knowledge obtained from the experiments of laboratory animals to human musculoskeletal system. To achieve the goal, we propose a method for estimating the homologous posture of the mammalian skeletal system corresponding to the human body posture. We hypothesize the homology of bone geometry between mammalian species implies that of biomechanical functions. The method relies on this homology and determines the homologous postures according to the anatomical landmarks of bone geometry. This paper shows the results of the analysis on homologous postures between the human and mouse skeletal models to validate our hypothesis. A pilot study also introduces comparison of mechanical functions between the two models by using the homologous postures.
