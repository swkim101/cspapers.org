Motor functions of the biological system has been forged through 4 billion years evolution. From a neurorobotics view, it is important not only to know how well it works, but also how it fails. To quantitatively describe early onset symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease, we analyzed phenotypes of genetically engineered Huntington disease (HD) model mice, which reveal progressive impaired motor functions. We devised a simple yet sensitive paradigm called the crystalized motion profile (CMP), by which we successfully detected subtle difference between normal and abnormal mice in terms of whole-body level motor coordination. Our long-term objective is to remodel human mind and body to regain impaired motor and cognitive functions with ageing. To do so, we are developing a soft neurorobotic suit that provides integrated cognitive and physical interventions to users. Our analysis on the HD model mice is important as the first step to bridge between molecular mechanisms (altered genetic code) and the macroscopic neuro-musculoskeletal model. With this, we can extrapolate from knowledge of non-human mammals to human to derive the remodeling.
