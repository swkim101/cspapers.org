Indoor mobile robots navigation must use external sensors to complement odometry. This paper analyses two different external sensors such as a laser LMS-200 and an omnidirectional camera Mobotix C2S. Experiments with only one of these sensors and with both integrated are carried out on a tour guide robot in order to obtain conclusions about their contribution to robot pose estimation, and how to locate external landmarks in the environment.
