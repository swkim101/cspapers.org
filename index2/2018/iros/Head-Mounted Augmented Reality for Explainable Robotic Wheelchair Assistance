Robotic wheelchairs with built-in assistive features, such as shared control, are an emerging means of providing independent mobility to severely disabled individuals. However, patients often struggle to build a mental model of their wheelchair's behaviour under different environmental conditions. Motivated by the desire to help users bridge this gap in perception, we propose a novel augmented reality system using a Microsoft Hololens as a head-mounted aid for wheelchair navigation. The system displays visual feedback to the wearer as a way of explaining the underlying dynamics of the wheelchair's shared controller and its predicted future states. To investigate the influence of different interface design options, a pilot study was also conducted. We evaluated the acceptance rate and learning curve of an immersive wheelchair training regime, revealing preliminary insights into the potential beneficial and adverse nature of different augmented reality cues for assistive navigation. In particular, we demonstrate that care should be taken in the presentation of information, with effort-reducing cues for augmented information acquisition (for example, a rear-view display) being the most appreciated.
