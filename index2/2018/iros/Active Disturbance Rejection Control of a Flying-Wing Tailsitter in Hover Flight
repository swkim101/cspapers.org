This paper presents the development and hovering control of a tailsitter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that merges long endurance and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) abilities. The designed tailsitter contains one flying-wing with two motors and two elevons. Vehicle aerodynamics and a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) model are especially developed for the tailsitter. To achieve a good performance in outdoor stationary hovering and accurate vertical flying, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for attitude controller is proposed. With signals from extended state observer (ESO) and tracking differentiator (TD), ADRC decouples the system model into a controllable chain of integrators. Based on the decoupled system dynamics, the motion of tailsitter can be easily handled by developed position controller. Experimental results are presented to corroborate the effectiveness of the controller in disturbance rejection.
