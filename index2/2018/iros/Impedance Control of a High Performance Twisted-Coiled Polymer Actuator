This paper presents a 1-link robotic arm that is antagonistically driven by one pair of a high performance super-coiled polymer actuators with an embedded controller. The actuator which is made from Spandex and nylon fibers is low-cost, easy to fabricate and light-weight. Moreover, it can generate large displacement and provide Joule heating capability. The main contribution of the paper is the model-based impedance controller, which enables position control of the antagonistic joint with variable stiffness and damping. The impedance control is a torque-based law, which in turn depends on a proposed backstepping control law to control the force of each actuator. The control system is proved to be stable using dissipativity stability theory and verified through experiments. Experimental results show that our system can track the angular position reference with the worst position error of 0.43deg and root-mean squared error of 0.16deg at steady state for sinusoidal waveform tracking (with the frequency of 0.1Hz), and the worst position error of 0.2deg for set-point regulation.
