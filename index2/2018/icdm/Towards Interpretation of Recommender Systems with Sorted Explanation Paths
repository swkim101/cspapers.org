Despite the wide application in recent years, most recommender systems are not capable of providing interpretations together with recommendation results, which impedes both deployers and customers from understanding or trusting the results. Recent advances in recommendation models, such as deep learning models, usually involve extracting latent representations of users and items. However, the representation space is not directly comprehensible since each dimension usually does not have any specific meaning. In addition, recommender systems incorporate various sources of information, such as user behaviors, item information, and other side content information. Properly organizing different types of information, as well as effectively selecting important information for interpretation, is challenging and has not been fully tackled by conventional interpretation methods. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc method called Sorted Explanation Paths (SEP) to interpret recommendation results. Specifically, we first build a unified heterogeneous information network to incorporate multiple types of objects and relations based on representations from the recommender system and information from the dataset. Then, we search for explanation paths between given recommendation pairs, and use the set of simple paths to construct semantic explanations. Next, three heuristic metrics, i.e., credibility, readability and diversity, are designed to measure the validity of each explanation path, and to sort all the paths comprehensively. The top-ranked explanation paths are selected as the final interpretation. After that, practical issues on computation and efficiency of the proposed SEP method are also handled by corresponding approaches. Finally, we conduct experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed SEP method.
