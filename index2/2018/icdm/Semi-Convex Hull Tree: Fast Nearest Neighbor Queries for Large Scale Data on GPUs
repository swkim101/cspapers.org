A fast exact nearest neighbor search algorithm over large scale data is proposed based on semi-convex hull tree, where each node represents a semi-convex hull, which is made of a set of hyper planes. When performing the task of nearest neighbor queries, unnecessary distance computations can be greatly reduced by quadratic programming. GPUs are also used to accelerate the query process. Experiments conducted on both Intel(R) HD Graphics 4400 and Nvidia Geforce GTX1050 TI, as well as theoretical analysis show that the proposed algorithm yields significant improvements and outperforms current k-d tree based nearest neighbor query algorithms and others
