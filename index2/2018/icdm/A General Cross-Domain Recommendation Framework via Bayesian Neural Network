Collaborative filtering is an effective and widely used recommendation approach by applying the user-item rating matrix for recommendations, however, which usually suffers from cold-start and sparsity problems. To address these problems, hybrid methods are proposed to incorporate auxiliary information such as user/item profiles to collaborative filtering models; Cross-domain recommendation systems add a new dimension to solve these problems by leveraging ratings from other domains to improve recommendation performance. Among these methods, deep neural network based recommendation systems achieve excellent performance due to their excellent ability in learning powerful representations. However, these cross-domain recommendation systems based on deep neural network rarely consider the uncertainty of weights. Therefore, they maybe lack of calibrated probabilistic predictions and make overly confident decisions. Along this line, we propose a general cross-domain recommendation framework via Bayesian neural network to incorporate auxiliary information, which takes advantage of both the hybrid recommendation methods and the cross-domain recommendation systems. Specifically, our framework consists of two kinds of neural networks, one to learn the low dimensional representation from the one-hot codings of users/items, while the other one is to project the auxiliary information of users/items into another latent space. The final rating is produced by integrating the latent representations of the one-hot codings of users/items and the auxiliary information of users/items. The latent representations of users learnt from ratings and auxiliary information are shared across different domains for knowledge transfer. Moreover, we capture the uncertainty in all weights by representing weights with Gaussian distributions to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. We have done extensive experiments on real-world data sets to verify the effectiveness of our framework.
