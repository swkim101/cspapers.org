Subjective Logic (SL) is one of well-known belief models that can explicitly deal with uncertain opinions and infer unknown opinions based on a rich set of operators of fusing multiple opinions. Due to high simplicity and applicability, SL has been popularly applied in a variety of decision making in the area of cybersecurity, opinion models, and/or trust / social network analysis. However, SL has been facing an issue of scalability to deal with a large-scale network data. In addition, SL has shown a bounded prediction accuracy due to its inherent parametric nature by treating heterogeneous data and network structure homogeneously based on the assumption of a Bayesian network. In this work, we take one step further to deal with uncertain opinions for unknown opinion inference. We propose a deep learning (DL)-based opinion inference model while node-level opinions are still formalized based on SL. The proposed DL-based opinion inference model handles node-level opinions explicitly in a large-scale network using graph convoluational network (GCN) and variational autoencoder (VAE) techniques. We adopted the GCN and VAE due to their powerful learning capabilities in dealing with a large-scale network data without parametric fusion operators and/or Bayesian network assumption. This work is the first that leverages the merits of both DL (i.e., GCN and VAE) and a belief model (i.e., SL) where each node level opinion is modeled by the formalism of SL while GCN and VAE are used to achieve non-parametric learning with low complexity. By mapping the node-level opinions modeled by the GCN to their equivalent Beta PDFs (probability density functions), we develop a network-driven VAE to maximize prediction accuracy of unknown opinions while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity. We validate our proposed DL-based algorithm using real-world datasets via extensive simulation experiments for comparative performance analysis.
