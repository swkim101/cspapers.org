Natural Language Inference (NLI) task requires an agent to determine the semantic relation between a premise sentence (p) and a hypothesis sentence (h), which demands sufficient understanding about sentences from lexical knowledge to global semantic. Due to the issues such as polysemy, ambiguity, as well as fuzziness of sentences, fully understanding sentences is still challenging. To this end, we propose an Image-Enhanced Multi-Level Sentence Representation Net (IEMLRN), a novel architecture that is able to utilize the image to enhance the sentence semantic understanding at different scales. To be specific, we introduce the corresponding image of sentences as reference information, which can be helpful for sentence semantic understanding and inference relation evaluation. Since image information might be related to the sentence semantics at different scales, we design a multi-level architecture to understand sentences from different granularity and generate the sentence representation more precisely. Experimental results on the large-scale NLI corpus and real-world NLI alike corpus demonstrate that IEMLRN can simultaneously improve the performance. It is noteworthy that IEMLRN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art sentence-encoding based models on the challenging hard subset and challenging lexical subset of SNLI corpus.
