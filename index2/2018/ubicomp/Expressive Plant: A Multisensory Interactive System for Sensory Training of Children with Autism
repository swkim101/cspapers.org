Children with autism typically show difficulty in sensory processing, which directly affects their ability to communicate and build connections with others. In order to enhance their senses, we present a multi-sensory interactive system, Expressive Plant, that provides sensory training on vision, hearing and tactile and olfactory feeling. A pilot study with autistic children and their teachers was conducted. The result indicates that our system is promising in helping children with autism engage in sensory training and improve their ability to sense the environment.
