In this paper, a smartphone application "iTrack" is introduced for young people with autism that provides learning support and emergency support about safety skills related to fire and rain. Also, the application provides additional support to caregivers to promote collaboration between them. Our proposed application evaluated on two autistic individuals. Fire and rain safety skills were taught to children using video modelling via a smartphone.
