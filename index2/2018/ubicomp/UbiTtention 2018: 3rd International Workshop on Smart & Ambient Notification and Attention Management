In the advancing ubiquitous computing, users are increasingly confronted with a tremendous amount of information proactively provided via notifications from versatile applications and services, through multiple devices and screens in their environment. The human's attention is becoming a new significant bottleneck. Further, the latest computing trends with emerging new devices including versatile IoT devices, and contexts, such as smart cities and vehicles, are even accelerating this situation. In such situations, "attention management", including attention representation, sensing, prediction, analysis, and adaptive behavior in the computer systems, are needed in our computing system. Following last years' successful UbiTtention 2016 and UbiTtention 2017 workshops with up to 50 participants, the UbiTtention 2018 workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academy and industry to explore the management of human attention and notifications with versatile devices and smart situations to overcome information overload and overchoice.
