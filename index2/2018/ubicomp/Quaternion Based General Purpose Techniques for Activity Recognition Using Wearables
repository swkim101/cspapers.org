Human activity recognition (HAR) is challenging, particularly in natural settings, due to issues like confounding gestures present in different activities, diversity in performing the same activity, and the wide range of possible human activities. Acceleration and rotation rate, two of the most widely used sensing modalities for HAR, are limited in addressing these issues. Also, many solutions for wearables are focused on some particular activities, and they do not generalize to others. One challenge is to develop underlying generic techniques for activity recognition that can be used in many different wearable based applications. We present a set of general purpose techniques for activity recognition using wearables. The techniques are based on quaternions that represent the orientation of a device in three-dimensional space. The techniques can be used for different purposes like reducing computation, increasing robustness and accuracy, and better understanding movements for HAR.
