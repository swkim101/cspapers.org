In this paper, we propose a battery-free place recognition system that utilizes solar-cells as a sensor for localization. Our system combines multiple solar cells having different characteristics against the light environment. As an initial work, we select five kinds of solar cells available in the market and investigate the characteristics of them. Then, we show a potential for estimating the place based on the variation of electricity amounts generated from solar cells. Finally, we show that our proposed system distinguish nine places with 88.0% accuracy.
