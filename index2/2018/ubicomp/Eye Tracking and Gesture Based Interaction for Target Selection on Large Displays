Mouse based target selection requires much movement when locating targets across long distance on large displays. Eye tracking technique can locate targets more easily and quickly across long distance, and has a high potential for fast targets selection on large displays. However, eye tracking still faces to challenges, such as low accuracy, and high error rate of selection operation, especially for gaze-only interaction. This paper proposed a multimodal interaction method that combined gaze with gestures. This method utilized gaze for rough selection first, and then utilized hand gesture to confirm accurate selection. Furthermore, when targets are small and crowded, we used semi-fixed gaze cursor and secondary selection mechanism to optimize the selection process. Finally we conducted a pilot study, and the results showed that the selection speed and accuracy rate of our method was higher than the gaze only input and similar to mouse input.
