Past studies have shown that commercial sports tracking technologies do not often provide the desired level of awareness of one's own body, and they are often abandoned after intermittent usage. In this position paper, we explore design possibilities for wearable displays for increasing bodily awareness while the users are engaged in sports. This builds our vision of future sports displays, and provides a framework and inspiration for developing interactive sport technologies utilizing wearable displays. Our work contributes new directions in developing wearable devices for enhancing the experience of physical activity.
