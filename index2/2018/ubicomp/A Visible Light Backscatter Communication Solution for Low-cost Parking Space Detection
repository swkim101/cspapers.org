We introduce an intelligent parking space detection system based on PassiveVLC, a visible light backscatter communication technology. Its substrate is retroreflection -- by instrumenting retroreflector in each parking space, we are able to detect the vacancy of parking space based on whether the lighting infrastructure receives the light reflection or not from that particular parking lot. We further design and implement a MAC protocol to improve the scalability of our system.
