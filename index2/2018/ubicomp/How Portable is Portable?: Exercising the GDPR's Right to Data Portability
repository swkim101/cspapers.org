The new European General Data Protection Regulation has introduced several new rights designed to empower users and regulate imbalances of power between those who collect and control data and those to whom the data refer. In this paper we focus on one particular right, the right to data portability, and examine how it is being implemented. We discuss the responses to 230 real-world data portability requests, and examine the file formats returned and difficulties in making and interpreting requests. We find variation in file formats, not all of which meet the GDPR requirements, and confusion amongst data controllers about the various GDPR rights.
