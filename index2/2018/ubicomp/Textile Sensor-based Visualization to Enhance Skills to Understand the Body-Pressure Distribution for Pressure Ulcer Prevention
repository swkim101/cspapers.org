This study proposes a system to visualize the body-pressures applied to body parts in a bed, with textile pressure sensors to support caregivers to learn posture change skill for pressure ulcer prevention. As the result of an evaluation with 21 nursing students, the comparison group using our system for learning showed better scores than ones of the control group with skill to understand the body-pressure distribution of sub-body parts: head (6/6, 100%) and right leg (3/6, 50%).
