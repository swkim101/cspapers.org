This is my application document to attend the UbiComp 2018 Broadening Participation Workshop. In this application, I introduce myself first, including the current Ph.D. program I am enrolled in. Then, I go through the topics I am working on, such as the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)-based malicious accounts detection designs on LBSNs (Location-Based Social Networks), and the measurement work on the cross-site linking function that links users accounts on multiple OSNs. Some of my work have been published. At last, I summarize the future work of these topics. I classify the related work of malicious users into four categories according to the motivations of malicious behaviors. I plan to deal with more types of malicious behaviors by exploiting the cross-site linking function.
