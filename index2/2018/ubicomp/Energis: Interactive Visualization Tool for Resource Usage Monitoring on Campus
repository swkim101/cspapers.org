This paper presents an interactive visualization tool for resource usage monitoring. This paper discusses the developing processes and focuses on implementation techniques for data preparation and visualization. The web application called Energis is developed as the first prototype. It features interactive 3D graphical map with numerical and animated infographics. It is designed to enable real-time user-to-user data sharing. A user experience study is conducted in order to evaluate the potential usage of the tool. The preliminary results from a standardized questionnaire show that the voluntary participants rate the application based on their hands-on experience at a consistently high level. With the availability of meter data providers, the tool can be utilized in location-based management to understand resource usage in both temporal and spatial domains.
