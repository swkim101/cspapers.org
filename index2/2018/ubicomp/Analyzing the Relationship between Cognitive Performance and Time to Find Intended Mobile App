Although mental illness is one of the most serious social problems, stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, on the contrary, an optimal amount of stress can result in individuals being able to perform better in tasks. While there have been several studies on estimating stress level from smartphone usage logs and several effective features were revealed as a result, there are few studies on estimating cognitive performance. Thus, in this paper, we explore several factors affecting the estimation of cognitive performance from smartphone logs. To conduct the analysis, we collected smartphone usage logs and Go/No-Go task data for 6 weeks from 39 participants in the wild. We found that the time to find intended app is related to cognitive performance. This result suggests that measuring the time to find intended app can be the effective feature of estimating cognitive performance from smartphone logs.
