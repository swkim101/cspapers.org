As digital machine tools like 3D printers have become cheaper and popular, even common people come to involve personal fabrication. There are many web services for sharing instructions; however, people often have difficulty to create such instructions. To solve this problem, we propose a support system to create video instructions for manufacturing using smartwatches. Our system mainly consists of a smartphone application for recording, a web server for data storage and machine learning platform, and a browser-based application for data presentation and manual tagging. The system can automatically add chapters on video instructions and provide smart fast-forward function.
