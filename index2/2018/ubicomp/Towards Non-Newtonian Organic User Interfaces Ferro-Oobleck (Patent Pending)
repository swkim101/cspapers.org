Throughout the 2010s interest in both organic user interfaces and various tangible haptics systems has grown steadily. Prior art has shown this through transmitting shape as a means of a novel interaction. Oobleck is a mixture of water and cornstarch that exhibits properties of both a solid and liquid depending on whether or not force is applied to it at the time. Prior art mainly employed the use of sound and vibration to activate the oobleck. The results were somewhat effective but really lacked any precise control over the oobleck. However, by embedding magnetic particles and some chemical additives in the oobleck, finer and more dynamic control over the oobleck could be attained. A magnetic matrix was concepted as a user interface to test the oobleck medium. As a proof of concept, 4 solenoid valves with small neodymium attached to them were used. Neodymium were used instead of electromagnets due to their extremely dense and strong magnetic fields. The interface was designed to communicate fingertip touch between parties. 4 touch sensors were placed on a mouse shaped interface, when triggered, these would deactivate relays that controlled solenoids with small neodymium attached to them, springing upwards to be near a thin receptacle holding the oobleck. A user could then feel the shape of the oobleck change in specific locations to reflect the feeling of the person pressing their fingertips against the sensor area.
