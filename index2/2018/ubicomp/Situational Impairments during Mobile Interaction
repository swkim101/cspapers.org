Non-conventional contextual and environmental factors are known to adversely affect mobile interaction leading to situational impairments. The term situational impairments was first introduced by Sears [20], where the term was used to describe the relationship between the user, the nature of the tasks that the user is engaged in, the surrounding environment where the task is performed, and the design of technology used to complete the task. Due to their ubiquitous nature, smartphones are often used in situations, where the user is situationally impaired e.g., due to contextual and environmental factors, such as cold ambience [6, 15], ambient noise [17], motion [5, 7, 19], or being encumbered [13, 14]. Therefore, one of the challenges within the Ubicomp community is to enhance the capabilities of mobile devices to detect these situational impairments and accommodate them. Moreover, the effects of some of the situational impairments have been established during mobile interaction (e.g., cold environments [6, 15], ambient noise [17], motion [5, 7, 19], and encumbrance [13, 14]). However, other situational impairments (e.g., emotional state of the user, and stress [1]) remain underexplored. Hence, it is valuable to the Ubicomp community to know the effects of underexplored situational impairments on mobile interaction, in order to develop the detection mechanisms and adaptive interfaces to accommodate them. Our research has three main objectives. The first objective of our research is to understand the effect of underexplored situational impairments (in particular, ambient noise, mood or emotional state of the user, and stress). The second objective of our research is to develop mechanisms for detecting situational impairments (e.g., ambient temperature). Finally, our research aims to provide design guidelines and recommendations for building interfaces to adapt the interaction by accommodating the situational impairments.
