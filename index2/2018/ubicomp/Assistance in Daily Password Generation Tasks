Passwords and PINs are used to protect all kinds of services against adversaries in our everyday lives. To serve their purpose, passwords require a certain degree of complexity which is often enforced through password policies. This results in complicated passwords, which might not only be hard for users to create, but also hard to remember. Furthermore, users might reuse passwords which they feel are secure. We present a scheme for deterministic password generation that solves these problems by assisting the user in generating and remembering passwords. The passwords are generated based on previously stored meta data (e.g., policies) and a master password. Since the password generation is deterministic, only the master password is required to recreate the passwords. As proof of concept we implemented a mobile app and pre-evaluated it. The pre-evaluation indicates that our scheme offers a good usability.
