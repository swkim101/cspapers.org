The effect of daily life stress has been known to cause irregular behavioral changes in a person's daily work timeline. They not only affect work but also fills a person with depression and anxiety. Thus, managing stress is a key for improving life quality. In this poster, we propose StressWatch, a mobile system which helps users in finding the root causes of their stress origination in daily life. The system monitors user contexts and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) features of the user by utilizing sensor data stream from the user's smartwatch. It then extracts a series of stress level from HRV data and matches the stress level and user contexts in order to explore the source of the stress of the user. Also, we performed a motivational study to investigate the feasibility of opportunistic HRV monitoring in daily life.
