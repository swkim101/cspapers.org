For efficient operation of taxis, it is important to provide taxi drivers with detailed information about passenger demand. In this paper, we propose a future taxi demand prediction algorithm by using real-time population data generated from cellular networks. We evaluated the effects of real-time population data on the accuracy of taxi demand prediction by using stacked denoising autoencoders. The results of an offline experiment conducted herein indicate that when real-time population data were used, the root mean squared prediction error of the proposed algorithm was 1.370 as opposed to 1.513 when population data were not used. In addition, we conducted a field test. We implement a real-time prediction system based on realtime population data, the first such online real-world test conducted worldwide. In the trial, 26 participant drivers tried our demand forecast system. The results showed that the sales of participant drivers improved by 1,409 JPY per person per day, which represents a 3.9% increase in sales on average compared to the drivers who did not use the system.
