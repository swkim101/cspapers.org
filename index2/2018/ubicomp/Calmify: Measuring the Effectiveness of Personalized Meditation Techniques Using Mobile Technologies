In recent years, the number of people suffering from stress and anxiety disorders is growing dramatically, reaching over 40 million adults in the United States alone. The meditation, amongst many other relaxation techniques, is emerging as a popular practice for dealing with stress and anxiety. However, so far meditation and its effect on well-being have been mostly measured based on subjective feedback or in some cases in laboratory settings where bulky and expensive devices are used for capturing physiological data, therefore, unfit for daily life uses. In this paper, we present the early design of Calmify, a mobile application, which is aimed to measure the effectiveness of personalized meditation techniques using a smartphone and off-the-shelf wearable devices.
