The proliferation of smart devices prompts the explosive usage of mobile applications, which increases network traffic load. Characterizing the application level traffic patterns from an individual perspective is valuable for operators and content providers to make technical and business strategies. In this paper, we identify several typical traffic patterns and predict per-user traffic demand utilizing application usage dataset in cellular network. Our primary contributions are twofold: First, we novelly designed a three-stage model combining factor analysis and machine learning to extract the traffic patterns of individuals. By detecting the latent temporal structure of their application usage, users in the network are grouped into six typical patterns. Second, we implement a Wavelet-ARMA based model to forecast per-user application level traffic demand. The evaluation on real-world dataset indicates the model improves the prediction accuracy by 7 to 8 times compared with the benchmark solutions.
