Everyday mobility encompasses different forms of public and private transportation. However, everyday mobility often does not involve substantial levels of physical activity. The goal of this workshop is to investigate ways of integrating physical activity into everyday mobility in accordance with widely accepted health recommendations. We aim to explore wearable and ambient systems that sense and support active navigation as well as conceptual aspects from a variety of perspectives, such as persuasive technologies. Researchers from different disciplines are invited to contribute their point of view by means of position papers, posters, and demonstrations. One planned outcome of this workshop is a set of design guidelines for navigation systems that explicitly consider health aspects. The workshop explores requirements and design challenges in a creative setting.
