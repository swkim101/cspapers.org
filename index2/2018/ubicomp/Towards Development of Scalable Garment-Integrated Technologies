This research project aims to develop a scalable manufacturing method for garment-integrated technologies that preserve user comfort and work within the constraints of typical apparel manufacturing processes while providing required electrical performance and durability needed by the system. We have developed a method for attaching discrete surface-mount components and rigorously tested the method. To demonstrate the scalability of the method test prototype garments are under development, which will be used to evaluate the durability of the manufacturing process at garment scale as well as the impact of integrating electronic technology on labor, equipment, and cost.
