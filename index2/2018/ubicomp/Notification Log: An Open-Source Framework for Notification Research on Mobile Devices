In the past decade, the number of always-connected mobile devices exploded. Smartphones are always with the user and host a large number of applications and services that use notifications to gain the user's attention. These notifications and their effects on users have been extensively researched in the context of human-computer interaction. In a body of prior work, numerous small- and large-scale studies were conducted to understand notifications as well as their effects. A common theme in these studies is the need for accessing users' notifications, often for logging purposes. In this paper, we present an open-source framework for notification research on mobile devices. The framework has been used as the foundation of multiple in-the-wild and in-lab studies, and has been downloaded by over 60,000 users. We explain the requirements, the architecture, and past application scenarios of the framework. The scenarios range from enabling reflection on mobile notifications to rich experiences in multi-device environments.
