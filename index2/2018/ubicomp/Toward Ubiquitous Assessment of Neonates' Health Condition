Neonates needs an intensive health care during their early life. The cost of health care is high. In addition, health care might not be accessible to neonates in rural areas. In this paper, we propose the development of a smart, accessible, and cost-effective system to monitor neonates' health conditions using the advanced technologies of artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. The paper also presents an approach for automatically measuring neonates' pain, which is a main indication of an underlying health condition. While the preliminary results of our approach are encouraging, several extensions should be considered in future.
