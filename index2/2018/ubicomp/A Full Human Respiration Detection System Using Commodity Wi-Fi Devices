In recent years, human respiration detection based on Wi-Fi signals has drawn a lot of attention due to better user acceptance and great potential for real-world deployment. However, latest studies show that respiration sensing performance varies at different locations due to the nature of Wi-Fi radio wave propagation in indoor environments, i.e., respiration detection may experience poor performance at certain locations which we call "blind spots". In this demo, we will demonstrate a human respiration detection system which enables full location coverage with no blind spot.
