With the vision of building "A Smart World", Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role where users, computing systems and objects with sensing and actuating capabilities cooperate with unparalleled convenience. Among many applications of IoT, healthcare is the most emerging in today's scenario, as new technological advancement creates opportunity for early detection of illnesses, quick decision generation and even aftercare monitoring. Nowadays, it has become a reality for many patients to be monitored remotely, overcoming traditional logistical obstacles. However, these e-health applications increase the concerns of security, privacy, and integrity of medical data. For secured transmission in IoT healthcare, data that has been gathered from sensors in a patient's body area network needs to be sent to the end user and might need to be aggregated, visualized and/or evaluated before being presented. Here, trust is critical. Therefore, an end-to-end trustworthy system architecture can guarantee the reliable transmission of a patient's data and confirms the success of IoT Healthcare application.
