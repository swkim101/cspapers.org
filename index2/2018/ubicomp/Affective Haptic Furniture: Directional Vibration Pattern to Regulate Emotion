Emotion regulation is an important part of humans' life and it is not only negative emotion that is harmful but excessive positive emotion could also prevent someone from achieving their goals. For example, high excitement that prevents someone from falling asleep. In our research, we are exploring the use of directional vibration patterns and embedding them onto a furniture to provide more accessibility to useful emotions. We have designed three vibration patterns and implemented them onto a chair-like cushion to evaluate the generated emotions in a user study.
