"RICKSHAW BUDDY" is a low-cost automated assistance system for three-wheeler auto rickshaws to reduce the high rate of accidents in the streets of developing countries like Bangladesh. It is a given fact that the lack of over speed alert, back camera, detection of rear obstacle and delay of maintenance are causes behind fatal accidents. These systems are absent not only in auto rickshaws but also most public transports. For this system, surveys have been done in different phases among the passengers, drivers and even the conductors for a useful and successful result. Since the system is very cheap, the low-income drivers and owners of vehicles will be able to afford it easily making road safety the first and foremost priority.
