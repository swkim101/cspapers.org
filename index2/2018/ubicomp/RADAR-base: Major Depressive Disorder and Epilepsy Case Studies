Emerging mobile health (mHealth) and eHealth technology could provide opportunities for remote monitoring and interventions for people with mental health and neurological disorders. RADAR-base is a modern mHealth data collection platform built around Confluent and Apache Kafka. Here we report progress on studies into two brain disorders: major depressive disorder and epilepsy. For depression an ambulatory study is being conducted with patients recruited to three sites and for epilepsy an in-hospital study is being carried out at two sites. Initial results show smartphones and wearable devices have potential to improve care for patients with depression and epilepsy.
