Digital cameras and smartphones have made it exceedingly convenient for people to take photographs. Anyone can easily take and store hundreds of pictures. With film cameras, the general assumption was that users paid more attention to the scenes, owing to the higher cost of photography materials. We hypothesize that user attentiveness has diminished because of the ease provided by digital cameras. To improve memory recall, we propose a viewer that, during photograph review, provides feedback of the user's heart rate at the time of shooting. We believe this will enhance memory recall more than extant photo viewers.
