We describe the vision, implementation and initial deployment experience with an App based crowd sourcing system for the analysis and prediction of the influence of aggregated individual behavior patterns on the spread of infectious diseases. The App builds on InfluenzaNet [19], a well established European participatory network of self reporting web platforms for monitoring Influeza-Like-Ilnesses (ILI) and goes starting from the current practice of explicit self reporting towards the use of sensor derived behavior information. The App has been cleared with the Regional Research Ethics Committee (CCER) in Geneva, Switzerland and was test deployed through the Google Play Store in Switzerland during last year's influenza season. It is currently being prepared for a broader European deployment.
