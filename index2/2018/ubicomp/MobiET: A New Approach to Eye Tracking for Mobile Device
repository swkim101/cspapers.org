In recent years, eye tracking technique has been greatly promoted. However, due to the limitations of the hardware performance of mobile device, the image captured by the mobile device camera has low resolution, so the existed image processing based eye tracking technique for mobile device still has low accuracy. This paper proposed an approach, MobiET, to compute the gaze fixation on mobile device. Based on the image processing of eye image, the rectangle area of eye was extracted; and then the geometric center of this area (EC), and the iris center of gravity (IC) were detected. Then the vector of EC-IC was generated, and by means of calibration, the mapping relationship between the vector and the gaze fixation coordinates could be calculated. The evaluation results showed that the proposed approach had high accuracy, e.g., 2.34 to 4.69 degrees of visual angle when the distance between eyes and smart phone screen was from 22 to 28 centimeters.
