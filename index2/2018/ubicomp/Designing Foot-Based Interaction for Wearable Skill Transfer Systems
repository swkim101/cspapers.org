Foot-based interaction for skill transfer is an underexplored domain. The goal of this research is to explore systems for transferring foot movements from an instructor to a recipient in a real-time performance-oriented context. Given this, we designed a wearable haptic-visual system consisting of a pair of smart shoes equipped with LED lights and haptic-enabled socks. This system focuses on portability and non-intrusiveness.
