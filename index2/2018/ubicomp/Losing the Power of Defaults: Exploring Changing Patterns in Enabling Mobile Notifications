One of the primary ways that people interact with applications on their mobile phones is through notifications. However, Android and iOS treat notifications differently, one being opt-in and the other being opt-out. We explore, through two identical survey studies spaced 2.5 years apart, changing practices in choosing to enable or disable notifications for certain types of mobile applications and how the power of defaults has lessened over time. We conclude with implications for apps that wish to use notifications to increase engagement.
