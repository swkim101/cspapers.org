People with visual impairments (PVI) experience difficulties with daily tasks that require visual queues, making PVI dependent on sighted people. Emergent assistive technology has proven to enable PVI with performing complex tasks, such as item identification by using phone applications or stand-alone assistive devices. Existing technologies currently fail to provide seamless interactions, where users can easily access information, at any location and time, without requiring the performance of multiple steps. In this research, we focus on augmenting PVI through wearable technology to provide seamless support in a mobile environment, such as the supermarket.
