This paper describes our effort to reconnect people to their surroundings in an urban setting, making them aware of the immediate environment. We present an initial exploration, as well as a first prototype to support urban wandering. Our first insights are encouraging, as it seems our prototype enhances the experience of wandering and helps users with lower ambiguity tolerance to engage in wandering activity.
