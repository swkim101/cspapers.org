An increasing number of travelers edit and share movies while traveling, owing to the widespread use of smartphones. Whereas short movies have garnered much attention, manually concatenating highlights and commentaries is often considered complicated for producing good movies. Thus, we propose a method for creating impressive short movies by reconstructing travel shorts based on their emotional arcs, ostensibly representing the emotional trajectories of stories in a time series. Our method extracts adjectives from travel movies utterances, calculates emotional scores using a sentiment dictionary, and rearranges scenes based on emotional arc templates. The templates consist of 194 popular cinema screenplays. We conduct a user study for which travelers evaluate short travel movies reconstructed by our method. Their impressions were changed according to templates of the emotional arcs.
