Sensor-based activity recognition is my core research area. As a Ph.D. student, I have been working on this area for healthcare monitoring system, fall detection, and elderly support system. My research approach is to improving activity recognition method by approaching better recognition performance (specially, abnormal activities of elders), which may lead to serious health concern if left unattended. Another target is to solve sensor network data loss problem which is one of the important issues to detect human activity properly. This workshop will be highly motivational and crucial for my learning and future research endeavor.
