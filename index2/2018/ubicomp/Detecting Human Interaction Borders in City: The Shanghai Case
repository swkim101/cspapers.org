Detecting human interaction borders in urban environment, the geographical perimeter of dense human mobility interaction, is important for mobility-related city resource allocation and urban planning. However, with the advance of transportation technology, dwellers' movements become convenient and flexible, leading to the doubts that whether such interaction borders exist and how they come into being. This poster investigates these problems via a cellular mobility dataset in Shanghai, China. From this large-scale dataset, we first build an urban flow network, where the node is city block and the edge is human mobility interaction frequency. Based on this network, we discover several spatial communities, and extract the borders of them as the interaction borders. We surprisingly find that the interaction borders do exist because city blocks in each spatial community are geographically connected. We further find that the borders are influenced not only by administrative policy but also by other factors in geographical and cultural aspects.
