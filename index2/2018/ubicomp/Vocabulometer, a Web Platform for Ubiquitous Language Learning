The Vocabulometer is a reading assistant system designed to record the reading activity of a user and to extract mutual information about the users and the read documents. The Vocabulometer stands as a web platform and offers services for analyzing which word is read at which time, estimating the reading skill of the user, the level of difficulty of a document, and recommending reading materials according to the user's vocabulary. For now the system is based on eye tracking but in the future we plan to make a smartphone application which do not need additional hardware.
