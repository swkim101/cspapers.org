Maintaining a positive and respectful attitude during a group discussion is the key to a healthy collaboration. Automatically capturing and effectively showcasing the attitudes expressed through one's face, voice, and quote can make the group members more aware of their emotions and behaviors. My work is on developing fully automated systems to analyze group discussions and provide feedback to improve discussion experience and team cohesion. I explore the automatic capture and analysis of audio-video data from the discussions, and the effective design principles of machine mediation for effective behavior changes. In this proposal, I describe the developed system that senses group dynamics and provides automated feedback for videoconferencing based group discussions, and discuss the ways in which it can evolve to address different challenges regarding effective collaboration.
