Sensors can be worn on various positions on the body such as wristband, clothes, armband, ring, etc. However the head is a strategic position as our brain, eyes, ears, nose and mouth are near. We introduce a short state of the art of the existing technologies for sensing the mental states and the possible applications on eyewear. Analyzing the physical activity has been broadly covered by sensing the physical movement of the body, but mental states need more fine analysis of physiological signals such as blood volume pressure, skin conductance, and brain activity. These signals can give information about emotions and knowledge of the users.
