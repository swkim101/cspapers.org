Emotions are the driving force for posting content on a social media platform. Although modeling and predicting in emotion with social media have been proposed, they often require post-investigation such as sentiment analysis. This often limits users to be aware of negative emotional states while publishing content on social media. In this project, we will propose an emotion detection technique by extracting the physiological responses of social media users from smartphone commodity sensors. We aim to provide design opportunities for social media platforms to raise emotional self-awareness of the users while using social media on the smartphone.
