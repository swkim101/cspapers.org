Radio frequency radar indoors is gaining traction owing to its promise for extended coverage and device-free operation. However, while the well-behaved radar sensing model affords clear advantages, the cluttered indoor environment presents numerous challenges for reliable human sensing. Classic radar techniques are hard to call upon since the kinematic and clutter behaviours in aerospace are vastly different from their indoor counterparts. We demonstrate the peculiarities of indoor radar using a commercial 2D array commodity device in the 6 to 8.5 GHz band. We then present a set of processing tools suited for indoor radar human sensing. We show that excessive indoor clutter and erratic human kinematics can be largely mitigated building on such processing tools without resorting to much low-level techniques unsupported by commercial commodity radars.
