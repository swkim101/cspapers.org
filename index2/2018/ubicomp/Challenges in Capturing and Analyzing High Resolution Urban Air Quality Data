Classic measurement grids with their static and expensive infrastructure are unfit to realize modern air quality monitoring needs, such as source appointment, pollution tracking or the assessment of personal exposure. Fine grained air quality assessment (both in time and space) is the future. Different approaches, ranging from measurement with low-cost sensors over advanced modeling and remote sensing to combinations of these have been proposed. This position paper summarizes our previous contributions in this field and lists what we see as open challenges for future research.
