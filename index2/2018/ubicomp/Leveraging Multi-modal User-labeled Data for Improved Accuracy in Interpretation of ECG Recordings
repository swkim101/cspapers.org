This paper presents our preliminary design of the Reaching the Frail Elderly Patient for Optimizing Diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation (REAFEL) system that helps to improve accuracy in interpretation of Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings by leveraging multi-modal user-labeled data and other contextual information from mobile devices. We describe the methods to collect and visualize the data, discuss the challenges associated with the project and conclude the paper by outlining future work.
