In this paper, a novel wearable respiration sensor using ultrasound transducer is proposed. Respiration is one of interesting physiological information which are affected by voluntary and in-voluntary motions. Hence, respiration reflects the consciousness and unconsciousness of person's state such as sleep, speaking, etc. The ultrasound transducer installed into the sensor can detect small abdominal movement as the impedance variation by pressure. In addition, the wide dynamic range allows to measure respiration under various situations in daily living. Moreover, our wearable sensor has generic devices such as accelerometer and the software development kit enables users to handle data obtained from these sensor. We demonstrate that the proposed sensor can measure respiration information precisely in various conditions through an experiment.
