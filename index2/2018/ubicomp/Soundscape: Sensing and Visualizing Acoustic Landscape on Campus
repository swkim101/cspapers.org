Soundscape or acoustic landscape is an important spatial characteristic that can influence real estate development and urban economics. Understanding of soundscape is thus essential for urban design and planning. This paper presents the development and implementation of our Soundscape system that senses and visualizes soundscape in an area on campus, as a case study. Unlike other soundscape sensing approaches that can only capture instance sound levels of the area, our system can collect and visualize longitudinal soundscape information that better reflects aggregate spatial characteristics.
