Thanks to the emergence of mobile computing technologies, location-based services (LBS) have been widely used. Massive data of LBS user activities would be useful for studying human mobility and urban computing. In this paper, we design and implement LBSLab, a system which facilitates large-scale data collection of mobile user activities, and provides data visualization in an informative way. LBSLab interacts with users via a mini-program built in the WeChat app, assembling several representative location-related functions such as conducting check-ins. A mobile user can join a data collection experiment by simply scanning a QR code. LBSLab can serve as an efficient system to study the user behavior of LBS-related applications.
