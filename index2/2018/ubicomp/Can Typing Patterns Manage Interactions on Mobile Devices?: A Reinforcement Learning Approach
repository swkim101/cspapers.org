The explosion of IoT devices has meant that our daily activities will continue to be influenced by such technologies. This paves the way for a deluge of notifications to interrupt us frequently. Such interruptions can result in frequent task switching where a user might put off one's activities to respond to such notifications. We devise a strategy through which we can mitigate these notifications by relying on the user's typing patterns. Furthermore, with the help of a reinforcement learning algorithm, the feedback from these typing patterns is used by the system to manage the notification system.
