The collection of human contributions through mobile devices is increasingly common across a range of methodologies. However, possible quality issues of these contributions are often overlooked. As the quality of human data has a direct impact on study reliability, more should be done to improve the accuracy of these contributions. We identify and categorise solutions aimed at increasing the accuracy of contributions prior, during, and following data collection. Our categorisation assists in the positioning of future work in this area and fosters the usage of cross-methodological practises.
