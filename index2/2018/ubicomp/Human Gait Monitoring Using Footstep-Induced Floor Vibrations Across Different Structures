In this paper, we present a structure-adaptive approach for monitoring human gait using footstep-induced floor vibrations. Human gait information is critical for timely and accurate assessment and diagnosis of many health conditions. Footstep-induced vibration monitoring has been introduced in prior works as an accurate and cost-effective mean to provide continuous gait monitoring in indoor environments. Prior works in this field typically rely on inverse modeling approaches to map signal characteristics to gait information, but are limited due to varying signal characteristics in each new deployment structure. These changing characteristics introduce errors when attempting to use a model trained in one structure in another structure. To overcome this challenge, we propose a structure-adaptive approach that enables the transfer of a model trained in one structure to a new structure where no training data is present. To this end, we first find a lower-dimension space in which vibration responses share similarity across various structures and label the data in the target structure. Then, we use the labeled data to train a new model for footstep detection and monitoring in that structure. We evaluated our approach through real-world experiments in three types of structures (wood, concrete, and steel). Our evaluation results show that our approach achieves a footstep detection accuracy of between 85 and 97 percent and F1-score of between 86 and 97 percent, which represents 3-10X and 2. 2-15X improvements over the baseline approach, respectively.
