We present how crowdsensing with civil officers contribute to collect larger amount of urban data with high spatial-temporal coverage, and enable to understand urban features by analyzing the data. We implemented a crowdsensing system which fits to daily city management, and conducted long-term experiment with garbage section of Fujisawa city, Japan. Based on analysis of collected data, we show that our system provide fine-grained urban data compared to crowdsensing with citizens with improving efficiency of city management. In addition, we analyze our dataset with demographic urban data, and clarified the relationship between pattern of uncollectible garbage thrown and features of resident area.
