The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation recognition challenge presents a unique opportunity to the activity-recognition community - providing a large, real-life dataset with activities different from those typically being recognized. This paper describes our submission (team JSI Classic) to the competition that was organized by the dataset authors. We used a carefully executed machine learning approach, achieving 90% accuracy classifying eight different activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Car, Bus, Train, Subway). The first step was data preprocessing, including a normalization of the phone orientation. Then, a wide set of hand-crafted domain features in both frequency and time domain were computed and their quality was evaluated. Finally, the appropriate machine learning model was chosen (XGBoost) and its hyper-parameters were optimized. The recognition result for the testing dataset will be presented in the summary paper of the challenge [13].
