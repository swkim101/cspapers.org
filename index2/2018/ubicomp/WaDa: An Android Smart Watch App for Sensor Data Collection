Researchers, particularly in the area of ubiquitous and wearable computing, often spend significant amount of effort and time in developing devices and/or apps for data collection. Most of the apps and devices are customized with limited options, and they are usually non-generic or publicly unavailable. In this paper, we present WaDa, an easy to use app for sensor data collection from commercial off-the-shelf Android smart watches. It provides handy features such as user-defined labels, time synchronization, sensor selection, and data navigation. WaDa, freely available for research and academic purposes, facilitates prompt data collection without requiring expertise and effort for custom device/app development.
