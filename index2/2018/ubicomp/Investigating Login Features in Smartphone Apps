Recent revelations about data breaches have heightened users' consciousness about the privacy of their online activity. An often overlooked avenue of collection of users' personal information are registration processes and/or social logins, such as login with Facebook or Google, implemented by smartphone apps. Although the extent of social login implementations on websites has been widely studied, there is negligible research on the extent of implementation of login features on smartphone apps. Hence, this work contributes to further the understanding of smartphone apps ecosystem through investigating whether smartphone apps use login features, and what relationships exist between login features and apps popularity. To address this research gap this work presents the systematic analysis of the publicly available Rico dataset, which contains 72,000 unique UI screen designs that describes smartphone apps design properties for 9,717 Android apps.
