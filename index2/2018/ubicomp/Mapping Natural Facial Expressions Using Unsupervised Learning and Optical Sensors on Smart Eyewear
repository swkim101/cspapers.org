Our communication highly depends on nonverbal clues, especially on facial expressions. This paper presents the mapping of spontaneous facial expressions in daily conversation using the optical sensors on smart eyewear and unsupervised learning method(Self-Organizing Map) to see the potentially detectable expressions. We had the case study of five to ten minutes of the unscripted communications with five users. It showed that our system could map the various facial expressions of the users such as social smile and the smile of enjoyment. The study also demonstrated that the map trained with the datasets of five users could categorize the similar expressions of each user into the shared clusters among the users.
