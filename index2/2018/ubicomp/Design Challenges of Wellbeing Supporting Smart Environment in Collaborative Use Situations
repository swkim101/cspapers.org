Recent technological development offers new possibilities for taking into account peoples' personal wellness data in adjustment of environment conditions. For example, users' heartrate, facial expression, room temperature, and CO2 data could be used for adjustment of lighting, temperature, and air-condition to support people's wellbeing in smart environment. Using personal wellness data for adaptive smart environment condition controlling seems inviting, however before expensive implementation is started, it is essential to know peoples' perceptions towards such systems to be able to create environments that people want to use. We conducted an anticipated user experience study of an adaptive wellbeing supporting meeting room concept video with 48 participants. Based on our results we present the four design challenges for future research.
