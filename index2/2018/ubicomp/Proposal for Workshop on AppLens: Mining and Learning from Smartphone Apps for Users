Smartphone applications (abbr. apps) are becoming ubiquitous in our everyday life. Apps on smartphones can sense users' behaviors and activities, providing a lens for understanding users, which is an important point in the community of ubiquitous computing. In UbiComp 2018, we would like to run a workshop on mining and learning from smartphone apps for users (AppLens). It seeks for participants interested in understanding users from their use of smartphone apps, such as mining user attributes and discovering life patterns, discovering cultural and social phenomenon by analyzing app usage, such as social event detection, recognizing app usage behaviors, such as app overuse detection, and studying smartphone apps, such as app categorization and app popularity prediction. This workshop will include paper sessions, two invited talks, and a panel session, so as to keep participants engaged to make the workshop more interactive. It provides a forum for the participants to communicate and discuss issues to promote the emerging research field. Moreover, we will select a few accepted papers to be extended and published in a prestigious journal special issue.
