Health monitoring using a wearable device is gaining increasing research interest. Several longitudinal studies have been conducted across college students taking advantage of the robust data acquisition of wearable devices. In these studies, watch-type wearable device and mobile phone are often used to collect data. However, longitudinal activity tracking using an eyewear-type device is challenging because such devices often result in significant discomfort to the user due to their bulky hardware. This paper reports on a longitudinal study on high school students using commercial electrooculography glasses to track study activity. Initial result indicates that weekly feedback via text messages can contribute to longer use of the device.
