College students are exposed to smartphone distraction during study-related contexts (e.g., classrooms, self and group studies). This constant distraction may lower their academic performance. In this work, we built a simple context-aware proactive blocking prototype to explore the patterns of focusing contexts, and to evaluate user experiences of proactive blocking for distraction management in study-related contexts for college students. Our preliminary user study shows the positive effects of proactive blocking. We discuss several design implications for context-aware proactive blocking and semi-automated logging for distraction management.
