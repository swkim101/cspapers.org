In this study, an Automated Assistance System "RICHSHAW BUDDY" has been developed for three-wheeler Auto Rickshaws. In developing countries like Bangladesh, Auto Rickshaws are one of the key parts of transportation. They are also the reason for most fatal accidents (~85%) because of over speed, lack of maintenance and absence of back viewer [1]. In this research, we have developed a complete assistance system with rear-view monitoring, back obstacle sensor, an over speed sensor and a maintenance scheduler which are integrated into a user-friendly app. We have designed a system to overcome the downsides with minimal costing and easy installation process. To appraise the effectiveness, we installed this system in real Auto Rickshaw in the road. Astounded responses were accomplished by the Auto Rickshaw drivers while tested and demonstrated. This novel work creates a new pathway to increase road safety and consciousness of driving rules.
