I, Sahiti Kunchay, am a student of the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) at The Pennsylvania State University, enrolled in the IST's PhD program's Fall 2018 cohort, with the expected date of graduation being May 2023. My undergraduate background in Computer Science and Sociology offered me the unique perspective of identifying and investigating pressing issues through the combined lens of research methodologies in computing as well as social sciences. As a part of my research career, I have been involved in multiple projects, which yielded publications accepted at workshops co-located with conferences such as ACM CHI, ACM SenSys and ACM MobiSys. Along with being awarded the Student Travel Grant by SIGMOBILE, I have also been awarded the ACM-W Scholarship to present my work at the aforementioned venues.
