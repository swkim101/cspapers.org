Poster: Building a system of FinD Control devices such as a keyboard or a touch panel have been widely used. Instead of touching something, the movement of fingers itself can be an input means. Although there were several trials to detect the movement of fingers, they necessitated special sensors, either rings or gloves, attached to the fingers. Based on the background, we have developed a system to identify the moved finger called FinD using the acceleration signals obtained with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smart watches. The experiment results show that FinD can distinguish the movement of at least three fingers.
