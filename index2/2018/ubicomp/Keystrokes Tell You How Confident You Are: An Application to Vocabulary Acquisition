The vocabulary acquisition is a complex task which needs continuous reviewing. Existing vocabulary acquisition tools take into account only the correctness of the answers. However, it is important to know if the user has a knowledge misconception or give an answer by chance. This information can be assessed through the user's confidence. We aim to construct a confidence estimation system that will help the users reviewing more effectively. We analyze the keystroke information of 12 participants answering 120 vocabulary questions on a smartphone, and estimate whether they feel confident about their answers. We obtained an accuracy of 89.1% in a user-independent case.
