Wireless charging pads such as Qi are rapidly gaining ground, but its limited power supply range still requires precise placement on a specific point. 2-D wireless power transfer (WPT) sheets consisting of coil arrays are one well-known solution for this issue [3]. However, these approaches require custom-made designs by experts; what we need is a system that can be reconfigured by simply placing ready-made modules on the intended surface. In this demo, we present "Alvus", a reconfigurable 2-D wireless charging system which enables such simple construction of wireless charging surfaces. Alvus is based on multihop WPT, which constructs "virtual power codes" and consists of three types of ready-made resonator modules: transmitter, relay, and receiver. Our system instantly and interactively forms wireless charging surface on everyday objects (e.g. floor, wall, table, etc.) only by placing the resonator modules.
