We present the activity of strolling as an artistic practice. With this we make an invitation to be lost in the geography of an urban setting. The main concept is to provide the physical space with a communication level that would be pleasant to discover while wandering without a destination. We want to support fl√¢nerie as way for recapturing the dimensions of both time and space against the modern division between work, conviviality, rest and family life which are typical of modernism. Therefore the Post-Modern paradigm of valuing heterotopias drives this contribution. Along with considerations about semiotics, sonification, ecological psychology and digital jewellery we would like to furnish a possible way to imbue the sub-urban areas of genius loci, the spirit of a place.
