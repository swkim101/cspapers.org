In the current global fashion market, the utilization of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has continuously enhanced retail sales performance and productivity. The purpose of this study was to review the literature on RFID utilization in the See-Now-Buy-Now fashion business model. This study identified five conditions to meet by fashion companies for efficient RFID incorporation into the See-Now-Buy-Now fashion business model, which require immediate order fulfillment after presenting their runway collections: (a) essential RFID components, (b) a compatible cloud-based solution, (c) predictive analysis capability, (d) strong IT infrastructure for operating mobile commerce, and (e) a vertically integrated supply chain. The current research also determined major challenges of current RFID used in the fashion industry, such as passive RFID tag limitations, cloud system interoperability, and privacy and security concerns on RFID data sharing.
