The power of cloud computing is in the inherent ability to scale and share resources at internet scale. In the meantime, the power of edge computing is in the ubiquity of its resources and their proximity to data sources. The collaborative use of these two computing platforms (collaborative distributed computing) is of great practical importance. In this research, we study the seamless integration of edge devices, edge servers and cloud resources as a collaborative distributed system. As the first step towards the realization of collaborative distributed computing, we investigate the feasibility of edge-based video summarization, as a case study. Experimental results show the effective use of edge servers in the close proximity saves internet bandwidth usage and leverages the processing of latency-sensitive jobs.
