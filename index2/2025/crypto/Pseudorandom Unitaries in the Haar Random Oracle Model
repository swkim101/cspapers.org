The quantum Haar random oracle model is an idealized model where every party has access to a single Haar random unitary and its inverse. We construct strong pseudorandom unitaries in the quantum Haar random oracle model. This strictly improves upon prior works who either only prove the existence of pseudorandom unitaries in the inverseless quantum Haar random oracle model [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin, EUROCRYPT 2025] or prove the existence of a weaker notion (implied by strong pseudorandom unitaries) in the quantum Haar random oracle model [Hhan, Yamada, 2024]. Our results also present a viable approach for building quantum pseudorandomness from random quantum circuits and analyzing pseudorandom objects in nature.
