This extended abstract outlines our research on designing intelligent network infrastructures for Extended Reality (XR). The research aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) in overcoming the limitations of traditional network infrastructures for XR in discrete content representation, handcrafted compression, and redundancy-based system resilience. To build a practical AI-based XR system, we introduce our AI-system co-design methodology, featuring system optimizations driven by AI models' in-depth measurements and AI algorithms inspired by the XR system's context analysis. We design and implement systems that showcase AI-system co-design advances photo-realism, efficiency, and resilience of network infrastructures for XR practically.
