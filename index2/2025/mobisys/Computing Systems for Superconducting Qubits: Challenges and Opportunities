Superconducting qubits have emerged as leading candidates for realizing quantum computers, which are particularly useful for solving computational problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical supercomputers. The performance of such systems critically depends on the precision and reliability of their control infrastructure. In this paper, we present an overview of state-of-the-art quantum control systems, including both closed- and open-source solutions, and discuss their respective advantages and limitations. While we review both categories, we focus more extensively on open-source control platforms and explore how their flexibility and programmability can support the research community and drive progress in the field. Lastly, we outline several promising research directions in quantum computing infrastructure, including scalable control, high-precision readout, and leakage suppression. We believe that these areas should be prioritized by the community, as they are critical to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation.
