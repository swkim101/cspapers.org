Air travel often lacks cohesive digital tools to support both pre-trip organization and engaging in-flight experiences. We present FlyEnJoy, a mobile application with an offline-first architecture that integrates itinerary planning management, and in-flight social features to improve travel satisfaction. The system highlights local peer-to-peer networking for realtime in-flight interaction without the Internet and context-aware smart planning tools that adapt to each trip. This demo paper outlines the design and technical components of FlyEnJoy, including its offline-first design, peer-to-peer networking and context-aware smart planning approach. We also discuss insights from a traveler survey that motivated the need for such a platform and conclude with a demonstration that showcases the capabilities of FlyEnJoy in a live scenario.
