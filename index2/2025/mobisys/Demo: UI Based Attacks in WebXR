The WebXR API enables immersive AR/VR experiences directly through web browsers on head-mounted displays (HMDs). However, prior research shows that security-sensitive UI properties and the lack of an  like element that separates different origins can be exploited to manipulate user actions, particularly within the advertising ecosystem. In our prior work, we proposed five novel UI-based attacks in WebXR, targeting the ad ecosystem. This demo presents these attacks in a unified gaming application, embedding each into distinct interactive scenarios. Our work highlights the need to address design challenges and requirements for improving immersive web-based experiences. We provide our demo video at: https://youtu.be/lTBQbxnNq34.
