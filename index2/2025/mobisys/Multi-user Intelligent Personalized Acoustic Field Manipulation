Personalized acoustic field manipulation enables tailored audio experiences in scenarios like multi-user immersive environments and acoustic augmented reality. However, conventional systems rely on headphones or bulky speaker arrays, which pose significant limitations in terms of user comfort, mobility, and practicality. Despite advances in the field, there remains a critical gap in achieving device-free, compact, and flexible personalized sound field control system for multiple users. To address the challenges, our work explores the feasibility of achieving audible sound field manipulation and integrates directional sensing through air nonlinearity while maintaining device-free and compact size. Specifically, we designed and implemented a series of novel systems to enable functionalities including multi-user directional audio delivery, independent audible zones construction, and multi-user simultaneous sensing and communication. These solutions enhance personalized audio experiences in shared spaces and open new possibilities for future applications in both immersive and interactive environments.
