Live volumetric video streaming enables immersive user experiences but poses significant challenges due to the high bandwidth requirement that 3D representations entail. Recent research has focused on reducing volumetric video bandwidth, but it struggles to effectively address temporal redundancy under real-time constraints, limiting its applicability for live streaming scenarios. To address these challenges, we present DeltaStream, a novel live volumetric video streaming system that efficiently encodes 3D point clouds by leveraging 2D information. By utilizing 2D RGB and depth frames, DeltaStream efficiently infers inter-frame changes to reduce the streaming bandwidth of volumetric video. Furthermore, DeltaStream introduces an adaptive block-based approach that can reduce the client-side decoding load. Through extensive evaluations, our results demonstrate that DeltaStream reduces bandwidth by up to 71% with 1.63× faster decoding speed while maintaining visual quality compared to state-of-the-art systems.
