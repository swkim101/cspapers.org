Adversarial attacks with real objects or lasers on car-borne LiDAR-based object detection are concerning. The existing defense approaches are often designed to address specific attacks and short of considering adaptive attackers who may adapt based on all available information about the deployed defense to maximize attack effect. This paper proposes Hyper3Def, a new defense for the function of detecting vehicle objects, which uses a Hypernet to generate an ensemble of multiple new detection models when needed at run time. The detection results of these models are fused to give the final result. As a dynamic defense, Hyper3Def revokes an important basis of the adaptive attack, i.e., the object detection model is needed to plan effective adversarial perturbations. Evaluation based on open data and real-world experiments with embedded system implementation show that, when confronting adaptive attacks, Hyper3Def outperforms various baseline defenses including the adversarial training, which is often cited as the state of the art.
