Boundary violations—array out-of-bounds accesses, integer overflows, and stray pointer offsets—remain a leading cause of software failure. Classical analyses such as abstract interpretation and symbolic execution try to detect such errors, yet the exponential growth of program states forces them to trade precision for scalability. We introduce QCheck, the first quantum framework aimed at boundary checking of classical programs. QCheck converts a program into a quantum circuit that places all feasible executions in superposition and then applies a fixed-point quantum search to amplify exactly those states that cross a user-supplied bound. This shrinks the worst-case cost of overflow detection from O(N) path explorations to [EQUATION] oracle calls while preserving soundness. The synthesised circuits require qubit counts and depths on par with Shor's factoring circuit, suggesting near-term hardware feasibility. We evaluated QCheck on 10 benchmark programs drawn from the SV-COMP suite and canonical algorithms such as GCD and Fibonacci. Running on IBM Qiskit's simulator with 3-bit variable widths, QCheck flagged all injected boundary bugs with zero false positives, whereas Frama-C raised spurious alerts on up to 70.8 % of the same workloads and Angr timed out on half of them. Additional experiments confirm that the fixed-point search reaches its theoretical 75 % success probability (for δ = 0.5) once the iteration count exceeds the minimal threshold, validating the practical soundness of our decoder. These results demonstrate that quantum-assisted boundary checking can combine exhaustive exploration with quantum speed-ups, opening a new path toward reliable software analysis in the NISQ era and beyond.
