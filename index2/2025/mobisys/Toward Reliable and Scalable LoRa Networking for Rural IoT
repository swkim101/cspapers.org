The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing our interaction with the physical world, significantly enhancing precision agriculture, infrastructure monitoring, forest fire prevention, environmental protection, and numerous other applications in rural areas. Deploying reliable and scalable wireless connectivity in rural areas is critical, but it presents distinct technical and economic challenges. Local area wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, provide limited coverage and consume high power. They are not suitable for rural scenarios. Cellular technologies like LTE and 5G offer wide-area coverage but involve high infrastructure costs and power consumption. Recently, Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) have become promising alternatives. They address rural IoT needs by offering long-range communication, low power consumption, and reduced deployment costs. Among LPWAN technologies, LoRa stands out due to its robustness, scalability, and affordability. In a typical LoRa network architecture (Node-Gateway-Server), sensor nodes collect data and transmit via LoRa radio signals to nearby gateways (fronthaul). Gateways subsequently relay the aggregated data to cloud servers through backhaul connections, typically using cellular networks or wired links. However, deploying LoRa in real rural environments presents unique and significant challenges, as shown in Table 1.
