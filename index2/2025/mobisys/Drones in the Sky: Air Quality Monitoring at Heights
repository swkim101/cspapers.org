Air pollution represents a critical global health challenge. Traditional air quality monitoring methods, which rely on expensive stations or extensive low-cost sensor networks, often fall short in capturing the fine spatial and temporal variations of pollutants, particularly in urban environments dominated by vehicular emissions. Recent advancements in drone technology offer a novel solution to these limitations, enabling the collection of high-resolution air quality data across different altitudes and environments. We contribute by investigating the potential of drone-based air quality monitoring. Specifically, we conduct measurements in two distinct settings: an industrial site and a residential area. We present analytical findings that highlight the effectiveness of drones in capturing pollutant levels and discuss the key challenges associated with this technology. Our findings underscore the promise of drone-based monitoring in enhancing air quality assessment and inform directions for future research.
