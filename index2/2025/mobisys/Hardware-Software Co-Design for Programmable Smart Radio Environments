In this abstract, we introduce the concept of a programmable smart radio environment, which can be controlled and tuned by software to reconfigure itself in real time based on application needs. We design programmable smart surface systems and deploy them on buildings and vehicles to physically control radio environments. Our ideas are implemented as hardware-software systems, integrated into city-scale wireless testbeds alongside existing network protocols, and validated through rigorous experimental evaluation.
