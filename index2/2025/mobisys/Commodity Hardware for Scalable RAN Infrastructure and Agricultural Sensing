Next-generation wireless networks promise massive connectivity with higher data rates and lower latency, offering transformative potential for agriculture by enabling smarter, more efficient, and sustainable farming practices. However, the advancement of wireless infrastructure and precision agriculture is constrained by the need for specialized, costly hardware. Our research addresses this challenge by designing systems that leverage general-purpose commodity hardware for both radio-access network (RAN) infrastructure and soil monitoring. By utilizing existing servers at edge and cloud data centers, as well as ubiquitous Wi-Fi devices, we can eliminate the need for expensive, dedicated equipment, reducing costs and accelerating the evolution of wireless and agricultural sensing technologies.
