The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into physical agents, such as drones, robots, and autonomous vehicles, demands not only intelligence but also timely perception and decision-making. This work presents a time-sensitive AI system architecture that addresses the critical timing challenges inherent in such intelligent physical agents. We propose system-level designs that enable deadline-aware Deep Neural Network (DNN) execution on edge/embedded platforms, along with time-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) serving on edge servers, thereby providing end-to-end support for time-critical physical intelligence.
