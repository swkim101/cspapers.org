Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are undesirable for academic research due to the difficulty of modification and the inability to readily program missions from a companion computer. Furthermore, open-source designs are scarce and unreliable. To address this gap, we present ROARQuad - a Robust and Open source Academic Research Quadcopter. Our quadcopter costs around $1,500, provides over thirty minutes of flight time, and has a maximum payload of nearly 2 kilograms. To support research into swarm coordination and planning, we have experimentally derived the power consumption profile of the vehicle. Our quadcopter not only addresses the limitations of existing COTS and academic designs but also provides a flexible and reliable solution for future UAV research and development.
