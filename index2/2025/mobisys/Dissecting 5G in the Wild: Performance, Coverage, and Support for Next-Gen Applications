5G, officially rolled out in 2019, has been rapidly deployed by major mobile network operators across the globe. Key advancements in 5G such as higher-order modulation, massive MIMO, wider channels, and higher operating frequencies, have set high expectations over the predecessor technology LTE, especially for enabling high-bandwidth and latency-sensitive applications such as Mixed Reality (XR), Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), and 360° video streaming — often referred to as 5G "killer" apps. While 5G's technical promises have fueled widespread excitement, understanding its true impact requires a closer look at the real-world performance delivered to end users. This abstract highlights our ongoing efforts over the past four years to systematically evaluate the performance and capabilities, and uncover different operator policies of operational 5G networks through extensive out-in-the-wild measurement campaigns. We examine network coverage, throughput, latency, and emerging features, as well as 5G's interaction with the "killer" apps. Our findings reveal both the strengths and limitations of current 5G deployments. Building on these insights, we also propose and implement solutions aimed at addressing key challenges, with an eye toward shaping the design of future 5G and Beyond-5G (B5G) systems.
