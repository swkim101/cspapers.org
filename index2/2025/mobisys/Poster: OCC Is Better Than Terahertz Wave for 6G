The increasing demands of next-generation wireless applications are straining the limited sub-6 GHz spectrum. While terahertz wave (T-Wave) offers expanded bandwidths for 6G, its short range, increased energy use, and high costs limit viability. Optical Camera Communications (OCC) is a practical alternative, using image sensors to simultaneously decode multiple spatially-separated optical streams. OCC offers T-Wave-like directional communication, with added benefits such as signal origin verification and precise localization, at a higher technology readiness level. As an example, OCC can support applications like vehicle-to-everything (V2X), enabling ranging, lane-level positioning, and pedestrian safety. We also validated OCC's viability in dense, high-throughput scenarios through prototypes built with COTS components.
