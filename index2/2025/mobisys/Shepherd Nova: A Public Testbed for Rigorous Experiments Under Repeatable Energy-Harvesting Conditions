Public testbeds are essential for replicable experiments and meaningful comparisons on shared physical infrastructure. While many testbeds exist for battery-powered Internet of Things (IoT) systems, there is a lack of public testbeds for observing and profiling the distributed operation of energy-harvesting IoT systems, including battery-free devices. We fill this gap and present Shepherd Nova, the first public testbed designed to support experiments under repeatable energy-harvesting conditions. Shepherd Nova uses field-recorded harvesting data to supply power to devices, consistently replicating real-world spatio-temporal energy availability across multiple experiments. Its virtual power source supports diverse ambient energy sources, harvesting circuitry, and energy storage devices. Moreover, Shepherd Nova provides services like general-purpose input/output (GPIO) tracing, power profiling, and serial output logging, all of which can run synchronously and with high resolution. Sub-microsecond synchronization enables precise correlation between these observations and emulated energy-harvesting conditions, offering unprecedented insights into distributed energy-harvesting IoT systems. In this paper, we describe Shepherd Nova's design, characterize its performance, and demonstrate its capabilities through controlled experiments and an example test case.
