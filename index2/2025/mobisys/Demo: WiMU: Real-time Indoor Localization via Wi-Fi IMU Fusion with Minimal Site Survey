Due to the ubiquitous deployment of WiFi infrastructure, numerous studies have employed WiFi RSSI fingerprinting for indoor localization. However, fingerprinting methods necessitate labour-intensive site surveys for fingerprint collection and location annotation. To address these limitations, we propose WiMU, a real-time indoor localization system that integrates WiFi and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to enhance the real-time performance and accuracy of localization. WiMU operates on commodity WiFi infrastructure without the need for additional hardware, leveraging crowd-sourced user trajectories to learn spatial representations of access points (APs). These representations can be fine-tuned with minimal labeled data to support effective localization. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that WiMU reduces the cost of building an indoor localization system while ensuring high positioning accuracy, paving the way for the large-scale deployment of real-time indoor localization systems.
