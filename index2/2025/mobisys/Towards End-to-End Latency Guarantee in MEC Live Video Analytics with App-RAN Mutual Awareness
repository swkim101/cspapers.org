While mobile live video analytics apps require end-to-end latency guarantee for responsiveness and immersiveness, achieving consistent low latency is challenging due to complex fluctuations of wireless channel and scene complexity; for example, latency SLO satisfaction rate drops to as low as 26% in commercial 5G MEC platforms. Prior works mostly focus on either app-only (bitrate, DNN adaptation, or GPU allocation) or RAN-only (radio resource allocation) scheduling, with mutual ignorance of the other side resulting in mismatched scheduling decisions and frequent SLO violations. Coordinating the two schedulers is also challenging, as they are run separately by network and cloud operators with disjoint control. We present ARMA, an end-to-end live video analytics system with app-RAN mutual-awareness for high end-to-end latency SLO satisfaction in MEC. We design a mutually-aware decoupled scheduling mechanism on top of RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) in Open-RAN architecture that fosters cooperative interaction between the two operators' schedulers while preserving operational proprietaries. We prototype an Open RAN-enabled 5G MEC testbed and evaluate ARMA, showing that ARMA achieves 97% SLO satisfaction rate.
