MmWave FMCW radars are integrated into many sensing systems for robust sensing. However, their sensing functions are vulnerable to spoofing attacks and interfered with by backscatter communications, both of which can cause sensor malfunction and system failure. Noticing that radar spoofing and communication share similar signal modulation mechanisms, in this paper, we present SCR, a new Spoofing-resilient and Communication-integrated Radar sensing scheme. SCR is based on the rigorous analysis of the radar sensing model that highlights the differences between modulated spoofing and communication signals and normal sensing signals reflected by natural objects. The key designs of SCR are a novel chirp configuration scheme and signal processing pipeline, which signify different patterns between modulated and normal signals in radar spectra, for reliable detection of spoofing and communication. We have developed SCR and tested it with actual 77 GHz mmWave radar sensors and backscatter prototypes. Our field tests show that SCR can reliably detect fake objects created by modulated signals in both velocity and distance radar sensing domains.
