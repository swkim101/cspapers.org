Ubiquitous acoustic intelligence leverages the pervasiveness of sound and the ubiquity of microphones/speakers to enable intelligent, seamless, and privacy-preserving interaction between humans and mobile devices. However, enabling such intelligence poses multiple challenges: human voice and behavior manifest in acoustics in subtle, complex ways that are difficult to capture robustly; acoustic communication suffers from significant distortion in complex environments and cross-heterogeneous devices; and processing audio data requires careful design to ensure privacy and efficiency. To address these challenges, we developed a series of systems across three pillars: intelligent acoustic sensing, robust acoustic communication, and privacy-aware acoustic computing.
