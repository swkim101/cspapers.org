Sign language is the primary communication channel used by deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people. However, they face significant barriers in interacting with hearing people who are unfamiliar with sign language. In this poster, we propose SiHear, a system over wearable smart glasses to enable two-way, seamless and real-time communication between DHH and hearing individuals for daily use. SiHear supports two communication modes: (1) "I See You Hear" for translating the signs performed by the DDH people into speech which can be heard by the hearing people, and (2) "You See I Hear" for converting the spoken language by the hearing people into the sign language which can be seen by the DDH people on their smart glasses. We implement SiHear on commodity glasses each tethered with an Android phone and a laptop.
