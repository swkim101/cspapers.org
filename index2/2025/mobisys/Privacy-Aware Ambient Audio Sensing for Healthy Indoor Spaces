Indoor airborne transmission poses a significant health risk, yet current monitoring solutions are invasive, costly, or fail to address it directly. My research explores the untapped potential of ambient audio sensing to estimate key transmission risk factors such as ventilation, aerosol emissions, and occupant distribution—non-invasively and in real time. I develop privacy-preserving systems that leverage existing microphones to monitor the whole spectrum of indoor air quality which can have a significant effect on an individual's health. This work lays the foundation for privacy-aware airborne risk monitoring using everyday devices.
