Human-wildlife conflicts in residential/agricultural settings rely on ineffective deterrents like rodenticides or fences. We introduce InvisibleFence, a modular 3D-printed Vision Pod system with off-the-shelf deterrents. The Vision Pod fuses a 2K camera and 240° motion sensing with an edge-optimized pipeline trained on 44,000 wildlife images of eleven classes—achieving 86.7% mAP. Benchmarking YOLO variants (416p–2K) ensures performance. Upon detection, it sends MQTT commands to drive deterrent units—ultrasonic speakers or lighting/spray modules—that emit tones without affecting humans or pets. InvisibleFence creates adaptive zones that reduce false triggers and limit habituation.
