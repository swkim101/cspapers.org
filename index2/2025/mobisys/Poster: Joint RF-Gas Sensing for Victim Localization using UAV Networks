Using UAVs has recently emerged as a cost-efficient solution to assist first responders in search and rescue missions. Victims are usually equipped with wireless devices, which makes RF sensing an efficient solution for their localization in disaster situations. Nevertheless, the success of existing methods is highly diminished by the noisy nature of RF measurements. While leveraging recent advancements in lightweight gas sensing, we present in this ongoing work paper a novel localization approach that efficiently combines RF measurements with victim odor information while accounting for the dynamic nature of measurements' quality. We discuss the approach design, early simulation results, and ongoing experimental evaluation.
