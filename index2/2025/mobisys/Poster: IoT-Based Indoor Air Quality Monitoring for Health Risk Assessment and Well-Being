We study the impact of air pollutants on occupants' health by deploying 26 low-cost IoT air quality sensors in the UbiKampus office space at the University of Helsinki. Our data shows significant air quality variation even within meter-scale distances, highlighting the need for detailed indoor air quality monitoring and emphasizing the potential benefits low-cost IoT sensors can bring.
