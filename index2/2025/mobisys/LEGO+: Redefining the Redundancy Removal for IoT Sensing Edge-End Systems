The Internet of Things (IoT) can only thrive if IoT sensor nodes can be effortlessly deployed and maintained without compromising their general-purpose nature. However, existing low-power sensor systems fail to strike a balance between these two issues, leaving the widespread of IoT sensor nodes as an open problem. In this paper, we propose LEGO+ as a minimalist yet general-purpose sensing edge-end architecture. Instead of running embedded software on a redundant general-purpose microprocessor, LEGO+ can directly construct the desired control functionality for various IoT sensing applications through hardware-level logic orchestration. To achieve this, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the underlying unit behaviors within IoT sensor systems and, based on this, abstract a uniform logic orchestration model. Next, to enable sensor nodes to comprehend and execute the generated logic, we devise a hierarchical atomic control circuit with negligible overheads. Finally, we develop a task state prediction scheme to further improve the overall operation efficiency among multiple nodes. We prototype LEGO+ for proof-of-concept and conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results demonstrate that LEGO+ can reduce the overall power consumption of sensor nodes by 86% and enhance task efficiency by 49%, thereby facilitating a wider array of IoT sensing applications.
