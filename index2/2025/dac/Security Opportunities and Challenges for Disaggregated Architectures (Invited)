Disaggregated computer architectures are an interesting paradigm according to which the components of a traditional monolithic server, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking, are separated into distinct, often independently managed units that communicate over a network. Disaggregation not only offers benefits such as greater flexibility, scalability, and resource optimization but can also improve security. For example, in the context of enterprise routing, it can offer fine-grained control over the network that allows one to deploy security policies, access control rules, and threat detection mechanisms more precisely, ensuring that only authorized traffic flows through the enterprise environment. It makes patch management easier because its modularity allows different components to be patched independently. The same benefits also apply to cellular networks. Disaggregation is a key feature of the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm, whose goal is to make the radio access network intelligent, virtualized, and fully interoperable. However, disaggregation also introduces several unique security risks, such as increased attack surfaces, increased exposure of sensitive data, increased difficulty in tracing data provenance, insecure isolation among different components, and insecure APIs. In addition, well-known security technologies, such as trusted execution environments, may have to be redesigned in the context of disaggregated architectures. In this paper, after an overview of these benefits and concerns, we focus on the research approaches proposed to address some of these concerns for network fabric, O-RAN, and trusted execution environments.
