Vision Transformers (ViTs) are new foundation models for vision applications. Edge-deploying ViTs to realize energy-saving, low-latency, and high-performance dense predictions have wide applications, such as autonomous driving and surveillance image analysis. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism renders ViTs slow and resource-intensive, particularly for pixel-level dense predictions that involve long contexts. Additionally, the pyramid-like architecture of modern ViT variants leads to an unbalanced workload, further reducing hardware utilization and decreasing the throughput of conventional edge devices. To this end, we propose an algorithm-hardware co-optimized edge ViT accelerator tailored for efficient dense predictions. At the algorithm level, we propose a decoupled chunk attention (DCA) mechanism implemented in a pipelined manner to reduce off-chip memory access, thereby enabling efficient dense predictions within limited on-chip memory. At the architecture level, we introduce a hybrid architecture that combines SRAM-based computing-in-memory (CIM) and nonvolatile RRAM storage to eliminate extensive off-chip memory access, with a fusion scheduling to balance workloads and minimize intermediate on-chip memory access. At the circuit level, a bit/element two-way-reconfigurable CIM macro is proposed to improve hardware utilization across pyramidal ViT blocks with varied matrix sizes. The experimental results on object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks demonstrate that our design can efficiently process patch lengths up to 16384 with a speedup of 18.5×-217.1×, a reduction in memory accesses of 1.7×-7.4×, and an improvement in energy efficiency of 1.8×, under less than 1% performance degradation.
