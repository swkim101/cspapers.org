Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently, it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a new transformer-based edge-computefree image coding framework called Easz. Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a realworld testbed demonstrate multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and image reconstruction quality.
