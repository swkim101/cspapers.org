Structural testing has been very successful in the VLSI manufacturing process to screen out faulty devices and provide high outgoing product quality. However, recent reported data show that existing solutions are not good enough for advanced technology nodes and emerging device technologies. This paper discusses a new manufacturing test approach called DeviceAware Test (DAT), applies it to different flavors of emerging devices, and its potential to be used beyond just manufacturing test.
