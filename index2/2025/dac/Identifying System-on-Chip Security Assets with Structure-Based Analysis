In the evolving field of hardware design, ensuring the security of System-on-Chips (SoCs) has become increasingly vital. As SoCs grow in complexity, integrating components from various sources, the identification and protection of security assets are crucial to prevent vulnerabilities. Traditional methods of identifying these assets are manual and time-intensive. To address this challenge, automated tools for security asset identification are essential, enabling faster and more accurate detection of critical assets early in the design process. In this paper, we propose a framework for the automated identification of security assets within SoCs. By transforming register-transfer level (RTL) code into graphs and leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify assets based on their structural patterns, our approach can effectively differentiate between security and non-security assets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high classification accuracy, with the model reaching up to 99% accuracy in identifying security assets, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention.
