Inspired by the human brain, Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) processes information efficiently by operating in high-dimensional space using hypervectors. While previous works focus on optimizing pregenerated hypervectors in software, this study introduces a novel on-the-fly vector generation method in hardware with $O(1)$ complexity, compared to the $O(N)$ iterative search used in conventional approaches to find the best orthogonal hypervectors. Our approach leverages Hadamard binary coefficients and unary computing to simplify encoding into addition-only operations after the generation stage in ASIC, implemented using inmemory computing. The proposed design significantly improves accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets.
