To address the growing security issues faced by ARM-based mobile devices today, TrustZone was adopted to provide a trusted execution environment (TEE) to protect sensitive data. Such TrustZone-based models have been proven to be effective, but they target CPU architectures and do not work for the security of widely used heterogeneous computing platforms such as FPGAs. To solve this issue, we propose a comprehensive SoC-FPGA security framework, FPGA-TrustZone, to support FPGA TEE by extending the security of ARM TrustZone. Experiments on real SoC-FPGA hardware development boards show that FPGA-TrustZone provides high security with low performance overhead.
