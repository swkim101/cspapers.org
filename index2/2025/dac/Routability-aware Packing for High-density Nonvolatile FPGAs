Nonvolatile field-programmable gate arrays (NVFPGAs) can use multi-level cell (MLC) nonvolatile memories (NVMs) to enhance their logic density. However, the highdensity design of NVFPGAs degrades the intra-routability of configurable logic blocks (CLBs), which significantly prolongs the time consumed by the packing process in the computer-aided design (CAD) flow. To relieve the efficiency degradation, in this paper, we propose a routability-aware re-pair stage to adjust the logical-physical look-up table (LUT) assignments to mitigate the congestion and improve their intra-routability, thereby reducing the packing time. In addition, exploiting the structural equivalence of MLC LUTs, we remove unnecessary intra-routing attempts from packing to further improve efficiency. Evaluation shows the proposed strategies reduce packing time by $41.48 \%$ on average.
