As the scaling of semiconductor devices nears its limits, utilizing the back-side space of silicon has emerged as a new trend for future integrated circuits. With intense interest, several works have hacked existing backend tools to explore the potential of synthesizing double-side clock trees via nano Through-Silicon-Vias (nTSVs). However, these works lack a systematic perspective on design resource allocation and multi-objective optimization. We propose a systematic approach to design clock trees with double-side metal layers, including hierarchical clock routing, concurrent buffers and nTSVs insertion, and skew refinement. Compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the widely-used open-source tool, our algorithm outperforms them in latency, skew, wirelength, and the number of buffers and nTSVs.
