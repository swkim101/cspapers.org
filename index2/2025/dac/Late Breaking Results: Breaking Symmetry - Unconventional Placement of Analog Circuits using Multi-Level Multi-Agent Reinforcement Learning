Layout-dependent effects (LDEs) significantly impact analog circuit performance. Traditionally, designers have relied on symmetric placement of circuit components to mitigate variations caused by LDEs. However, due to non-linear nature of these effects, conventional methods often fall short. We propose an objective-driven, multi-level, multi-agent Q-learning framework to explore unconventional design space of analog layout, opening new avenues for optimizing analog circuit performance. Our approach achieves better variation performance than the state-of-the-art layout techniques. Notably, this is the first application of multiagent RL in analog layout automation. The proposed approach is compared with non-ML approach based on simulated annealing.
