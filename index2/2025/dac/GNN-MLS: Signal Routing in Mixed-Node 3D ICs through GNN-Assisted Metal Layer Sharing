Native 3D Integrated Circuit (3D IC) design offers enhanced performance and density but faces challenges in signal routing due to limited true 3D EDA tool support. Pseudo-3D flows bridge this gap but lack cross-tier optimization, critical for both mixed-node and homogeneous designs. Metal Layer Sharing (MLS) addresses this by enabling cross-tier routing co-optimization but risks timing degradation if not applied strategically. Additionally, MLS creates open connections in hybrid-bonded 3D ICs, making chips untestable. We propose GNN-MLS, a Graph Neural Network-based framework for precise MLS net selection, combined with a tailored DFT solution for robust testability. Experiments show GNN-MLS reduces timing violations by 79% and improves WNS and TNS by 81% and 94%, and moves designs closer to true 3D ICs.
