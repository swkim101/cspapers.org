Nowadays, there is a growing trend to deploy machine learning (ML) models on edge devices. To cope with the increasing resource requirements of current ML models, multi-accelerator edge devices that integrate CPU, GPU, NPU, or TPU in a single SoC gain popularity. However, we observe that existing ML inference serving frameworks are poor in utilizing the unique hardware architecture of these edge devices. In this paper, we present InFSCALER, an efficient ML inference serving framework tailored for multi-accelerator edge devices. InfSCALER discovers the architectural bottleneck of ML models and designs a bottleneck-aware asymmetric auto-scaling technique to facilitate efficient resource allocation for ML models on the edge. Furthermore, InfScaler capitalizes on the hardware’s unified memory feature inherent to edge devices, ensuring efficient data sharing between the asymmetrically scaled model partitions. Our experimental results show that InfScaler achieves up to $\mathbf{1 2 6. 5 9 \%}$ throughput improvement and $\mathbf{2 7. 3 2 \%}$ resource reduction while satisfying the latency requirements compared with the state-of-the-art inference serving approaches.
