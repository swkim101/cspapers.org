This paper presents a high speed NAND based 4:1 Multiplexer (MUX) for various logic operations in a ResistiveRandom access memory crossbar structure. Compared to existing 4:1 MUX designs that require 10 steps, our proposed method completes execution in 3 steps. Additionally, proposed $4: 1$ MUX based Full adder, Full subtractor and 1-bit Comparator reduce clock cycles by 75% compared to state-of-the-art. Despite an increase in memristor count, the reduction in computational delay makes this approach promising for fast in-memory computing.
