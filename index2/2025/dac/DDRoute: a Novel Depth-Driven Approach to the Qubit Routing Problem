In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the topological constraints present in many of the currently available quantum devices pose a physical limit on the feasible interactions between qubits. To comply with such limitations, the compilation of quantum circuits requires solving the Qubit Routing Problem (QRP), by inserting SWAP operations among qubits. The State of the Art provides heuristic algorithms addressing this task, yet the depth of the output circuits is often incompatible with the current limits of quantum hardware. Therefore, we propose DDRoute, a novel heuristic algorithm to solve QRP, designed to reduce the depth overhead introduced by the routing process in the compiled circuits. Our experimental evaluation proves the efficiency of our approach, with a depth reduction of up to 70% with respect to the state-of-the-art routing procedures.
