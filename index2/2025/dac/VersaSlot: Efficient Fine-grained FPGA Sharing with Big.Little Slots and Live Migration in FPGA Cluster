As FPGAs gain popularity for on-demand application acceleration in data center computing, dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) has become an effective fine-grained sharing technique for FPGA multiplexing. However, current FPGA sharing encounters partial reconfiguration contention and task execution blocking problems introduced by the DPR, which significantly degrade application performance. In this paper, we propose VersaSlot, an efficient spatio-temporal FPGA sharing system with novel Big.Little slot architecture that can effectively resolve the contention and task blocking while improving resource utilization. For the heterogeneous Big.Little architecture, we introduce an efficient slot allocation and scheduling algorithm, along with a seamless cross-board switching and live migration mechanism, to maximize FPGA multiplexing across the cluster. We evaluate the VersaSlot system on an FPGA cluster composed of the latest Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs (ZCU216) and compare its performance against four existing scheduling algorithms. The results demonstrate that VersaSlot achieves up to 13.66x lower average response time than the traditional temporal FPGA multiplexing, and up to $2.19 x$ average response time improvement over the state-of-the-art spatio-temporal sharing systems. Furthermore, VersaSlot enhances the LUT and FF resource utilization by 35% and 29% on average, respectively.
