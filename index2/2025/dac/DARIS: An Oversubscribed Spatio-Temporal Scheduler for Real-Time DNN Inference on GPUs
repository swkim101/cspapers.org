The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is limited by high computational demands, especially in constrained environments. GPUs, though effective accelerators, often face underutilization and rely on coarse-grained scheduling. This paper introduces DARIS, a priority-based real-time DNN scheduler for GPUs, utilizing NVIDIA’s MPS and CUDA streaming for spatial sharing, and a synchronization-based staging method for temporal partitioning. In particular, DARIS improves GPU utilization and uniquely analyzes GPU concurrency by oversubscribing computing resources. It also supports zero-delay DNN migration between GPU partitions. Experiments show DARIS improves throughput by $15 \%$ and $11.5 \%$ over batching and state-of-the-art schedulers, respectively, even without batching. All high-priority tasks meet deadlines, with low-priority tasks having under 2% deadline miss rate. High-priority response times are 33% better than those of low-priority tasks.
