Deep learning has significantly advanced Electronic Design Automation (EDA), with circuit representation learning emerging as a key area for modeling the relationship between a circuit’s structure and functionality. Existing methods primarily use either Large Language Models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code analysis or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for netlist modeling. While LLMs excel at high-level functional understanding, they struggle with detailed netlist behavior. GNNs, however, face challenges when scaling to larger sequential circuits due to long-range information dependencies and insufficient functional supervision, leading to decreased accuracy and limited generalization. To address these challenges, we propose MOSS, a multimodal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs for sequential circuit modeling. By enhancing D-type Flip-Flop (DFF) node features with embeddings from fine-tuned LLMs on RTL code, we focus the GNN on critical anchor points, reducing reliance on long-range dependencies. The LLM also provides global circuit embeddings, offering efficient supervision for functionality-related tasks. Additionally, MOSS introduces an adaptive aggregation method and a two-phase propagation mechanism in the GNN to better model signal propagation and sequential feedback within the circuit. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSS significantly improves the accuracy of functionality and performance predictions for sequential circuits compared to existing methods, particularly in larger circuits where previous models struggle. Specifically, MOSS achieves a $\mathbf{9 5. 2 \%}$ accuracy in arrival time prediction.
