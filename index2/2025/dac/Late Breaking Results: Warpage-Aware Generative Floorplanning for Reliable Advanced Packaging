This paper presents the first warpage-aware generative learningbased floorplanning algorithm to effectively model the warpage effect and optimize the die floorplan on a fixed outlined substrate. With more heterogeneous materials and dense interconnects in advanced packaging, warpage is a main reliability concern and may degrade system performance. We present a novel transformer-based encoding scheme to learn node and edge representations, followed by parallel decoding and warpage-aware legalization to jointly minimize die displacement and warpage. Experimental results show that our algorithm improves warpage by 9.9% and wirelength by 8.3% on average, compared with the state-of-the-art work.
