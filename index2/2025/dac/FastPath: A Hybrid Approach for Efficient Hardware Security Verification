Many verification methods have been proposed to detect microarchitectural information leakage in response to the surge of security breaches in hardware designs. These sophisticated efforts have gone a long way toward preventing attackers from breaking the system’s confidentiality. However, each approach has its own set of weaknesses: it may not be scalable enough, exhaustive enough, flexible enough to meet changing requirements or fit well into existing verification flows. We propose FastPath, a hybrid verification methodology that combines the efficiency of simulation with the exhaustive nature of formal verification. FastPath employs a structural analysis framework to automate the method further. Our experimental results compare FastPath to a state-of-the-art formal approach, showing a significant reduction in manual effort while achieving the same level of exhaustive confidence. We also discovered and contributed a fix for a previously unknown leak of internal operands in cv32e40s, a RISC-V processor intended for security applications.
