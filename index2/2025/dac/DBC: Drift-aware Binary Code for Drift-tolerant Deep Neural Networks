Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a wide range of applications. However, their substantial number of weights necessitates scalable and efficient storage solutions. Emerging non-volatile memory technologies, such as phase change memory (PCM) with multi-level cell (MLC) operation, are promising candidates due to their high scalability and non-volatility compared to conventional charge-based storage devices. Despite these advantages, MLC PCM suffers from reliability issues, particularly conductance drift, where the conductance of a PCM cell changes over time. This drift can lead to significant accuracy degradation in DNNs, as their weights are stored in PCM cells. In this paper, we propose Drift-aware Binary Code (DBC), a novel binary code designed to improve the tolerance of DNNs to conductance drift. DBC maps smaller decimal values to less error-prone MLC PCM cell levels and ensures that values shift to smaller magnitudes when conductance drift occurs. This approach helps maintain the accuracy of the DNN over an extended period compared to conventional binary code, as dominant DNN weights are stored at levels less prone to errors and DNNs exhibit better tolerance when weight values decrease rather than increase due to drift. Additionally, DBC requires no additional hardware overhead for auxiliary bits and can be combined with other fault-tolerant approaches, such as error correction code (ECC). Experimental results based on the real PCM device developed by IBM Research demonstrate that DBC improves the drift tolerance of DNNs by up to $55.18 \times$ compared to conventional binary code.
