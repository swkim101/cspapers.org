To fully harness emerging computing architectures, compilers must provide intuitive input handling alongside powerful code optimization to unlock maximum performance. Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) — highly energy-efficient for nested-loop applications — have lacked a compiler capable of meeting these objectives. This paper introduces the Adora compiler [1], which effectively bridges user-friendly, lightweight coding inputs with high-performance acceleration on the CGRA SoC. Adora utilizes CGRA-target loop transformations to achieve efficient data-flow level execution while optimizing data communication and task pipelining at the task-flow level. Additionally, it incorporates a comprehensive automated algorithm with a thoughtfully designed optimization sequence. A series of comprehensive experiments highlights the exceptional efficiency and scalability of the Adora compiler, demonstrating its transformative impact in leveraging CGRA capabilities for acceleration in edge computing.
