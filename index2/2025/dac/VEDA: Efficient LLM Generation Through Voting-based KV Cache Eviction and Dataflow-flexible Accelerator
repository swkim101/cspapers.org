Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks but pose significant computational and memory challenges for edge deployment due to their intensive resource demands. This work addresses the efficiency of LLM inference by algorithm-hardwaredataflow tri-optimizations. We propose a novel voting-based KV cache eviction algorithm, balancing hardware efficiency and algorithm accuracy by adaptively identifying unimportant kv vectors. From a dataflow perspective, we introduce a flexible-product dataflow and a runtime reconfigurable PE array for matrix-vector multiplication. The proposed approach effectively handles the diverse dimensional requirements and solves the challenges of incrementally varying sequence lengths. Additionally, an element-serial scheduling scheme is proposed for nonlinear operations, such as softmax and layer normalization (layernorm). Results demonstrate a substantial reduction in latency, accompanied by a significant decrease in hardware complexity, from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. The proposed solution is realized in a custom-designed accelerator, VEDA, which outperforms existing hardware platforms. This research represents a significant advancement in LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating real-time processing, enhancing data privacy, and enabling model customization.
