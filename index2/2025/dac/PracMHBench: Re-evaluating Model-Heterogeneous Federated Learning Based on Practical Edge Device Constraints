Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately, no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform PracMHBench to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding heterogeneity pattern.
