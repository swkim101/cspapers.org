Remote Attestation (RA) has become a valuable security service for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as the security of these devices is often not prioritized during the manufacturing process. However, traditional RA schemes suffer from a single point of failure because they rely on a trusted verifier. To address this issue, we propose a voting-based blockchain attestation protocol that provides a reliable solution by eliminating the single point of failure through distributed verification across all nodes. In addition, it offers a traceable and immutable public history of the attestation results, which can be verified by external auditors at any time. Finally, we verify our proposed protocol on three NVIDIA Jetson embedded devices hosting up to 15 attestation nodes.
