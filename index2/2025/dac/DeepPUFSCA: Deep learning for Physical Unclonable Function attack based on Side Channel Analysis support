Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) poses a vulnerability that it could be imitated by machine learning attacks and side channel attacks, which break its physical uniqueness and unpredictable characteristic. Hence, many works are concerned with enhancing PUF design by introducing more nonlinear modules inside to differentiate approximating PUF behavior from the attacker side. However, the safety of these PUFs are still an open area and need to be verified. In this paper, we propose DeepPUFSCA, which is a deep learning-based model that uniquely combines both challenge and side-channel information features during training to attack PUF. To gather the data, we conduct a design of an arbiter PUF on FPGA and measure its power consumption. Our intensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that DeepPUFSCA outperforms other machine learning-based methods in terms of attacking accuracy, even the novel ensemble algorithms. Moreover, we also show that combined side channel information boosts the model performance compared to attacking with challenge-response only.
