High-level synthesis (HLS) tools streamline FPGA design by enabling engineers to implement hardware using $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{C}++$ languages. However, while clock management serves as a critical stage in the FPGA EDA flow that affects system-level performance, area, and especially power consumption, existing commercial HLS tools lack comprehensive solutions for clock management. Specifically, the diversity of clock resources creates a vast design space for finding the optimal configuration, and the insufficient analysis of multiple clock domain scenarios hinders effective clock-oriented optimizations in HLS. This work introduces AutoClock, an open-source integrated clock management framework that complements AMD Vitis HLS. AutoClock allocates resources for clock generation, assigns modules to appropriate clock domains, addresses metastability and time division multiplexing (TDM) malfunctioning introduced by multiclock domain architectures, and hierarchically gates the clock of modules in a design. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoClock can fully utilize clock resources on FPGAs and help reduce dynamic power consumption by up to 74.38%.
