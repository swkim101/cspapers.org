As technology nodes continue to shrink, Complementary FET (CFET) structures, which stack PMOS and NMOS together, have emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation technology. Due to the reduction in routing tracks, the insertion of dummy polys to increase routing resources and the use of M2 during the synthesis of CFET standard cells have become more inevitable. These two factors make block-level routing significantly more challenging. To address this, we introduce the methods to utilize the backside (BS) routing resources at the CFET standard cell synthesis stage and efficiently handle CFET transistor folding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider BS routing resources at the cell synthesis stage and efficiently address transistor folding in the CFET stacked structure. In the transistor folding and placement stages, we utilize Euler paths to estimate the lower bound of contacted poly pitch (CPP) and apply dynamic programming (DP) to calculate the frontside minimum required tracks (FMRT) of BS-resource-aware placements. The subsequent satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) approach determines which tracks the devices occupy and completes cell routing. Experimental results show that compared to previous work [11], we achieve reductions of 1%, 45%, and 19% in #CPP, #M2 tracks, and runtime, respectively.
