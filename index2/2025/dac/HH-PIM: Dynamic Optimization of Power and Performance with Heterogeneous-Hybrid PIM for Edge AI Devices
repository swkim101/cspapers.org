Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures offer promising solutions for efficiently handling AI applications in energy-constrained edge environments. While traditional PIM designs enhance performance and energy efficiency by reducing data movement between memory and processing units, they are limited in edge devices due to continuous power demands and the storage requirements of large neural network weights in SRAM and DRAM. Hybrid PIM architectures, incorporating nonvolatile memories like MRAM and ReRAM, mitigate these limitations but struggle with a mismatch between fixed computing resources and dynamically changing inference workloads. To address these challenges, this study introduces a Heterogeneous-Hybrid PIM (HH-PIM) architecture, comprising high-performance MRAM-SRAM PIM modules and low-power MRAM-SRAM PIM modules. We further propose a data placement optimization algorithm that dynamically allocates data based on computational demand, maximizing energy efficiency. FPGA prototyping and power simulations with processors featuring HH-PIM and other PIM types demonstrate that the proposed HH-PIM achieves up to 60.43% average energy savings over conventional PIMs while meeting application latency requirements. These results confirm HH-PIM’s suitability for adaptive, energy-efficient AI processing in edge devices.
