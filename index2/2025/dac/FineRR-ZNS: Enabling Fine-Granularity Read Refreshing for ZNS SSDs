Zoned namespace (ZNS) SSDs are emerging storage devices offering low cost, high performance, and software definability. By adopting host-managed zone-based sequential programming, ZNS SSDs effectively eliminate the space overhead associated with on-board DRAM memory and garbage collection. However, while background read refreshing serves as a data protection mechanism in conventional block-interface SSDs, state-of-the-art ZNS SSDs lack read refreshing functionality to guarantee data reliability. Moreover, implementing zonelevel read refreshing in ZNS SSDs incurs significant overhead due to the large volume of valid data movements in a zone, leading to degraded I/O performance. To efficiently enable read refreshing for ZNS SSDs, this paper proposes FineRR-ZNS, a fine-granularity read refreshing mechanism for ZNS SSDs. FineRR-ZNS employs a host-controlled fine-granularity read refreshing scheme that selectively determines block-level read refreshing via metadata remapping. A zone reconstruction method is also designed to retrieve remapped data forming complete data during zone-level RR. Specifically, the remapped data after zone reconstruction are still available and prioritized for read access until their respective blocks need the next RR. Evaluation results show that FineRR-ZNS significantly enhances read refreshing efficiency and I/O throughput compared to zone-level read refreshing implemented in the state-of-the-art ZenFS file system.
