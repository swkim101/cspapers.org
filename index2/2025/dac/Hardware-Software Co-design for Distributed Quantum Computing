Distributed quantum computing (DQC) offers a pathway for scaling up quantum computing architectures beyond the confines of a single chip. Entanglement is a crucial resource for implementing nonlocal operations in DQC, and it is required to allow teleportation of quantum states and gates. Remote entanglement generation in practical systems is probabilistic, has longer duration than that of local operations, and is nondeterministic. Therefore, optimizing the performance of probabilistic remote entanglement generation is critically important for the performance of DQC architectures. In this paper we propose and study a new DQC architecture that combines (1) buffering of successfully generated entanglement, (2) asynchronously attempted entanglement generation, and (3) adaptive scheduling of remote gates based on the entanglement generation pattern. We show that our hardware-software co-design improves both the runtime and the output fidelity under a realistic model of DQC.
