High-performance security guarantees rely on hardware support. Generic programmable support for fine-grained instruction analysis has gained broad interest in the literature as a fundamental building block for the security of future processors. Yet, implementation in real out-of-order (OoO) superscalar processors presents tough challenges that cannot be explored in highly abstract simulators. We detail the challenges of implementing complex programmable pathways without critical paths or contention. We then introduce FireGuard, the first implementation of fine-grained instruction analysis on a real $\mathbf{O o O}$ superscalar processor. We establish an end-to-end system, including microarchitecture, SoC, ISA and programming model. Experiments show that our solution simultaneously ensures both security and performance of the system, with parallel scalability. We examine the feasibility of building FireGuard into modern SoCs: Apple’s M1-Pro, Huawei’s Kirin-960, and Intel’s i7-12700F, where less than 1% silicon area is introduced.
