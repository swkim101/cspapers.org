In technology mapping, the quality of the final implementation heavily relies on the circuit structure after technologyindependent optimization. Recent studies have introduced equality saturation as a novel optimization approach. However, its efficiency remains a hurdle against its wide adoption in logic synthesis. This paper proposes a highly scalable and efficient framework named E-morphic. It is the first work that employs equality saturation for resynthesis after conventional technology-independent logic optimizations, enabling structure exploration before technology mapping. Powered by several key enhancements to the equality saturation framework, such as direct e-graph-circuit conversion, solution-space pruning, and simulated annealing for e-graph extraction, this approach not only improves the scalability and extraction efficiency of e-graph rewriting but also addresses the structural bias issue present in conventional logic synthesis flows through parallel structural exploration and resynthesis. Experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-art delay optimization flow in ABC, E-morphic on average achieves 12.54% area saving and 7.29% delay reduction on the large-scale circuits in the EPFL benchmark.
