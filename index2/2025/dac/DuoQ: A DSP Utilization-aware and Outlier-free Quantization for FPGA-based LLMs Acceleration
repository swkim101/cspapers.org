Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) on FPGAs, but its presence of outliers affects the accuracy of the quantized model. Existing methods mainly deal with outliers through channel-wise or tokenwise isolation and encoding, which leads to expensive dynamic quantization. To address this problem, we introduce DuoQ, an FPGA-oriented algorithm-hardware co-design framework. DuoQ effectively eliminates outliers through learnable equivalent transformations and low-semantic token awareness in the quantization scheme part, facilitating per-tensor quantization with 4 -bits. We co-design the quantization algorithm and hardware architecture. Specifically, DuoQ accelerates end-to-end LLM through a novel DSP-aware PE unit design and encoder design. In addition, two types of post-processing units assist in the realization of nonlinear functions and dynamic token awareness. Experimental results show that compared with platforms with different architectures, DuoQ’s computational efficiency and energy efficiency are improved by up to $8.8 \times$ and $23.45 \times$. In addition, DuoQ has achieved accuracy improvements compared to other outlieraware software and hardware works.
