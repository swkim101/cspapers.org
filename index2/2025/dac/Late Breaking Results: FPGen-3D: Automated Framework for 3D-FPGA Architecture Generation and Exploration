In this work, we propose FPGen-3D, an automated framework for 3D field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) architecture generation and exploration. FPGen-3D generates custom 3D FPGA fabrics based on user-defined architectural parameters, producing synthesizable register-transfer level (RTL) code, routing results, and programming bitstreams, enabling efficient navigation of the 3D FPGA design space. We demonstrate its capabilities through a case study of generating and exploring various vertical connection strategies via 3D switch blocks (SB) and 3D configurable logic block (CLB). Results show that 3D FPGAs can achieve lower wire length than traditional 2D FPGAs with a decrease of up to $\mathbf{1 8. 5 \%}$.
