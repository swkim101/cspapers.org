Measurement-based uncomputation (MBU) is a technique used to perform probabilistic uncomputation of quantum circuits. We formalize this technique for the case of single-qubit registers, and we show applications to modular arithmetic. Using MBU, we reduce Toffoli count and depth by 10% to 15% for modular adders based on the architecture of [1], and by almost 25% for modular adders based on the architecture of [2]. Our results have the potential to improve other circuits for modular arithmetic, such as modular multiplication and modular exponentiation, and can find applications in quantum cryptanalysis.
