In this work, we aim to address the computational overhead challenge in quantum optimal control while reducing circuit latency. We propose a novel approach combining ZX-Calculus, circuit partitioning, and circuit synthesis for pulse generation. By implementing finer granularity in pulse generation and exploring equivalent circuit representations, we achieve increased parallelism and decreased latency. Our method demonstrates a 31.74% reduction in latency compared to previous work and a 76.80% reduction compared to gate-based pulse generation methods, while minimizing computational overhead.
