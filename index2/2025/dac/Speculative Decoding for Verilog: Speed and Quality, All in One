The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized code generation tasks across various programming languages. However, the unique characteristics of programming languages, particularly those like Verilog with specific syntax and lower representation in training datasets, pose significant challenges for conventional tokenization and decoding approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of speculative decoding for Verilog code generation, showing that it can improve both inference speed and output quality, effectively achieving speed and quality all in one. Unlike standard LLM tokenization schemes, which often fragment meaningful code structures, our approach aligns decoding stops with syntactically significant tokens, making it easier for models to learn the token distribution. This refinement addresses inherent tokenization issues and enhances the model’s ability to capture Verilog’s logical constructs more effectively. Our experimental results show that our method achieves up to a $5.05 \times$ speedup in Verilog code generation and increases pass@10 functional accuracy on RTLLM by up to $\mathbf{1 7. 1 9 \%}$ compared to conventional training strategies. These findings highlight speculative decoding as a promising approach to bridge the quality gap in code generation for specialized programming languages.
