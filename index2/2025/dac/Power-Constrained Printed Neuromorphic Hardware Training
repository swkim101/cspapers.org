With the rising demand for ultra-low-cost and flexible electronics in applications like smart packaging and wearable health monitoring, printed electronics provide an affordable, adaptable, and customizable alternative to conventional silicon. However, these systems often rely on printed batteries or energy harvesters with limited power capacity, making strict power budgets critical. Printed neuromorphic circuits (pNCs) are promising for their analog signal processing, reduced circuit complexity, and energy efficiency in low-power environments. Nonetheless, maintaining robust performance under strict power constraints remains challenging, necessitating advanced optimization techniques. In this work, we propose an augmented Lagrangian approach to enforce task-specific power constraints in pNCs, validated across 13 benchmark datasets. Our method preserves accuracy within strict power budgets while achieving Pareto-optimal power-accuracy trade-offs in a single training run. In contrast, the penalty-based method, which serves as the baseline, requires up to 150 runs per dataset to generate the Pareto front. For low-power scenarios ($\approx 20 \%$ of the original power), our method demonstrates a $52 \times$ improvement in accuracy-to-power ratio over the baseline. At higher power budgets $(\approx 80 \%$ of the original power), it achieves a $59 \times$ improvement, maintaining competitive performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves $\mathbf{8 1. 8 2 \%}$ accuracy with p-tanh activation function (AF) at high power budgets and excels with p-Clipped_ReLU AF under low power constraints. This highlights the computational efficiency and effectiveness of our approach for power-constrained circuit design.
