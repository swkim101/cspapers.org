The increasing demand to maximize PPA gains with backside metal layers has driven their function beyond power delivery. This study introduces a novel BS-PDN-last flow, crucial for leveraging multifunctional backside, by deferring power routing to the post-signal routing stage. This approach addresses the IR-drop and performance trade-offs inherent in conventional PDN-first flows. Experimental results show that the BS-PDN-last flow achieves a $90 \%$ reduction in Total Negative Slack and a $\mathbf{1 2 \%}$ performance gain with BS-CDN. Additionally, our work presents the first comprehensive comparison of FS-PDN, BSPDN, and multifunctional backside designs, evaluated on both physical design and workload metrics leveraging accurate vector-based analysis.
