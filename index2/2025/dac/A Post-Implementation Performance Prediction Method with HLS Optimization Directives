High-Level Synthesis (HLS) offers various optimization directives that enable designers to flexibly adjust hardware microarchitecture. However, existing HLS performance prediction methods typically rely on control data flow graphs generated (CDFG) from original HLS C/C++, which struggle to capture the complex interactions between directives and the resulting hardware resource reuse issues. To address these issues, this paper proposes a post-implementation performance prediction method tailored for directive-optimized circuits design, which utilizes a Graph Builder to integrate directive optimization and resource reuse information into the graph representation. In addition, the performance prediction model, which integrates a TransformerConv-based graph neural network (GNN) and an aggregation pool module, effectively captures key features related to post-implementation performance. Experimental results show that our method can reduce the prediction error of critical path delay (CP), power, and resource utilization to 3.87% $\sim$ 8.08%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. It also demonstrates excellent generalization on unseen kernels, providing a more effective and accurate performance prediction tool for HLS.
