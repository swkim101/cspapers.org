Embedded Android Devices have proliferated in many security-critical embedded scenarios, requiring sufficient testing to root out vulnerabilities. Due to Android’s architecture, which uses a Hardware ion Layer (HAL) for vendor-specific driver implementations, traditional kernel testing techniques cannot detect such bugs within the actual driver logic, which are commonly proprietary and vendorspecific. In this paper, we propose DroidFuzz, an embedded Android system fuzzer that targets such vendor-specific driver implementations to find such bugs. Through leveraging pre-testing HAL driver probing, kernel-user relational payload generation, and cross-boundary execution state feedback, we effectively test the proprietary drivers in both the kernel and the HAL layer. We implemented DroidFuzz and evaluated its effectiveness on 7 embedded Android devices, and found 12 security-critical previously unknown bugs, all of which have been confirmed by the respective vendors.
