Integrated circuit yield optimization plays a vital role in ensuring reliable semiconductor manufacturing, directly impacting both product quality and production costs. Current approaches to yield optimization face two fundamental challenges that limit their practical effectiveness. First, yield estimation requires intensive computational resources. Second, traditional black-box optimization methods inefficiently allocate these resources across design candidates. Most existing approaches compound these issues by performing detailed yield estimations uniformly across all candidates, regardless of their potential quality. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel precision-aware yield optimization framework that intelligently adapts computational resource allocation based on each design candidate’s predicted performance. Our approach moves beyond simple simulation counting by incorporating a Figure of Merit (FoM) as a continuous quality metric. By combining a Continuous AutoRegression model to characterize the relationship between true yield and precision levels with a sophisticated multi-fidelity acquisition strategy, our framework achieves optimal resource distribution. Experimental validation on four industry-standard benchmark circuits demonstrates that our method converges with fewer than 1,000 simulations, reducing simulation costs by over $10 \times$ while achieving better final designs and robustness than state-of-the-art high-fidelity approaches.
