Prior work shows that remote power attacks on Intel processors are possible through two Model Specific Registers (MSRs): MSR_PKG_Energy_Status and MSR_PPO_Energy_Status. In response, Intel introduced a defense: a bit in MSR IA32_MISC_PACKAGE_CTLS allows users to enable/disable “filtering” mechanism that adds additional noise to energy measurements to harden against power side-channel attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that “filtering” does not cover all possible avenues of measuring power. On Intel server-grade platforms, components like out-of-band management interface (OOB) exist which also expose telemetric information like inband energy consumption. For this, we first reverse engineer the protocol structure over which OOB communicates with in-band components. We then show how OOB allows read-only access to the Package Configuration Space (PCS) and note that energy readings through PCS are outside the scope of filtering. Using this, we establish remote power side-channels on Intel SGX and TDX operational on Intel Sapphire Rapids. We first construct a synchronization mechanism to align in-band execution with out-of-band measurements by leveraging deliberately disabled MSRs. We then use energy readings through OOB PCS to recover 2048-bit RSA keys from MbedTLS operational within in-band Intel SGX (with generic single-stepping assumption). Finally, we also leak AESNI keys from within in-band Intel TDX (without any single-step assumption). Prior to our work, the literature on side-channels has been focused on attacks leveraging in-band interfaces. Our work establishes the importance of evaluating confidential computing architectures against attack vectors that combine abilities of both in-band and out-of-band interfaces to achieve adversarial objectives (that both in-band and out-of-band interfaces cannot independently achieve).
