Placement plays a critical role in VLSI physical design, particularly in optimizing routability. With continuous advancements in semiconductor manufacturing technology, increased integration, and growing design complexity, managing routing congestion during placement has become increasingly challenging. Despite the widespread techniques to improve routability, these methods often lack theoretical guidance or sever the intrinsic connection between placement and routing optimization. In this paper, we propose RUPlace, an ADMMbased placer for unified optimization of placement and routing. Leveraging Wasserstein distance and bilevel optimization, our approach provides a unified framework for congestion optimization by alternately running global routing and incremental placement. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective model for cell inflation-based global placement, where convex programming is employed to determine the optimal inflation ratio. Experimental results on a diverse set of open-source industrial benchmarks from CircuitNet and Chipyard demonstrate that our method achieves superior congestion reduction compared to widely used tools such as OpenROAD, Xplace 2.0, and DREAMPlace 4.1, while maintaining competitive wirelength and runtime.
