Statistical Static Timing Analysis (SSTA) is a crucial technique in digital circuit design because it addresses on-chip variations (OCV) by propagating timing distributions instead of fixed delays. However, the computational complexity of SSTA demands significant memory and long runtimes. While GPUs offer opportunities to accelerate SSTA, their limited memory capacity makes it challenging to handle large-scale SSTA workloads. To address this challenge, we propose a statistical timing graph (STG) scheduling algorithm combined with a GPU memory management strategy. We have shown up to $4.9 \times$ speedup on a GPU with 16 GB memory compared to a 20-thread CPU baseline when solving an 18.2 GB STG.
