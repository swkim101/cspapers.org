Linux kernels are being widely deployed in embedded applications, such as increasingly automated vehicles and robots, due to their robust ecosystem. Security modules have been developed to enhance the integrity of Linux kernels, a critical system component. However, these modules consume substantial computational resources, making them unsuitable for embedded domains. We introduce LightRIM, a lightweight method to measure the Linux kernel’s integrity during runtime, ideal for resource-limited embedded applications. We focus on major attack types and extract objects for monitoring. Our approach includes a two-stage hashing process and an event-triggered measurement algorithm tied to the security value. To mitigate Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks, we introduce a heuristic algorithm that maximizes the attack detection rate within CPU usage constraint and randomizes the measurement intervals. Experimental results indicate that LightRIM incurs less than 0.7% performance overhead while providing extensive attack coverage.
