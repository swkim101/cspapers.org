A refinement relation captures the state equivalence between two sequential circuits. It finds applications in various tasks of VLSI design automation, including regression verification, behavioral model synthesis, assertion synthesis, and design space exploration. However, manually constructing a refinement relation requires an engineer to have both domain knowledge and expertise in formal methods, which is especially challenging for complex designs after significant transformations. This paper presents a rigorous and efficient sequential equivalence checking algorithm for non-cycle-accurate designs. The algorithm can automatically find a concise and human-comprehensible refinement relation between two designs, helping engineers understand the essence of design transformations. We demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm with experiments and case studies. In particular, we showcase how refinement relations can facilitate error detection and correction for LLM-generated RTL designs.
