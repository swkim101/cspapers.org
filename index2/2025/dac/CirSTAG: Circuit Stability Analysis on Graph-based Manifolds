Circuit stability (sensitivity) analysis aims to estimate the overall performance impact of variations in underlying design parameters, such as gate sizes and capacitance. This process is challenging because it often requires numerous time-consuming circuit simulations. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable effectiveness and efficiency in tackling several chip design automation issues, including circuit timing predictions, parasitic prediction, gate sizing, and device placement. This paper introduces a novel approach called CirSTAG, which utilizes GNNs to analyze the stability (robustness) of modern integrated circuits (ICs). CirSTAG is grounded in a spectral framework that examines the stability of GNNs by leveraging input/output graph-based manifolds. When two adjacent nodes on the input manifold are mapped (through a GNN model) to two remote nodes (data samples) on the output manifold, this indicates a significant mapping distortion (DMD) and consequently poor GNN stability. CirSTAG calculates a stability score equivalent to the local Lipschitz constant for each node and edge, considering both graph structure and node feature perturbations. This enables the identification of the most critical (sensitive) circuit elements that could significantly impact circuit performance. Our empirical evaluations across various timing prediction tasks with realistic circuit designs demonstrate that CirSTAG can accurately estimate the stability of each circuit element under diverse parameter variations. This offers a scalable method for assessing the stability of large integrated circuit designs.
