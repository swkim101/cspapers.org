As the technology node advances beyond 5 nm, the conventional FinFET architecture encounters substantial scaling issues. ComplementaryFET (CFET) technology, characterized by the vertical stacking of P-FET over N-FET or vice versa, has emerged as a promising solution. However, the inherent characteristics of CFET architecture, particularly the scarcity of routing resources, pose significant obstacles to in-cell routability and layout generation. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive placement and routing framework for synthesizing CFET cells. We first present a partitioning technique followed by a heuristic quality maintenance strategy for large-scale cells to ensure scalability and efficiency. Then, we propose a novel satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)-based placement method that incorporates partial routing to achieve minimum-width placement while ensuring in-cell routability. Particularly, the placement method also determines the pin positions for each net, which simplifies subsequent routing complexity. Finally, we propose a progressive metal routing method to address the challenges of routing resource scarcity and unidirectional routing in CFET technology, which includes a manual-inspired M0 routing followed by an integral linear programming (ILP)-based M1 and M2 routing. Compared with the state-of-the-art CFET cell generators, experimental results show that our algorithm achieves the smallest cell width for all tested cells, with 7 out of 30 cells exhibiting smaller widths. For the remaining 23 cells, which have the same cell width as those in other generators, our algorithm achieves the smallest M2 usage and total metal length.
