Several secure data outsourcing systems incorporate various cryptographic techniques to balance security, functionalities, and efficiency. However, their security properties can be ad hoc and sometimes obscure. Our recent work, Secure Normal Form (SNF) [ICDE’24], presents a principled approach that allows data owners to define acceptable leakages of nonsensitive aspects of their data. This approach enables efficient processing of queries while ensuring no unintended leakage of sensitive information. In this paper, we discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing SNF within advanced computational environments and modern data management architectures. We argue that its applicability may extend beyond merely offloading secure query execution to the cloud.
