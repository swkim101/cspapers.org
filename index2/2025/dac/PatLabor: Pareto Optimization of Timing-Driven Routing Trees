Wirelength is the fundamental metric for VLSI routing. With the advancement of new technologies, wire delay has also become a significant factor for timing performances. It is thus necessary to consider both wirelength and delay in routing tree construction, i.e., timing-driven routing trees. Prior methods propose various heuristics to balance wirelength and delay with a tunable parameter, which cannot compute the full Pareto frontier. In this work, we propose PatLabor, a practical method for timing-driven routing. PatLabor directly optimizes the Pareto set, which obtains tighter Pareto curves than prior methods and does not require parameter tuning. PatLabor obtains all Paretooptimal solutions on small-degree nets up to 9 pins and is theoretically guaranteed by provable time complexity and approximation bounds. Experimental results verify our theoretical findings and show that PatLabor obtains tighter Pareto curves than state-of-the-art methods on ICCAD-15 benchmarks. For example, PatLabor obtains up to 58.5% more Pareto-optimal solutions than prior methods for degree-9 nets.
