Fast and accurate pre-routing timing prediction is essential in the chip design flow. However, existing machine learning (ML)assisted pre-routing timing methods often overlook the impact of power delivery networks (PDNs), which contribute to IR drop and routing congestion. This limitation can make these methods less practical for realworld circuit design flows. To address this, we propose two specialized encoders-an IR drop-aware encoder and a routing congestion-aware encoder-that effectively capture PDN effects through multimodal fusion of netlist, layout, and PDN data. To mitigate the challenges of imbalanced multimodal fusion, we further develop a Pareto optimization approach to ensure balanced utilization of all modalities, enhancing timing prediction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale open-source designs using TSMC’s 16 nm technology node validate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art pre-routing timing prediction methods.
