Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model parallelism is prevalent in training Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT). However, the intensive all-to-all collective communication of the MoE layer’s intermediate computing results substantially degrades MoE training efficiency. In this paper, we propose BirdMoE, a novel load-aware communication compression technique with Bi-random quantization for MoE training with two core modules. Specifically, BirdMoE employs a lightweight Random Quantization (RQ) with expectation invariance property to efficiently map the floating-point intermediate computing results into integers while maintaining the MoE training quality. Additionally, BirdMoE utilizes a Mixed Precision (MP) strategy to dynamically balance the communication loads among expert nodes, significantly improving all-to-all communication efficiency for the MoE training system. Experiments on four typical MoE training tasks demonstrate that BirdMoE achieves higher $4.06 \times- 10.44 \times$ total communication compression ratios and $1.18 \times-5.27 \times$ training speedup compared with the state-of-the-art compression techniques while maintaining the MoE training quality.
