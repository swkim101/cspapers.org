High-performance System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures are becoming increasingly complex and heterogeneous, and the days when a single application could utilize all of an SoC’s hardware resources are all but over. The SoC’s workload, i.e., the set of independent applications that the SoC typically executes, therefore has a significant impact on its efficiency. Accounting for Workload-Level Parallelism (WLP) in early-stage design space exploration is thus critical as later-stage analysis steps must focus on favorable design points to yield optimal results. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art MultiAmdahl and Gables fall short because they only model the extremes of minimal and maximal WLP. We hence propose HILP, the first early-stage design space exploration approach for heterogeneous SoCs that fully accounts for WLP. Our key observation is that scheduling a workload of independent multi-phase applications on a heterogeneous SoC is an instance of the classic job-shop scheduling optimization problem and thus can be solved using integer linear programming. HILP therefore uses a high-performance integer linear programming solver to find a near-optimal schedule that minimizes the overall execution time of the workload, i.e., it schedules the dependent phases of all applications in the workload on the cores and accelerators of the target SoC to maximize performance while respecting power consumption and memory bandwidth constraints. We validate HILP by demonstrating that it captures the performance effects of Amdahl’s law, the memory wall, and dark silicon, and then use it to explore the impact of WLP across a large SoC design space, yielding multiple insights. The key takeaway is that modeling WLP is necessary to ensure that more detailed, later-stage design tasks focus on the most favorable parts of the vast design space of heterogeneous SoCs.
