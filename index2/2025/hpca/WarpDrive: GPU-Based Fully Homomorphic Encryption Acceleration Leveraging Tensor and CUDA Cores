The application of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is rapidly gaining traction as a means to maintain data confidentiality while performing computations on encrypted data. Given the accessibility and computational power, GPUs hold promise for significantly accelerating FHE operations. However, existing GPU-based acceleration solutions face several formidable challenges, notably the extensive occurrence of pipeline stalls induced by memory access and suboptimal harnessing of GPU hardware. This paper presents WarpDrive, a comprehensive framework for GPU-based FHE acceleration. Through sophisticated computation decomposition and fine-grained memory access design, WarpDrive significantly reduces the number of instructions by $\mathbf{7 3 \%}$ and pipeline stalls by $\mathbf{8 6 \%}$ compared to the state-of-the-art solution. Additionally, WarpDrive features a framework that supports the concurrent utilization of CUDA Cores and Tensor Cores within the NTT operation, for the first time, achieving performance that surpasses that of any single type of processing unit. Furthermore, we fully exploit the intra-ciphertext parallelism to elevate both computation and memory utilization, achieving up to $2.12 \times$ improvements without the need for ciphertext batching. Experimental results demonstrate that our optimizations highly enhance the performance of homomorphic operations. On an NVIDIA A100 GPU, WarpDrive achieves a throughput of 1218 KOPS for NTT and 305 KOPS for homomorphic multiplication, outperforming the state-of-the-art GPU solution (TensorFHE) by factors of $13.4 \times$ and $3.5 \times$, respectively. For the specific FHE workload, even under a much smaller batch size, our approach achieves $2.8 \times$ the performance of TensorFHE.
