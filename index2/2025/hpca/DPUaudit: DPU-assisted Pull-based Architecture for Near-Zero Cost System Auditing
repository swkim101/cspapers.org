System auditing frameworks are crucial for modern data center security, as they record system events to detect intrusions. However, existing software-based auditing frameworks are limited by their high runtime overhead. To address the limitations of software-based frameworks, researchers had proposed a hardware-based auditing framework that offloads log processing to isolated hardware. However, despite using powerful specialized hardware, this approach still suffers from high runtime overhead, which contradicts their efficiency goal. We have identified that the high overhead is due to the pushbased architecture, which involves operating a log sender on the monitored host. Consequently, the existing approach requires heavy software protection mechanisms to secure the log sender, resulting in high runtime overhead.In this paper, we propose a new DPU-assisted pull-based architecture called DPUaudit for hardware-based auditing, which achieves near-zero runtime overhead. Instead of using a log sender, DPUaudit utilizes DPU to actively pull system events from the monitored host. This eliminates the need for heavy mechanisms to handle and safeguard the log sender, achieving highly efficient system auditing. Experimental results show that, on average, DPUaudit only slows down applications on the monitored host by 2.1% for six mainstream data center applications under different workloads, which is at least one order of magnitude smaller than existing approaches, while still ensuring the integrity of audit logs.
