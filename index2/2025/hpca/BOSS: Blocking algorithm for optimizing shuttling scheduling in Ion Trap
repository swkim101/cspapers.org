Ion traps stand at the forefront of quantum hardware technology, presenting unparalleled benefits for quantum computing, such as high-fidelity gates, extensive connectivity, and prolonged coherence times. In this context, we explore the critical role of shuttling operations within these systems, especially their influence on the fidelity loss and elongated execution times. To address these challenges, we have developed BOSS, an efficient blocking algorithm tailored to enhance shuttling efficiency. This optimization not only bolsters the shuttling process but also elevates the overall efficacy of ion trap devices. We experimented on multiple applications using two qubit gates up to 4000+ and qubits ranging from 64 to 78. Our method significantly reduces the number of shuttles on most applications, with a maximum reduction of $96.1 \%$. Additionally, our investigation includes simulations of realistic experimental parameters that incorporate sympathetic cooling, offering a higher fidelity and a refined estimate of execution times that align more closely with practical scenarios.
