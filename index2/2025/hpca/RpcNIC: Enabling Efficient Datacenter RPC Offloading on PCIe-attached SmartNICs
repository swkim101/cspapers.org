The emerging microservice/serverless-based cloud programming paradigm and the rising networking speeds leave the RPC stack as the predominant data center tax. Domain-specific hardware acceleration holds the potential to disentangle the overhead and save host CPU cycles. However, state-of-the-art RPC accelerators integrate RPC logic into the CPU or use specialized low-latency interconnects, hardly adopted in commodity servers. To this end, we design and implement RpcNIC, a software-hardware co-designed SmartNIC that enables efficient RPC layer offloading and reconfigurable RPC kernel offloading. RpcNIC connects to the server through the most widely used PCIe interconnect. To grapple with the ramifications of PCIe-induced challenges, RpcNIC introduces three techniques: (a) a target-aware deserializer that effectively batches cross-PCIe writes on the SmartNIC’s SRAM using compacted hardware data structures; (b) a memory-affinity CPU-SmartNIC collaborative serializer, which trades additional host memory copies for slow cross PCIe-transfers; (c) an automatic field update technique that transparently codifies the schema based on dynamic reconfigure RPC kernels to minimize superfluous PCIe traversals. We prototype RpcNIC using the Xilinx U280 FPGA card. On HyperProtoBench, RpcNIC achieves an average of 2.3 × lower RPC layer processing time than a comparable RPC accelerator baseline and demonstrates 2.6 × achievable throughput improvement in the end-to-end cloud workload.
