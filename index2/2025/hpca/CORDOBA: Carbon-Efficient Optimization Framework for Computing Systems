The worldâ€™s push toward an environmentally sustainable society is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry. Despite existing carbon modeling efforts to quantify carbon footprint of computing systems, optimizing carbon footprint in large design spaces-while also considering trade-offs in power, performance, and area-is especially challenging. To address this need, we present CORDOBA, a carbon-aware optimization framework that optimizes carbon efficiency. We quantify carbon efficiency using the total Carbon Delay Product metric (tCDP): the product of total carbon and application execution time. We justify why tCDP is an effective metric for quantifying carbon efficiency. We use CORDOBA to explore the large design space for carbonefficient specialized hardware, and identify distinct carbonefficient optimal designs across operational use (eliminating up to $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ of the design space) despite uncertainty in carbon footprint parameters. We quantify opportunities to improve tCDP for real system case studies: (a) optimizing hardware provisioning from 8 to 4 cores in real system CPUs improves tCDP by $1.25 \times$; and (b) leveraging advanced three-dimensional (3D) integration techniques (3D stacking of separately-fabricated logic and memory chips) improves tCDP by $6.9 \times$ versus conventional systems.
