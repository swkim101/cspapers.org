Quantum computing carries significant potential for addressing practical problems. However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy quantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits. Therefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful results. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to optimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit gate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First, we introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford subcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since Clifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption, which efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We demonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have wideranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, manybody physics, and combinatorial optimization problems. Nearterm algorithms such as VQE and QAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a 77.7% reduction in CNOT gate count and up to an 84.1% reduction in entangling depth compared with state-of-the-art methods.
