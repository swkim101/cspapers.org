This paper introduces the Hamiltonian-Adaptive Ternary Tree (HATT) framework to compile optimized Fermion-to-qubit mapping for specific Fermionic Hamiltonians. In the simulation of Fermionic quantum systems, efficient Fermion-toqubit mapping plays a critical role in transforming the Fermionic system into a qubit system. HATT utilizes ternary tree mapping and a bottom-up construction procedure to generate Hamiltonian aware Fermion-to-qubit mapping to reduce the Pauli weight of the qubit Hamiltonian, resulting in lower quantum simulation circuit overhead. Additionally, our optimizations retain the important vacuum state preservation property in our Fermion-toqubit mapping and reduce the complexity of our algorithm from $O\left(N^{4}\right)$ to $O\left(N^{3}\right)$. Evaluations on various Fermionic systems demonstrate $5 \sim 25 \%$ reduction in Pauli weight, gate count, and circuit depth, alongside excellent scalability to larger systems. Experiments on the Ionq device also show the advantages of HATT in noise resistance in quantum simulations.
