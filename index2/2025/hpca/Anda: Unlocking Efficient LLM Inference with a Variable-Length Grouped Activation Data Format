The widely-used, weight-only quantized large language models (LLMs), which leverage low-bit integer (INT) weights and retain floating-point (FP) activations, reduce storage requirements while maintaining accuracy. However, this shifts the energy and latency bottlenecks towards the FP activations that are associated with costly memory accesses and computations. Existing LLM accelerators focus primarily on computation optimizations, overlooking the potential of jointly optimizing FP computations and data movement, particularly for the dominant FP-INT GeMM operations in LLM inference. To address these challenges, we investigate the sensitivity of activation precision across various LLM modules and its impact on overall model accuracy. Based on our findings, we first propose the Anda data type: an adaptive data format with group-shared exponent bits and dynamic mantissa bit allocation. Secondly, we develop an iterative post-training adaptive precision search algorithm that optimizes the bit-width for different LLM modules to balance model accuracy, energy efficiency, and inference speed. Lastly, a suite of hardware optimization techniques is proposed to maximally exploit the benefits of the Anda format. These include a bit-plane-based data organization scheme, Anda-enhanced processing units with bit-serial computation, and a runtime bit-plane Anda compressor to simultaneously optimize storage, computation, and memory footprints. Our evaluations on FP-INT GeMM operations show that Anda achieves a $2.4 \times$ speedup, $4.0 \times$ area efficiency, and $3.1 \times$ energy efficiency improvement on average for popular LLMs including OPT, LLaMA, and LLaMA-2 series over the GPU-like FP-FP baseline. Anda demonstrates strong adaptability across various application scenarios, accuracy requirements, and system performance, enabling efficient LLM inference across a wide range of deployment scenarios.
