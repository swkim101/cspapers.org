RowHammer vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to modern DRAM-based systems, where rapid activation of DRAM rows can induce bit-flips in neighboring rows. To mitigate this, state-of-the-art host-side RowHammer mitigations typically rely on shared counters or tracking structures. While these optimizations benefit benign applications, they are vulnerable to Performance Attacks (Perf-Attacks), where adversaries exploit shared structures to reduce DRAM bandwidth for co-running benign applications by increasing DRAM accesses for RowHammer counters or triggering repetitive refreshes required for the early reset of structures, significantly degrading performance. In this paper, we propose secure hashing mechanisms to thwart adversarial attempts to capture the mapping of shared structures. We propose DAPPER, a novel low-cost tracker resilient to Perf-Attacks even at ultra-low RowHammer thresholds. We first present a secure hashing template in the form of DAPPER-S. We then develop Dapper-H, an enhanced version of DapperS, incorporating double-hashing, novel reset strategies, and mitigative refresh techniques. Our security analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of DAPPER-H against both RowHammer and Perf-Attacks. Experiments with 57 workloads from SPEC2006, SPEC2017, TPC, Hadoop, MediaBench, and YCSB show that, even at an ultra-low RowHammer threshold of 500, DapperH incurs only a 0.9% slowdown in the presence of Perf-Attacks while using only 96 KB of SRAM per 32GB of DRAM memory.
