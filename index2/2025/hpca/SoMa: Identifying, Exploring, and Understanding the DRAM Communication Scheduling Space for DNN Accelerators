Modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators are equipped with increasingly larger on-chip buffers to provide more opportunities to alleviate the increasingly severe DRAM bandwidth pressure. However, most existing research on buffer utilization still primarily focuses on single-layer dataflow scheduling optimization. As buffers grow large enough to accommodate most single-layer weights in most networks, the impact of single-layer dataflow optimization on DRAM communication diminishes significantly. Therefore, developing new paradigms that fuse multiple layers to fully leverage the increasingly abundant onchip buffer resources to reduce DRAM accesses has become particularly important, yet remains an open challenge.To address this challenge, we first identify the optimization opportunities in DRAM communication scheduling by analyzing the drawbacks of existing works on the layer fusion paradigm and recognizing the vast optimization potential in scheduling the timing of data prefetching from and storing to DRAM. To fully exploit these optimization opportunities, we develop a Tensor-centric Notation and its corresponding parsing method to represent different DRAM communication scheduling schemes and depict the overall space of DRAM communication scheduling. Then, to thoroughly and efficiently explore the space of DRAM communication scheduling for diverse accelerators and workloads, we develop an end-to-end scheduling framework, SoMa, which has already been developed into a compiler for our commercial accelerator product. Compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Cocco framework, SoMa achieves, on average, a 2.11Ã— performance improvement and a 37.3% reduction in energy cost simultaneously. Then, we leverage SoMa to study optimizations for LLM, perform design space exploration (DSE), and analyze the DRAM communication scheduling space through a practical example, yielding some interesting insights. Moreover, SoMa has been open-sourced at https://github.com/SET-Scheduling-Project/SoMa-HPCA2025.
