Digital computing-in-memory (CIM) is an emerging solution to break through the limitations of memory wall by integrating digital logic into SRAM, which is able to achieve high area and energy efficiency with no accuracy loss. Digital CIM’s SRAM cells are still prone to errors like conventional SRAM due to noise and variation, especially under low-voltage operation for high energy efficiency. The SRAM cell errors cause multiplyaccumulation (MAC) result errors, which may seriously damage the neural network inference accuracy. However, traditional SRAM’s error correcting code (ECC) that corrects errors in one read-out row is incompatible with digital CIM, which reads out multiple rows simultaneously for computation. Detecting and correcting computational MAC errors and SRAM cell errors (i.e., MAC-cell errors) in digital CIM remain largely unexplored.To address digital CIM’s unique MAC-cell error resilience needs, we propose ER-DCIM, an error-resilient digital CIM with run-time MAC-cell error correction to guarantee computation correctness. The proposed residue code-based MAC error correction mechanism is the first to correct additive errors in the MAC result in real time during DCIM computation. Then, we propose a progressive cell error correction mechanism to correct underlying cell error in a timely manner, avoiding performance loss due to stalling computation. Further, we design a mode switcher to repurpose redundant error-resilient logic reserved for low-voltage mode to improve performance in high-voltage mode. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques enable digital CIM to maintain high throughput and energy efficiency without accuracy loss in both low-voltage and high-voltage modes.
