Embedded computing systems are becoming increasingly complex. Modern system-on-chips come with heterogeneous designs that integrate diverse processing systems and a large variety of peripherals. When considering software with mixed and independent security and criticality levels, the heterogeneity of modern computing platforms poses considerable challenges in achieving strong isolation between execution domains. Tackling these challenges is even more difficult in platforms that integrate Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) fabrics, which, due to their wide flexibility, introduce new security- and safety-related threats that can jeopardize isolation. As a matter of fact, if no proper countermeasures are in place, hardware accelerators (HAs) deployed on FPGA can be exploited to break the isolation capabilities implemented in a system by issuing dangerous bus transactions. This research proposes a design flow for heterogeneous platforms to strongly isolate bus transactions issued by HAs. The design flow is then specialized for the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ platform, leveraging the virtualizationrelated features of the Arm System Memory Management Unit (SMMU). The proposed solution jointly combines two new IPs for enforcing information transported by the AXI bus, a tool to verify the FPGA design, a principled configuration of the SMMU driver, and a secure boot flow. The proposal is evaluated with an industry-relevant use case related to embedded machine learning applied for the railway domain, in which isolation is established between two AMD Deep Learning Processor Units (DPU) and a set of FPGA HAs dedicated to a real-time critical application.
