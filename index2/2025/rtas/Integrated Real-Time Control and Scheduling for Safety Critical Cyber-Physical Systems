Cyber-physical systems (CPS) must interact with varying environments at fine-grained time-scales, assuring control safety and stability while optimizing application-specific performance objectives. To address those requirements, co-design of real-time control and scheduling has received considerable attention over multiple decades, to allow rigorous assurance of system properties while enabling diverse forms of adaptation to changing operating conditions. In this paper, we present a new formalization of the periodicity requirements for control inputs to (1) guarantee reachability of safe (and avoidance of unsafe) portions of the system state space, (2) adaptively manage dynamic periodicity constraints that may change as the state space is traversed, and (3) express minimum periods to enable safe hand-offs between high-performance controllers and more conservative backup controllers. Our evaluations of this approach confirm that it is able to maintain system safety and stability while optimizing system performance.
