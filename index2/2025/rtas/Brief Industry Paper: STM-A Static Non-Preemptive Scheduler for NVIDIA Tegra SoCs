This paper introduces System Task Manager (STM), a static, centrally monitored, OS-agnostic, non-preemptive scheduler that manages work across hardware engines on NVIDIA Tegra System-on-Chips (SoCs). We detail the design of STM and how the various components enable it to achieve high throughput while providing timing guarantees. We demonstrate a real-world application in the domain of autonomous vehicles. This includes results from deployment to a fleet of over 200 cars with 72 000 km of cumulative driving. We conclude by discussing various future research directions for this project.
