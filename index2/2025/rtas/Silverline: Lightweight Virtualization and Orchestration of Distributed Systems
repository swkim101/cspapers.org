We introduce Silverline, a novel framework for lightweight virtualization and orchestration of distributed real-time systems. Leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm) for robust sandboxing and multi-language (polyglot) capabilities, Silverline decouples applications from their platforms through distinct manifests, enabling a centralized orchestrator to optimize resource allocation and deploy Wasm modules seamlessly across the edge-cloud continuum. It features a split data and control plane with orchestration sidecars, allowing applications to use native communication protocols and respond autonomously to network changes. We evaluate our framework in two real application contexts: an industrial automation use-case and an automotive body electronics demonstrator. Through micro-benchmarks and end-to-end testing, we demonstrate Silverline's potential for managing real-time workloads in diverse heterogeneous ecosystems.
