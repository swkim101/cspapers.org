Power Distribution Systems (PDSes) protect Cyber-Physical Systems from power faults. This work proposes an intelligent PDS with real-time current monitoring to improve fault tolerance. To bound the real-time task utilization, we define linear and nonlinear utilization bounding techniques unique to PDSes. We exploit sub-maximal loading inherent in all practical PDSes, providing a total task set utilization bound less than the sum of individual task bounds. We show these techniques are safe and applicable to real PDSs. Simulation of existing and randomly generated PDSes show up to 90 % utilization reduction versus a naive approach. An experimental, open-source PDS implementation is also provided to validate feasibility.
