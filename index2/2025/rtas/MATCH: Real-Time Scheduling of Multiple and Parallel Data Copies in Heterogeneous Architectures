In recent years, multiple data copies become popular in heterogeneous computing architectures. They enable parallel data transfer among diverse processing units. Tasks executed on such heterogeneous architectures often exhibit heightened re-source competitions and intricate task dependencies, posing challenges in meeting strict timing constraints. Due to the dominant roles of data copies in the heterogeneous architecture, effective scheduling and tight response time analysis could contribute to the timing performance of the entire heterogeneous computing system. In this work, we introduce MATCH, which offers realtime scheduling and end-to-end response time analysis for the multiple parallel data copies that are popular in mainstream heterogeneous architectures. We first identify the aggravated resource competition and task dependency from multiple data copies and comprehensive task execution patterns. Then, we provide a real-time scheduling strategy and cross-granularity schedulability analysis to deal with resource competition and task dependency. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that efficient scheduling and analysis on multiple parallel data copies can significantly improve the schedulability by 55.5%-144.4%. Additionally, experiments conducted on various scales of heterogeneous systems demonstrate that MATCH can significantly reduce pessimism in response time analysis by up to 22.8%-57.5%. Importantly, the proposed approach is compatible with existing scheduling approaches that do not consider multiple parallel data copies and are readily applied to off-the-shelf heterogeneous computing systems.
