Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use smart contracts to foster communities working toward common goals. Existing definitions of decentralization, however -- the'D'in DAO -- fall short of capturing the key properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation. This work proposes a new framework for measuring DAO decentralization called Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced''vibe''). VBE is based on the idea that voters with closely aligned interests act as a centralizing force and should be modeled as such. VBE formalizes this notion by measuring the similarity of participants'utility functions across a set of voting rounds. Unlike prior, ad hoc definitions of decentralization, VBE derives from first principles: We introduce a simple (yet powerful) reinforcement learning-based conceptual model for voting, that in turn implies VBE. We first show VBE's utility as a theoretical tool. We prove a number of results about the (de)centralizing effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, etc. that are overlooked in previous notions of DAO decentralization. Our results lead to practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. We also show how VBE can be used empirically by presenting measurement studies and VBE-based governance experiments. We make the tools we developed for these results available to the community in the form of open-source artifacts in order to facilitate future study of DAO decentralization.
