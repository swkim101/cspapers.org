It is undeniable that Malaysia has gone through a digital transformation landscape since the adverse advance of the Information Revolution (IR 4.0). This includes having Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has been hyped as most people have learned to utilize AI tools in various sectors or workplaces.  The education sector is one of them, as we can see most of the students and academicians are using it profusely in producing good assignments, reports, dissertations, videos, scripts, background music, design and others on a large scale.  (Nemorin et al., 2022) AI is a great innovative technology where several types of AI tools are used in the education sector. Nevertheless, it has the implications of it as people are now interdependent or rely excessively on AI technologies and it somehow diminishes the quality, critical mind, analytical thinking, original work, quality and authenticity of the product output.  Due to the negative repercussions as well as the challenges on integrity issues brought on by AI, researchers and society have increased their attention on the side effects of AI in the education field. Thus, this present study aimed to contribute in providing a framework or guidelines that monitor and mitigate this problem from getting out of hand. Using the online survey, data was collected from Malaysian respondents as part of the study's quantitative research approach. The data were analyzed through the Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) technique using Smart PLS version 3.0 to investigate factors influencing the overuse of AI software in education tasks. The findings demonstrated that misuse of Artificial Intelligence software would lead to greater impact or challenges towards educators in university. The importance of this research will raise educator’s awareness by controlling the misuse of Artificial Intelligence usage, raising quality work academically and providing policy guidelines in ensuring more integrity in education.
