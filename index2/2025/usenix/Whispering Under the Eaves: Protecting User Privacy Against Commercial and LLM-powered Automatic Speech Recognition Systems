The widespread application of automatic speech recognition (ASR) supports large-scale voice surveillance, raising concerns about privacy among users. In this paper, we concentrate on using adversarial examples to mitigate unauthorized disclosure of speech privacy thwarted by potential eavesdroppers in speech communications. While audio adversarial examples have demonstrated the capability to mislead ASR models or evade ASR surveillance, they are typically constructed through time-intensive offline optimization, restricting their practicality in real-time voice communication. Recent work overcame this limitation by generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and enhancing their transferability for black-box scenarios. However, they introduced excessive noise that significantly degrades audio quality and affects human perception, thereby limiting their effectiveness in practical scenarios. To address this limitation and protect live users' speech against ASR systems, we propose a novel framework, AudioShield. Central to this framework is the concept of Transferable Universal Adversarial Perturbations in the Latent Space (LS-TUAP). By transferring the perturbations to the latent space, the audio quality is preserved to a large extent. Additionally, we propose target feature adaptation to enhance the transferability of UAPs by embedding target text features into the perturbations. Comprehensive evaluation on four commercial ASR APIs (Google, Amazon, iFlytek, and Alibaba), three voice assistants, two LLM-powered ASR and one NN-based ASR demonstrates the protection superiority of AudioShield over existing competitors, and both objective and subjective evaluations indicate that AudioShield significantly improves the audio quality. Moreover, AudioShield also shows high effectiveness in real-time end-to-end scenarios, and demonstrates strong resilience against adaptive countermeasures.
