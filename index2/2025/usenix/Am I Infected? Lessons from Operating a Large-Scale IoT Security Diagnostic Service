There is an expectation that users of home IoT devices will be able to secure those devices, but they may lack information about what they need to do. In February 2022, we launched a web service that scans users' IoT devices to determine how secure they are. The service aims to diagnose and remediate vulnerabilities and malware infections of IoT devices of Japanese users. This paper reports on findings from operating this service drawn from three studies: (1) the engagement of 114,747 users between February, 2022 - May, 2024; (2) a large-scale evaluation survey among service users (n=4,103), and; (3) an investigation and targeted survey (n=90) around the remediation actions of users of non-secure devices. During the operation, we notified 417 (0.36%) users that one or more of their devices were detected as vulnerable, and 171 (0.15%) users that one of their devices was infected with malware. The service found no issues for 99% of users. Still, 96% of all users evaluated the service positively, most often for it providing reassurance, being free of charge, and short diagnosis time. Of the 171 users with malware infections, 67 returned to the service later for a new check, with 59 showing improvement. Of the 417 users with vulnerable devices, 151 users revisited and re-diagnosed, where 75 showed improvement. We report on lessons learned, including a consideration of the capabilities that non-expert users will assume of a security scan.
