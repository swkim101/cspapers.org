We introduce a new type of indirect, cross-modal injection attacks against visual language models that enable creation of self-interpreting images. These images contain hidden"meta-instructions"that control how models answer users' questions about the image and steer models' outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view. Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form of prompt injection. Adversarial images look natural and the model's answers are coherent and plausible, yet they also follow the adversary-chosen interpretation, e.g., political spin, or even objectives that are not achievable with explicit text instructions. We evaluate the efficacy of self-interpreting images for a variety of models, interpretations, and user prompts. We describe how these attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of self-interpreting content that carries spam, misinformation, or spin. Finally, we discuss defenses.
