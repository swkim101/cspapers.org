Individuals are increasingly relying on large language model (LLM)-enabled conversational agents for emotional support. While prior research has examined privacy and security issues in chatbots specifically designed for mental health purposes, these chatbots are overwhelmingly"rule-based"offerings that do not leverage generative AI. Little empirical research currently measures users'privacy and security concerns, attitudes, and expectations when using general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots to manage and improve mental health. Through 21 semi-structured interviews with U.S. participants, we identified critical misconceptions and a general lack of risk awareness. Participants conflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like accountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these chatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures with a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of"intangible vulnerability,"where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued compared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or location-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard user mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more effectively.
