The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) has provided developers with an unprecedented platform for creating games and applications (apps) that require distinct inputs, different from those of conventional devices like smartphones. The Meta Quest VR platform, driven by Meta, has democratized VR app publishing and attracted millions of users worldwide. However, as the number of published apps grows, there is a notable lack of robust headless tools for user interface (UI) exploration and user event testing. To address this need, we present AUTOVR, an automatic framework for dynamic UI and user event interaction in VR apps built on the Unity Engine. Unlike conventional Android and GUI testers, AUTOVR analyzes the app's internal binary to reveal hidden events, resolves generative event dependencies, and utilizes them for comprehensive exploration of VR apps. Using sensitive data exposure as a performance metric, we compare AUTOVR with Android Monkey, a widely used headless Android GUI stress testing tool. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates AUTOVR's superior performance, triggering an order of magnitude of more sensitive data exposures and significantly enhancing the privacy of VR apps.
