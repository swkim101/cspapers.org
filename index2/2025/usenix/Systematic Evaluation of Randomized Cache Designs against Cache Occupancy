In the main text published at USENIX Security 2025, we presented a systematic analysis of the role of cache occupancy in the design considerations for randomized caches (from the perspectives of performance and security). On the performance front, we presented a uniform benchmarking strategy that allows for a fair comparison among different randomized cache designs. Likewise, from the security perspective, we presented three threat assumptions: (1) covert channels; (2) process fingerprinting side-channel; and (3) AES key recovery. The main takeaway of our work is an open problem of designing a randomized cache of comparable efficiency with modern set-associative LLCs, while still resisting both contention-based and occupancy-based attacks. This note is meant as an addendum to the main text in light of the observations made in [2]. To summarize, the authors in [2] argue that (1) L1d cache size plays a role in adversarial success, and that (2) a patched version of MIRAGE with randomized initial seeding of global eviction map prevents leakage of AES key. We discuss the same in this addendum.
