On-device deep learning (DL) has rapidly gained adoption in mobile apps, offering the benefits of offline model inference and user privacy preservation over cloud-based approaches. However, it inevitably stores models on user devices, introducing new vulnerabilities, particularly model-stealing attacks and intellectual property infringement. While system-level protections like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a robust solution, practical challenges remain in achieving scalable on-device DL model protection, including complexities in supporting third-party models and limited adoption in current mobile solutions. Advancements in TEE-enabled hardware, such as NVIDIA's GPU-based TEEs, may address these obstacles in the future. Currently, watermarking serves as a common defense against model theft but also faces challenges here as many mobile app developers lack corresponding machine learning expertise and the inherent read-only and inference-only nature of on-device DL models prevents third parties like app stores from implementing existing watermarking techniques in post-deployment models. To protect the intellectual property of on-device DL models, in this paper, we propose THEMIS, an automatic tool that lifts the read-only restriction of on-device DL models by reconstructing their writable counterparts and leverages the untrainable nature of on-device DL models to solve watermark parameters and protect the model owner's intellectual property. Extensive experimental results across various datasets and model structures show the superiority of THEMIS in terms of different metrics. Further, an empirical investigation of 403 real-world DL mobile apps from Google Play is performed with a success rate of 81.14%, showing the practicality of THEMIS.
