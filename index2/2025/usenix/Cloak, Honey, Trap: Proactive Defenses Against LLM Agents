Phishing attacks are a significant societal threat, disproportionately harming vulnerable populations and eroding trust in essential digital services. Current defenses are often reactive, failing against modern evasive tactics like cloaking that conceal malicious content. To address this, we introduce PhishLumos, an adaptive multi-agent system that proactively mitigates entire attack campaigns. It confronts a core cybersecurity imbalance: attackers can easily scale operations, while defense remains an intensive expert task. Instead of being blocked by evasion, PhishLumos treats it as a critical signal to investigate the underlying infrastructure. Its Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents uncover shared hosting, certificates, and domain registration patterns. On real-world data, our system identified 100% of campaigns in the median case, over a week before their confirmation by cybersecurity experts. PhishLumos demonstrates a practical shift from reactive URL blocking to proactive campaign mitigation, protecting users before they are harmed and making the digital world safer for all.
