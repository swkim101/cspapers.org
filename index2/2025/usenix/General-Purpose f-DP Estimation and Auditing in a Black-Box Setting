In this paper we propose new methods to statistically assess $f$-Differential Privacy ($f$-DP), a recent refinement of differential privacy (DP) that remedies certain weaknesses of standard DP (including tightness under algorithmic composition). A challenge when deploying differentially private mechanisms is that DP is hard to validate, especially in the black-box setting. This has led to numerous empirical methods for auditing standard DP, while $f$-DP remains less explored. We introduce new black-box methods for $f$-DP that, unlike existing approaches for this privacy notion, do not require prior knowledge of the investigated algorithm. Our procedure yields a complete estimate of the $f$-DP trade-off curve, with theoretical guarantees of convergence. Additionally, we propose an efficient auditing method that empirically detects $f$-DP violations with statistical certainty, merging techniques from non-parametric estimation and optimal classification theory. Through experiments on a range of DP mechanisms, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimation and auditing procedures.
