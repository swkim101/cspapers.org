Semiparametric language models (LMs) have shown promise in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they utilize non-parametric memory as static storage, which lacks learning capability and remains disconnected from the internal information flow of the parametric models, limiting scalability and efficiency. Based on recent interpretability theories of LMs, we reconceptualize the non-parametric memory represented by k NN-LM as a learnable Mixture-of-Neighbors Induction Memory (MoNIM), which synergizes the induction capabilities of attention heads with the memorization strength of feed-forward networks (FFN). By integrating into the model’s information flow, MoNIM functions as an FFN-like bypass layer within the Transformer architecture, enabling effective learning of new knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNIM is a retentive and scalable continual learner in both data-and model-wise, enhancing the scalability and continual learning performance of semiparametric LMs. 1
