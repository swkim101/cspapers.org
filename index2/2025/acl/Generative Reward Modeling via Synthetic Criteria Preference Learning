Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) leverage synthesized Chains of Thought (CoT) to reduce the need for massive labeled data, but this approach introduces risks of overoptimization due to the inability to guarantee the correctness of the CoTs. Identifying and optimizing unexpected behaviors within these synthesized CoT remains a challenge, as it heavily depends on precise annotations of intermediate behavior, similar to process supervision. In this work, we introduce a criteria-based preference tree for reward modeling, where each path in the tree represents a reasoning trajectory based on synthesized criteria. Crucially, each reasoning trajectory can be independently optimized through RL algorithm. These fine-grained process reward signals are derived from the inference-time computations and predefined rules, eliminating the need for human supervision. In experiments, SyncPL 1 showed significant improvements over baselines on multiple human preference benchmarks. We further demonstrate that synthesized data can be learned us-ing a long CoT format, analogous to an o1-like model, further enhancing performance while keeping stability and efficiency during training.
