Cross-Document Coreference Resolution (CDCR) aims to identify and group together mentions of a specific event or entity that occur across multiple documents. In contrast to the within-document tasks, in which event and entity mentions are linked by rich and coherent contexts, cross-document mentions lack such critical contexts, which presents a significant challenge in establishing connections among them. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task Cross-Document Discourse Coherence Enhancement (CD-DCE) to enhance the discourse coherence between two cross-document event or entity mentions. Specifically, CD-DCE first selects coherent texts and then adds them between two cross-document mentions to form a new coherent document. Subsequently, the coherent text is employed to represent the event or entity mentions and to resolve any coreferent mentions. Experimental results on the three popular datasets demonstrate that our proposed method 1 outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.
