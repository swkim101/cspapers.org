As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly diverse and extensive multilingual corpora, they demonstrate cross-lingual transfer capabilities. However, these capabilities often fail to effectively extend to low-resource languages, particularly those utilizing non-Latin scripts. While transliterating low-resource languages into Latin script presents a natural solution, there currently lacks a comprehensive framework for integrating transliteration into LLMs training and deployment. Taking a pragmatic approach, this paper innovatively combines character transliteration with Huffman coding to design a complete transliteration framework. Our proposed framework offers the following advantages: 1) Compression: Reduces storage requirements for low-resource language content, achieving up to 50% reduction in file size and 50-80% reduction in token count. 2) Accuracy: Guarantees 100% lossless conversion from transliterated text back to the source language. 3) Efficiency: Eliminates the need for vocabulary expansion for low-resource languages, improving training and inference efficiency. 4) Scalability: The framework can be extended to other low-resource languages. We validate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple downstream tasks, including text classification, machine reading comprehension, and machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the model's capability to process low-resource languages while maintaining performance on high-resource languages.
