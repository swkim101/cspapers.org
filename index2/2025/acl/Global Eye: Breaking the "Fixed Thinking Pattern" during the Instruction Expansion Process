An extensive high-quality instruction dataset is crucial for the instruction tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent instruction expansion methods have demonstrated their capability to improve the quality and quantity of existing datasets, by prompting high-performance LLM to generate multiple new instructions from the original ones. However, existing methods focus on constructing multi-perspective prompts (e.g., increasing complexity or difficulty) to expand instructions, overlooking the “Fixed Thinking Pattern" issue of LLMs. This issue arises when repeatedly using the same set of prompts, causing LLMs to rely on a limited set of certain expressions to expand all instructions, potentially compromising the diversity of the final expanded dataset. This paper theoretically analyzes the causes of the “Fixed Thinking Pattern", and corroborates this phenomenon through multi-faceted empirical research. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on dynamic prompt updating: Global Eye. Specifically, after a fixed number of instruction expansions, we analyze the statistical characteristics of newly generated instructions and then update the prompts. Experimental results show that our method enables LLaMA3-8B and LLaMA2-13B to surpass the performance of open-source LLMs and GPT3.5 across various metrics.
