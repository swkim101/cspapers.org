Linguistic coordination—a phenomenon where conversation partners end up having similar patterns of language use—has been established across a variety of contexts and for multiple linguistic features. However, the study of language coordination has been accompanied by a diverse and inconsistently applied set of measures and theoretical perspectives. This diversity has significant consequences, as replication studies have highlighted the brittleness of certain measures and called influential findings into question. While prior work has addressed specific modeling decisions and model types, linguistic coordination research has yet to fully examine, synthesize, and critique the space of modeling choices available. In this work, we present a framework to organize the linguistic coordination literature. Using this schema, we provide a high-level overview of the choices involved in the measurement process and synthesize relevant critiques. Based on both gaps and limitations surfaced from this review, we suggest directions for further exploration and evaluation. In doing so, we provide the clarity required for linguistic coordination research to arrive at interpretable and sound conclusions.
