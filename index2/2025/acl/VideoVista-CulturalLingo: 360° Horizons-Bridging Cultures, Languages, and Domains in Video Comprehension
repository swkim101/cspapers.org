Assessing the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal AI systems can effectively measure their understanding and reasoning abilities. Most video evaluation benchmarks are limited to a single language, typically English, and predominantly feature videos rooted in Western cultural contexts. In this paper, we present VideoVista-CulturalLingo, the first video evaluation benchmark designed to bridge cultural, linguistic, and domain divide in video comprehension. Our work differs from existing benchmarks in the following ways: 1) Cultural diversity, incorporating cultures from China, North America, and Europe; 2) Multi-linguistics, with questions presented in Chinese and English-two of the most widely spoken languages; and 3) Broad domain, featuring videos sourced from hundreds of human-created domains. VideoVista-CulturalLingo contains 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs, and we have evaluated 24 recent open-source or proprietary video large models. From the experiment results, we observe that: 1) Existing models perform worse on Chinese-centric questions than Western-centric ones, particularly those related to Chinese history; 2) Current open-source models still exhibit limitations in temporal understanding, especially in the Event Localization task, achieving a maximum score of only 45.2%; 3) Mainstream models demonstrate strong performance in general scientific questions, while open-source models demonstrate weak performance in mathematics.
