Keyboard-based interaction may not accommodate various needs, especially for individuals with disabilities. While inertial sensor-based writing recognition is promising due to the sensors’ small size, wearability, and low cost, accurate recognition in the Chinese context is hampered by the difficulty of collecting extensive inertial signal samples for the vast number of characters. Therefore, we design a Chinese Inertial GAN (CI-GAN) containing Chinese glyph encoding (CGE), forced optimal transport (FOT), and semantic relevance alignment (SRA) to acquire unlimited high-quality training samples. Unlike existing vectorization methods focusing on the meaning of Chinese characters, CGE represents shape and stroke features, providing glyph guidance for writing signal generation. FOT establishes a triple-consistency constraint between the input prompt, output signal features, and real signal features, ensuring the authenticity and semantic accuracy of the generated signals. SRA aligns semantic relationships between multiple outputs and their input prompts, ensuring that similar inputs correspond to similar outputs (and vice versa), alleviating model hallu-cination. The three modules guide the generator while also interacting with each other, forming a coupled system. By utilizing the massive training samples provided by CI-GAN, the performance of six widely used classifiers is improved from 6.7% to 98.4%, indicating that CI-GAN constructs a flexible and efficient data platform for Chinese inertial writing recognition. Furthermore, we release the first Chinese inertial writing dataset on GitHub.
