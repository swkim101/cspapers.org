Role-playing agents (RPAs) are garnering increasing interests as a novel form of conversational AI. While previous research has predominantly concentrated on their ability to por-tray specified characters, we argue from a user-centered perspective that RPAs’ capability to advance the plot requires substantial improvements to deliver more engaging interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose RolePlot , a role-playing framework specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the plot-progression capabilities of RPAs. RolePlot begins by constructing a plot-progression dataset extended from human-written literary scripts and specially designed synthetic data, followed by narrative theory-driven manual annotation and automated labeling validated through human verification. We then exploit the over-parameterized embedding space of LLMs to detect a “trigger subspace” that identifies dialogue segments cat-alyzing plot transitions. When user’s inputs align with this subspace, we explicitly prompt RPAs to advance the plot. For evaluation, we simulate User-RPA interactions and track both the conversation longevity (measured in dialogue turns before disengagement) and users’ arousal levels across different stages. Empiri-cally, our method improves RPAs’ capability to time plot developments, and more importantly, yielding a significant increase in conversation
