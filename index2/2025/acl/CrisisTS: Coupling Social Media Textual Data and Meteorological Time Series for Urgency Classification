This paper proposes C RISIS TS, the first multimodal and multilingual dataset for urgency classification composed of benchmark crisis datasets that have been mapped with open source geocoded meteorological time series data. This mapping is based on a simple and effective strategy that allows for temporal and location alignment even in the absence of location mention in the text. A set of multimodal experiments have been conducted relying on transformers and LLMs to improve overall performances while ensuring model generalizability. Our results show that modality fusion out-performs text-only models.
