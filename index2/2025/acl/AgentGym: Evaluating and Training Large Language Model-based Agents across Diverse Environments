Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising foundation to build generally-capable agents (LLM-based agents) that can handle multi-turn decision-making tasks across various environments. However, the community lacks a unified interactive framework that covers diverse environments for comprehensive evaluation of agents, and enables exploration and learning for their self-improvement. To address this, we propose A GENT G YM , a framework featuring 7 real-world scenarios, 14 environments, and 89 tasks for unified, real-time, and concurrent agent interaction. We construct expanded instruction set, high-quality trajectories, and comprehensive benchmarking suite for developing LLM-based agents. Moreover, A GENT G YM supports interactive exploration and learning for agents through multi-turn interactions and real-time feedback. Based on A GENT G YM , we take the initial step to develop LLM-based agents that can handle diverse tasks via methods like self-improvement or reinforcement learning. Experimental re-sults show that the trained agents can achieve results comparable to commercial models. We hope our work can help the community develop more advanced LLM-based agents. We release the code, dataset, benchmark, and checkpoints at https://agentgym.github.io/.
