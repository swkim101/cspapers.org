In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis, monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization) between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are released to the community.
