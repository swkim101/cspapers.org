To address the phenomenon of similar classes, existing methods in few-shot continual relation extraction (FCRE) face two main challenges: non-representative prototypes and representation bias, especially when the number of available samples is limited. In our work, we propose Minion to address these challenges. Firstly, we leverage the General Orthogonal Frame (GOF) structure, based on the concept of Neural Collapse, to create robust class pro-totypes with clear separation, even between analogous classes. Secondly, we utilize label description representations as global class representatives within the fast-slow contrastive learning paradigm. These representations consistently encapsulate the essential attributes of each relation, acting as global information that helps mitigate overfitting and reduces representation bias caused by the limited local few-shot examples within a class. Extensive experiments on well-known FCRE benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness for advancing RE system.
