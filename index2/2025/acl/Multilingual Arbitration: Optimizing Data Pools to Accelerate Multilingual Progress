Synthetic data has driven recent state-of-the-art advancements, but reliance on a single oracle teacher model can lead to model collapse and bias propagation. These issues are particularly severe in multilingual settings, where no single model excels across all languages. In this study, we propose multilingual arbitration , which exploits performance variations among multiple models for each language. By strategically routing samples through a diverse set of models, each with unique strengths, we mitigate these challenges and enhance multilingual performance. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses single-teacher distillation, achieving up to 80% win rates over proprietary and open-weight models like Gemma 2, Llama 3.1, and Mistral v0.3, with the largest improvements in low-resource languages.
