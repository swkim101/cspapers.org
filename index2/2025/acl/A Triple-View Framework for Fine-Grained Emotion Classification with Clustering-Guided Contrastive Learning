Fine-grained emotion classification (FEC) aims to analyze speakers’ utterances and distinguish dozens of emotions with subtle differences, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of human emotional states. However, compared to traditional coarse-grained emotion classification, two difficulties arise as the granularity of emotions becomes finer, i.e., the presence of closely confusable emotions which are hard to distinguish, and the biased performance caused by long-tailed emotions. Although addressing both difficulties is vital to FEC, previous studies have predominantly focused on dealing with only one of them. In this paper, we pro-pose TACO, a novel triple-view framework that treats FEC as an instance-label (i.e., utterance-emotion) joint embedding learning problem to tackle both difficulties concurrently by considering three complementary views. Specifically, we design a clustering-guided contrastive loss, which incorporates clustering techniques to guide the contrastive learning process and facilitate more discriminative instance embed-dings. Additionally, we introduce the emotion label description as a helpful resource to refine label embeddings and mitigate the poor performance towards under-represented (i.e., long-tailed) emotions. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed TACO achieves substantial and consistent improvements compared to other competitive baseline methods.
