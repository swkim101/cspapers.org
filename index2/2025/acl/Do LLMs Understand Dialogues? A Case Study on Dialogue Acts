Recent advancements in NLP, largely driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly improved performance on an array of tasks. However, Dialogue Act (DA) classification remains challenging, particularly in the fine-grained 50-class, multiparty setting. This paper investigates the root causes of LLMs’ poor performance in DA classification through a linguistically motivated analysis. We identify three key pre-tasks essential for accurate DA prediction: Turn Management , Communica-tive Function Identification , and Dialogue Structure Prediction . Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with these fundamental tasks, often failing to outperform simple rule-based baselines. Additionally, we establish a strong empirical correlation between errors in these pre-tasks and DA classification failures. A human study further highlights the significant gap between LLM and human-level dialogue understanding. These findings indicate that LLMs’ shortcomings in dialogue comprehension hinder their ability to accurately predict DAs, highlighting the need for improved dialogue-aware training approaches.
