As LLMs continuously evolve, there is an urgent need for a reliable evaluation method that delivers trustworthy results promptly. Currently, static benchmarks suffer from inflexibility and unreliability, leading users to prefer human voting platforms like Chatbot Arena. However, human evaluations require significant manual effort. To address this, we propose the Auto-Arena, an innovative framework that automates the entire evaluation process using LLM-powered agents. Firstly, an LLM examiner generates questions. Then, two LLM candidates engage in a multi-round peer battle based on individual questions, aiming at revealing their true performance differences. Finally, a committee of LLM judges collaboratively discusses and decides the winner, reducing bias and enhancing fairness. During the peer battles, we observe intriguing scenarios where the LLM candidates display competitive behaviors and even learn from the opponents. In our extensive experiments involving 15 recent LLMs, Auto-Arena shows a 92.14% correlation with human preferences, surpassing all previous expert-annotated benchmarks without any manual efforts. As a result, Auto-Arena offers a promising alternative to current human evaluation platforms for evaluating LLMs automatically.
