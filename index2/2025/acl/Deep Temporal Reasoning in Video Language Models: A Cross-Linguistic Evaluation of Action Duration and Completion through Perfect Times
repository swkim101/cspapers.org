Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.
