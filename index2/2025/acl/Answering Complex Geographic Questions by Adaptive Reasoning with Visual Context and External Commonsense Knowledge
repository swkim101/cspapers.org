This paper focuses on a new task of answering geographic reasoning questions based on the given image (called GeoVQA ). Unlike traditional VQA tasks, GeoVQA asks for details about the image-related culture, landscape, etc. This requires not only the identification of the objects in the image, their properties and relations, but also the understanding of the geographic knowledge of the objects, such as location, transportation, landmark, cuisine, etc. This background knowledge does not explicitly appear in the image, nor is there an extra-textual description. Without this missing but necessary knowledge, it is difficult for existing matching-based methods to infer the correct answer. To tackle these challenges, we pro-pose a new geographic reasoning framework for our task. We first analyze the image and describe its fine-grained content by text and keywords using a multi-modal retrieval augmented technique, so as to deduce an answer in a unified textual modality. Next, we retrieve the crucial geographic commonsense knowledge. To reduce the retrieval complexity, we design a dynamic method that can adaptively collect the relevant clues for each reasoning step. The step in the incorrect direction will be pruned according to some judgment criteria. The remaining steps can help us form a reasoning chain to derive a
