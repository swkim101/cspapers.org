The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across various domains, leveraging vast pre-training knowledge and impressive generalization capabilities. However, these models often inherit biased knowledge, resulting in unfair decisions in sensitive applications. It is challenging to remove this biased knowledge without compromising reasoning abilities due to the entangled nature of the learned knowledge within LLMs. To solve this problem, existing approaches have attempted to mitigate the bias using techniques such as fine-tuning with unbiased datasets, model merging, and gradient ascent. While these methods have experimentally proven effective, they can still be sub-optimum in fully disentangling biases from reasoning. To address this gap, we propose S elective D isentanglement U nlearning (SDU), a novel unlearning framework that selectively removes biased knowledge while preserving reasoning capabilities. SDU operates in three stages: identifying biased parameters us-ing a shadow LLM, fine-tuning with unbiased data, and performing selective parameter updates based on weight saliency. Experimental results across multiple LLMs show that SDU improves fairness accuracy by 14.7% and enhances reasoning performance by 62.6% compared to existing baselines. 2
