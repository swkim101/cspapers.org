With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), intelligent models have evolved from mere tools to autonomous agents with their own goals and strategies for cooperating with humans. This evolution has birthed a novel paradigm in NLP, i.e., human-model cooperation, that has yielded remarkable progress in numerous NLP tasks in recent years. In this paper, we take the first step to present a thorough review of human-model cooperation, exploring its principles, formalizations, and open challenges. In particular, we introduce a new taxonomy that provides a unified perspective to summarize existing approaches. Also, we discuss potential frontier areas and their corresponding challenges. We regard our work as an entry point, paving the way for more breakthrough research in this regard.
