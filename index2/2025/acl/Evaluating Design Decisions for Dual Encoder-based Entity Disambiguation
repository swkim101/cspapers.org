Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of linking mentions in text to corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Dual Encoders address this by embedding mentions and label candidates in a shared embedding space and applying a similarity metric to predict the correct label. In this work, we focus on evaluating key design decisions for Dual Encoder-based ED, such as its loss function, similarity metric, label verbalization format, and negative sampling strategy. We present the resulting model VerbalizED, a document-level Dual Encoder model that includes contextual label verbalizations and efficient hard negative sampling. Additionally, we explore an iterative prediction variant that aims to improve the disambiguation of challenging data points. Comprehensive experiments on AIDA-Yago validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering insights into impactful design choices that result in a new State-of-the-Art system on the ZELDA benchmark.
