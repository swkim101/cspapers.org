BERT-family have been increasingly explored for adaptation to scenarios beyond language understanding tasks, with more recent efforts focused on enabling them to become good instruction followers. These explorations have endowed BERT-family with new roles and human expectations, showcasing their potential on par with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). However, several certain shortcomings in previous BERT-family, such as the relatively sub-optimal training corpora, learning procedure, and model architecture, all impede the further advancement of these models for serving as general and competitive LLMs. Therefore, we aim to address these deficiencies in this paper. Our study not only introduces a more suitable pre-training task that helps BERT-family excel in wider applications to realize generality but also explores the integration of cutting-edge technologies into our model to further enhance their capabilities. Our final models, termed Bi directional G eneral L anguage M odels ( BiGLM ), exhibit performance levels comparable to current SOTA LLMs across a spectrum of tasks. More-over, we conduct detailed analyses to study the effects of scaling and training corpora for BiGLM. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the early attempt to offer a recipe for building novel types of scalable, general, and competitive LLMs that diverge from current autoregressive modeling methodology. Our codes and models are available on Github 1 .
