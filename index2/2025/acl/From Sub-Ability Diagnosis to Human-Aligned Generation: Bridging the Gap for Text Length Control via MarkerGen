Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their length-controllable text generation (LCTG) ability remains below expectations, posing a major limitation for practical applications. Existing methods mainly focus on end-to-end training to reinforce adherence to length constraints. However, the lack of decomposition and targeted enhancement of LCTG sub-abilities restricts further progress. To bridge this gap, we conduct a bottom-up decomposition of LCTG sub-abilities with human patterns as reference and perform a detailed error analysis. On this basis, we propose MarkerGen, a simple-yet-effective plug-and-play approach that:(1) mitigates LLM fundamental deficiencies via external tool integration;(2) conducts explicit length modeling with dynamically inserted markers;(3) employs a three-stage generation scheme to better align length constraints while maintaining content quality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MarkerGen significantly improves LCTG across various settings, exhibiting outstanding effectiveness and generalizability.
