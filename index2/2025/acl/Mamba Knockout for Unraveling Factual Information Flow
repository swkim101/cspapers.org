This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms. Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured factorization, we disentangle how distinct"features"either enable token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.
