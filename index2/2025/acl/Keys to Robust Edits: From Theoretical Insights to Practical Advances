Large language models (LLMs) struggle with maintaining accurate knowledge due to conflicting/outdated parametric memories. While locate-and-edit methods address this, their reliance on models' internal representations leads to robustness failures in long-context reasoning and paraphrased queries. We identify a fundamental limitation of locate-and-edit methods: existing semantic keys (for memory localization) cannot simultaneously satisfy robustness (context-invariant activation) and specificity (precise knowledge discrimination). Through theoretical error-bound analysis, we establish formal criteria for effective editing. Our solution introduces \textit{Robust Edit Pathway (REP)}, a plug-and-play module that: (1) disentangles editing keys from native model representations; (2) dynamically adjusts keys via contrastive learning to achieve robustness-specificity balance. Extensive experiments across various editing methods (ROME/MEMIT/R-ROME/EMMET), existing LLMs (LLaMA2, QWen, Mistral), and datasets (CounterFact, ZsRE) show that REP improves success rate over robustness tests by up-to 66.4\% while maintaining the success rate unaffected.
