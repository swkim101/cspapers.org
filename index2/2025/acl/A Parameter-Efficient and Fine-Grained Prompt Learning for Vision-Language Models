Current vision-language models (VLMs) understand complex vision-text tasks by extracting overall semantic information from large-scale cross-modal associations. However, extracting from large-scale cross-modal associations often smooths out semantic details and requires large computations, limiting multi-modal fine-grained understanding performance and efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a detail-oriented prompt learning (DoPL) method for vision-language models to implement fine-grained multi-modal semantic alignment with merely 0.25M trainable parameters. According to the low-entropy information concentration theory, DoPL explores shared interest tokens from text-vision correlations and transforms them into alignment weights to enhance text prompt and vision prompt via detail-oriented prompt generation. It effectively guides the current frozen layer to extract fine-grained text-vision alignment cues. Furthermore, DoPL constructs detail-oriented prompt generation for each frozen layer to implement layer-by-layer localization of fine-grained semantic alignment, achieving precise understanding in complex vision-text tasks. DoPL performs well in parameter-efficient fine-grained semantic alignment with only 0.12% tunable parameters for vision-language models. The state-of-the-art results over the previous parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and full fine-tuning approaches on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DoPL in complex multi-modal tasks.
