Stance detection is a pivotal task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), identifying textual attitudes toward various targets. Despite advances in using Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges persist due to hallucination-models generating plausible yet inaccurate content. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MPVStance, a framework that incorporates Multi-Perspective Verification (MPV) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) across a structured five-step verification process. Our method enhances stance detection by rigorously validating each response from factual accuracy, logical consistency, contextual relevance, and other perspectives. Extensive testing on the SemEval-2016 and VAST datasets, including scenarios that challenge existing methods and comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrates that MPVStance significantly outperforms current models. It effectively mitigates hallucination issues and sets new benchmarks for reliability and accuracy in stance detection, particularly in zero-shot, few-shot, and challenging scenarios.
