Visual perspective-taking, an ability to envision others’ perspectives from a single self-perspective, is vital in human-robot interactions. Thus, we introduce a human-centric visual grounding task and a dataset to evaluate this ability. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for inferring others’ perspectives, yet are insensitive to information differences induced by slight perspective changes. To address this problem, we propose a top-view enhanced perspective transformation (TEP) method, which decomposes the transition from robot to human perspectives through an abstract top-view representation. It unifies perspectives and facilitates the capture of information differences from diverse perspectives. Experimental results show that TEP improves performance by up to 18%, exhibits perspective-taking abilities across various perspectives, and generalizes effectively to robotic and dynamic scenarios. ‡
