Neural Scene Representation (NSR) is a promising technique for representing real scenes. By learning from dozens of 2D photos captured from different viewpoints, NSR computes the 3D representation of real scenes. However, the performance of NSR processing running on GPU is insufficient for applications. Cambricon-R achieves high performance of more than 60 scenes per second, but at the cost of modeling quality. In this paper, we propose Cambricon-SR, an algorithm-hardware co-designed accelerator to improve NSR performance and quality. First, we propose a novel NSR algorithm with sparse encoding table, it achieves more than 80% of sparsity for the encoding table with negligible accuracy loss. Second, to efficiently eliminate the invalid memory access requests to the pruned entries, we propose the sparse index unit based on sequential SRAM access to address the challenge of irregular memory access to the sparse structure bitmap. It achieves a throughput increase of 7.54 × for the encoding stage with an additional area overhead of 8.59%. Third, we propose the dynamic shared buffer for the MLP units to reduce the buffer usage by 85.3% so that we can increase the number of the MLP units. We conduct experimental evaluations on 8 typical scenes. The results demonstrate that, compared with A100 GPU and Cambricon-R, Cambricon-SR achieves 1259 × and 4.12 × speedup, and reduces the energy consumption by 1139 × and 2.98 × for each training iteration of NSR, respectively.
