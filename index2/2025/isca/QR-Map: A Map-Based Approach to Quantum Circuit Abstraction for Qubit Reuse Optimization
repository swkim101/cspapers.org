Recent advances in quantum computing introduce the ability to reuse qubits through mid-circuit measurements, thereby enhancing the efficiency of quantum devices with limited computational resources. However, identifying optimal reuse opportunities in quantum circuits remains challenging due to the intricate dependencies between quantum gates. Existing frameworks address this by either directly searching for reuse opportunities or converting circuits into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Unfortunately, these frameworks may require exponential search complexity or may not always ensure optimal results due to their non-deterministic property. To overcome these challenges, we propose QR-Map (Qubit Reuse Map), a map-based framework that abstracts computational dependencies for efficient qubit reuse. By extracting and aligning two-qubit gates, QR-Map facilitates dependency detection and ensures qubit savings without incurring excessive idle time. This approach achieves an optimal balance between gate serialization depth and crosstalk reduction. Evaluations with various quantum circuit benchmarks demonstrate that quantum circuits optimized with QR-Map achieve average reductions of 20% in qubit usage, 25% in circuit depth, and 22% in SWAP insertions compared to those optimized with the state-of-the-art framework.
