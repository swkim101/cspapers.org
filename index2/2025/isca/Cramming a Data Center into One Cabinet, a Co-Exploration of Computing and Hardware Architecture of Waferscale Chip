The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly increased hardware demands. Wafer-scale chips, which integrate numerous compute units on an entire wafer, offer a high-density computing solution for data centers and can extend Moore’s Law at system level. However, current wafer-scale data center architectures face inefficiencies, such as uncoordinated resource allocation and lack of co-optimization for system area, preventing optimal integration density and performance within given cost and physical constraints. We propose a co-exploration approach of computing and hardware architectures to bridge this gap. We first develop an optimized wafer-scale single-cabinet data center model, integrating configurable on-chip memory dies and employing a vertically stacked hardware architecture. Based on this model, we introduce Titan, an automated exploration framework for intra-chip and inter-chip architecture design and optimization. Based on the architecture features of wafer-scale systems with optimal integration density, Titan establishes parameter dependencies to co-design the computing and hardware architectures. To reduce the design cycle for wafer-scale systems, Titan introduces vertical area constraints and pre-checks physical limits by integrating a series of reliability prediction models. It also integrates hardware capacity and cost evaluations to enable multi-objective optimization. Under the same cost constraint, on average, Titan’s cabinet design architecture improves system computing capacity by 2.90 ×, communication bandwidth by 2.11 ×, and memory bandwidth by 11.23 × compared to the state-of-the-art Dojo-like wafer-scale single tray architecture. Simulated in different scenarios, Titan’s design delivers 3.17 × and 10.66 × performance improvement for Llama2-7B and Llama2-72B. Moreover, we leverage Titan to uncover insights into the optimal single-chip area choice within a cabinet under different cost constraints.
