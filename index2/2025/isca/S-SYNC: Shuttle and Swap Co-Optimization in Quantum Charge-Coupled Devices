The Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture is a modular design to expand trapped-ion quantum computer that relies on the coherent shuttling of qubits across an array of segmented electrodes. Leveraging trapped ions for their long coherence times and high-fidelity quantum operations, QCCD technology represents a significant advancement toward practical, large-scale quantum processors. However, shuttling increases thermal motion and consistently necessitates qubit swaps, significantly extend execution time and negatively affect application success rates. In this paper, we introduce S-SYNC â€“ a compiler designed to co-optimize the number of shuttling and swapping operations. S-SYNC exploits the unique properties of QCCD and incorporates generic SWAP operations to efficiently manage shuttle and SWAP counts simultaneously. Building on the static topology formulation of QCCD, we develop scheduling heuristics to enhance overall performance. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach reduces the shuttling number by 3.69x on average and improves the success rate of quantum applications by 1.73x on average. Moreover, we apply S-SYNC to gain insights into executing applications across various QCCD topologies and to compare the trade-offs between different initial mapping methods.
