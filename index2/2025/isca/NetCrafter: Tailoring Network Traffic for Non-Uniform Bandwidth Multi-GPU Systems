Multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are being integrated into systems to meet the computing demands of emerging workloads. To continuously support more GPUs in a system, it is important to connect them efficiently and effectively. To this end, emerging multi-GPU systems are adopting a hierarchical approach – a group of GPUs with high affinity are connected with higher-bandwidth networks, while multiple groups of GPUs are connected with lower-bandwidth networks to support the scaling of GPUs. Unfortunately, such a non-uniform bandwidth configuration leads to significant performance bottlenecks, especially across lower-bandwidth networks. We present NetCrafter, a combination of novel approaches to deal with the network traffic. NetCrafter is based on three observations: a) not all flits in the network fully utilize the network bandwidth, b) not all requested flits are even necessary – they are requested in the hope that their data might be useful later, c) some flits are more latency-sensitive than others and must be prioritized in the network. NetCrafter leverages these observations to reduce the network traffic by stitching compatible flits that are partly filled, and trimming the number of flits by not fetching flits that are unnecessary. NetCrafter also effectively manages network traffic by sequencing flits such that latency-sensitive flits reach their destinations faster. Although our proposed techniques are generic and can be applied to any network, they are especially useful in alleviating the bottlenecks presented by lower-bandwidth networks connecting multiple groups of GPUs. Overall, NetCrafter significantly improves multi-GPU performance, thereby contributing to efficient scaling of GPU-based systems.
