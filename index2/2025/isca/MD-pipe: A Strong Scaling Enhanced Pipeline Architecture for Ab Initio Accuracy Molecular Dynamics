Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with first-principles accuracy are widely applied in various fields, including materials science and molecular pharmacology. Current research focus on reducing the solution time of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) from both algorithmic and software perspectives. However, these optimizations are still far from meeting the ever-increasing performance demands for AIMD. In this paper, a fine-grained pipeline architecture is proposed to further optimize the solution time of MD. We design a high-utilization systolic line that eliminates the injection and evacuation time during each matrix operation. Besides, in conjunction with the MD dataflow, a computation migration strategy is introduced to reduce the storage overhead. Furthermore, we leverage dataflow rearrangement and preloading to eliminate the matrix transpose costs. The MD-pipe architecture has been implemented and verified using AMD VPK180 FPGA and ASIC synthesis tools. Evaluation results show that our work on FPGA and ASIC outperforms the NVIDIA A100 GPU by 2.97 × and 23.77 × respectively. Moreover, the ASIC implementation achieves a simulation speed of 67.6μs/day, outperforming state-of-the-art work on Fugaku supercomputer by 454 times under extremely strong scaling deployment (one-atom-per-core).
