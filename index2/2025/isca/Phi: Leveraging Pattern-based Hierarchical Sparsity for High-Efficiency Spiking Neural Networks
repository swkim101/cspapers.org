Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention for their energy efficiency and biological plausibility, utilizing 0-1 activation sparsity through spike-driven computation. While existing SNN accelerators exploit this sparsity to skip zero computations, they often overlook the unique distribution patterns inherent in binary activations. In this work, we observe that particular patterns exist in spike activations, which we can utilize to reduce the substantial computation of SNN models. Based on these findings, we propose a novel pattern-based hierarchical sparsity framework, termed Phi, to optimize computation. Phi introduces a two-level sparsity hierarchy: Level 1 exhibits vector-wise sparsity by representing activations with pre-defined patterns, allowing for offline pre-computation with weights and significantly reducing most runtime computation. Level 2 features element-wise sparsity by complementing the Level 1 matrix, using a highly sparse matrix to further reduce computation while maintaining accuracy. We present an algorithm-hardware co-design approach. Algorithmically, we employ a k-means-based pattern selection method to identify representative patterns and introduce a pattern-aware fine-tuning technique to enhance Level 2 sparsity. Architecturally, we design Phi, a dedicated hardware architecture that efficiently processes the two levels of Phi sparsity on the fly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Phi achieves a 3.45 × speedup and a 4.93 × improvement in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators, showcasing the effectiveness of our framework in optimizing SNN computation.
