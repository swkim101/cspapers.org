Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is an emerging cryptographic technique for privacy-preserving computation, which enables computations on the encrypted data. Nonetheless, the massive computational demands of FHE prevent its further application to real-world workloads. To tackle this problem, several studies focus on the ASIC-based acceleration for FHE. However, the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms poses challenges to the generality of ASIC accelerator design. By contrast, a number of works rely on GPGPUs for FHE accelerations, due to the high parallelism and flexibility provided by GPGPUs. In this work, we propose a GPGPU-based acceleration solution that supports the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme by further exploiting Tensor Core(TCU) capabilities. In our study, we first analyze the FHE applications based on GPGPUs and emphasize the poor data reuse of some FHE kernels. Subsequently, we highlight the inefficient usage of TCUs due to the unused FP64 components. To address these issues, we propose a novel FHE acceleration solution based on GPGPU named Neo, which features: 1) algorithmic optimizations that transform scalar multiplication and element-wise multiplication into matrix multiplication; 2) data layout optimizations for FHE kernels to optimize for matrix multiplications; 3) Accelerating matrix multiplication with the floating-point components in TCUs to leverage the strengths of various components within the GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that within NVIDIA A100 GPGPU, Neo outperforms TensorFHE by 3.28 Ã—.
