Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables direct computation on encrypted data, providing substantial security advantages in cloud-based modern society. However, FHE suffers from significant computational overhead compared to plaintext computation, hindering its adoption in real-world applications. While many accelerators have been designed to address performance bottlenecks, most do not fully leverage cryptographic optimization technologies, leaving room for further performance enhancements. In this work, we propose FAST, an FHE accelerator incorporating recent cryptographic optimizations, including hoisting technology and the gadget decomposition key-switching method (named KLSS method). We analyze ciphertext level consumption throughout application execution and observe that workload requirements vary significantly with different ciphertext levels for both hybrid and KLSS key-switching methods. Additionally, we note the differing computational precision requirements for these key-switching methods. Based on these observations, we designed a versatile framework that supports multiple key-switching methods during a single application execution and integrates hoisting technology. Furthermore, we developed a scalable, precision-tunable multiplier to accommodate the needs of hybrid and KLSS key-switching methods. FAST architecture features a specialized multiplier and novel data organization to exploit cryptographic optimizations effectively. To our knowledge, this is the first accelerator to support hoisting technology and the gadget decomposition key-switching method. Our solution achieves a significant performance improvement, averaging a 1.8 Ã— speedup.
