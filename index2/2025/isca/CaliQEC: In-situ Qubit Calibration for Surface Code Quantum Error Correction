Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum computation. However, error drift in qubits undermines QEC performance during long computations, necessitating frequent calibration. Conventional calibration methods disrupt quantum states, requiring system downtime and rendering in situ calibration impractical. To address this challenge, we propose QECali, a novel framework that enables in situ calibration for surface codes. Our evaluation demonstrates that QECali introduces modest qubit overhead and negligible increases in execution time, offering the first practical solution for in situ calibration in surface code based quantum computation.
