Elastic Block Storage (EBS) has a pivotal role in modern data center infrastructure, providing reliable, high-performance and flexible block storage service to users. In Alibaba Cloud, EBS is the most widely used service and has been supporting the operation of millions of virtual disks. However, even with layers of load balancing and caching, we still observe significant traffic skewness across the EBS stack. This motivates us to comprehensively investigate symptoms and root causes behind the traffic patterns and, more importantly, explore the fixes for the identified issues. In this paper, we collect 310 million IO traces from approximately 60k virtual machines and 140k virtual disks deployed in our EBS. Based on extensive statistical analysis, we examine the traffic skewness across multiple components of the EBS stack. We identify four typical symptoms related to the IO virtualization framework, traffic throttle, storage cluster management and cache. For each symptom, we further explore the potential solutions along with the challenges
