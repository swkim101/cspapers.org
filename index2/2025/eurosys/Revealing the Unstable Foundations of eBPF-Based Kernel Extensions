eBPF programs significantly enhance kernel capabilities, but encounter substantial compatibility challenges due to their deep integration with unstable kernel internals. We introduce DepSurf, a tool that identifies dependency mismatches between eBPF programs and kernel images. Our analysis of 25 kernel images spanning 8 years reveals that dependency mismatches are pervasive, stemming from kernel source code evolution, diverse configuration options, and intricate compilation processes. We apply DepSurf to 53 real-world eBPF programs, and find that 83% are impacted by dependency mismatches, underscoring the urgent need for systematic dependency analysis. By identifying these mismatches, Dep-Surf enables a more robust development and maintenance process for eBPF programs, enhancing their reliability across a wide range of kernels
