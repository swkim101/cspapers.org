The feature extractor component in today's ML-based traffic analysis applications is becoming a key bottleneck. While mainstream software-based approaches can support flexible feature extraction, they fail to scale to multi-100Gbps network speed easily. Meanwhile, hardware-accelerated solutions can scale to high throughput, but cannot flexibly support generic traffic analysis applications. In this paper, we propose SuperFE, a feature extraction framework that allows users to extract traffic features efficiently and flexibly. SuperFE leverages the capabilities of both new-generation programmable switches and SmartNICs, with three key designs. First, SuperFE presents a user-friendly and extensible interface to support customized feature extraction policies, shielding underlying hardware implementation details and complexities. Second, SuperFE introduces a high-performance multi-granularity key-vector cache system in the programmable switches to batch necessary feature metadata for massive amounts of packets. Third, SuperFE exploits the multi-core parallel and hierarchical memory of SoC-based SmartNICs to achieve efficient feature computation with diverse streaming algorithms. Evaluations using our prototype demonstrate that SuperFE enables various state-of-the-art traffic analysis applications to efficiently extract features from multi-100Gbps raw traffic without compromising detection accuracy, and achieves nearly two orders of magnitude higher throughput than the software-based counterparts.
