Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) technology has advanced in recent years and can simultaneously satisfy the network requirements of high data plane performance, high deployment density, and fast startup for applications in traditional containers. However, it falls short with secure containers, which have become the mainstream choice in multi-tenant clouds. SR-IOV requires secure containers to use passthrough I/O for higher data plane performance, which hinders the container startup performance and prevents its usage in time-sensitive tasks like serverless computing. In this paper, we advocate that the startup performance of SR-IOV enabled secure containers can be further boosted, making SR-IOV suitable for building a Container Network Interface (CNI) for secure containers. We first dissect the end-to-end concurrent startup process and identify three key bottlenecks that lead to the slow startup, including Virtual Function I/O device set management, Direct Memory Access memory mapping, and Virtual Function (VF) driver initialization. We then propose a CNI named FastIOV that addresses these bottlenecks through lock decomposition, unnecessary mapping skipping, decoupled zeroing, and asynchronous VF driver initialization. Our evaluation shows that FastIOV reduces the overhead of enabling SR-IOV for secure containers by 96.1%, achieving 65.7% and 75.4% reductions in the average and 99th percentile end-to-end startup time.
