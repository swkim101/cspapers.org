In the context of streaming dataflow queries, the task placement problem aims to identify a mapping of operator tasks to physical resources in a distributed cluster. We show that task placement not only significantly affects query performance but also the convergence and accuracy of auto-scaling controllers. We propose CAPSys , an adaptive resource controller for dataflow stream processors, that considers auto-scaling and task placement in concert. CAPSys relies on Contention-Aware Placement Search (CAPS) , a new placement strategy that ensures compute-intensive, I/O-intensive, and network-intensive tasks are balanced across available resources. We integrate CAPSys with Apache Flink and show that it consistently achieves higher throughput and lower back-pressure than Flink’s strategies, while it also improves the convergence of the DS2 auto-scaling controller under variable workloads. When compared with the state-of-the-art ODRP placement strategy, CAPSys computes the task placement in orders of magnitude lower time and achieves up to 6 × higher throughput.
