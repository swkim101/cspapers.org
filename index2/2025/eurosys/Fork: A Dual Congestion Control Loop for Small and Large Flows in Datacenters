Many existing transport designs aim to deliver ultra-low latency and high bandwidth for applications in high-speed datacenter networks. However, almost all of them intertwine the control of small and large flows using the same control entity (e.g., sender or receiver) and congestion feedback signal (e.g., ECN or credit), thus bringing significant performance impairments. By contrast, we seek to decouple the rate control of small flows from that of large ones. To this end, we present Fork, a new datacenter transport that relies on two parallel control loops. One sender-driven small flow control loop (SCP) runs at the highest priority with a multi-flow ACK clocking mechanism to achieve low latencies for small flows. Another receiver-driven low-priority large flow control loop (LCP) employs two simple yet effective mechanisms: ECN migration and AIMD credit control, to protect small flow transmission while gracefully utilizing the spare bandwidth left by SCP. We have implemented a Fork prototype based on DPDK, and shown, through both testbed experiments and simulations, that compared to Homa and Aeolus, Fork reduces the average FCT of small flows by up to 81.4% and 67.7%, respectively, while maintaining lower FCTs for large flows.
