Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are pivotal for extracting semantic and structural information from heterogeneous graphs. Traditional HGNN implementations often grapple with the challenges of excessive metapath instances, requiring substantial storage or incurring high instance-matching overhead. These methods typically suffer from redundant instance encoding and costly semantic graph construction. Addressing these issues, we introduce an advanced Metapath Graph (MG) abstraction that encapsulates the structural information of all metapath instances within a compact representation. This approach significantly reduces storage demands, eliminates redundant instance encodings, and foregoes the need for constructing semantic graphs, thereby facilitating rapid HGNN inference. Our software-based system, MetaHG, leverages layerwise encoding and aggregation to avoid redundancies without the necessity of semantic graphs. It incorporates a fast, lightweight partitioning method to efficiently manage large graphs. Distinctively, MetaHG seamlessly integrates with both dynamic HGNNs and homogeneous GNNs, unlike conventional systems. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that MetaHG surpasses the state-of-the-art BFS- and DFS-based HGNN systems, MAGNN and the software implementation of MetaNMP, by 42.5× and 4.53×, respectively, on average.
