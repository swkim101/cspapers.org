Sketches have proven to be useful for measuring traffic. They store measurement results in the registers of data plane switches. However, they suffer from the short of switch register resources, limiting their measurement accuracy. We propose Phantom, a framework that virtualizes register resources on programmable switches. We observe that in addition to original register resources, switches also offer the capability of data recirculation. Such a capability can be utilized to store some measurement data of sketches, enabling Phantom to realize virtual registers. We realize this insight by building Phantom on a 64x100 Gbps Tofino switch. Our testbed experiments indicate that Phantom can virtualize O(106) registers under Tbps-level traffic, which brings up to 86% accuracy improvement to sketches.
