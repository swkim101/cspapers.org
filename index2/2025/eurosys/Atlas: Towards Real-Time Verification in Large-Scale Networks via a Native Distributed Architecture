Data plane verification (DPV) can be critical in ensuring the network operates correctly. To be useful in practice, they need to be: (1) fast so as to prevent significant packet loss or security violations; (2) scalable so as to accommodate today's large-scale network architecture. Current DPV tools struggle to meet these requirements due to their centralized architecture. To be concrete, there is a bottleneck for a single-point server to perform real-time DPV tasks. Furthermore, a single-point server makes it hard to collect real-time data plane updates from every device in large-scale networks. This paper proposes Atlas, a native distributed data plane verification (DPV) solution, which systematically solves its scalability problem and improves its real-time performance. To achieve this, (1) Atlas designs a hierarchical distributed architecture for DPV in large-scale networks. (2) Atlas proposes a native approach to maximize the parallelism of the architecture. Both dataset-driven simulation experiments and deployments in the wild demonstrate that Atlas is capable of fast and scalable distributed verification. The advantages offered by Atlas continue to expand as network sizes increase. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Atlas is 2-7Ã— faster while keeping each component lightweight.
