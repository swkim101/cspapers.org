Internet congestion control (CC) has long posed a challenging control problem in networking systems, with recent approaches increasingly incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enhance adaptability and performance. Despite promising, DRL-based CC schemes often suffer from poor fairness, particularly when applied to network environments unseen during training. This paper introduces Jury, a novel DRL-based CC scheme designed to achieve fairness generalizability. At its heart, Jury decouples the fairness con-trol from the principal DRL model with two design elements: i) By transforming network signals, it provides a universal view of network environments among competing flows, and ii) It adopts a post-processing phase to dynamically module the sending rate based on flow bandwidth occupancy estimation, ensuring large flows behave more conservatively and smaller flows more aggressively, thus achieving a fair and balanced bandwidth allocation. We have fully implemented Jury, and extensive evaluations demonstrate its robust convergence properties and high performance across a broad spectrum of both emulated and real-world network conditions.
