Blockchain systems, especially EVM-compatible ones that serially execute transactions, face a significant limitation in throughput. One promising solution is concurrent transaction execution, which accelerates transaction processing and increases the overall throughput. However, existing concurrency control algorithms fail to obtain adequate speedups in high-contention blockchain workloads, primarily due to their transaction-level conflict resolution strategies. This paper introduces a novel operation-level concurrency control algorithm tailored for blockchains. The crux of our approach is to ensure that only operations depending on conflicts are executed serially, while permitting concurrent execution of the remaining conflict-free operations. In contrast to conventional approaches that either block or abort an entire transaction upon detecting conflicts, our algorithm integrates a redo phase that identifies and re-executes conflicting operations. To facilitate this, we propose the SSA (static single-assignment) operation log, a mechanism to trace operation dependencies, thereby enabling precise conflict identification and efficient re-execution. Our prototype, ParallelEVM, is evaluated using real-world Ethereum blocks. Experimental results show that ParallelEVM achieves an average speedup of 4.28 × , a marked improvement over the 2.49 × speedup achieved by optimistic concurrency control.
