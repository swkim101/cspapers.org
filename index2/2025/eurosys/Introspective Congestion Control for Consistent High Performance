The congestion control (CC) algorithm is expected to achieve consistent high performance under different network environments. Traditionally, classic CCs are designed with the methodology of inferring path conditions to guide the rate adjustment. However, this methodology suffers from wrong path condition inferences in certain cases, which mislead the rate adjustment and lead to performance degradation. To avoid wrong path condition inferences, we develop the projection-based introspective method and design the introspective congestion control (ICC) algorithm in this paper. Specifically, the rate adjustment rules are designed to possess a specialized profile such that the projection of the profile can be distinguished under unchanged path conditions. In this way, the projection, which can be distinguished from the time series of delay signals in the frequency domain, facilitates ICC to extract more information for path condition inferences. Consequently, with the introspection on the projection, ICC can avoid being misled by wrong path condition inferences and thus achieve consistent high performance under different conditions. The advantages of ICC are confirmed through extensive experiments conducted on various locally emulated scenarios, global testbeds over the Internet, and the Alipay platform.
