Deduplication is widely used in backup storage and reduces storage overhead by allowing backups to share common data chunks. However, it naturally disrupts the sequential layout of backup images, leading to fragmentation, which slows down backup restoration. Existing solutions to this issue often come with trade-offs, either reducing deduplication effectiveness or introducing significant I/O overhead. In this paper, we propose GCCDF, a novel approach that enhances the efficiency of deduplication-based backup storage. It reorders data as part of garbage collection to eliminate fragmentation, avoiding additional I/O costs. During the reordering, it effectively groups related data for better locality and aligns with the storage layout in backup storage. Evaluation results demonstrate that GCCDF significantly improves restoration speed, offsets data migration overhead, and preserves the deduplication ratio.
