In order to realize large scale quantum error correction (QEC), resource states, such as $|T\rangle$, must be prepared which is expensive in both space and time. In order to circumvent this problem, alternatives have been proposed, such as the production of continuous angle rotation states \cite{akahoshi2023partially, choi2023fault, toshio2024practicalquantumadvantagepartially}. However, the production of these states is non-deterministic and may require multiple repetitions to succeed. The original proposals suggest architectures which do not account for realtime (or dynamic) management of resources to minimize total execution time. Without a realtime scheduler, a statically generated schedule will be unnecessarily expensive. We propose RESCQ (pronounced rescue), a realtime scheduler for programs compiled onto these continuous angle systems. Our scheme actively minimizes total cycle count by on-demand redistribution of resources based on expected production rates. Depending on the underlying hardware, this can cause excessive classical control overhead. We further address this by dynamically selecting the frequency of our recomputation. RESCQ improves over baseline proposals by an average of $2\times$ in cycle count.
