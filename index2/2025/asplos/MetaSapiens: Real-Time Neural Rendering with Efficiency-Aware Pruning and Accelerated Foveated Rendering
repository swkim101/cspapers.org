Point-Based Neural Rendering (PBNR) is emerging as a promising class of rendering techniques, which are permeating all aspects of society, driven by a growing demand for real-time, photorealistic rendering in AR/VR and digital twins. Achieving real-time PBNR on mobile devices is challenging. This paper proposes MetaSapiens, a PBNR system that for the first time delivers real-time neural rendering on mobile devices while maintaining human visual quality. MetaSapiens combines three techniques. First, we present an efficiency-aware pruning technique to optimize rendering speed. Second, we introduce a Foveated Rendering (FR) method for PBNR, leveraging humans' low visual acuity in peripheral regions to relax rendering quality and improve rendering speed. Finally, we propose an accelerator design for FR, addressing the load imbalance issue in (FR-based) PBNR. Our evaluation shows that our system achieves an order of magnitude speedup over existing PBNR models without sacrificing subjective visual quality, as confirmed by a user study.
