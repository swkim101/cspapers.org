Distributed microservice applications require a convenient means of controlling L7 communication between services. Service meshes have emerged as a popular approach to achieving this. However, current service mesh frameworks are difficult to use – they burden developers in realizing even simple communication policies, lack compatibility with diverse dataplanes, and introduce performance and resource overheads. We identify the root causes of these drawbacks and propose a ground-up new mesh architecture that overcomes them. We develop novel abstractions for mesh communication, a new mesh policy language centered on these abstractions to enable expressive policies, and a novel con-trol plane that enables using minimal dataplane resources for policy enforcement. We develop the precise semantics of our language abstractions and demonstrate how our con-trol plane can use them to execute policies correctly and optimally. We build and evaluate a prototype on realistic workloads and policies and open-source production traces. Our results show that complex policies can be specified in up to 6.75 × fewer lines, enforced with up to 2.6 × smaller tail latencies and up to 39% fewer CPU resources than today.
