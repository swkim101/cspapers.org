Rendering service, which typically orchestrates screen display and UI through Vertical Synchronization (VSync), is an indispensable system service for user experiences of smartphone OSes (e.g., Android, OpenHarmony, and iOS). The recent trend of large high-frame-rate screens, stunning visual effects, and physics-based animations has placed unprecedented pressure on the VSync-based rendering architecture, leading to higher frame drops and longer rendering latency. This paper proposes Decoupled Vertical Synchronization (D-VSync), which decouples execution and displaying in the rendering service. D-VSync allows frames to be rendered a number of VSync periods before being physically displayed on the screen. The key insight behind D-VSync to resolve the limitation of VSync is that, the decoupling enables sporadic long frames to utilize the computational power saved by common short frames, therefore providing a larger time window to tolerate workload fluctuations. Evaluation results of 75 common OS use cases and apps on OpenHarmony (Mate 40 Pro, Mate 60 Pro), 25 popular apps on Android (Google Pixel 5), and simulations of 15 mobile games show that compared to VSync, D-VSync on average reduces frame drops by 72.7%, user-perceptible stutters by 72.3%, and rendering latency by 31.1%, with only 0.13%-0.37% more power consumption. D-VSync has been integrated into HarmonyOS NEXT.
