Extended user interrupts (xUI) is a set of processor extensions that builds on Intel’s UIPI model of user interrupts, for enhanced performance and flexibility. This paper de-constructs Intel’s current UIPI design through analysis and measurement, and uses this to develop an accurate model of its timing. It then introduces four novel enhancements to user interrupts: tracked interrupts, hardware safepoints, a kernel bypass timer, and interrupt forwarding. xUI is modeled in gem5 simulation and evaluated on three use cases – preemption in a high-performance user-level runtime, IO notification in a layer3 router using DPDK, and IO notification in a synthetic workload with a streaming accelerator modeled after Intel’s Data Streaming Accelerator. This work shows that xUI offers the performance of shared memory polling with the efficiency of asynchronous notification.
