Cloud platforms have been virtualizing storage devices like flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) to make effective use of storage resources. They enable either software-isolated instance or hardware-isolated instance for facilitating the storage sharing between multi-tenant applications. However, for decades, they have to combat the fundamental tussle between the performance isolation and resource utilization. They suffer from either long tail latency caused by weak isolation or low storage utilization caused by strong isolation. In this paper, we present FleetIO, a learning-based storage virtualization framework that employs reinforcement learning (RL) for managing virtualized SSDs. FleetIO explores the unique features of RL to handle the dynamic changes of application workloads and storage states, and integrates the storage scheduling into the RL decision-making process. It achieves both performance isolation and improved storage utilization by enabling dynamic fine-grained storage harvesting across collocated application instances, while minimizing its negative impact on their service-level objectives (SLOs). FleetIO clusters workloads into different types (e.g., latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive) based on the collected I/O traces at runtime, and fine-tunes the RL reward functions for each type of workloads. We implement FleetIO on a real programmable SSD board and evaluate it with diverse cloud applications. We show that FleetIO improves the overall storage utilization of the shared SSD by up to 1.4 × , and decreases the tail latency of I/O requests by 1.5 × on average, compared to the state-of-the-art storage sharing approaches
