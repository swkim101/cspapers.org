A body of recent work has revealed that two different rows in a DRAM bank, from the perspective of a processor-memory interface, are connected to the same wordline but two separate row buffers (bitline sense amplifiers) in certain DRAM chips. Such a pair of rows is referred to as a ''coupled-row pair.'' Coupled-row pairs pose a substantial security threat as RowHammer bitflips can be caused not only by the conventional, adjacent aggressor rows but also by their coupled rows that are distant in physical address We investigate the impact of a coupled row on both FPGA-based infrastructure and server systems. In RowHammer attacks, coupled rows have hammering strength nearly identical to aggressor rows, with these attacks invisible to conventional, processor-side mitigation solutions. By exploiting these observations, we present Marionette, a new type of RowHammer attack that exploits coupled rows to extend the existing RowHammer attack surface. First, coupled rows enable an attacker to evade two types of existing software-based RowHammer defenses: tracking- and isolation-based defenses. We induce RowHammer bitflips successfully against tracking-based RowHammer defenses by silently hammering coupled rows. We also identify the feasibility of RowHammer bitflips in an isolation-based inter-VM RowHammer defense by breaking DRAM-subarray-level isolation. Second, we successfully conduct an existing RowHammer exploit in a server under the tracking-based RowHammer defense. In a native server system, Marionette enhances the success rate of the RowHammer exploit by up to 1.66x. Lastly, we explore lightweight mitigation schemes for Marionette by exposing the coupled-row relationship to systems.
