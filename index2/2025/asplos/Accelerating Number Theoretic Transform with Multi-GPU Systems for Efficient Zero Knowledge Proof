Zero-knowledge proofs validate statements without revealing any information, pivotal for applications such as verifiable outsourcing and digital currencies. However, their broad adoption is limited by the prolonged proof generation times, mainly due to two operations: Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) and Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). While MSM has been efficiently accelerated using multi-GPU systems, NTT has not, due to the high inter-GPU communication overhead incurred by its permutation data access pattern. This paper identifies the necessity of multi-GPU NTT support for end-to-end proof generation. It introduces UniNTT, an NTT algorithm tailored for multi-GPU systems. The data access pattern of NTT incurs communication across all levels of the multi-GPU hierarchy (i.e., warp, thread block, GPU, and multi-GPU), complicating the implementation of multi-GPU NTT. To this end, UniNTT proposes a novel, overhead-free decomposition approach that recursively decomposes an NTT into smaller NTTs, enabling all hierarchy levels execute the same NTT computations at different scales. It promotes a uniform design of NTT optimizations based on an abstract hardware model, which are then tailored and applied to different levels of the hierarchy. UniNTT not only simplifies the optimization process but also shows that optimizations typically specific to one level can also be effectively generalized to others. Experiments show that UniNTT achieves an average 4.26Ã— speedup compared to leading NTT implementations when both are executed on an 8-GPU system.
