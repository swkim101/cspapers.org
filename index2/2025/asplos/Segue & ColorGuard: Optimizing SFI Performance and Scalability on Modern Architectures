Background To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of applying CBL teaching method and SEGUE Framework in the doctor-patient communication skills of resident physicians in the department of otolaryngology. Methods This is an observational study to compare the score changes in doctor-patient communication skills of 120 resident physicians, before and after using CBL combined SEGUE Framework teaching method. The effects of gender, age, grade, educational background and marital status on SEGUE score were analyzed. Results Through the combined application of CBL teaching method and SEGUE Framework, the SEGUE score of 120 resident physicians was significantly improved. There was no significant difference in SEGUE score among different sex and marital status of resident physicians. SEGUE score is positively correlated with age; Different grades and educational backgrounds have significant effects on SEGUE score. Conclusion The combination of CBL teaching method and SEGUE Framework is feasible and effective in the education program of doctor-patient communication skills for resident physicians in the department of otolaryngology, and worthy of popularization and application in other medical specialties.
