Hardware-assisted virtualization is a key enabler of the modern cloud. It decouples virtual machine execution from the hardware it runs on, allowing increased flexibility through services such as dynamic hardware provisioning and live migration. Underlying this flexibility is the security promise that guest virtual machines are isolated from each other. However, due to the level of sharing between VMs, hardware vulnerabilities present a serious threat to this usage. One such vulnerability is Rowhammer, which allows attackers to modify the contents of memory to which they have no access. While the attack has been known for over a decade, published applications against such environments are limited, compromising only co-resident VMs, but not the hypervisor. More-over, due to security concerns, a key component enabling their attack has been disabled. Hence, this attack is no longer applicable in a contemporary virtualized environment. In this paper, we examine how Rowhammer can affect virtualized systems. We present HyperHammer, a Rowhammer attack that breaks hypervisor-enforced memory isolation and further compromises the hypervisor. Due to the highly
