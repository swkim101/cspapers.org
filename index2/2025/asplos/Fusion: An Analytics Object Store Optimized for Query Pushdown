The prevalence of disaggregated storage in public clouds has led to increased latency in modern OLAP cloud databases, particularly when handling ad-hoc and highly-selective queries on large objects. To address this, cloud databases have adopted computation pushdown, executing query predicates closer to the storage layer. However, existing pushdown solutions are inefficient in erasure-coded storage. Cloud storage employs erasure coding that partitions analytics file objects into fixed-sized blocks and distributes them across storage nodes. Consequently, when a specific part of the object is queried, the storage system must reassemble the object across nodes, incurring significant network latency. In this work, we present Fusion , an object store for analytics that is optimized for query pushdown on erasure-coded data. It co-designs its erasure coding and file placement topologies, taking into account popular analytics file formats (e.g., Parquet). Fusion employs a novel stripe construction algorithm that prevents fragmentation of computable units within an object, and minimizes storage overhead during erasure coding. Compared to existing erasure-coded stores, Fusion improves median and tail latency by 64% and 81%, respectively, on TPC-H, and up to 40% and 48% respectively, on real-world SQL queries. Fusion achieves this while incurring a modest 1.2% storage overhead compared to the optimal. CCS
