In recent years, control flow attacks targeting Intel SGX have attracted significant attention from the security community due to their potent capacity for information leakage. Although numerous software-based defenses have been developed to counter these attacks, many remain inadequate in fully addressing other, yet-to-be-discovered side channels. In this paper, we introduce MDPeek, a novel control flow attack targeting secret-dependent branches in SGX. To circumvent existing defenses, such as microarchitectural state flushing and branch balancing, we exploit a new leakage source, the Memory Disambiguation Unit (MDU). We present the first comprehensive reverse engineering on the MDU’s enable and update logic. Based on our detailed analysis, we develop a methodology to identify vulnerable workloads in real-world applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MDPeek with end-to-end attacks on the latest versions of three SGX-secured applications, including Libjpeg, MbedTLS and WolfSSL. In addition, we propose a low-overhead mitigation technique, store-to-load coupling, which provides a 7 × latency reduction compared to naive techniques like serialization and load aligning.
