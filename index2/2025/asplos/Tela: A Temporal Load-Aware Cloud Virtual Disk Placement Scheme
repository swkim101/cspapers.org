Cloud Block Storage (CBS) relies on Cloud Virtual Disks (CVDs) to provide block interfaces to Cloud Virtual Machines. The process of allocating user-subscribed CVDs to physical storage warehouses in cloud data centers, known as CVD placement, significantly impacts resource utilization, load balancing, and I/O performance. However, previous works have failed to account for temporal fluctuations in cloud loads, resulting in imbalanced loads, low resource utilization, and frequent warehouse overloads. To address these issues, we propose Tela, the first temporal load-aware CVD placement scheme. Using a series of interpretable models, Tela predicts the temporal load characteristics and values of CVDs, as well as potential peak loads in warehouses. Guided by these predictions, TELA places CVDs into warehouses according to their load patterns, aiming for peak shaving and load balancing while preventing overloads. Experimental results show that Tela significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme, reducing overload occurrences by 86.8-93.8%, reducing P99 overload duration by 92.6%, and decreasing load imbalance by 36.7-44.4%.
