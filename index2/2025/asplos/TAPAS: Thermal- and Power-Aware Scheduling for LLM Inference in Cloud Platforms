The rising demand for generative large language models (LLMs) poses challenges for thermal and power management in cloud datacenters. Traditional techniques often are inadequate for LLM inference due to the fine-grained, millisecond-scale execution phases, each with distinct performance, thermal, and power profiles. Additionally, LLM inference workloads are sensitive to various configuration parameters (e.g., model parallelism, size, and quantization) that involve trade-offs between performance, temperature, power, and output quality. Moreover, clouds often co-locate SaaS and IaaS workloads, each with different levels of visibility and flexibility. We propose TAPAS, a thermal- and power-aware framework designed for LLM inference clusters in the cloud. TAPAS enhances cooling and power oversubscription capabilities, reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) while effectively handling emergencies (e.g., cooling and power failures). The system leverages historical temperature and power data, along with the adaptability of SaaS workloads, to: (1) efficiently place new GPU workload VMs within cooling and power constraints, (2) route LLM inference requests across SaaS VMs, and (3) reconfigure SaaS VMs to manage load spikes and emergency situations. Our evaluation on a large GPU cluster demonstrates significant reductions in thermal and power throttling events, boosting system efficiency.
