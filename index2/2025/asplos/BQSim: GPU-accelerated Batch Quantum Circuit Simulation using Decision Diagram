Quantum circuit simulation (QCS) plays an important role in the designs and analysis of a quantum algorithm, as it assists researchers in understanding how quantum operations work without accessing expensive quantum computers. Despite many QCS methods, they are largely limited to simulating one input at a time. However, many simulation-driven quantum computing applications, such as testing and verification, require simulating multiple inputs to reason a quantum algo-rithm under different scenarios. We refer to this type of QCS as batch quantum circuit simulation (BQCS). In this paper, we present BQSim , a GPU-accelerated batch quantum circuit simulator. BQSim is inspired by the state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) that can compactly represent quantum gate matrices, but overcomes its limitation of CPU-centric simulation. Specifically, BQSim uses DD to optimize a quantum circuit for reduced BQCS computation and converts DD to a GPU-efficient data structure. Additionally, BQSim employs a task graph-based execution strategy to minimize repetitive kernel call overhead and efficiently overlap kernel execution with data movement. Compared with three state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulators, cuQuantum , Qiskit Aer , and FlatDD , BQSim is 3 . 25 × , 159 . 06 × ,
