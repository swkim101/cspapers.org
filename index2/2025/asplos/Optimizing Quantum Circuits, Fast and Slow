Optimizing quantum circuits is critical: the number of quantum operations needs to be minimized for a successful evaluation of a circuit on a quantum processor. In this paper we unify two disparate ideas for optimizing quantum circuits, rewrite rules, which are fast standard optimizer passes, and unitary synthesis, which is slow, requiring a search through the space of circuits. We present a clean, unifying framework for thinking of rewriting and resynthesis as abstract circuit transformations. We then present a radically simple algorithm, GUOQ, for optimizing quantum circuits that exploits the synergies of rewriting and resynthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the ability of GUOQ to strongly outperform existing optimizers on a wide range of benchmarks.
