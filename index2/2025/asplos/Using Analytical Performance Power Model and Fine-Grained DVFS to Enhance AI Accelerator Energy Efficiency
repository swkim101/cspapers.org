Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly increased AI processors' energy consumption, which is becoming a critical factor limiting AI development. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) stands as a key method in power optimization. However, due to the latency of DVFS control in AI processors, previous works typically apply DVFS control at the granularity of a program's entire duration or sub-phases, rather than at the level of AI operators. The advent of millisecond-level DVFS capabilities on the latest Ascend NPU platforms enables us to set frequency individually for single or multiple operators, opening up the opportunity for further enhancing energy efficiency through fine-grained DVFS control. To ensure performance is unaffected in DVFS, our work builds performance and power models for each operator. Through in-depth timeline analysis, we demonstrate that the cycle count of an operator can be modeled as a convex piecewise linear function of frequency, resulting in a performance model with an average error of 1.96%. Moreover, we build power models that incorporate temperature-dependent terms, which enhances the model's precision and results in an average error of 4.62%. Based on our performance and power models as well as the fine-grained DVFS functionality of Ascend NPU, we propose a DVFS strategy that integrates operator classification, preprocessing, and a genetic algorithm-based search. Experiments on applications including GPT-3 training achieve a reduction in AICore (the computing component within the Ascend NPU) power by 13.44% and NPU chip power by 4.95%, while limiting performance degradation to 1.76%.
