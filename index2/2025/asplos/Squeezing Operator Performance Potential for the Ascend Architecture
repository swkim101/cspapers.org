With the rise of deep learning, many companies have developed domain-specific architectures (DSAs) optimized for AI workloads, with Ascend being a representative. To fully realize the operator performance on Ascend, effective analysis and optimization is urgently needed. Compared to GPU, Ascend requires users to manage operations manually, leading to complex performance issues that require precise analysis. However, existing roofline models face challenges of visualization complexity and inaccurate performance assessment. To address these needs, we introduce a component-based roofline model that abstracts components to capture operator performance, thereby effectively identifying bottleneck components. Furthermore, through practical operator optimization case studies, we illustrate a comprehensive process of optimization based on roofline analysis, summarizing common performance issues and optimization strategies. Finally, extensive end-to-end optimization experiments demonstrate significant model speed improvements, ranging from 1.07× to 2.15×, along with valuable insights from practice.
