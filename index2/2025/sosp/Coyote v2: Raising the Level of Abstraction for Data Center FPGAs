In the trend towards hardware specialization, FPGAs play a dual role as accelerators for offloading, e.g., network virtualization, and as a vehicle for prototyping and exploring hardware designs. While FPGAs offer versatility and performance, integrating them in larger systems remains challenging. Thus, recent efforts have focused on raising the level of abstraction through better interfaces and high-level programming languages. Yet, there is still quite some room for improvement. In this paper, we present Coyote v2, an open-source FPGA shell built with a novel, three-layer hierarchical design supporting dynamic partial reconfiguration of services and user logic, with a unified logic interface, and high-level software abstractions which facilitate application deployment, multi-tenancy and transparent workload pipelining. Experimental results indicate Coyote v2 reduces synthesis times between 15% and 20% and run-time reconfiguration times by an order of magnitude, when compared to existing systems. We also demonstrate the advantages of Coyote v2 by deploying several realistic applications, including HyperLogLog cardinality estimation, AES encryption, and neural network inference. Finally, Coyote v2 places a great deal of emphasis on integration with real systems through reusable and reconfigurable services, including a fully RoCE v2-compliant networking stack, a shared virtual memory model with the host, and a DMA engine between FPGAs and GPUs. We demonstrate these features by, e.g., seamlessly deploying an FPGA-accelerated neural network from Python.
