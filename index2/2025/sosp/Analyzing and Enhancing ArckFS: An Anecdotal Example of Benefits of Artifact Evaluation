We analyze and enhance Trio and ArckFS by Zhou et al. (SOSP 2023), high-performance NVM file system architecture and file system. A group of authors from KAIST initiated this study through a careful review of the paper and the released artifact, seeking to enhance the Trio work. Their analysis identifies (1) insufficient clarity in the paper on the handling of multi-inode operations, and (2) several implementation bugs in ArckFS that cause occasional operation failures or potential crash inconsistencies during inode creation. Through close collaboration between the KAIST and Trio authors, we have enhanced the Trio work. (1) We clarify a few relevant rules for ArckFS to handle multi-inode operations. (2) We develop patches for the identified bugs, which essentially maintain the performance claims made in the Trio paper. Our study highlights the crucial role of artifact evaluation in systems research and its potential benefits.
