Cloud service providers increasingly adopt SmartNICs to offload data-plane services (e.g., DPDK and SPDK) and control-plane tasks (such as disk and NIC initialization). Our analysis of production environments reveals that data-plane services statically provision CPUs for peak load, resulting in 67.5% idle CPU cycles during 99% of their runtime in IaaS clouds, leading to wasted CPU resources. On the other hand, control-plane tasks fail to meet critical Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as virtual machine startup time. Unfortunately, achieving control-plane SLO improvements through co-scheduling with idle data-plane services remains highly challenging, due to the combined effects of intrinsic scheduling latency and the substantial architectural complexity inherent to control-plane ecosystems. We present Tai Chi, a hardware and software co-designed scheduler that coordinates control-plane tasks and dataplane services through a SmartNIC-accelerated hybrid virtualization. This hybrid framework unifes physical and virtual CPUs within a single OS while providing native inter-process communication semantics among all tasks. By achieving microsecond-scale scheduling precision, it reduces control-plane operation latency by 3.1× (e.g., VM startup) while maintaining data-plane SLO compliance, imposes negligible scheduling overhead, and requires zero code modifications to legacy control-plane systems. Its cross-platform SmartNIC compatibility enables seamless and transparent deployment in the production environment, demonstrating compelling advantages over prior solutions in hyperscale cloud infrastructure.
