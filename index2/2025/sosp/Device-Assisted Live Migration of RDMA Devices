Recently, we have seen growing pressure to move highperformance workloads, such as HPC and AI, to cloud environments that offer more affordable and manageable infrastructure. These workloads require direct access to RDMA devices for high-performance communication. Device passthrough, however, violates the decoupling between the guest OS and the underlying hardware, making Live Migration (LM) extremely challenging [29, 38, 40, 42, 48]. This paper presents a method for migrating a collection of directly interacting hardware devices in a manner that is transparent to both the VM and its network peers. We propose a device-assisted solution that includes (a) a generic device-hypervisor interface, (b) the design and implementation of LM support for the NVIDIA ConnectX family of network adapters, and (c) a novel scheme to quiesce direct communication over the memory fabric (e.g., PCIe). We demonstrate transparent migration of HPC and AI workloads in accelerated virtual environments. Our approach incurs no runtime overhead or performance degradation after migration and achieves sub-second downtimes even for VMs with high RDMA resource utilization.
