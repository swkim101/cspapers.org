Memory scalability has emerged as a critical bottleneck in virtualized cloud environments. Tiered memory architectures that combine limited fast memory with abundant slower memory offer a promising solution, but existing hypervisor-based approaches suffer from significant performance penalties. We present Demeter, introducing a paradigm shift through guest-delegated tiered memory management based on two key insights: (1) delegation to guests eliminates both expensive access tracking at the hypervisor level and frequent TLB flushes that severely degrade memory virtualization performance under two-dimensional address translation, and (2) Processor Event-Based Sampling, which cannot be effectively utilized by hypervisor-based solutions, remains fully functional and highly efficient when properly leveraged within the guest. Building on these insights, Demeter designs an efficient range-based tiered memory management scheme in guest virtual address space to preserve locality information and employs a double balloon-based provisioning mechanism that maintains cloud elasticity while enabling vendor-specific QoS control. Our evaluation with seven real-world workloads across DRAM+PMEM and DRAM+CXL.mem configurations demonstrates that Demeter improves performance by up to 2× compared to existing hypervisor-based approaches and by 28% on average compared to the next best guest-based alternative. Our implementation is fully open source and publicly available at Zenodo.
