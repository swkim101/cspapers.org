Modern OS kernels, such as Linux, employ the eBPF subsystem to enable user space to extend kernel functionality. To ensure safety, an in-kernel verifier statically analyzes these extensions; however, its imprecise analysis frequently results in the erroneous rejection of safe extensions, exposing a critical tension between the precision and computational complexity of the verifier that limits kernel extensibility. We propose a proof-guided abstraction refinement technique that significantly enhances the verifier's precision while preserving low kernel space complexity. Rather than incorporating sophisticated analysis (e.g., via new abstract domains) directly into the verifier, our key insight is to decouple the complex reasoning to user space while bridging the gap through formal proofs. Upon encountering uncertainties, the verifier initiates an abstraction refinement procedure rather than rejecting the extension. As the refinement involves nontrivial reasoning, the verifier simply delineates the task and delegates it to user space. A formal proof is produced externally, which the verifier subsequently checks in linear time before adopting the refined abstraction. Consequently, our approach achieves high precision via user space reasoning while confining kernel space operations to an efficient proof check. Evaluation results show that our technique enables the verifier to accept 403 out of 512 real-world eBPF programs that were previously rejected erroneously, paving the way for more reliable and flexible kernel extensions.
