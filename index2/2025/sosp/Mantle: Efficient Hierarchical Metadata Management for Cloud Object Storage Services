Cloud Object Storage Services (COSSs) are the primary storage backend in the cloud, supporting large-scale analytics and ML workloads that frequently access deep object paths and update metadata concurrently. However, current COSS architectures incur costly multi-round lookups and high directory contention, delaying job execution. Prior optimizations, largely designed for distributed file systems (with least adoption in clouds), do not apply due to COSS-specific constraints like stateless proxies and limited APIs. Mantle is a new COSS metadata service for modern cloud workloads. It adopts a two-layer architecture: a scalable, sharded database (TafDB) shared across namespaces and a per-namespace, single-server IndexNode consolidating lightweight directory metadata. With a fine-grained division of metadata and responsibility, Mantle supports up to 10 billion objects or directories in a single namespace and achieves 1.8 million lookups per second through scalable execution of single-RPC lookups on IndexNode. It also delivers up to 58K directory updates per second under high contention by integrating out-of-place delta updates in TafDB and offloading loop detection for cross-directory renames to IndexNode, both effectively eliminating coordination bottlenecks. Compared to the metadata services of Tectonic, InfiniFS and LocoFS, Mantle reduces metadata latency by 6.6-99.1% and improves throughput by 0.07-115.00×. With data access enabled, it shortens job completion times by 63.3–93.3% for interactive Spark analytics and 38.5–47.7% for AI-driven audio preprocessing tasks. Mantle has been deployed on Baidu Object Storage (BOS) for over 2 years, a service offered by Baidu Canghai Storage.
