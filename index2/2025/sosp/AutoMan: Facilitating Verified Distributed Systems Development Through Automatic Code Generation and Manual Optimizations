Developing correct and performant distributed systems is notoriously challenging due to their complexity and scale. There are two main approaches to addressing correctness issues that stem from their complexity: (i) formal verification, and (ii) automatic compilation of specifications to implementations. The former provides machine-checked correctness guarantees along with good performance but requires substantial expert effort. In contrast, the latter can reduce developer effort, though often at the expense of rigorous correctness guarantees. In this paper, we design, develop, and evaluate the AutoMan workflow, which makes developing distributed systems with refinement-based formal verification techniques more accessible and practical for both experts and developers. AutoMan achieves this by automatically generating implementations and their corresponding verification obligations from formal system specifications. This is accomplished without placing trust in the code generator and without sacrificing end-to-end correctness or performance. AutoMan's use of refinement-based verification methodology for ensuring soundness allows hand-tuned performance-critical code and automatically generated code to harmoniously co-exist without jeopardizing end-to-end correctness guarantees. The effectiveness of AutoMan is demonstrated through the reimplementation of Multi-Paxos, PBFT, a sharded Key-Value store, and CausalMesh following the AutoMan methodology. In all cases, the use of AutoMan substantially reduced development effort (e.g., 70%-97% for Multi-Paxos), while the resulting systems maintained robust efficiency and correctness.
