This paper presents Tiga, a new design for geo-replicated and scalable transactional databases such as Google Spanner. Tiga aims to commit transactions within 1 wide-area roundtrip time, or 1 WRTT, for a wide range of scenarios, while maintaining high throughput with minimal computational overhead. Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both strictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round. It uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each a future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers before their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated timestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed and proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path, committing in 1.5–2 WRTTs. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Tiga can commit more transactions at 1-WRTT latency, and incurs much less throughput overhead. Evaluation results show that Tiga outperforms all baselines, achieving 1.3–7.2× higher throughput and 1.4–4.6× lower latency.
