—Matter is emerging as an IoT industry–unifying standard, aiming to enhance the interoperability among diverse smart home products, enabling them to work securely and seamlessly together. With many popular IoT vendors increasingly supporting Matter in consumer IoT products, we perform a systematic study to investigate how and whether vendors can integrate Matter securely into IoT systems and how well Matter as a standard supports vendors’ secure integration. By analyzing Matter development model in the wild, we reveal a new kind of design flaw in user-facing Matter control capabilities and interfaces, called UMCCI flaws, which are exploitable vulnerabilities in the design space and seriously jeopardize necessary control and surveillance capabilities of Matter-enabled devices for IoT users. Therefore we built an automatic tool called UMCCI Checker, enhanced by the large-language model in UI analysis, which enables automatically detecting UMCCI flaws without relying on real IoT devices. Our tool assisted us with studying and performing proof-of-concept attacks on 11 real Matter devices of 8 popular vendors to confirm that the UMCCI flaws are practical and common. We reported UMCCI flaws to related vendors, which have been acknowledged by CSA, Apple, Tuya, Aqara, etc. To help CSA and vendors better understand and avoid security flaws in developing and integrating IoT standards like Matter, we identify two categories of root causes and propose immediate fix recommendations.
