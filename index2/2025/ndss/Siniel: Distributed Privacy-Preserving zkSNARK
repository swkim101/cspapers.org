—Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARK) is a powerful cryptographic primitive, in which a prover convinces a verifier that a given statement is true without leaking any additional information. However, existing zkSNARKs suffer from high computation overhead in the proof generation. This limits the applications of zkSNARKs, such as private payments, private smart contracts, and anonymous credentials. Private delegation has become a prominent way to accelerate proof generation. In this work, we propose Siniel, an efficient private delegation framework for zkSNARKs constructed from polynomial interactive oracle proof (PIOP) and polynomial commitment scheme (PCS). Our protocol allows a computationally limited prover (a.k.a. delegator) to delegate its expensive prover computation to several workers without leaking any information about the private witness. Most importantly, compared with the recent work EOS (USENIX’23), the state-of-the-art zkSNARK prover
