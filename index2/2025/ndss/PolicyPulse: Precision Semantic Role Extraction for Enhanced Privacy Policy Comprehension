â€”The effectiveness of natural language privacy policies continues to be clouded by concerns surrounding their readability, ambiguity, and accessibility. Despite multiple design alternatives proposed over the years, natural language policies are still the primary format for organizations to communicate privacy practices to users. Current NLP techniques are often drawn towards generating high-level overviews, or specialized towards a single aspect of consumer privacy communication; the flexibility to apply them for multiple tasks is missing. To this aid, we present PolicyPulse, an information extraction pipeline designed to process privacy policies into usable formats. PolicyPulse employs a specialized XLNet classifier, and leverages a BERT-based model for semantic role labeling to extract phrases from policy sentences, while maintaining the semantic relations between predicates and their arguments. Our classification model was trained on 13 , 946 manually annotated semantic frames, and achieves a F1-score of 0 . 97 on identifying privacy practices communicated using clauses within a sentence. We emphasize the versatility of PolicyPulse through prototype applications to support requirement-driven policy presentations, question-answering systems, and privacy preference checking.
