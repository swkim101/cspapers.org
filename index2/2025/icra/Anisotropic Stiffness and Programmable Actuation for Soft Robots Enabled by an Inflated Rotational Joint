Soft robots are known for their ability to perform tasks with great adaptability, enabled by their distributed, non-uniform stiffness and actuation. Bending is the most fundamental motion for soft robot design, but creating robust, and easy-to-fabricate soft bending joint with tunable properties remains an active problem of research. In this work, we demonstrate an inflatable actuation module for soft robots with a defined bending plane enabled by forced partial wrinkling. This lowers the structural stiffness in the bending direction, with the final stiffness easily designed by the ratio of wrinkled and unwrinkled regions. We show the stiffness properties of the actuation module through a first-principle model validated by experimental characterization, and demonstrate the module's ability to maintain the kinematic constraint over a large range of loading conditions. We illustrate how these properties give the potential for complex actuation in a soft continuum robot and for decoupling actuation force and efficiency from load capacity. The module provides a novel method for embedding intelligent actuation into soft pneumatic robots.
