Tactile sensing and the manipulation of delicate objects are critical challenges in robotics. This study presents a vision-based magnetic-actuated whisker array sensor that integrates these functions. The sensor features eight whiskers arranged circularly, supported by an elastomer membrane and actuated by electromagnets and permanent magnets. A camera tracks whisker movements, enabling high-resolution tactile feedback. The sensor's performance was evaluated through object classification and grasping experiments. In the classification experiment, the sensor approached objects from four directions and accurately identified five distinct objects with a classification accuracy of 99.17% using a Multi-Layer Perceptron model. In the grasping experiment, the sensor tested configurations of eight, four, and two whiskers, achieving the highest success rate of 87% with eight whiskers. These results highlight the sensor's potential for precise tactile sensing and reliable manipulation.
