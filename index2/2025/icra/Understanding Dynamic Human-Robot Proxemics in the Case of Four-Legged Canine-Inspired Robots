The integration of humanoid and animal-shaped robots into specialized domains, such as healthcare, multiterrain operations, and psychotherapy, necessitates a deep understanding of proxemics-the study of spatial behavior that governs effective human-robot interactions. Unlike traditional robots in manufacturing or logistics, these robots must navigate complex human environments where maintaining appropriate physical and psychological distances is crucial for seamless interaction. This study explores the application of proxemics in human-robot interactions, focusing specifically on quadruped robots, which present unique challenges and opportunities due to their lifelike movement and form. Utilizing a motion capture system, we examine how different interaction postures of a canine robot influence human participants' proxemic behavior in dynamic scenarios. By capturing and analyzing position and orientation data, this research aims to identify key factors that affect proxemic distances and inform the design of socially acceptable robots. The findings underscore the importance of adhering to human psychological and physical distancing norms in robot design, ensuring that autonomous systems can coexist harmoniously with humans.
