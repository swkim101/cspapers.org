The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that cooptimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reducedorder geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.
