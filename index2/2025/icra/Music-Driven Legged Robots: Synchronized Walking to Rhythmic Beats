We address the challenge of effectively controlling the locomotion of legged robots by incorporating precise frequency and phase characteristics, which is often ignored in locomotion policies that do not account for the periodic nature of walking. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a low-level phase tracker, oscillators, and a high-level phase modulator. This controller allows quadruped robots to walk in a natural manner that is synchronized with external musical rhythms. Our method generates diverse gaits across different frequencies and achieves real-time synchronization with music in the physical world. This research establishes a foundational framework for enabling real-time execution of accurate rhythmic motions in legged robots. The video and code are available at https://music-walker.github.io/.
