This paper presents the addition of two models for added mass to the fluid-field spring-loaded inverted pendulum (FF-SLIP) Model for legged swimming. The relative ability of these models to capture the increased fluid forces due to virtual mass displacement is evaluated using a two-legged swimming robot, Tadpole. We show that a simple addition to our reduced-order model can predict fluid-leg interaction forces while remaining computationally efficient.
