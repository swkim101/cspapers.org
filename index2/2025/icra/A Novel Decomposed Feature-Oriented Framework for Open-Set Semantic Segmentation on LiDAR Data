Semantic segmentation is a key technique that enables mobile robots to understand and navigate surrounding environments autonomously. However, most existing works focus on segmenting known objects, overlooking the identification of unknown classes, which is common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented framework for open-set semantic segmentation on LiDAR data, capable of identifying unknown objects while retaining the ability to classify known ones. We design a decomposed dual-decoder network to simultaneously perform closed-set semantic segmentation and generate distinctive features for unknown objects. The network is trained with multi-objective loss functions to capture the characteristics of known and unknown objects. Using the extracted features, we introduce an anomaly detection mechanism to identify unknown objects. By integrating the results of close-set semantic segmentation and anomaly detection, we achieve effective feature-driven LiDAR open-set semantic segmentation. Evaluations on both SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
