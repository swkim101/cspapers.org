Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) models often centralize skeleton data, increasing significant privacy concerns. To address this, decentralized training models for SAR have been advanced, particularly using federated learning (FL), a research area of considerable value with wide-ranging applications, including human-robot interaction, camera-enabled devices, and security surveillance. However, FL-based SAR faces the challenge of substantial accuracy degradation due to data poisoning attacks; thus, it requires the identification of malicious clients. This paper introduces an innovative approach for detecting data poisoning attacks in federated SAR, called FedDet. The method involves creating prototypes of perspective transform and exchanging these matrices between the clients and server to identify the malicious client. Additionally, a prototype-guided attack detector is de-veloped, incorporating spatiotemporal matching to analyze the correlation between prototype skeleton data. Experimental results on FL frameworks and SAR models demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models. Our code is available at https://github.com/alsgur0720/federated-detection.
