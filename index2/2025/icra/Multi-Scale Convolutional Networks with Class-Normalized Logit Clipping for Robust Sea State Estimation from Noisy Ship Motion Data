Autonomous ships utilize automation systems to achieve unmanned navigation, driving innovation in maritime transportation. However, sea conditions, influenced by dynamic factors such as wave height, wind speed, and ocean currents, present a challenge in accurately assessing these conditions. Traditional classification models often assume accurate labels, but noisy labels are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as noise sample filtering or loss function adjustment, have limited applicability and poor generalization when dealing with complex sea condition data. To address this issue, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network model. The model's feature extraction module uses deep representation learning to capture latent patterns in the data, and a loss function is designed to mitigate the impact of outliers. The integration of these components allows the model to perform accurate classification even in the presence of noisy labels. Extensive experiments on public and sea condition datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating that the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and holds great promise for practical applications.
