Simulation is an indispensable tool in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offering an efficient and safe alternative to road testing. An outstanding challenge with simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework CaDRE, to generate realistic, diverse, and controllable safetycritical scenarios. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world scenarios, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and highquality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning (RL) and sampling-based methods.
