Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, real-world image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the field.
