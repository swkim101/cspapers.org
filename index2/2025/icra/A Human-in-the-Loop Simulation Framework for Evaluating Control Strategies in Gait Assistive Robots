As the global population ages, effective rehabilitation and mobility aids will become increasingly critical. Gait assistive robots are promising solutions, but designing adaptable controllers for various impairments poses a significant challenge. This paper presented a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation framework tailored specifically for gait assistive robots, addressing unique challenges posed by passive support systems. We incorporated a realistic physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) model to enable a quantitative evaluation of robot control strategies, highlighting the performance of a speed-adaptive controller compared to a conventional PID controller in maintaining compliance and reducing gait distortion. We assessed the accuracy of the simulated interactions against that of the real-world data and revealed discrepancies in the adaptation strategies taken by the human and their effect on the human's gait. This work underscored the potential of HITL simulation as a versatile tool for developing and fine-tuning personalized control policies for various users.
