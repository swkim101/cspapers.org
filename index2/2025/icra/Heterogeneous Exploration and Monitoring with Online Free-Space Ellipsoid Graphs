This paper proposes a heterogeneous teaming solution to the problem of target discovery and monitoring in unknown, non-convex environments. The team consists of two types of agents: agile agents with sensors capable of mapping their surroundings and slower agents that are capable of monitoring or servicing discovered targets. We propose an exploration algorithm that utilizes the IRIS algorithm to generate a graph decomposition from collision free ellipses contained within the environment. This graph is passed to the monitoring agents who execute polynomial complexity assignment and touring algorithms to generate high quality path plans which service all discovered targets. Our algorithmic structure allows the team to solve the problems of exploration, target discovery, assignment, and monitoring within unknown, non-convex environments efficiently using limited information. The performance of our proposed method is verified through batch simulations and complexity analysis.
