Most birds in nature rely on jumping for takeoff. Flapping-Wing Robots can flap and fly like birds but require an operator to take off, which are unable to generate sufficient lift to maintain flight at a low airspeed and must accelerate to take-off speed in a short time. It poses a challenge for the design of the jumping mechanism. This study is inspired by the jump-takeoff of birds and designs a simple and lightweight jumping leg, which is capable of storing and releasing energy with only one degree of freedom. In addition, a prototype was developed and tested, with a wingspan of 2 meters and a mass of 1.6 kilograms, accelerating to 4 m/s in 52 ms by jumping, achieving the jumping take-off from the ground.
