Autonomous driving necessitates the ability to reason about future interactions between traffic agents and to make informed evaluations for planning. This paper introduces the Gen-Drive framework, which shifts from the traditional prediction and deterministic planning framework to a generation-then-evaluation planning paradigm. The framework employs a behavior diffusion model as a scene generator to produce diverse possible future scenarios, thereby enhancing the capability for joint interaction reasoning. To facilitate decision-making, we propose a scene evaluator (reward) model, trained with pairwise preference data collected through VLM assistance, thereby reducing human workload and enhancing scalability. Furthermore, we utilize an RL fine-tuning framework to improve the generation quality of the diffusion model, rendering it more effective for planning tasks. We conduct training and closed-loop planning tests on the nuPlan dataset, and the results demonstrate that employing such a generation-then-evaluation strategy outperforms other learning-based approaches. Additionally, the fine-tuned generative driving policy shows significant enhancements in planning performance. We further demonstrate that utilizing our learned reward model for evaluation or RL fine-tuning leads to better planning performance compared to relying on human-designed rewards.
