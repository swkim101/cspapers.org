Nonlinear compliant actuators are being increasingly used in human-robot interaction scenarios due to their inherent flexibility. However, a limitation is that nonlinear hysteresis exists, which will degrade the force/torque tracking performance if the hysteresis is not modeled accurately. Moreover, the existing methods are difficult to deal with the multi-loop asymmetry hysteresis. In this work, we present a novel modeling method, in which the hysteresis curves are decoupled into nonlinear reference lines and symmetrical hysteresis loops. A hybrid hysteresis model based on power function and Maxwellslip model is then developed to fit the nonlinear reference lines and symmetrical hysteresis loops respectively. Experiments were conducted on a nonlinear compliant actuator and the results show that the root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) of the hysteresis model decreases by 24.4% when compared with the Maxwellslip based hysteresis model.
