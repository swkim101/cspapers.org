There are many ways for a gripper to estimate the forces between its fingers. If powered by direct-drive brushless motors, then one technique is to measure their current. This is not the most accurate technique, but it is simple, keeps the sensor remote, and requires no new components. The estimation involves multiplying current signals through by the torque constant and the inverse transpose of the Jacobian. The Jacobian either amplifies the signal from fingertip force to motor current (at the cost of tip force production), or diminishes it (with the gain of tip force production), indicating an inherent trade-off. However, the Jacobian is a function of configuration, and for any workspace point there are multiple configurations (multiple inverse kinematics solutions), therefore a selection of Jacobian exists. For a given workspace point, the number of Jacobian choices is just a few, but these choices can be designed (through dimensional synthesis) to overcome the trade-off. The problem can be framed as velocity ellipse synthesis over multiple output modes. In this work, we conduct optimal synthesis to compute a new gripper design. The gripper was built and tested. It transitions between two different modes: sense mode and grip mode. Sense mode can sense forces 3 times smaller than grip mode. Grip mode can exert forces 4 times greater than sense mode.
