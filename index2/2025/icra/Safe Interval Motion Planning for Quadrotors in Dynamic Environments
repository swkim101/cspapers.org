Trajectory generation in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge for quadrotors, particularly due to the non-convexity in the spatial-temporal domain. Many existing methods either assume simplified static environments or struggle to produce optimal solutions in real-time. In this work, we propose an efficient safe interval motion planning framework for navigation in dynamic environments. A safe interval refers to a time window during which a specific configuration is safe. Our approach addresses trajectory generation through a two-stage process: a front-end graph search step followed by a back-end gradient-based optimization. We ensure completeness and optimality by constructing a dynamic connected visibility graph and incorporating low-order dynamic bounds within safe intervals and temporal corridors. To avoid local minima, we propose a Uniform Temporal Visibility Deformation (UTVD) for the complete evaluation of spatial-temporal topological equivalence. We represent trajectories with B-Spline curves and apply gradient-based optimization to navigate around static and moving obstacles within spatial-temporal corridors. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that our method can achieve a success rate of over $\mathbf{9 5 \%}$ in environments with different density levels, exceeding the performance of other approaches, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in highly dynamic environments.
