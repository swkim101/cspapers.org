As scientific research in chemistry, materials science, and applied sciences becomes increasingly complex and data-driven, there is a growing need for efficient, scalable, and flexible automation to accelerate discoveries and reduce human burden and error in laboratories. We introduce the Experiment Orchestration System (EOS), an open-source software framework and runtime offering a comprehensive foundation for laboratory automation. EOS offers an extensible framework allowing users to define labs, devices, tasks, experiments, and optimization criteria using YAML and Python plugins, and also offers a distributed runtime for managing and executing automation. EOS has a central orchestrator that communicates with and controls laboratory equipment to execute tasks. EOS implements autonomous experiment campaigns, parameter optimization, task scheduling, result aggregation, and more. By providing a common infrastructure for laboratory automation, EOS aims to reduce automation implementation barriers and accelerate discoveries in science laboratories.
