The seafloor is a complex environment and it is challenging to conduct detailed mapping, soil composition sampling, and habitat characterization missions in this benthic region. As a step toward overcoming these challenges, we present a quadruped robot capable of walking on the seafloor and maneuvering via midfluid swimming. SELQIE, the Seafloor Environment Legged Quadruped Intelligent Explorer, is capable of walking underwater at speeds up to $0.2 ~\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, swimming at over $0.16 ~\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, and transitioning between modes. We also introduce a path planning algorithm that can account for both swimming and walking gaits to efficiently navigate around or over obstacles, and demonstrate the robot executing such a multi-modal trajectory.
