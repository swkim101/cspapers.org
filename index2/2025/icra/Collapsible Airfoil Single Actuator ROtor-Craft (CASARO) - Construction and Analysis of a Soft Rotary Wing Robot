In this paper, a soft rotary wing robot capable of flight and control is presented. The Collapsible Airfoil Single Actuator ROtor-craft (CASARO) is a single actuator monocopter that derives its geometric properties from the Samara seed. CASARO achieves better flight efficiency, lift, and handling ergonomics by reducing its overall volume by 91.7% when collapsed and stowed. Unlike conventional rotorcraft, CASARO uses a non-rigid fabric wing to produce lift in flight. It utilizes the robot's rotational velocity to maintain tension within its fabric and airframe, providing adequate lift during its hover state. The conception, design, construction, and control of the soft monowing are demonstrated, including its capability to reduce its footprint with its soft fabric construction. To analyze the flight dynamics of CASARO, the craft is flown indoors autonomously, tracking its wing surface, craft body attitude, and position with various step inputs to observe different wing dynamics. CASARO is also capable of being deployed outdoors for real-life human-operated flight.
