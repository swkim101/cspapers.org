To address complex mission tasks, multirotors benefit from in-flight reconfiguration that enhances their morphological adaptability. This paper presents the Center-Driven Scissor Extendable Airframe (CDSEA), a novel one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) morphing airframe designed to replace traditional fixed-size airframes. The CDSEA allows a quadrotor to achieve significant morphological changes during flight, with rotors deploying radially from a central point. This capability facilitates substantial variations in footprint radius and ensures smooth transitions. The paper details the mechanical design, as well as kinematic and dynamic analyses, and discusses the actuator selection strategy for the CDSEA. Experimental results with a prototype demonstrate that the CDSEA achieves a footprint-radius deformation ratio of 2.5 and a morphing time of 0.3 seconds, surpassing existing solutions. Additionally, the design improves obstacle avoidance and wind resistance. These results underscore the CDSEA's potential as an advanced solution for enhancing UAV adaptive navigation performance in complex environments.
