Classical manipulator motion planners work across different robot embodiments [1]. However they plan on a pre-specified static environment representation, and are not scalable to unseen dynamic environments. Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) [2] are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as they incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies directly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can successfully plan across different environments [3]. However none of the existing NMPs generalize across robot embodiments. In this paper we propose Cross-Embodiment Motion Policy (XMoP), a neural policy for learning to plan over a distribution of manipulators. XMoP implicitly learns to satisfy kinematic constraints for a distribution of robots and zero-shot transfers the planning behavior to unseen robotic manipulators within this distribution. We achieve this generalization by formulating a whole-body control policy that is trained on planning demonstrations from over three million procedurally sampled robotic manipulators in different simulated environments. Despite being completely trained on synthetic embodiments and environments, our policy exhibits strong sim-to-real generalization across manipulators with different kinematic variations and degrees of freedom with a single set of frozen policy parameters. We evaluate XMoP on 7 commercial manipulators and show successful cross-embodiment motion planning, achieving an average 70 % success rate on baseline benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate sim-to-real deployment on two unseen manipulators solving novel planning problems across three real-world domains even with dynamic obstacles.
