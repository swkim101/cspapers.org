Spherical Modular Self-reconfigurable Robots (SMSRs) have been popular in recent years. Their Self-reconfigurable nature allows them to adapt to different en-vironments and tasks, and achieve what a single module could not achieve. To collaborate with each other, relative localization between each module and assembly is crucial. Existing relative localization methods either have low accuracy, which is unsuit-able for short-distance collaborations, or are designed for fixed-shape robots, whose visual features remain static over time. This paper proposes the first visual relative localization method for SMSRs. We first detect and identify individual modules of SMSRs, and adopt visual tracking to improve the detection and identification robustness. Using an optimization-based method, tracking result is then fused with odometry to estimate the relative pose between assemblies. To deal with the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we adopt semi-definite relaxation to transform it into a convex form. The proposed method is validated and analysed in real-world experiments. The overall localization performance and the performance under time-varying configuration are evaluated. The result shows that the relative position estimation accuracy reaches 2%, and the orientation estimation accuracy reaches 6.64°, and that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.
