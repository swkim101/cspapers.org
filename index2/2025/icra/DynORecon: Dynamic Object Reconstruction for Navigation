This paper presents DynORecon, a Dynamic Object Reconstruction system that leverages the information provided by Dynamic SLAM to simultaneously generate a volumetric map of observed moving entities while estimating free space to support navigation. By capitalising on the motion estimations provided by Dynamic SLAM, DynORecon continuously refines the representation of dynamic objects to eliminate residual artefacts from past observations and incrementally reconstructs each object, seamlessly integrating new observations to capture previously unseen structures. Our system is highly efficient (~20 FPS) and produces accurate (~10 cm) object reconstructions using simulated and real-world outdoor datasets.
