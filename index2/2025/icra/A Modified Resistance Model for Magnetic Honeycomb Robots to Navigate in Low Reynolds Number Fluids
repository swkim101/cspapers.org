In recent years, magnetically controlled microrobots have garnered significant attention. This paper presents the H-robot, a self-designed microrobot featuring an innovative structure. The H-robot features a honeycomb porous spherical design specifically engineered to enhance cargo capacity. A new dynamic model for this structure has been developed for low Reynolds number fluid environments, along with a robust backstepping sliding mode control (RBSMC) strategy. Experiments were conducted in a calibrated magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator to achieve precise motion control. The results demonstrate that the H-robot accurately tracks standard trajectories, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of $9.09 \times 10^{-4} \mathbf{~ m}$ for the Number-8 path and $8.29 \times 10^{-4} \mathbf{~ m}$ for the S-shaped path. Additionally, the proposed resistance model enhances tracking accuracy by 73.61% compared to traditional models, effectively adjusting the dynamic behavior of the H-robot in low Reynolds number fluids and significantly improving its motion performance. Finally, path planning experiments in a maze demonstrate the H-robot's ability to navigate and avoid obstacles.
