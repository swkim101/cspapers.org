The Real2Sim2Real (R2S2R) paradigm is critical for advancing robotic learning. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with both spatial representations and their associated physics attributes in the Real2Sim stage. We propose a Real2Sim pipeline to generate digital assets enabling high-fidelity simulation. We design a hybrid repre-sentation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the representation of robotic arms in digital assets. This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and the Gaussian model. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment through mesh geometry. With the digital assets, we propose a fully manipulable Real2Sim pipeline that standardizes coordinate systems and scales, ensuring the seamless integration of multiple components. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we include datasets covering various robotic manipulation tasks with their mesh reconstructions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in realistic rendering and mesh reconstruction quality for robotic applications. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available at robostudioapp.com.
