Autonomous exploration in large environments often leads to inefficient long backtracking, as distant targets are prioritized over closer ones. In this work, a hierarchical planning method is proposed, which employs region partitioning to systematically address the aforementioned issue. The space is dynamically partitioned at a coarse resolution, and as exploration progresses, regions with sufficient known areas are further subdivided to locate unknown areas more precisely. A utility function considering unknown area size, travel distance and sequence similarity is used, and the simulated annealing algorithm generates a subregion sequence for global guidance. Within each subregion, a linear acceleration model helps select target points. This method reduces computational load and minimizes long-distance backtracking, enabling more efficient high-frequency planning. Extensive simulations and real-world tests show that our method significantly improves exploration efficiency compared to existing vision-based techniques.
