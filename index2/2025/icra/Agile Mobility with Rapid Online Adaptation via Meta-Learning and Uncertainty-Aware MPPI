Modern non-linear model-based controllers require an accurate physics model and model parameters to be able to control mobile robots at their limits. Also, due to surface slipping at high speeds, the friction parameters may continually change (like tire degradation in autonomous racing), and the controller may need to adapt rapidly. Many works derive a task-specific robot model with a parameter adaptation scheme that works well for the task but requires a lot of effort and tuning for each platform and task. In this work, we design a full model-learning-based controller based on meta pretraining that can very quickly adapt using few-shot dynamics data to any wheel-based robot with any model parameters, while also reasoning about model uncertainty. We demonstrate our results in small-scale numeric simulation, the large-scale Unity simulator, and on a medium-scale hardware platform with a wide range of settings. We show that our results are comparable to domain-specific well-engineered controllers, and have excellent generalization performance across all scenarios.
