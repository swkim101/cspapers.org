This paper introduces a novel method for controlling multirotor aerial robots connected by passive flexible elements. Despite the growing popularity of multirotor aerial robots, their real-world applications remain limited due to difficulties adapting to complex environments. Soft robotics, due to its inherent flexibility, offers a potential solution, although research on integrating flexible elements into aerial robots is still in the early stages. In this study, we propose control methods for a system where multiple aerial robots are interconnected with passive flexible elements. These robotic systems enhance adaptability, enabling tasks like object manipulation. We model the flexible parts using the piecewise constant strain (PCS) model, which allows for model-based closed-loop control and stabilizes various configurations of the system. Through simulations and experiments, we validated that the proposed method achieves both stable flight and flexible deformation. Notably, we succeeded in maintaining stable flight, which traditional methods could not achieve, and demonstrated both positional controllability and the ability of the flexible parts to bend dynamically during flight.
