Robotic weed removal in precision agriculture introduces a repetitive heterogeneous task planning (RHTP) challenge for a mobile manipulator. RHTP has two unique characteristics: 1) an observe-first-and-manipulate-later (OFML) temporal constraint that forces a unique ordering of two different tasks for each target and 2) energy savings from efficient task collocation to minimize unnecessary movements. RHTP can be framed as a stochastic renewal process. According to the Renewal Reward Theorem, the expected energy usage per task cycle is the long-run average. Traditional task and motion planning focuses on feasibility rather than optimality due to the unknown object and obstacle position prior to execution. However, the known target/obstacle distribution in precision agriculture allows minimizing the expected energy usage. For each instance in this renewal process, we first compute task space partition, a novel data structure that computes all possibilities of task multiplexing and its probabilities with robot reachability. Then we propose a region-based setcoverage problem to formulate the RHTP as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming. We have implemented and solved RHTP using Branch-and-Bound solver. Compared to a baseline in simulations based on real field data, the results suggest a significant improvement in path length, number of robot stops, overall energy usage, and number of replans.
