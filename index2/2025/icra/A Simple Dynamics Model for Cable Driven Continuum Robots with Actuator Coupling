The flexibility and dexterity of cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) make them well suited for intricate tasks such as minimally invasive surgery. However, the complexity of accurately modeling their dynamics has limited their broader adoption and effective control. Current models either oversimplify the dynamics by assuming quasi-static conditions or over complicate them, making real-time application challenging. Additionally, many existing models neglect the critical coupling between the robot's body and actuator dynamics, a factor essential for accurate control. In this paper, we propose a new minimal dynamics model for CDCRs that strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy. Our model captures the essential dynamics of both the robot and its actuators, providing a practical tool for control design. We also establish connections between our model and those used for other robotic systems, enabling the transfer of well-established control strategies to CDCRs. The model is validated through hardware experiments, demonstrating its ability to effectively address complex control challenges in CDCR applications.
