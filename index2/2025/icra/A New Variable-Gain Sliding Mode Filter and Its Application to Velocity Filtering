This paper proposes a new variable gain sliding mode filter augmented by variable windowing for achieving smooth and reactive response over a broad range of input frequencies. The proposed filter can be seen as a synergistic combination of Kikuuwe et al.'s [1] sliding mode filter with varying gain and sliding surfaces and a novel varying-length moving-window algorithm. In all schemes, the estimated input speed is employed for rendering the filter parameters between low and high settings. The discrete-time algorithm of the proposed filter does not suffer from chattering due to implicit (backward) Euler method. The effectiveness of the proposed filter in achieving better trade-off between noise attenuation and signal preservation is validated in both simulation and experimental scenarios by using the velocity signal obtained by differentiation of quantized position data.
