Online monocular 3D reconstruction has attracted widespread attention as it promotes the application of robots in interactive scenarios. Most existing methods focus on 1) real-time reconstruction, 2) accurate voxel featuring learning, and 3) effective voxel sparsification algorithm. To this end, 1) they adopt a coarse-to-fine pipeline, where all non-empty voxels are sent to the next level for refinement. However, this results in over-refinement of flat regions, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, 2) advanced methods focus on exploring view visibility but overlook the discriminability among visible views, which limits the representation of learned voxel features. Moreover, 3) existing sparsification algorithms struggle to distinguish detailed and empty voxels, resulting in either the loss of detailed voxels or the retention of empty voxels. To tackle these challenges, 1) we present Dynamic Detail Refinement (DDR) to allocate more voxels to detailed regions for refinement, which could alleviate the computational burden. Furthermore, 2) we propose Discriminability-Aware Fusion (DAF) to focus on discriminative views, which helps to capture accurate voxel features. In addition, 3) we propose Hierarchical Hybrid Sparsification (HHS) to balance global completeness and local refinement, which helps to preserve detailed voxels at hierarchical levels effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the representative ScanNet (V2) and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
