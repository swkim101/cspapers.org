Video object detection (VOD) of motile cells (e.g., bacteria and sperm) under microscopy is challenging due to motion blur, sporadic out-of-focus, and pose variations. Compared with VOD in generic scenes, the lower contrast and smaller color space of microscopy imaging further introduce feature overlap between the foreground objects and the background objects (e.g., impurity cells and contaminants). Transformer-based methods have achieved great success in the VOD of generic scenes by utilizing object queries to model the inner-frame objects and the inter-frame objects. However, the appearance overlap problem in microscopy video frames significantly compromises the inter-frame query aggregation by introducing background features into the object query. To tackle this challenge, this paper reports a static-dynamic query-based VOD network that treats object queries of the current video frame and reference video frames differently. Specifically, a two-stage framework is implemented that first generates high-quality object queries of reference frames with a static Transformer decoder pre-trained on a still image dataset. The network is then trained on a per-frame annotated dataset using a dynamic Transformer decoder to model the object queries of the current frame. A Reference Query Relation Module is further proposed to enhance the reference queries for more effective aggregation with the current query. Experiments on clinically collected biopsied sperm datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.
