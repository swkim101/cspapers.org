This paper introduces a motion planning approach for navigating in a dynamic environment. The path is represented using a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) to ensure smoothness, curvature continuity, and proper orientation by adjusting its parameters. A Differential Evolution algorithm optimizes the curve parameters and traversal speed at each replanning interval, taking into account speed limits, maximum curvature, and obstacles in the environment. A constraintbased on Velocity Obstacle (VO) ensures collision-free motion, considering bounds provided by lower-level controllers. The feasibility of the approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments with the Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadcopter.
