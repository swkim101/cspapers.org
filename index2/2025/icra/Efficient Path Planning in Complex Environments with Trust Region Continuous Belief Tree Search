Real-world applications of path planning must contend with complicated constraint and objective functions imposed by the surrounding operational and regulatory environment. Traditional methods such as PRM* and RRT* have asymptotic guarantees, but often struggle in practice with complex blackbox objective/constraint functions, especially in compute-limited situations. Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS) addresses these limitations by maintaining local estimates of the objective function in order to sample new nodes from continuous space, often giving high-quality solutions more quickly. However, CBTS requires careful tuning of a control duration parameter, which introduces a tradeoff between compute time and path cost/feasibility. In environments with complex costs and constraints, there may be no single control duration that gives good paths in short compute time. This paper proposes Trust Region CBTS (TR-CBTS), an extension of CBTS with an adaptive control duration parameter inspired by trust region methods. TR-CBTS adjusts control duration based on information from recently sampled candidate nodes, allowing longer control duration where possible to speed up compute time, and shortening control duration when precise navigation in environments with complex, unknown constraint and objective functions. We show TR-CBTS outperforms existing comparable planners for a realistic robotic path planning application in autonomous ship routing.
