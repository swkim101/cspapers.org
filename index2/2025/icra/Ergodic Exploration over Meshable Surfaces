Robotic search and rescue, exploration, and inspection require trajectory planning across a variety of domains. A popular approach to trajectory planning for these types of missions is ergodic search, which biases a trajectory to spend time in parts of the exploration domain that are believed to contain more information. Most prior work on ergodic search has been limited to searching simple surfaces, like a 2D Euclidean plane or a sphere, as they rely on projecting functions defined on the exploration domain onto analytically obtained Fourier basis functions. In this paper, we extend ergodic search to any surface that can be approximated by a triangle mesh. The basis functions are approximated through finite element methods on a triangle mesh of the domain. We formally prove that this approximation converges to the continuous case as the mesh approximation converges to the true domain. We demonstrate that on domains where analytical basis functions are available (plane, sphere), the proposed method obtains equivalent results, and while on other domains (torus, bunny, wind turbine), the approach is versatile enough to still search effectively. Lastly, we also compare with an existing ergodic search technique that can handle complex domains and show that our method results in a higher quality exploration.
