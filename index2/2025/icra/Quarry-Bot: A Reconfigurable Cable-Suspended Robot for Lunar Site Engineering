This paper introduces Quarry-Bot, a Reconfigurable Cable-Suspended Robot developed to support the NASA Artemis program's efforts in preparing for the long-term colonization of the Moon and Mars. Quarry-Bot autonomously clears debris on the lunar surface, a key step in site preparation for future habitats and infrastructure. The system utilizes active control strategies, combined with the Moon's lower gravity, to perform underhand rock tosses as a scalable approach to extraterrestrial site preparation. Its reconfigurable structure, including motorized anchor points and a lightweight tripod design, adjusts cable tensions to generate swing motions for debris displacement. The system is driven by two Dynamixel MX-106 motors for movement and steering, along with a NEMA 17 stepper motor for cable adjustments. Simulations and experiments conducted under both Earth and lunar gravity conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies in achieving rock throws. Quarry-Bot reaches swing angles and projects rocks over distances that may support lunar site clearing and overall engineering purposes. The paper concludes by discussing potential areas for further system refinement, including adjustments for different terrain conditions and improved actuation strategies for lunar missions.
