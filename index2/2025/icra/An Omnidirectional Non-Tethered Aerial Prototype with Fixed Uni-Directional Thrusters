This paper presents the first worldwide functional prototype omnidirectional multi-rotor aerial vehicle with fixed uni-directional thrusters, with an on-board power source. An optimization algorithm computes the positions and orientations of the propellers in the body frame of the prototype to achieve the omnidirectional capability, while minimizing the platform's weight and the required thrust to hover at any orientation, in addition to other construction requirements. The effect of the aerodynamic interaction between the different propellers is identified experimentally, and the ensuing results are included in the optimization algorithm to avoid such interactions during flight. The prototype's performance is assessed in real experiments demonstrating the decoupling between the forces and moments of the drone, its ability to track concurrently independent positions and orientations, and its ability to hover at a fixed position while rotating.
