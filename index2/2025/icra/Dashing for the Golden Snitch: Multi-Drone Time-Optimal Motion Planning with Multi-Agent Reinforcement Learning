Recent innovations in autonomous drones have facilitated time-optimal flight in single-drone configurations, and enhanced maneuverability in multi-drone systems by applying optimal control and learning-based methods. However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network using multi-agent reinforcement learning for time-optimal multi-drone flight. To strike a balance between flight efficiency and collision avoidance, we introduce a soft collision-free mechanism inspired by optimization-based methods. By customizing PPO in a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) fashion, we unlock higher efficiency and stability in training while ensuring lightweight implementation. Extensive simulations show that, despite slight performance tradeoffs compared to single-drone systems, our multi-drone approach maintains near-time-optimal performance with a low collision rate. Real-world experiments validate our method, with two quadrotors using the same network as in simulation achieving a maximum speed of 13.65 m/s and a maximum body rate of 13.4 rad/s in a 5.5 m × 5.5 m × 2.0 m space across various tracks, relying entirely on onboard computation [video33https://youtu.be/KACuFMtGGpo][code44https://github.com/KafuuChikai/Dashing-for-the-Golden-Snitch-Multi-Drone-RL].
