We introduce One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning (ODIL), which enables dual-arm robots to learn precise and coordinated everyday tasks from just a single demonstration of the task. ODIL uses a new three-stage visual servoing (3-VS) method for precise alignment between the end-effector and target object, after which replay of the demonstration trajectory is sufficient to perform the task. This is achieved without requiring prior task or object knowledge, or additional data collection and training following the single demonstration. Furthermore, we propose a new dual-arm coordination paradigm for learning dual-arm tasks from a single demonstration. ODIL was tested on a real-world dual-arm robot, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six precise and coordinated tasks in both 4-DoF and 6-DoF settings, and showing robustness in the presence of distractor objects and partial occlusions.
