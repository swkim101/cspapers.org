Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used as control inputs for myoelectric exoskeletons. However, muscle fatigue, which can result from prolonged use or heavy loads, significantly affects muscle activation patterns, leading to reduced estimation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose an adversarial learning framework to enhance grip force estimation under fatigue conditions. The framework consists of three key components: a domain-invariant feature extractor to mitigate domain shifts between non-fatigue and fatigue states, a force estimator to predict grip forces from these domain-invariant features, and a domain discriminator to distinguish between the two domains. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset collected from eight participants performing gripping tasks under both non-fatigue and fatigue conditions, during which high-density EMG signals and grip forces were recorded simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrated that our method significantly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.264 to 0.127, outperforming a baseline model consisting of only the feature extractor and force estimator $(p < 0.01)$. Additionally, the proposed approach exhibited consistent performance across all participants, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. These findings suggest that the proposed adversarial learning framework effectively enhances grip force estimation accuracy under muscle fatigue, offering a promising solution for improving the reliability and usability of myoelectric exoskeletons.
