In this paper, we present ZSORN, a novel language-driven object-centric image representation for object retrieval and navigation task within complex scenes. We propose an object-centric image representation and corresponding losses for visual-language model (VLM) fine-tuning, which can handle complex object-level queries. In addition, we design a novel LLM-based augmentation and prompt templates for stability during training and zero-shot inference. We implement our method on Astro robot and deploy it in both simulated and real-world environments for zero-shot object navigation. We show that our proposed method can achieve an improvement of 1.38 - 13.38% in terms of text-to-image recall on different benchmark settings for the retrieval task. For object navigation, we show the benefit of our approach in simulation and real world, showing 5% and 16.67% improvement in terms of navigation success rate, respectively.
