Comparing graph-structured maps is a task of paramount importance in robotic exploration and cartography, but unfortunately the computational cost of the existing similarity measures, such as the graph edit distance (GED), is prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we introduce and characterize three new graph distance measures which satisfy the requirements for a metric. The first one, LogEig, computes the square root of the sum of the squared logarithms of the generalized eigenvalues of the shifted Laplacian matrices associated with the two graphs, while the second calculates the Bures distance between these positive definite matrices. The third distance, Rank, computes the rank of the difference of the graph shift operators associated with the two graphs, e.g. the adjacency or the Laplacian matrix. Examples and numerical experiments with graphs from a publicly-available dataset, show the accuracy and computational efficiency of the new metrics for 2D topological-map matching, compared to the GED. The effect of spectral sparsification on the new graph distance measures is examined as well.
