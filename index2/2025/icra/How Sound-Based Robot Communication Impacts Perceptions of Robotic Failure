One challenge in human-robot interaction is selecting communication methods that fit a given robotic system and avoid overpromising. For example, verbal speech provides a clear and easy-to-understand communication method, but can inflate expectations of robot abilities. Is verbal speech the ultimate option? Might other tactics provide similar advantages with fewer downsides? The presented work focuses on addressing these important questions by 1) quantifying any inflated opinions of robots that use verbal speech and 2) gathering perspectives on alternative nonverbal sound-based communication tactics (as a means to potentially shrink gaps between expected and actual robot performance). We conducted a within-subjects online study that varied robot communication modes in videos of successful and unsuccessful mock tasks by a modern commercial robot. Assessments of robot competence and trust after an observed robot failure were higher for verbal robots, but we observed less decline in competence and trust ratings due to the failure for a nonverbal robot using character-like sound (compared to a robot using verbal communication). Human-robot interaction practitioners can use our results to design effective and robust communication strategies for robots.
