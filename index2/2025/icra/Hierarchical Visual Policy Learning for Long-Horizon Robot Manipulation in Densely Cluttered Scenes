In this work, we focus on addressing the long-horizon packing tasks in densely cluttered scenes. Such tasks require policies to effectively manage severe occlusions among objects and continually produce precise actions based on visual observations. We propose a vision-based Hierarchical policy for Cluttered-scene Long-horizon Manipulation (HCLM). It employs a high-level policy and three options to select and instantiate three parameterized action primitives: push, pick, and place. We first train the two-stream pick and place options by behavior cloning (BC). Subsequently, we use hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to train the high-level policy and push option. During HRL, we propose a Spatially Extended Q-update (SEQ) to augment the updates for the push option and a Two-Stage Update Scheme (TSUS) to alleviate the non-stationary transition problem in updating the high-level policy. We demonstrate that HCLM significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and efficiency in diverse tasks both in simulation and real world. The ablation studies also validate the key roles of SEQ and TSUS in HRL.
