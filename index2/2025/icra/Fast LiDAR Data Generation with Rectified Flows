Building LiDAR generative models holds promise as powerful data priors for restoration, scene manipulation, and scalable simulation in autonomous mobile robots. In recent years, approaches using diffusion models have emerged, significantly improving training stability and generation quality. Despite their success, diffusion models require numerous iterations of running neural networks to generate high-quality samples, making the increasing computational cost a potential barrier for robotics applications. To address this challenge, this paper presents R2Flow, a fast and high-fidelity generative model for LiDAR data. Our method is based on rectified flows that learn straight trajectories, simulating data generation with significantly fewer sampling steps compared to diffusion models. We also propose an efficient Transformer-based model architecture for processing the image representation of LiDAR range and reflectance measurements. Our experiments on unconditional LiDAR data generation using the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both efficiency and quality.
