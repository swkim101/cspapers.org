Motion planning is a central challenge in robotics, with learning-based approaches gaining significant attention in recent years. Our work focuses on a specific aspect of these approaches: using machine-learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate whether robot configurations are collision free, an operation termed “collision detection”. Despite the growing popularity of these methods, there is a lack of theory supporting their efficiency and prediction accuracy. This is in stark contrast to the rich theoretical results of machine-learning methods in general and of SVMs in particular. Our work bridges this gap by analyzing the sample complexity of an SVM classifier for learning-based collision detection in motion planning. We bound the number of samples needed to achieve a specified accuracy at a given confidence level. This result is stated in terms relevant to robot motion-planning such as the system's clearance. Building on these theoretical results, we propose a collision-detection algorithm that can also provide statistical guarantees on the algorithm's error in classifying robot configurations as collision-free or not.
