After-action reviews (AARs) are professional discussions that help operators and teams enhance their task performance by analyzing completed missions with peers and professionals. Previous studies comparing different formats of AARs have focused mainly on human teams. However, the inclusion of robotic teammates brings along new challenges in understanding teammate intent and communication. Traditional AAR between human teammates may not be satisfactory for human-robot teams. To address this limitation, we propose a new training review (TR) tool, called the Virtual Spectator Interface (VSI), to enhance human-robot team performance and situational awareness (SA) in a simulated search mission. The proposed VSI primarily utilizes visual feedback to review subjects' behavior. To examine the effectiveness of VSI, we took elements from AAR to conduct our own TR, and designed a 1 $\times 3$ between-subjects experiment with experimental conditions: TR with (1) VSI, (2) screen recording, and (3) non-technology (only verbal descriptions). The results of our experiments demonstrated that the VSI did not result in significantly better team performance than other conditions. However, the TR with VSI led to more improvement in the subjects' SA over the other conditions.
