This paper explores the feasibility of using magnetoresponsive silicone as the primary mechanism for generating vibrotactile feedback in haptic interfaces. The distinctive feature of this research lies in the integration of magnetoresponsive silicone, a flexible material that responds to electromagnetic fields to produce localized vibrations. Preliminary experiments evaluate the performance of these actuators, focusing on their ability to produce controlled vibrations across a range of frequencies and amplitudes relevant to human tactile perception. Building on this foundation, we introduce the VibroFlex Pad, a haptic interface featuring a magnetoresponsive silicone sheet and an array of electromagnets. The VibroFlex Pad demonstrates its versatility in generating varied tactile effects and simulating dynamic wavelike movements across its surface. To assess the VibroFlex Pad's effectiveness, a user study was conducted, separately evaluating tactile accuracy, overall performance, and user comfort. The findings suggest that the VibroFlex Pad offers reliable and precise vibrotactile feedback, highlighting its potential to enhance wearable haptic technologies and improve the user experience in a variety of applications.
