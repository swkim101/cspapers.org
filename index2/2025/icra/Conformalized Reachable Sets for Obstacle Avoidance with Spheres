Safe motion planning algorithms are necessary for deploying autonomous robots in unstructured environments to prevent harm to humans and avoid damage to nearby objects. Generating these motion plans in real-time is also important to ensure that the robot can adapt to sudden changes in its environment. Many trajectory optimization methods introduce heuristics that balance safety and real-time performance, potentially increasing the risk of the robot colliding with its environment. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance With Spheres (CROWS). CROWS is a novel real-time, receding-horizon trajectory planner that generates probablistically-safe motion plans. Offline, CROWS learns a novel neural network-based representation of a sphere-based reachable set that overapproximates the swept volume of the robot's motion. CROWS then uses conformal prediction to compute a confidence bound that provides a probabilistic safety guarantee on the learned reachable set. At runtime, CROWS performs trajectory optimization to select a trajectory that is probabilstically-guaranteed to be collision-free. We demonstrate that CROWS outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods in solving challenging motion planning tasks in cluttered environments while remaining collision-free.
