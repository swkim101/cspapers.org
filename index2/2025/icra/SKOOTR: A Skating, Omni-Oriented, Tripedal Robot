In both animals and robots, locomotion capabilities are determined by the physical structure of the system. The majority of legged animals and robots are bilaterally symmetric, which facilitates locomotion with consistent headings and obstacle traversal, but leads to constraints in their turning ability. On the other hand, radially symmetric animals have demonstrated rapid turning abilities enabled by their omnidirectional body plans. Radially symmetric tripedal robots are able to turn instantaneously, but are commonly constrained by needing to change direction with every step, resulting in inefficient and less stable locomotion. Inspired by the radial symmetry and maneuverability of brittle stars and octopuses, we introduce a novel design for a tripedal robot that has both frictional and rolling contacts. Additionally, a freely rotating central sphere provides an added contact point so the robot can retain a stable tripod base of support while lifting and pushing with any one of its legs. The SKating, OmniOriented, Tripedal Robot (SKOOTR) is more versatile and stable than existing tripedal robots. It is capable of multiple forward gaits, multiple turning maneuvers, obstacle traversal, and stair climbing. SKOOTR has been designed to facilitate customization for diverse applications: it is fully open-source, is constructed with 3D printed or off-the-shelf parts, and costs approximately $ 500 USD to build.
