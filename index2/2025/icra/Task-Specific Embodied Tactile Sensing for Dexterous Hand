In order to obtain a good tactile sensing, traditional dexterous hands always enable all the sensing units installed on them all the time, even if just a few sensor units are actually used, which make the tactile sensing system resource-wasting and energy consuming. In order to reduce their complexities by placing the tactile sensing units only at critical locations, this work proposes an embodied tactile dexterous hand (ET-Hand) and a novel multimodal sensor placement framework that learns multiple tasks to generate optimal placement proposal. Furthermore, our ET-Hand can dynamically adjust the perceived tactile sensor positions, types and numbers during robotic manipulation, providing novel tools and methods for investigating the tactile channels and placement scale required for robot exploration. In the object recognition and slip detection tasks, the results show that our proposed method performs close to or even better than traditional sensing way with large-scale placement.
