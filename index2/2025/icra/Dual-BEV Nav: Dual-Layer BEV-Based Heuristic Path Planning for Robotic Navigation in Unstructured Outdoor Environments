Path planning with strong environmental adaptability plays a crucial role in robotic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, especially in the case of low-quality location and map information. The path planning ability of a robot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local ground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open environments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of ground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing methods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability identifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths. Then, these paths are projected into the global traversability probability map generated by the global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal path. By integrating the traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer BEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public dataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising results. Compared to baselines, the Dual-BEV Nav improved temporal distance prediction accuracy by up to 18.26%. In the real-world deployment, under conditions significantly different from the training set and with notable occlusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a 65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local BEV representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning, while the global BEV probability map ensures the robustness of the overall planning.
