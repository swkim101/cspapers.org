Keyframes are LiDAR scans saved for future reference in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), but despite their central importance most algorithms leave choices of which scans to save and how to use them to wasteful heuristics. This work proposes two novel keyframe selection strategies for localization and map summarization, as well as a novel approach to submap generation which selects keyframes that best constrain localization. Our results show that online keyframe selection and submap generation reduce the number of saved keyframes and improve per scan computation time without compromising localization performance. We also present a map summarization feature for quickly capturing environments under strict map size constraints.
