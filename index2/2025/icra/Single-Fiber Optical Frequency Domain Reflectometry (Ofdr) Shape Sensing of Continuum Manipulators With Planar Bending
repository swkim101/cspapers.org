To address the challenges associated with shape sensing of continuum manipulators (CMs) using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) optical fibers, we present a unique shape sensing assembly utilizing solely a single Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) fiber attached to a flat nitinol wire (NiTi). Integrating this easy-to-manufacture unique sensor with a long and soft CM with 170 mm length, we performed different experiments to evaluate its C -, J -, and S-shape reconstruction ability. Results demonstrate phenomenal shape reconstruction accuracy for the performed C-shape ($<3.14 ~\text{mm}$ tip error, < 2.54 mm shape error), J-shape ($<1.91 ~\text{mm}$ tip error, $<1.11 \mathbf{m m}$ shape error), and S-shape ($<\mathbf{1. 7 4 ~ m m}$ tip error, $<\mathbf{1. 4 0 ~ m m}$ shape error) experiments.
