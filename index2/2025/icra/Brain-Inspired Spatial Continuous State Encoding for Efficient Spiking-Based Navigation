Spiking neural networks (SNNs) show great potential in mapless navigation tasks due to their low power consumption, but the continuous representation of spatial information poses a challenge to SNN training. Neuroscience findings reveal that spatial cognition cells encode spatial information through population spike patterns. Inspired by this, we propose a navigation method based on SNNs, leveraging spatial cognition cells, which include grid cells (GCs), head direction cells (HDCs), and boundary vector cells (BVCs). Our method integrates spike-based information to achieve precise navigation goal encoding and egocentric environment perception, significantly improving SNN navigation capabilities in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in navigation success rate and energy efficiency, showcasing superior adaptability across environments. Our work provides a novel approach to developing efficient brain-inspired navigation systems.
