The autonomous transportation of materials over challenging terrain is a challenge with major economic implications and remains unsolved. This paper introduces LEVA, a high-payload, high-mobility robot designed for autonomous logistics across varied terrains, including those typical in agriculture, construction, and search and rescue operations. LEVA uniquely integrates an advanced legged suspension system using parallel kinematics. It is capable of traversing stairs using a reinforcement learning (RL) controller, has steerable wheels, and includes a specialized box pickup mechanism that enables autonomous payload loading as well as precise and reliable cargo transportation of up to 85 kg across uneven surfaces, steps and inclines while maintaining a Cost of Transportation (CoT) of as low as 0.15. Through extensive experimental validation, LEVA demonstrates its off-road capabilities and reliability regarding payload loading and transport.
