Recent research has seen the advancement of drone depot models as a promising way to allocate drones for large-scale task completion. Applications of these drone depot models include data collection, environmental monitoring, package delivery, and more. This paper focuses on sharing agents between static depots for task allocation based on expected demand. We model the problem as a Binary Nonlinear Program, then derive an iterative neighborhood search based on solving a series of Binary Linear Programs to drive towards the optimal configuration of agents for each depot. We show that our method is more tractable than a Branch and Bound approach for this model as problem complexity grows. We also show through simulations that with near optimal allocation between local depots, the overall system performance will outperform greedy and non-sharing approaches.
