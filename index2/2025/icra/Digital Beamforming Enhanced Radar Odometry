Radar has become an essential sensor for autonomous navigation, especially in challenging environments where camera and LiDAR sensors fail. 4D single-chip millimeter-wave radar systems, in particular, have drawn increasing attention thanks to their ability to provide spatial and Doppler information with low hardware cost and power consumption. However, most single-chip radar systems using traditional signal processing, such as Fast Fourier Transform, suffer from limited spatial resolution in radar detection, significantly limiting the performance of radar-based odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. In this paper, we develop a novel radar signal processing pipeline that integrates spatial domain beamforming techniques, and extend it to 3D Direction of Arrival estimation. Experiments using public datasets are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed signal processing pipeline against traditional methodologies. These tests specifically focus on assessing structural precision across diverse scenes and measuring odometry accuracy in different radar odometry systems. This research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving more accurate radar odometry by simply replacing the standard FFT-based processing with the proposed pipeline.
