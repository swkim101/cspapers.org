Scaling social robot studies is constrained due to the need for human interaction, making large participant recruitment impractical. Robotics simulators help mitigate this limitation but generally lack the realism to accurately simulate social cues. We introduce a cognitive robotic simulation scheme to evaluate social attention models in physical environments. By projecting ground-truth priority maps to a simulated environment, we can directly compare predicted maps using common saliency metrics. Using the iCub robot, we assess a dynamic scanpath model that predicts attention targets, simulating human scanpaths. Evaluations with the FindWho and MVVA datasets show strong correlations between robotcaptured metrics and direct-streamed video metrics. Our results indicate robustness of the social attention model to noise and real-world conditions, suggesting its practical usability for predicting personalized scanpaths in real settings. This approach reduces the need for extensive human-robot interaction studies in the early stages of study design, enabling the scalability and reproducibility of social robot evaluations.
