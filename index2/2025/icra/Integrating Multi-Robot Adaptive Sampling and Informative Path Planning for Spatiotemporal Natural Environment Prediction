Learning to predict spatiotemporal (ST) environmental processes from a sparse set of samples collected autonomously is a difficult task from both a sampling perspective (collecting the best sparse samples) and from a learning perspective (predicting the next timestep). In this work, we focus on investigating the sample collection process via multirobot informative path planning. We present an approach for incorporating multi-robot informative path planning into a spatiotemporal adaptive sampling framework while considering path length constraints for sampling location selection. We also incorporate informative path planning to determine the best path to collect samples along while en route to collecting the desired sample. We achieve this in a decentralized manner by decoupling the process into two stages: the first stage uses our spatiotemporal mixture of Gaussian Processes (STMGP) model to determine the most informative sampling location via a mutual information lower bound heuristic and the second stage plans an informative path to collect the desired sample and other additional informative samples via submodular function optimization. Moreover, we effectively leverage peer-to-peer communication to enable coordination. Simulation results on real-world spatiotemporal data are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
