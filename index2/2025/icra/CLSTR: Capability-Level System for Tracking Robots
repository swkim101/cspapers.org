For human operators to effectively task teams of robots, it is critical that they maintain situational awareness about the status of those robots. However, maintaining this situational awareness becomes particularly difficult when there are dynamic changes not only in the members of the robot team, but also in the capabilities of those robots. Prior work has shown that situational awareness can be supported through interfaces that effectively visualize task-relevant information. As such, in this work, we introduce a Capability-Level System for Tracking Robots (CLSTR), a new visualization for supporting operators to maintain an appropriate level of situational awareness over the capabilities of a dynamic robot team. In evaluating CLSTR through an online human-subject study ($\mathbf{n} \boldsymbol{=} \mathbf{1 2 3}$), we found that a combination of different visual elements within an interface like the use of icons to summarize robot capabilities and animations to indicate team changes can help operators maintain awareness over robot teams.
