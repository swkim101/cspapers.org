Soft robotics are characterized by their high deformability, mechanical robustness, and inherent resistance to damage. These unique properties present exciting new opportunities to enhance both emerging and existing fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and exploration. However, to function effectively in unstructured environments, these technologies must withstand the same real-world conditions to which human skin and other soft biological materials are typically subjected. Here, we present a novel soft material architecture designed for active detection of material damage and autonomous repair in soft robotic actuators. By integrating liquid metal (LM) microdroplets within a silicone elastomer, the system can detect and localize damage through the formation of conductive pathways that arise from extreme pressure (> 1 MPa) or puncture events. These newly formed conductive networks function as in situ Joule heating elements, facilitating the reprocessing and healing of the material. The architecture allows for the reconfiguration of the newly formed electrical network using controlled electrical and thermal mechanisms to restore functionality. The entire process from damage detection to repair and reconfiguration occurs without any manual intervention or external mechanisms to facilitate healing. This innovative approach not only enhances the resilience and performance of soft materials but also supports a wide range of applications in soft robotics and wearable technologies, where adaptive and autonomous systems are crucial for operation in dynamic and unpredictable environments.
