The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image, 2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous results.
