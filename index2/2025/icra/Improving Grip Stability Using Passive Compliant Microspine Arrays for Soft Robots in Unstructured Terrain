Microspine grippers are small spines commonly found on insect legs that reinforce surface interaction by engaging with asperities to increase shear force and traction. An array of such microspines, when integrated into the limbs or undercarriage of a robot, can provide the ability to maneuver uneven terrains, traverse inclines, and even climb walls. Meanwhile, the conformability and adaptability of soft robots makes them ideal candidates for applications involving traversal of complex, unstructured terrains. However, there remains a real-life realization gap for soft locomotors pertaining to their transition from controlled lab environment to the field that can be bridged by improving grip stability through effective integration of microspines. In this research, a passive, compliant microspine stacked array design is proposed to enhance the locomotion capabilities of mobile soft robots. A microspine array integration method effectively addresses the stiffness mismatch between soft, compliant, and rigid components. Additionally, a reduction in complexity results from actuation of the surface-conformable soft limb using a single actuator. The two-row, stacked microspine array configuration offers improved gripping capabilities on steep and irregular surfaces. This design is incorporated into three different robot configurations - the baseline without microspines and two others with different combinations of microspine arrays. Field experiments are conducted on surfaces of varying surface roughness and non-uniformity - concrete, brick, compact sand, and tree roots. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of microspine arrays increases planar displacement an average of 10 times. The improved grip stability, repeatability, and, terrain traversability is reflected by a decrease in the relative standard deviation of the locomotion gaits.
