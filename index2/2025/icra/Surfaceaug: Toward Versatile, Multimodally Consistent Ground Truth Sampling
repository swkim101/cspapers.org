Despite recent advances in both model architectures and data augmentation, multimodal object detectors still barely outperform their LiDAR-only counterparts. This shortcoming has been attributed to a lack of sufficiently powerful multimodal data augmentation. To address this, we present SurfaceAug, a novel ground truth sampling algorithm. SurfaceAug pastes objects by resampling both images and point clouds, enabling object-level transformations in both modalities. We evaluate our algorithm by training a multimodal detector on KITTI and compare its performance to previous works. We show experimentally that SurfaceAug demonstrates promising improvements on car detection tasks.
