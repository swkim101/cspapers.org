Research into robotics applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has increasingly been focussed on learning precise object manipulation and trajectory planning. Extending these tasks to continuous robot-object interactions with the surface of complex geometries remains an open problem. In this paper we investigate end-to-end DRL solutions for depowdering tasks that work by directing a pressurized air stream onto the object's surfaces using a blast nozzle head mounted on a robotic arm. We develop a GPU accelerated vectorized cleaning effect for integration into RL training and consider ways to expose vision-less trajectory synthesis for surface treatment applications to the RL agent based on UV mapping. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DRL has the potential to be used for generating object-specific agents for depowdering tasks on a variety of 3D objects without requiring intermediate path planners even in a full 3D motion setup. Finally, we show that DRL-generated trajectories can be transferred to a real-world setup. Our task formulation lends itself to approximate a wide range of surface treatment applications (e.g., cleaning and spray painting) with various effects.
