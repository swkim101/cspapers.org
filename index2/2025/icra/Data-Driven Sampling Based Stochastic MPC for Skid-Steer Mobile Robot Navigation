Traditional approaches to motion modeling for skid-steer robots struggle to capture nonlinear tire-terrain dynamics, especially during high-speed maneuvers. In this paper, we tackle such nonlinearities by enhancing a dynamic unicycle model with Gaussian Process (GP) regression outputs. This enables us to develop an adaptive, uncertainty-informed navigation formulation. We solve the resultant stochastic optimal control problem using a chance-constrained Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control method. This approach formulates obstacle avoidance and path-following as chance constraints, accounting for residual uncertainties from the GP to ensure safety and reliability in control. Leveraging GPU acceleration, we efficiently manage the non-convex nature of the problem, ensuring real-time performance. Our approach unifies path-following and obstacle avoidance across different terrains, unlike prior works which typically focus on one or the other. We compare our GP-MPPI method against unicycle and data-driven kinematic models within the MPPI framework. In simulations, our approach shows superior tracking accuracy and obstacle avoidance. We further validate our approach through hardware experiments on a skid-steer robot platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in high-speed navigation.
