NeRF-based SLAM has recently achieved promising results in tracking and reconstruction. However, existing methods face challenges in providing sufficient scene representation, capturing structural information, and maintaining global consistency in scenes emerging significant movement or being forgotten. To this end, we present HS-SLAM to tackle these problems. To enhance scene representation capacity, we propose a hybrid encoding network that combines the complementary strengths of hash-grid, tri-planes, and one-blob, improving the completeness and smoothness of reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce structural supervision by sampling patches of non-local pixels rather than individual rays to better capture the scene structure. To ensure global consistency, we implement an active global bundle adjustment (BA) to eliminate camera drifts and mitigate accumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that HS-SLAM outperforms the baselines in tracking and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining the efficiency required for robotics.
