Laboratory automation is a key driver for higher efficiency and reproducibility of experiments and measurements in natural science laboratories. One process that is particularly susceptible to both manual errors in the physical handling of labware, faulty data analyses, and incomplete reporting is the quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). It is a ubiquitous analysis method in biolaboratories to amplify and measure the amount of a specific DNA sequence in a sample. Our system, which we call the qPCRBot, addresses these issues through three key pillars: automating data analysis and handling processes, standardizing data management and system communication protocols, and utilizing a robotic manipulator for labware transport. To achieve this, we developed a SiLA 2-based client-server architecture for unified and standardized access to both the qPCR device and the robot. For the manipulator, we implemented a Cartesian motion generator to ensure proper labware transport. We transform all experiment data to a standardized, XML-based format and integrate a widely-used Laboratory Information Management System for its storage. These developments collectively enable streamlined qPCR measurements without human interaction, thus enhancing both efficiency and reproducibility.
