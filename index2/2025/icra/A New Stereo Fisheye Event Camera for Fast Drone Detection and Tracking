In this paper, we present a new compact vision sensor consisting of two fisheye event cameras mounted back-to-back, which offers a full 360-degree view of the surrounding environment. We describe the optical design, projection model and practical calibration using the incoming stream of events, of the novel stereo camera, called SFERA. The potential of SFERA for real-time target tracking is evaluated using a Bayesian estimator adapted to the geometry of the sphere. Real-world experiments with a prototype of SFERA, including two synchronized Prophesee EVK4 cameras and a DJI Mavic Air 2 quadrotor, show the effectiveness of the proposed system for aerial surveillance.
