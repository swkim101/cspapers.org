Due to labor shortages in specialty crop industries, a need for robotic automation to increase agricultural efficiency and productivity has arisen. Previous manipulation systems harvest well in uncluttered and structured environments. High tunnel environments are more compact and cluttered in nature, requiring a rethinking of the large form factor systems and grippers. We propose a novel co-designed framework incorporating a global detection camera and a local eye-in-hand camera that demonstrates precise localization of small fruits via closed-loop visual feedback and reliable error handling. Field experiments in high tunnels show that our system can reach 85.0% of cherry tomato fruit in 10.98s on average.
