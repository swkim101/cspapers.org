Efficient, collision-free motion planning is essential for automating large-scale manipulators like timber cranes. They come with unique challenges such as hydraulic actuation constraints and passive joints-factors that are seldom addressed by current motion planning methods. This paper introduces a novel approach for time-optimal, collision-free hybrid motion planning for a hydraulically actuated timber crane with passive joints. We enhance the via-point-based stochastic trajectory optimization (VP-STO) algorithm to in-clude pump flow rate constraints and develop a novel collision cost formulation to improve robustness. The effectiveness of the enhanced VP-STO as an optimal single-query global planner is validated by comparison with an informed RRT* algorithm using a time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP). The over-all hybrid motion planning is formed by combination with a gradient-based local planner that is designed to follow the global planner's reference and to systematically consider the passive joint dynamics for both collision avoidance and sway damping.
