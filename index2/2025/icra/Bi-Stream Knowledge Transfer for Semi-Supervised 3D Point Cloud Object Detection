3D point cloud object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. However, labeling 3D object boxes is expensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of annotated point clouds used in fully-supervised training. This has led to a rise in semi-supervised 3D object detection research, which aims to improve model performance by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled point clouds. Existing methods typically rely on the Mean Teacher (MT) paradigm, which uses unlabeled instances discovered by the teacher with confidence scores higher than certain thresholds to train the student. However, this leads to a loss of information as it overlooks ambiguous instances from the teacher that could also contain valuable knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a Bi-Stream Knowledge Transfer (BiKT) framework that fully exploits and transfers knowledge from both confident and ambiguous instances to the student network. Specifically, all pseudo labels are allocated into two knowledge streams, the deterministic stream and the noisy stream, and then subsequently guide the student network through bi-level supervision. We also introduce a Dynamic Stream Switching (DSS) algorithm that sets the stream boundary tailored for the current learning status. To further improve the quality of pseudo labels in the knowledge streams, we propose a Diffusive Label Denoising (DLD) module, which is trained by explicitly generating noised instances and then learning to denoise them, as in diffusion models. Experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our BiKT on the ONCE validation and testing sets, as well as the robust generalization capability when confronted with diverse base detectors, increased amount of unlabeled data, and distinct datasets (e.g., Waymo), unveiling the power of semi-supervised learning in 3D object detection.
