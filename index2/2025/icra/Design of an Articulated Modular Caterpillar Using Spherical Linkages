Articulation between body segments of small insects and animals is a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion. Implementing this kind of motion in a compact robot is usually not tractable due to limitations in small actuator technologies. In this work, we concede full 3-DOF control and instead select a one degree-of-freedom curve in SO(3) to articulate segments of a caterpillar robot. The curve is approximated with a spherical four-bar, which is synthesized through optimal rigid body guidance. We specify the desired SO(3) motion using discrete task positions, then solve for candidate mechanisms by computing all roots of the stationary conditions using numerical homotopy continuation. A caterpillar robot prototype demonstrates the utility of this approach. This synthesis procedure is also used to design prolegs for the caterpillar robot. Each segment contains two DC motors and a shape memory alloy, which is used for latching and unlatching between segments. The caterpillar robot is capable of walking, steering, object manipulation, body articulation, and climbing.
