Research in visual perception has shown that the human visual system utilizes high-level feedback information to guide lower-level processing, enabling adaptation to signals of varying characteristics. Inspired by this, we propose the Feedback multi-Level feature Extractor (Flex) to dynamically adjust feature selection in object detection based on image-wise and instance-level feedback information. This is particularly beneficial for applications such as aerial object detection, UAV-based target recognition and autonomous vehicle navigation, where global image quality issues like sensor degradation, foggy, or rainy conditions can impact detection performance. Flex adapts to variations in image quality, refining the feature extraction process to improve robustness against these challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that Flex consistently enhances a range of state-of-the-art methods on challenging aerial object detection datasets, including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and HRSC2016. Furthermore, additional experiments on MS COCO confirm the module's effectiveness in general object detection tasks. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that the improvements are strongly correlated with image quality, aligning with our original motivation to address global image quality issues in real-world scenarios.
