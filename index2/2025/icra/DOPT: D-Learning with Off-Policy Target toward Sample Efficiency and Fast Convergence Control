In recent times, Lyapunov theory has been in-corporated into learning-based control methods to provide a stability guarantee. However, merely satisfying the Lyapunov conditions does not fully leverage the capabilities of the Neural Network (NN) controller. Furthermore, training an effective Lyapunov candidate requires substantial data, which inherently results in sample inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an off-policy variant of the vanilla D-learning method that uses current and historical data to iteratively enhance the NN controller within the framework of Lyapunov theory. Our method outperforms the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and D-learning in terms of stability, sample efficiency, and the quality of the trained controllers and Lyapunov candidates.
