General-purpose navigation in challenging environments remains a significant problem in robotics, with current state-of-the-art approaches facing myriad limitations. Classical approaches struggle with cluttered settings and require extensive tuning, while learning-based methods face difficulties generalizing to out-of-distribution environments. This paper introduces X-Mobility, an end-to-end generalizable navigation model that overcomes existing challenges by leveraging three key ideas. First, X-Mobility employs an auto-regressive world modeling architecture with a latent state space to capture world dynamics. Second, a diverse set of multi-head decoders enables the model to learn a rich state representation that correlates strongly with effective navigation skills. Third, by decoupling world modeling from action policy, our architecture can train effectively on a variety of data sources, both with and without expert policies-off-policy data allows the model to learn world dynamics, while on-policy data with supervisory control enables optimal action policy learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that X-Mobility not only generalizes effectively but also surpasses current state-of-the-art navigation approaches. Additionally, X-Mobility also achieves zero-shot Sim2Real transferability and shows strong potential for crossembodiment generalization. Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/X-MOBILITY.
