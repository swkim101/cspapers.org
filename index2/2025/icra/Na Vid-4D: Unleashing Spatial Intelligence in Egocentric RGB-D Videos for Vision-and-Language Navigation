Understanding and reasoning about the 4D space-time is crucial for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). However, previous works lack in-depth exploration in this aspect, resulting in bottlenecked spatial perception and action precision of VLN agents. In this work, we introduce NaVid-4D, a Vision Language Model (VLM) based navigation agent taking the lead in explicitly showcasing the capabilities of spatial intelligence in the real world. Given natural language instructions, NaVid-4D requires only egocentric RGB-D video streams as observations to perform spatial understanding and reasoning for generating precise instruction-following robotic actions. NaVid-4D learns navigation policies using the data from simulation environments and is endowed with precise spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using web data. Without the need to pre-train an RGB-D foundation model, we propose a method capable of directly injecting the depth features into the visual encoder of a VLM. We further compare the use of factually captured depth information with the monocularly estimated one and find NaVid-4D works well with both while using estimated depth offers greater gener-alization capability and better mitigates the sim-to-real gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaVid-4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulation environment and makes impressive VLN performance with spatial intelligence happen in the real world.
