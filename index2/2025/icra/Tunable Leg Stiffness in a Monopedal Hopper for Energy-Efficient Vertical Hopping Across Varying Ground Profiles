We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaption), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steadystate hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energyefficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.
