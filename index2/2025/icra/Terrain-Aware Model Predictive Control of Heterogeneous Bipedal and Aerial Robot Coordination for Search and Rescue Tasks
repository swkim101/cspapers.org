Humanoid robots offer significant advantages for search and rescue tasks, thanks to their capability to traverse rough terrains and perform transportation tasks. In this study, we present a task and motion planning framework for search and rescue operations using a heterogeneous robot team composed of humanoids and aerial robots. We propose a terrain-aware Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that incorporates terrain elevation gradients learned using Gaussian processes (GP). This terrain-aware MPC generates safe navigation paths for the bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain while minimizing terrain slopes, and it directs the quadrotors to perform aerial search and mapping tasks. The rescue subjects' locations are estimated by a target belief GP, which is updated online during the map exploration. A high-level planner for task allocation is designed by encoding the navigation tasks using syntactically cosafe Linear Temporal Logic (scLTL), and a consensus-based algorithm is designed for task assignment of individual robots. We evaluate the efficacy of our planning framework in simulation in an uncertain environment with various terrains and random rescue subject placements.
