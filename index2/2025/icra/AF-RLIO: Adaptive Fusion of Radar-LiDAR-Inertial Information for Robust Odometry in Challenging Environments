In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges, we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D millimeterwave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules. Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects appropriate point cloud data for scan-tomap matching and tightly couples it with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data, constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels. Furthermore, we open source our code at https://github.com/NeSC-IV/AF-RLIO.git to benefit the research community.
