In this paper, we present an adaptive walker system designed to address limitations in current intelligent walker technologies. While recent advancements have been made in this field, existing systems often struggle to seamlessly interpret user intent for speed control and lack adaptability across diverse scenarios and terrain. Our proposed solution incorporates high-resolution tactile sensors, deep learning algorithms, IMU sensors, and linear motors to dynamically adjust to the user's intentions and terrain changes. The system is capable of predicting the user's desired speed with an error margin of only 20.99%, relying solely on tactile input from hand and arm contact points. Additionally, it maintains the walker's horizontal stability with an error of less than 1 degree by adjusting leg lengths in response to variations in ground angle. This adaptive walker enhances user safety and comfort, particularly for individuals with reduced strength or cognitive abilities, and offers reliable assistance on uneven terrain such as uphill and downhill paths.
