Humans are able to convey different messages using only touch. Equipping robots with the ability to under-stand social touch adds another modality in which humans and robots can communicate. In this paper, we present a social gesture recognition system using a fabric-based, large-scale tactile sensor placed onto the arms of a humanoid robot. We built a social gesture dataset using multiple participants and extracted temporal features for classification. By collecting tactile data on a humanoid robot, our system provides insights into human-robot social touch, and displays that the use of fabric based sensors could be a potential way of advancing the development of spHRI systems for more natural and effective communication.
