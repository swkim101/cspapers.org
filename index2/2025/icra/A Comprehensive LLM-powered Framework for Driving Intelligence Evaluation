Evaluation methods for autonomous driving are crucial for algorithm optimization. However, due to the complexity of driving intelligence, there is currently no comprehensive evaluation method for the level of autonomous driving intelligence. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for driving behavior intelligence in complex traffic environments, aiming to fill this gap. We constructed a natural language evaluation dataset of human professional drivers and passengers through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving behavior evaluation interviews. Based on this dataset, we developed an LLM-powered driving evaluation framework. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through simulated experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human assessment. Our research provides valuable insights for evaluating and designing more intelligent, human-like autonomous driving agents.
