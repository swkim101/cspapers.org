Identifying a brain signal that enables the detection of incorrect execution in human-robot interaction (HRI) is considered a holy grail for real-time systems. A major challenge in achieving this is the inherent imbalance caused by the sparsity of error-related potential (ErrP) events in streaming electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which often leads models to learn irrelevant features and perform poorly. Thus, while deep learning-based ErrP detection has seen considerable advancements, the variability in individual user reaction times introduces labeling errors, complicating model adaptation to new subjects. Moreover, most deep learning methods are developed and validated on discrete, offline experiments using pre-defined windows, which fail to translate effectively to continuous, real-time HRI. Addressing these challenges is crucial to improving the robustness and adaptability of real-time ErrP detection in practical HRI applications. Here, we develop a causal EEG conformer framework, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a transformer with causal attention for real-time prediction of ErrP signals during HRI. We evaluated our ErrP model in a pseudo-online environment in both inter-session and inter-subject cross-validation settings for exoskeleton assistive robotics. Our model demonstrated superior performance in decoding accuracy and efficiency, showcasing better generalization for real-world dynamic HRI applications.
