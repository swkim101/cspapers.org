Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient. Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it with iterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied intelligence.
