Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images. Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method against complex viewpoint variations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
