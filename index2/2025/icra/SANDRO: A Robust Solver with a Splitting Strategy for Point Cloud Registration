Point cloud registration is a critical problem in computer vision and robotics, especially in the field of navigation. Current methods often fail when faced with high outlier rates or take a long time to converge to a suitable solution. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for point cloud registration called SANDRO11https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/SANDRO (Splitting strategy for point cloud Alignment using Non-convex anD Robust Optimization), which combines an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) framework with a robust loss function with graduated non-convexity. This approach is further enhanced by a splitting strategy designed to handle high outlier rates and skewed distributions of outliers. SANDRO is capable of addressing important limitations of existing methods, as in challenging scenarios where the presence of high outlier rates and point cloud symmetries significantly hinder convergence. SANDRO achieves superior performance in terms of success rate when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a 20% improvement from the current state of the art when tested on the Redwood real dataset and 60% improvement when tested on synthetic data.
