When agents must execute multiple tasks at spatially distinct locations, it is common to formulate and solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the order of locations (targets) that requires the smallest travel cost. Approaching such task sequencing problems as a TSP is restrictive, as it requires that unique locations be specified for each task. In reality a set of acceptable locations might be available. The Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem in which the agent needs only visit a spherical neighborhood surrounding each target, and can thus address this task sequencing problem when any location in a sphere is acceptable. Prior work has developed a branch-and-bound approach that finds globally optimal solutions to instances of the CETSP by solving a sequence of Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCP). We demonstrate it is possible to eliminate $2 / 3$ of the variables and $1 / 2$ of the constraints in these SOCPs, show how to reuse computation and memory allocation across multiple SOCPs in the sequence, and propose a strategy to warm-start the SOCPs using solutions obtained earlier in the sequence. Collectively, these three changes halve the time required to solve 210 random CETSP instances to optimality. We also obtained improved lower bounds on 73 instances from the literature, including solving one instance to optimality for the first time.
