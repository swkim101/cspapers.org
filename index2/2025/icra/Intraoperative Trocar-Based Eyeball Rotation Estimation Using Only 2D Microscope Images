In ophthalmic surgery, surgeons or robots manipulate a light probe and an instrument around two separated trocars following sclerotomy to achieve orbital control for eyeball pose adjustment and subsequent surgical tasks referring to microscope frames. However, current methods face significant challenges in directly extracting the eyeball pose from real-time microscope frames due to the limited microscope perspective and the darkened operating room (OR). This paper decomposes eyeball rotations only along the x and y axes. Then, a method of calculating eyeball poses using eyeball geometry and microscopic trocar positions is presented. This method is tested by simulation and a phantom system with current [2.0, 2.8] degree error, providing assistant intraoperative eyeball status in the dark OR with extended method discussions.
