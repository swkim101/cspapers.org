In limbed robotics, end-effectors must serve dual functions, such as both feet for locomotion and grippers for grasping, which presents design challenges. This paper introduces a multi-modal end-effector capable of transitioning between flat and line foot configurations while providing grasping capabilities. MAGPIE integrates eight-axis force sensing using proposed mechanisms with Hall effect sensors, enabling both contact and tactile force measurements. We present a computational design framework for our sensing mechanism that accounts for noise and interference, allowing for desired sensitivity and force ranges and generating ideal inverse models. The hardware implementation of MAGPIE is validated through experiments, demonstrating its capability as a foot and verifying the performance of the sensing mechanisms, ideal models, and gated network-based models.
