In this work, we introduce a framework that enables highly maneuverable locomotion using non-periodic contacts. This task is challenging for traditional optimization and planning methods to handle due to difficulties in specifying contact mode sequences in real-time. To address this, we use a bi-level contact-implicit planner and hybrid model predictive controller to draft and execute a motion plan. We investigate how this method allows us to plan arm contact events on the shmoobot, a smaller ballbot, which uses an inverse mouseball drive to achieve dynamic balancing with a low number of actuators. Through multiple experiments we show how the arms allow for acceleration, deceleration and dynamic obstacle avoidance that are not achievable with the mouseball drive alone. This demonstrates how a holistic approach to locomotion can increase the control authority of unique robot morpohologies without additional hardware by leveraging robot arms that are typically used only for manipulation.
