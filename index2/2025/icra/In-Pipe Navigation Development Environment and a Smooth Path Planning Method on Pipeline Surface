Autonomous in-pipe inspection robots can automatically navigate through complex pipeline networks and detect potential risks from corrosion and defects, demonstrating great potential for replacing costly manual inspections. However, there is no publicly available simulation environment where researchers can validate their in-pipe navigation algorithms as far as we know, and the navigation algorithms on constrained 3D pipe surface which is the critical software component are less discussed. Firstly, this paper proposes an open-source In-Pipe Navigation Development Environment. It contains various pipeline models, a magnetic wheel climbing robot model realized by the adhesion plugin, and baseline algorithms for navigation tasks. Secondly, a novel effective path planning method is introduced. Instead of planning based on surface structures, the proposed method plans based on pipeline axis and maps it into local path using the Frenet-Serret formula, thereby generating smooth, feasible, and efficient paths. Finally, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments in the proposed simulation and real-world environments. The results show the usability of the development environment, also robustness and efficiency of the proposed planning method.
