Transparent objects are common in daily life, while their optical properties pose challenges for RGB-D cameras to capture accurate depth information. This issue is further amplified when these objects are hand-held, as hand occlusions further complicate depth estimation. For assistant robots, however, accurately perceiving hand-held transparent objects is critical to effective human-robot interaction. This paper presents a Hand-Aware Depth Restoration (HADR) method based on creating an implicit neural representation function from a single RGB-D image. The proposed method utilizes hand posture as an important guidance to leverage semantic and geometric information of hand-object interaction. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we create a highfidelity synthetic dataset named TransHand- $\mathbf{1 4 K}$ with a real-tosim data generation scheme. Experiments show that our method has better performance and generalization ability compared with existing methods. We further develop a real-world human-to-robot handover system based on HADR, demonstrating its potential in human-robot interaction applications.
