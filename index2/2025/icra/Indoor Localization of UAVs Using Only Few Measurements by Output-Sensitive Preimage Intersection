We present a deterministic approach for the localization of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a known indoor environment by using only a few downward distance measurements and the corresponding odometries between measurements. For each distance measurement and odometry, we look at the preimage of that distance measurement under the downwards distance function combined with the corresponding odometry where the motion between every two measurements has four degrees of freedom: three of translation and one of azimuth change. The intersection of these preimages yields the set of all possible locations for the UAV. In this work, we present an efficient method for approximating that intersection of preimages. We perform a spatial subdivision search, which splits only voxels containing that intersection. We present a novel technique, based on geometric insights, for correctly evaluating whether a voxel indeed contains a true localization. This technique is also robust under different kinds of errors that might occur. Our method is guaranteed to contain the ground truth location, and its runtime complexity is output sensitive, in the Hausdorff dimension and measure of the resulting intersection of preimages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in various indoor scenarios, showing that it can be used to significantly decrease the uncertainty of localization when solving the kidnapped robot problem in simulation and on a physical drone. Our method can be performed in real-time. Furthermore, our method requires only a map of the environment, odometry and ToF sensors, which is advantageous in terms of cost, privacy and transmission bandwidth.
