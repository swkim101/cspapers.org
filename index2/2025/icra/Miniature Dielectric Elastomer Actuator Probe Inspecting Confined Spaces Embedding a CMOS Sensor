Navigating and inspecting confined space is crucial for the aerospace and healthcare industries. Exploring smaller and narrower spaces allows for problems to be identified earlier, preventing negative outcomes for patients and equipment. The challenge is to scale down the navigation probe while preserving degrees of freedom (DOF) and functionality. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising probe candidates because they are solid-state, electrical-driven, and can be scaled down favorably. This work demonstrates a modular 2-DOF DEA miniature probe with an embedded CMOS sensor for visual data acquisition. The modularity achieved by a novel connector system enables switching between single and dual DEA probes based on 2D or 3D pathway structures. The probes can be controlled using a pocket-sized circuit with two knobs to turn. We present the operating mechanism, device assembly, fabrication, and characterization of DEA bending actuators with widths below 2 mm. In the end, we demonstrate the ability of devices to navigate through various complex and confined pathways.
