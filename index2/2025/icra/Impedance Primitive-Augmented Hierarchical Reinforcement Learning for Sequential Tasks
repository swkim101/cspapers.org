This paper presents an Impedance Primitive-augmented hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for efficient robotic manipulation in sequential contact tasks. We leverage this hierarchical structure to sequentially execute behavior primitives with variable stiffness control capabilities for contact tasks. Our proposed approach relies on three key components: an action space enabling variable stiffness control, an adaptive stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness adjustments during primitive execution, and affordance coupling for efficient exploration while encouraging compliance. Through comprehensive training and evaluation, our framework learns efficient stiffness control capabilities and demonstrates improvements in learning efficiency, compositionality in primitive selection, and success rates compared to the state-of-the-art. The training environments include block lifting, door opening, object pushing, and surface cleaning. Real world evaluations further confirm the framework's sim2real capability. This work lays the foundation for more adaptive and versatile robotic manipulation systems, with potential applications in more complex contact-based tasks.
