Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in robotics with complex and heterogeneous dynamics. However, its vulnerability to unknown disturbances and adversarial attacks remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a robust policy training framework that integrates model-based control principles with adversarial RL training to improve robustness without the need for external black-box adversaries. Our approach introduces a novel Hamilton-Jacobi reachability-guided disturbance for adversarial RL training, where we use interpretable worst-case or near-worst-case disturbances as adversaries against the robust policy. We evaluated its effectiveness across three distinct tasks: a reach-avoid game in both simulation and real-world settings, and a highly dynamic quadrotor stabilization task in simulation. We validate that our learned critic network is consistent with the ground-truth HJ value function, while the policy network shows comparable performance with other learning-based methods.
