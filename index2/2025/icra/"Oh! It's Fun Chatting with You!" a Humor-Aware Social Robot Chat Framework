Humor is a key element in human interactions, essential for building connections and rapport. To enhance human-robot communication, we developed a humor-aware chat framework that enables robots to deliver contextually appropriate humor. This framework takes into account the interaction environment, and user's profile as well as emotional state. Two GPT models are used to generate responses. The initial one, named sensor-GPT, processes contextual data from the sensor along with the user's response and conversation history to create prompts for the second one, chat-GPT. These prompts can guide the model on how to integrate appropriate humor elements into the conversation, ensuring that the dialogue is both contextually relevant and humorous. Our experiment compared the effectiveness of humor expression between our framework and the GPT-40 model. The results demonstrate that robots using our framework significantly outperform those using GPT-4o in humor expression, extending conversations, and improving overall interaction quality.
