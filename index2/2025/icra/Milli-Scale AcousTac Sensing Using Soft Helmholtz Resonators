Acoustic transmission, or sound, can effectively communicate information over distances through various media. We focus on generating acoustic transmission using pneumatically driven resonators for wireless tactile sensing without the need for any electronics at the end-effector or contact point. We explore the relationship between emitted frequency and the geometry of the resonance chamber. When a normal compressive force is applied to the end cap, the compliant resonant cavity deforms, leading to an increase in frequency measurable by an external microphone. Prior work uses tube resonators with fipple attachments. In the present work, we study whether a different smaller audible cylindrical resonator with air blown across the entryway can be utilized instead. We test the utility of the Helmholtz resonator model in predicting the experimental frequency response. Resonance is often modeled for rigid cavities, presenting unique challenges in predicting resonance for the design of soft resonating taxels.
