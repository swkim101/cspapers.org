Forestry machines are not easily accessible for experimentation or demonstration of research results. These mobile robots are massive, very expensive, and require a large outdoor space and permits to operate. These factors hinder conducting experiments on real forestry robots. Thus, it is essential to design experimental setups utilizing easily accessible robots in indoor labs that can effectively replicate the behavior of interest of a forestry machine. We design a setup to resemble a log-loader crane and grapple motions using a Kinova Jaco2 arm by manufacturing a specialized end-effector to attach passively to the Jaco2 arm. Passively attached grapple causes undesirable sway, which is problematic and dangerous in forestry. To address the sway problem, we employ dynamic programming to develop an anti-sway motion planner, and validate its performance for different point-to-point maneuvers in our experimental setup. We also repeat each experiment at least 6 times to ensure the repeatability and reliability of the experiments. The experimental results showcase the excellent sway-damping performance of our planner and also the very good repeatability of our experiments.
