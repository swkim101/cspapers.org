With the ongoing miniaturization, recently, lightweight, commercial underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMSs) have emerged that massively lower the entry barrier into underwater manipulation. Within this research field, dynamic and accurate end effector trajectory tracking is a crucial first step in developing autonomous capabilities. In this context, coupling effects between the manipulator and vehicle dynamics are expected to pose a considerable challenge. However, UVMS control strategies analyzed in detailed experimental studies are particularly rare. We present a holistic approach based on task-priority control that we describe and discuss from modeling towards extensive experimental studies, which are crucial for the notoriously hard-to-simulate underwater domain. We demonstrate this framework on the widely used platform of a BlueROV2 and an Alpha 5 manipulator. The end effector trajectory tracking is shown to be highly accurate, with $<4 \text{cm}$ median position error. Moreover, our experimental findings on the consideration of dynamic coupling within UVMS control motivate further research. The code is available at https://github.com/HippoCampusRobotics/uvms.
