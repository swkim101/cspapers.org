This paper presents the key principles of eViper-2D - a thin large-area soft robotics platform - as a new development of the previous extendable Vibrating Intelligent Piezo-Electric Robot (eViper) platform. We first introduce the mechanical, electrical, and control framework of eViper-2D, and then develop systematic and scalable methods to study the impact of diverse actuation patterns on robotic motion dynamics and energy efficiency. By integrating power electronics, communication circuits, piezoelectric actuators, and batteries onboard, the eViper-2D platform enables rapid design iteration and quick evaluation of different control strategies for the multi-actuator soft robot. The platform supports data-driven modeling via automated data acquisition. We show that eViper-2D can provide rich insights into optimizing actuation patterns to achieve agile motion and minimal cost of transport (COT).
