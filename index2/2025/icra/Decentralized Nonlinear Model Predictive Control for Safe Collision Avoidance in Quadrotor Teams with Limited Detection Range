Multi-quadrotor systems face significant challenges in decentralized control, particularly with safety and coordination under sensing and communication limitations. State-of-the-art methods leverage Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees but often neglect actuation constraints and limited detection range. To address these gaps, we propose a novel decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that integrates Exponential CBFs (ECBFs) to enhance safety and optimality in multi-quadrotor systems. We provide both conservative and practical minimum bounds of the range that preserve the safety guarantees of the ECBFs. We validate our approach through extensive simulations with up to 10 quadrotors and 20 obstacles, as well as real-world experiments with 3 quadrotors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in realistic settings, highlighting its potential for reliable quadrotor teams operations.
