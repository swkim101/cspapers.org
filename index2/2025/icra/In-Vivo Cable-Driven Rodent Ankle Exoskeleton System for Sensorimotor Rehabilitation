This paper introduces a novel cable-driven rodent ankle exoskeleton system designed for in-vivo research on the restoration and enhancement of sensorimotor abilities. The system features a lightweight, actuator-decoupled exoskeleton for shaping motion and providing kinesthetic feedback, along with a vision system and feedback-controlled treadmill for gait analysis. Experiments conducted under anesthesia and in awake conditions demonstrated effective control with minimal interference to natural gait. Dynamic time warping distance and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between joint angles from natural gait and those from rats wearing both passive and active exoskeleton component. The knee joint showed a low DTW distance and high correlation regardless of conditions, while all three joint displayed a greater maximum value from natural gait when the active component was engaged. These results provide valuable insights into the physiological impacts of wearable robotics in animal models, advancing sensorimotor rehabilitation technologies.
