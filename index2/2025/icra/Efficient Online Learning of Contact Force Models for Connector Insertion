Contact-rich manipulation tasks with stiff frictional elements, like connector insertion, are difficult to model with rigid-body simulators. In this work, we propose a new approach for modeling these environments by learning a quasistatic contact force model instead of a full simulator. Using a feature vector that contains information about the configuration and control, we find a linear mapping adequately captures the relationship between this feature vector and the sensed contact forces. A novel Linear Model Learning (LML) algorithm is used to solve for the globally optimal mapping in real time without any matrix inversions, resulting in an algorithm that runs in nearly constant time on a GPU as the model size increases. We validate the proposed approach for connector insertion in both simulation and hardware experiments, where the learned model is combined with an optimizationbased impedance controller to achieve smooth insertions in the presence of misalignments and uncertainty.
