Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers robust sensing capabilities in diverse environments, making it a highly promising solution for human body reconstruction due to its privacy-friendly and non-intrusive nature. However, the significant sparsity of mm Wave point clouds limits the estimation accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that enhances mm Wave point clouds and improves human body reconstruction accuracy. Our method includes a mm Wave point cloud enhancement module that densifies the raw data by leveraging temporal features and a multi-stage completion network, followed by a 2D-3D fusion module that extracts both 2D and 3D motion features to refine SMPL parameters. The mm Wave point cloud enhancement module learns the detailed shape and posture information from 2D human masks in single-view images. However, image-based supervision is involved only during the training phase, and the inference relies solely on sparse point clouds to maintain privacy. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with the enhanced point clouds further improving performance when integrated into existing models.
