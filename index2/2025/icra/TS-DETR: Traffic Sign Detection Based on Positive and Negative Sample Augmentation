Traffic sign detection plays an essential role in advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) or self-driving vehicles. Typically, deep neural networks are employed to analyze road scene images captured by an onboard camera. However, due to the significant variation in appearance of different traffic signs, the classification of high similarity patterns is still a challenging task. To address these issues, this paper presents an end-to-end traffic sign detection framework based on DETR. The proposed network incorporates data augmentation and negative sample learning to mitigate the problem of data imbalance and enhance the model recognition capability effectively. An UASPP module (Upsample Atrous Pyramid Pooling) is introduced to integrate multi-scale features and global information. In the experiments, the performance evaluation has demonstrated the improvement of mAP by 3.9% on TT100K and 36.3% on GTSDB compared to state-of-the-art methods.
