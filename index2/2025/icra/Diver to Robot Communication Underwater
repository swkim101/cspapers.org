Gesture-based communication is a standard underwater communication strategy that is taught to divers as part of their regular diver training and it would seem a natural mechanism to leverage for diver to robot communication underwater. Enabling an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to understand such sequences would involve having the robot learn the large set of gestures that divers use and the way they are combined. As perfect transcription of gestures is unlikely, the communication process also requires an error-correcting framework to ensure that communication is clear and correct. Here we describe an interactive process that provides this infrastructure. A weakly supervised transfer learning approach is used to recognize standard SCUBA gestures in individual video frames and within a Sim2Real process to train a LSTM to recognize gesture sequences. This process is placed within a per-gesture and per-sequence interaction process to assist and confirm the recognition of individual gestures and to confirm entire gesture sequences. Individual aspects of this process and complete end-to-end operation are demonstrated using an unmanned underwater vehicle.
