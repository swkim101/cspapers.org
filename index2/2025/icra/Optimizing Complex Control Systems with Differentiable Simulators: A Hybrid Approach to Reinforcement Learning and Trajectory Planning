Deep reinforcement learning (RL) often relies on simulators as abstract oracles to model interactions within complex environments. While differentiable simulators have recently emerged for multi-body robotic systems, they remain underutilized, despite their potential to provide richer information. This underutilization, coupled with the high computational cost of exploration-exploitation in high-dimensional state spaces, limits the practical application of RL in the real-world. We propose a method that integrates learning with differentiable simulators to enhance the efficiency of exploration-exploitation. Our approach learns value functions, state trajectories, and control policies from locally optimal runs of a model-based trajectory optimizer. The learned value function acts as a proxy to shorten the preview horizon, while approximated state and control policies guide the trajectory optimization. We benchmark our algorithm on three classical control problems and a torque-controlled 7 degree-of-freedom robot manipulator arm, demonstrating faster convergence and a more efficient symbiotic relationship between learning and simulation for end-to-end training of complex, poly-articulated systems.
