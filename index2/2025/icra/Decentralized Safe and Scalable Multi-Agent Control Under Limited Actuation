To deploy safe and agile robots in cluttered environments, there is a need to develop fully decentralized controllers that guarantee safety, respect actuation limits, prevent deadlocks, and scale to thousands of agents. Current approaches fall short of meeting all these goals: optimization-based methods ensure safety but lack scalability, while learning-based methods scale but do not guarantee safety. We propose a novel algorithm to achieve safe and scalable control for multiple agents under limited actuation. Specifically, our approach includes: ($i$) learning a decentralized neural Integral Control Barrier function (neural ICBF) for scalable, input-constrained control, (ii) embedding a lightweight decentralized Model Predictive Control-based Integral Control Barrier Function (MPC-ICBF) into the neural network policy to ensure safety while maintaining scalability, and (iii) introducing a novel method to minimize deadlocks based on gradient-based optimization techniques from machine learning to address local minima in deadlocks. Our numerical simulations show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent control algorithms in terms of safety, input constraint satisfaction, and minimizing deadlocks. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization across scenarios with varying agent counts, scaling up to 1000 agents. Videos and code are available at https://maicbf.github.io/.
