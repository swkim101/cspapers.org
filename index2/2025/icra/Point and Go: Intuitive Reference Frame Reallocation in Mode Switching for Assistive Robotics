Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive ‘point and go’ translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines position control with a refined endeffector oriented frame that provides precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced completion times by 31%, pauses by 41%, and mode switches by 33%, while receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.
