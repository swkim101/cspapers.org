While wearable robots that utilize intrinsically soft materials for actuation offer enhanced safety and biological compatibility, the challenges of sensing and control significantly affect their performance. The control problem in such systems is inherently complex, and the inclusion of 'softness' introduces additional nonlinearities, hysteresis, and uncertainties. Furthermore, the effectiveness of control strategies is highly dependent on sensor selection and integration, which presents its own challenges. Most robotic systems require separate sensors for control purposes. In this study, a new sensing and control scheme are introduced for soft wearable robots, leveraging the intrinsic soft-sensing capability of fluidic filament actuators without adding computational complexity. This method enables simultaneous sensing and actuation with $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ position accuracy, even under physical disturbances. This approach is demonstrated with a soft assistive device for elbow flexion/extension, achieving 70.5% tracking accuracy and a 0.09s response delay to human intention, ensuring the system provides minimal resistance when assistance is not needed, while delivering the required support when necessary.
