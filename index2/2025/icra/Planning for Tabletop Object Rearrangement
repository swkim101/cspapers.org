Finding an high-quality solution for the tabletop object rearrangement planning is a challenging problem. Compared to determining a goal arrangement [1], rearrangement planning is challenging due to the dependencies between objects and the buffer capacity available to hold objects. Although [3] has proposed an A* based searching strategy with lazy evaluation for the high-quality solution, it is not scalable, with the success rate decreasing as the number of objects increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced A*-based algorithm that improves state representation and employs incremental goal attempts with lazy evaluation at each iteration. This approach aims to enhance scalability while maintaining solution quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm can provide superior solutions compared to [3], in a shorter time, for both stationary and mobile robots.
