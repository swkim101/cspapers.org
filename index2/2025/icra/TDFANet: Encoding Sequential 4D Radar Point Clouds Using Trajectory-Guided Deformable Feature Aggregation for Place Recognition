Place recognition is essential for achieving closedloop or global positioning in autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multimodal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features. Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multiscale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated. Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments. Source codes are available.
