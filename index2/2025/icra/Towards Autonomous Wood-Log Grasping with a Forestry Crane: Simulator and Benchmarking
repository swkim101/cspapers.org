Forestry machines operated in forest production environments face challenges when performing manipulation tasks, especially regarding the complicated dynamics of underactuated crane systems and the heavy weight of logs to be grasped. This study investigates the feasibility of using reinforcement learning for forestry crane manipulators in grasping and lifting heavy wood logs autonomously. We first build a simulator using Mujoco physics engine to create realistic scenarios, including modeling a forestry crane with 8 degrees of freedom from CAD data and wood logs of different sizes. We further implement a velocity controller for autonomous log grasping with deep reinforcement learning using a curriculum strategy. Utilizing our new simulator, the proposed control strategy exhibits a success rate of 96% when grasping logs of different diameters and under random initial configurations of the forestry crane. In addition, reward functions and reinforcement learning baselines are implemented to provide an open-source benchmark for the community in large-scale manipulation tasks.
