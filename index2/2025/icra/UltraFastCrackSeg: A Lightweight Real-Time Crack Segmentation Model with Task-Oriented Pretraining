Crack segmentation is pivotal for structural health monitoring, enabling the timely maintenance of critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads. However, existing deep learning models are often too computationally intensive for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we introduce UltraFastCrackSeg, a lightweight model designed for real-time crack segmentation that effectively balances high accuracy with low computational demands. Featuring an efficient encoder-decoder architecture, our model significantly reduces parameter count and floating-point operations (FLOPs) compared to current methods, as illustrated in Figure 1. We further enhance performance through a self-supervised pretraining approach that employs a novel, task-oriented masking strategy, thereby improving feature extraction. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that UltraFastCrackSeg achieves state-of-the-art Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 scores while maintaining a compact model size and high inference speed. Evaluations on a low-power CPU device confirm its capability to achieve up to 80 frames per second (FPS) with ONNX runtime optimization, making it highly suitable for real-time, on-site applications. These findings establish UltraFastCrackSeg as a robust and efficient solution for practical crack detection tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/weiqingq/UltraFastCrackSeg.
