Individuals with Severe Speech and Motor Impairment (SSMI) struggle to interact with their surroundings due to physical and communicative limitations. To address these challenges, this paper presents a gaze-controlled robotic system that helps SSMI users perform stamp printing tasks. The system includes gaze-controlled interfaces and a robotic arm with a gripper, designed specifically for SSMI users to enhance accessibility and interaction. User studies with gazecontrolled interfaces such as video see-through (VST), video pass-through (VPT), and optical see-through (OST) displays demonstrated the system's effectiveness. Results showed that VST had the average stamping time of $28.45 s(SD = 15.44s)$ and the average stamp count $7.36(SD = 3.83)$, outperforming VPT and OST.
