Point cloud completion is crucial for reconstructing accurate shapes in many 3D visual applications. Recent approaches incorporate images into the completion pipeline, introducing geometric clues and global constraints. However, their fusion processes often fail to reconstruct detailed parts and maintain global consistency simultaneously. Except for images, text is another important clue for recognizing the target's characteristics. Thus, in this work, we propose to combine multiple modalities including points, images and texts for point cloud completion. Specifically, inspired by recently pre-trained large language models, we generate the description texts for images by Visual Question Answering (VQA) models and introduce Visual-Textual Embedding (VTE) models to extract joint features of image-text pairs. Furthermore, we describe the edge geometric patterns by multi-scale edge convolution to guide the refinement of shapes in local areas. Then we adopt cross attention mechanism to effectively fuse multi-modal features and refine the coarse shape. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate our method's superior performance over previous uni-modal and cross-modal methods.
