As 4D extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) emerge as groundbreaking techniques for dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis in robotics and computer vision, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of these assets becomes crucial. While steganography has advanced significantly in 2D and 3D media, existing methods are inadequate for the complex, dynamic nature of 4D-GS representations. To address this gap, we propose Hide-in-Motion, a novel 4D steganography method for hiding information through deformation in Gaussian splatting. Our approach introduces a composite attribute and a Decouple Feature Field for coarse-to-fine deformation modeling and embedding implicit information, along with an Opacity-Guided Adaptive strategy. Hide-in-Motion overcomes the limitations of previous techniques, enhancing both the robustness of embedded information and the quality of 4D reconstruction. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully embeds and recovers implicit information across various modalities while maintaining high rendering quality in dynamic scenes. This work not only advances copyright protection and secure data transmission for 4D assets but also paves the way for enhancing the security and integrity of 4D digital assets.
