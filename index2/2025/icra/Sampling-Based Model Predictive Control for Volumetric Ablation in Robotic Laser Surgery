Laser-based surgical ablation relies heavily on surgeon involvement, restricting precision to the limits of human error and perception. The interaction between laser and tissue is governed by various laser parameters that control the laser irradiance on the tissue, including the power, distance, spot size, orientation, and exposure time. This complex interaction lends itself to robotic automation, allowing the surgeon to focus on high-level tasks, such as choosing the region and method of ablation, while the lower-level ablation plan can be handled autonomously. This paper describes a sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme to plan ablation sequences for arbitrary tissue volumes. Using a steady-state point ablation model to simulate a single laser-tissue interaction, a random search technique explores the reachable state space while preserving sensitive tissue regions. The sampled MPC strategy provides an ablation sequence that accounts for parameter uncertainty without violating constraints, such as avoiding nerve bundles.
