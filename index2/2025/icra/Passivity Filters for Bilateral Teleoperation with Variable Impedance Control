In robotic teleoperation, it is crucial to be able to dynamically adjust interactions with the environment. Drawing inspiration from human behavior during interactions, Variable Impedance Control (VIC) has been widely adopted to enhance robotic flexibility and adaptability. However, maintaining the passivity of such control systems remains a critical safety concern. This paper introduces an optimization-based framework for passive variable impedance control in bilateral teleoperation, combining the advantages of Passivity Filters (PFs), Time-Domain Passivity (TDP) control, and Passive-Set-Position-Modulation (PSPM). The method solves an optimization problem aimed at dissipating the energy that could lead to a lack of passivity. The proposed method is assessed through experiments, illustrating its ability to keep the teleoperation system passive and safe under a variable impedance profile.
