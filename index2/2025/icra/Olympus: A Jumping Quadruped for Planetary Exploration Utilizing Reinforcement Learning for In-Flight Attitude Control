Exploring planetary bodies with lower gravity, such as the moon and Mars, allows legged robots to utilize jumping as an efficient form of locomotion thus giving them a valuable advantage over traditional rovers for exploration. Motivated by this fact, this paper presents the design, simulation, and learning-based “in-flight” attitude control of Olympus, a jumping legged robot tailored to the gravity of Mars. First, the design requirements are outlined followed by detailing how simulation enabled optimizing the robot's design - from its legs to the overall configuration - towards high vertical jumping, forward jumping distance, and in-flight attitude reorientation. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning policy used to track desired in-flight attitude maneuvers is presented. Successfully crossing the sim2real gap, extensive experimental studies of attitude reorientation tests are demonstrated.
