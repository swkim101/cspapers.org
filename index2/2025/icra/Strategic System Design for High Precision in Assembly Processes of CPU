Robotic picking and placing played an essential role in Industrial 4.0 and have long been recognized as significant contributions to industrial processes. Various scenarios involve picking and placing parts for assembly in industrial production, such as assembling different electronic components in the manufacturing process. Those tasks require high precision to complete. However, achieving high precision in the assembly of CPUs poses a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with reflective surfaces. This paper presents a strategic system design tailored to address these challenges effectively. We focus on system device choice and optimizing the key parameters of the sensor system to strike a balance between device cost and the required precision. We use methods to construct the whole robot manipulation system, such as geometric segmentation, binocular vision with structure light projection and, based on 3D information, 6D pose estimation to construct the system. The results of our study demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of this strategic system design in industrial settings. By meeting strict system accuracy requirements, our approach contributes to advancing industry practices and growing its impact on society.
