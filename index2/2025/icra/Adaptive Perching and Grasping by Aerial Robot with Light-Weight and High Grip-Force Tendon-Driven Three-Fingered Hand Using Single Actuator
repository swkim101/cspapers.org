Aerial robots, especially multirotor type, have been utilized in various scenarios such as inspection, surveillance, and logistics. The most critical issue for multirotor type is the limited flight time due to the large power consumption to hover against gravity. Inspired by nature, various research areas focus on the perching and grasping ability by deploying a gripper on the multirotor to grasp arboreal environments to save energy; however, most of the mechanical design for gripper restricts the approach path, significantly limiting the performance of perching and grasping. In addition, it is also challenging to design a light gripper that also offers sufficiently large grip force to hang itself. Therefore, in this work, we develop a single-actuator hand for aerial robot that enables adaptive grasping of various objects, and thus can perch from various approach directions. First, we present the design of the lightweight three-fingered hand with a pair of special two-dimensional differential plates that enables adaptive grasping with a single actuator. In addition, we develop a unique control method for the over-actuated aerial robot equipped with this hand to perform both adaptive pendulum-like perching and detachment. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the prototype hand via load bearing and object grasping experiments, along with in-flight perching experiments.
