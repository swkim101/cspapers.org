This paper presents a robust control algorithm for precise orientation control of robot manipulators using a disturbance observer (DOB) specifically designed for orientation dynamics. Our approach addresses the challenges of 3D orientation control by incorporating various orientation representations, such as Euler angles, quaternions, and exponential coordinates, and analyzing their impact on DOB performance. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving high-precision orientation control under uncertainties and disturbances. This work offers a comprehensive framework for robust orientation control, advancing the application of DOB in complex robotic tasks.
