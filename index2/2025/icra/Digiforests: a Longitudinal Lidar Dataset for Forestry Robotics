Forests are vital to our ecosystems, acting as carbon sinks, climate stabilizers, biodiversity centers, and wood sources. Due to their scale, monitoring and managing forests takes a lot of work. Forestry robotics offers the potential for enabling efficient and sustainable foresting practices through automation. Despite increasing interest in this field, the scarcity of robotics datasets and benchmarks in forest environments is hampering progress in this domain. In this paper, we present a real-world, longitudinal dataset for forestry robotics that enables the development and comparison of approaches for various relevant applications, ranging from semantic interpretation to estimating traits relevant to forestry management. The dataset consists of multiple recordings of the same plots in a forest in Switzerland during three different growth periods. We recorded the data with a mobile 3D LiDAR scanning setup. Additionally, we provide semantic annotations of trees, shrubs, and ground, instance-level annotations of trees, as well as more fine-grained annotations of tree stems and crowns. Furthermore, we provide reference field measurements of traits relevant to forestry management for a subset of the trees. Together with the data, we also provide open-source baseline panoptic segmentation and tree trait estimation approaches to enable the community to bootstrap further research and simplify comparisons in this domain.
