We introduce a learning-guided motion planning framework that generates seed trajectories using a diffusion model for trajectory optimization. Given a workspace, our method approximates the configuration space (C-space) obstacles through an environment representation consisting of a sparse set of task-related key configurations, which is then used as a conditioning input to the diffusion model. The diffusion model integrates regularization terms that encourage smooth, collision-free trajectories during training, and trajectory optimization refines the generated seed trajectories to correct any colliding segments. Our experimental results demonstrate that high-quality trajectory priors, learned through our C-space-grounded diffusion model, enable the efficient generation of collision-free trajectories in narrow-passage environments, outperforming previous learning- and planning-based baselines.
