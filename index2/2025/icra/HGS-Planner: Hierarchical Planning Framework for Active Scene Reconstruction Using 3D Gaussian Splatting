In complex missions such as search and rescue, robots must make intelligent decisions in unknown environments, relying on their ability to perceive and understand their surroundings. High-quality and real-time reconstruction enhances situational awareness and is crucial for intelligent robotics. Traditional methods often struggle with poor scene representation or are too slow for real-time use. Inspired by the efficacy of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we propose a hierarchical planning framework for fast and high-fidelity active reconstruction. Our method evaluates completion and quality gain to adaptively guide reconstruction, integrating global and local planning for efficiency. Experiments in simulated and realworld environments show our approach outperforms existing real-time methods.
