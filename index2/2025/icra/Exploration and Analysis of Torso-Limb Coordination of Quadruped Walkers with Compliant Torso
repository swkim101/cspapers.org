Quadrupeds exhibit remarkable locomotion performance through the coordination between their limbs and torso. From past biological knowledge, it is understood that during walking, the forelimbs primarily contribute to braking, while the hindlimb are responsible for propulsion. However, in the field of quadruped robot dynamics, effectively leveraging this coordination remains a challenge. To investigate the torso-limb coordination, this study explores the walking performance of a quadruped walker with a compliant torso, driven by the forelimb or the hindlimb. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the walking behavior under different control drive methods. The findings provide insights into the design of compliant-bodied robots and the optimal distribution of propulsion forces between the forelimbs and hindlimbs.
