We present an end-to-end framework for planning tight assembly operations, where the input is a set of digital models, and the output is a full execution plan for a physical robotic arm, including the trajectory placement and the grasping. The framework builds on our earlier results on tight assembly plan-ning for free-flying objects and includes the following novel components: (i) the framework itself together with physical demon-strations, (ii) trajectory placement based on novel dynamic path-wise IK and (iii) post processing of the free-flying paths to relax the tightness and smooth the path. The framework provides guarantees as to the quality of the outcome trajectory. For each component we provide the algorithmic details and a full open-source software package for reproducing the process. Lastly, we demonstrate the framework with tight and challenging assembly problems (as well as puzzles, which are planned to be hard to assemble), using a UR5e robotic arm in the real world and in simulation. See the figure at the top for a physical UR5e assembling the alpha-z puzzle (known to be considerably more complicated to assemble than the celebrated alpha puzzle). Full video clips of all the assembly demonstrations together with our open source software are available at our project page: https://tau-cgl.github.io/Full-Cycle-Assembly-Operation/
