Over the past decades, the development of tactile sensors has gained increasing attention and has gradually become a fundamental device for robots. Especially in today's context where human-robot interaction demands are growing and the requirements for tactile perception are becoming stricter, how to enable robots to better perceive their environment has become a topic worth discussing. Tactile sensors, after years of development, have emerged in two main types: taxel-based and vision-based sensors, where the latter can provide relatively low resolution (LR) tactile patterns compared with the former. Both of them have seen significant enhancements in their tactile perception capabilities on flat and regular surfaces. However, as application scenarios expand, current flat tactile perception can no longer meet the robots' needs for multi-dimensional and complex perception capabilities. Therefore, we investigate the high-resolution (HR) reconstruction of non-planar tactile patterns captured by LR taxel-based sensors in this paper. We first develop a new dataset, where the ground truth of non-planar tactile patterns are obtained with a vision-based GelSight Mini tactile sensor, and the LR data are collected via a commercial taxel-based Xela sensor. In addition, we propose to adapt the state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based tactile super-resolution model of flat/planar surfaces to the non-planar scenario, and also develop a diffusion-based model for the nonplanar HR reconstruction. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed models.
