Ultra-wideband (UWB) is gaining popularity with devices like AirTags for precise home item localization but faces significant challenges when scaled to large environments like seaports. The main challenges are calibration and localization under obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a one-shot calibration and localization framework based on UWB-LiDAR fusion. Our method uses Gaussian processes to estimate the anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with only one round of sampling in large-scale areas, i.e., $600 \times 450 ~\mathrm{m}^{2}$. With LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where the UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fail, as shown in the video https://https://youtu.be/oY8jQKdM7lU. We will open-source our datasets and calibration codes for community use.
