This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory network-based Fluid Experiment Data-Driven model (FEDLSTM) for predicting unsteady, nonlinear hydrodynamic forces on the underwater quadruped robot we constructed. Trained on experimental data from leg force and body drag tests conducted in both a recirculating water tank and a towing tank, FED-LSTM outperforms traditional Empirical Formulas (EF) commonly used for flow prediction over flat surfaces. The model demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability in capturing complex fluid dynamics, particularly in straightline and turning-gait optimizations via the NSGA-II algorithm. FED-LSTM reduces deflection errors during straight-line swimming and improves turn times without increasing the turning radius. Hardware experiments further validate the model's precision and stability over EF. This approach provides a robust framework for enhancing the swimming performance of legged robots, laying the groundwork for future advances in underwater robotic locomotion.
