Haptic devices are widely used as control interfaces for robotic teleoperation, offering intuitive rendering of interactions between remote robot and environment. In particular, cutaneous feedback devices provide intrinsic stability and reduced form factor compared to kinesthetic feedback interfaces. However, the implementation of cutaneous feedback devices in industrial settings must be rigorously validated to prevent potential equipment accidents, which could lead to substantial economic losses due to unskilled robot manipulation. This paper presents a novel ungrounded haptic control interface (POstick-VF), designed specifically for high-risk steel production tasks. POstick-VF offers visuo-tactile feedback within an extensive workspace, enabling intuitive robot manipulation through its kinematic similarity with real tools ensuring safety. The performance of the developed POstick is rigorously validated and compared with conventional joystick controller through experiments conducted with an on-site hydraulic robot.
