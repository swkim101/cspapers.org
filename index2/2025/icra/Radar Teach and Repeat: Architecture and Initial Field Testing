Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) scanning radar has emerged as an alternative to spinning LiDAR for state estimation on mobile robots. Radar's longer wavelength is less affected by small particulates, providing operational advantages in challenging environments such as dust, smoke, and fog. This paper presents Radar Teach and Repeat (RT&R): a full-stack radar system for long-term off-road robot autonomy. RT&R can drive routes reliably in off-road cluttered areas without any GPS. We benchmark the radar system's closed-loop path-tracking performance and compare it to its 3D LiDAR counterpart. 11.8 km of autonomous driving was completed without interventions using only radar and gyro for navigation. RT&R was evaluated on four different routes with progressively less structured scene geometry. RT&R achieved lateral path-tracking root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 5.6 cm, 7.5 cm, and 12.1 cm as the routes became more challenging. These RMSE values are less than half of the width of one tire (24 cm) on our robot testing platform. These same routes have worst-case errors of 21.7 cm, 24.0 cm, and 43.8 cm. We conclude that radar is a viable alternative to LiDAR for long-term autonomy in challenging off-road scenarios. The implementation of RT&R is open-source and available at: https://github.com/utiasASRL/vtr3.
