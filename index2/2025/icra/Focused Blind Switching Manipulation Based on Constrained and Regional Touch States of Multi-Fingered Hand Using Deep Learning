To achieve a desired grasping posture (including object position and orientation), multi-finger motions need to be conducted according to the the current touch state. Specifically, when subtle changes happen during correcting the object state, not only proprioception but also tactile information from the entire hand can be beneficial. However, switching motions with high-DOFs of multiple fingers and abundant tactile information is still challenging. In this study, we propose a loss function with constraints of touch states and an attention mechanism for focusing on important modalities depending on the touch states. The policy model is AE-LSTM which consists of Autoencoder (AE) which compresses abundant tactile information and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which switches the motion depending on the touch states. Motion for cap-opening was chosen as a target task which consists of sub tasks of sliding an object and opening its cap. As a result, the proposed method achieved the best success rates with a variety of objects for real time cap-opening manipulation. Furthermore, we could confirm that the proposed model acquired the features of each subtask and attention on specific modalities.
