This paper presents the Spinning Blimp, a novel lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial vehicle designed for low-energy stable flight. Using an oblate spheroid helium balloon for buoyancy, the vehicle achieves minimal energy consumption while maintaining prolonged airborne states. The unique and low-cost design employs a passively arranged wing coupled with a propeller to induce a spinning behavior, providing inherent pendulum-like stabilization. We propose a control strategy that takes advantage of the continuous revolving nature of the spinning blimp to control translational motion. The cost-effectiveness of the vehicle makes it highly suitable for a variety of applications, such as patrolling, localization, air and turbulence monitoring, and domestic surveillance. Experimental evaluations affirm the design's efficacy and underscore its potential as a versatile and economically viable solution for aerial applications.
