We explore a navigation planning problem under uncertainty for a simple robot with extremely limited sensing. Our robot can turn subject to significant proportional error and move forward. As it moves in an environment with a known terrain map, the robot can detect changes in the terrain at its current position. Given an initial pose and a goal segment, the robot should find some sequence of actions to travel reliably from start to goal, if such a sequence exists. The resulting plan should guarantee the robot reaches the goal segment despite any movement errors experienced within some known error bound. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find such an action sequence, implement and evaluate this algorithm, and present evidence for the feasibility of such an algorithm in an underwater navigation setting.
