Language models (LMs) possess a strong capability to comprehend natural language, making them effective in translating human instructions into detailed plans for simple robot tasks. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge to handle long-horizon tasks, especially in subtask identification and allocation for cooperative heterogeneous robot teams. To address this issue, we propose a Language Model-Driven MultiAgent PDDL Planner (LaMMA-P), a novel multi-agent task planning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon tasks. LaMMA-P integrates the strengths of the LMs' reasoning capability and the traditional heuristic search planner to achieve a high success rate and efficiency while demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Additionally, we create MAT-THOR, a comprehensive benchmark that features household tasks with two different levels of complexity based on the AI2-THOR environment. The experimental results demonstrate that LaMMA-P achieves a 105% higher success rate and 36 % higher efficiency than existing LM-based multiagent planners.
