Navigating large-scale outdoor environments requires complex reasoning in terms of geometric structures, environmental semantics, and terrain characteristics, which are typically captured by onboard sensors such as LiDAR and cameras. While current mobile robots can navigate such environments using pre-defined, high-precision maps based on hand-crafted rules catered for the specific environment, they lack commonsense reasoning capabilities, especially the traversability analysis, that most humans possess when navigating unknown outdoor spaces. To address this gap, we introduce the Global Navigation Dataset (GND), a large-scale dataset that integrates multi-modal sensory data, including 3D LiDAR point clouds and RGB and 360° images, as well as multi-category traversability maps (pedestrian walkways, vehicle roadways, stairs, off-road terrain, and obstacles) from ten university campuses. These environments encompass a variety of parks, urban settings, elevation changes, and campus layouts of different scales. The dataset covers approximately $2.7 ~\text{km}^{2}$ and includes at least 350 buildings in total. We also present a set of novel applications of GND to showcase its utility to enable global robot navigation, such as map-based global navigation, mapless navigation, and global place recognition.
