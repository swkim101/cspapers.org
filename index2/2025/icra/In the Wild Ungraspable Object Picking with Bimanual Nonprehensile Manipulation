Picking diverse objects in the real world is a fundamental robotics skill. However, many objects in such settings are bulky, heavy, or irregularly shaped, making them ungraspable by conventional end effectors like suction grippers and parallel jaw grippers (PJGs). In this paper, we expand the range of pickable items without hardware modifications using bimanual nonprehensile manipulation. We focus on a grocery shopping scenario, where a bimanual mobile manipulator equipped with a suction gripper and a PJG is tasked with re-trieving ungraspable items from tightly packed grocery shelves. From visual observations, our method first identifies optimal grasp points based on force closure and friction constraints. If the grasp points are occluded, a series of nonprehensile nudging motions are performed to clear the obstruction. A bimanual grasp utilizing contacts on the side of the end effectors is then executed to grasp the target item. In our replica grocery store, we achieved a 90% success rate over 102 trials in uncluttered scenes, and a 67 % success rate over 45 trials in cluttered scenes. We also deployed our system to a real-world grocery store and successfully picked previously unseen items. Our results highlight the potential of bimanual nonprehensile manipulation for in-the-wild robotic picking tasks. A video summarizing this work can be found at youtu. be/gOhOrDuK8jM.
