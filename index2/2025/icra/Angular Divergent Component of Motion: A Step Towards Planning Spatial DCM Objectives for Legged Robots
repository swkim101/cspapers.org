In this work, the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) method is expanded to include angular coordinates for the first time. This work introduces the idea of spatial DCM, which adds an angular objective to the existing linear DCM theory. To incorporate the angular component into the framework, a discussion is provided on extending beyond the linear motion of the Linear Inverted Pendulum model (LIPM) towards the Single Rigid Body model (SRBM) for DCM. This work presents the angular DCM theory for a 1D rotation, simplifying the SRBM rotational dynamics to a flywheel to satisfy necessary linearity constraints. The 1D angular DCM is mathematically identical to the linear DCM and defined as an angle which is ahead of the current body rotation based on the angular velocity. This theory is combined into a 3D linear and 1D angular DCM framework, with discussion on the feasibility of simultaneously achieving both sets of objectives. A simulation in MATLAB and hardware results on the TORO humanoid are presented to validate the framework's performance.
