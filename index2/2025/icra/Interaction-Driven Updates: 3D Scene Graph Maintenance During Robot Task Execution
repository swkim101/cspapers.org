Robots powered by large language model (LLM) demonstrate significant research and application potential by effectively interpreting scene information to respond to human commands. However, when robots rely on static scene information during task execution, they face difficulties in adapting to changes in the environment, posing a major challenge for dynamic scene perception. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative interaction-driven approach to enhance robots' ability to perceive dynamic scene information. This approach consists of two contributions, the observation point selection module and the dynamic scene maintenance module. Specifically, first, the robot uses the 3D scene graph (3DSG) containing assets and objects to perceive static scene information through the LLM planner. Next, the best observation point for each asset is obtained through the observation point selection module. Then, with the help of the best observation point, the dynamic scene maintenance module interacts with the asset-related objects to dynamically update all the object node information related to the asset node. This approach enables robots to maintain dynamic scene information, enhancing their adaptability in unpredictable environments and improving task reliability. We evaluated our method using the iTHOR and RoboTHOR datasets within the AI2-THOR simulator and in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively and accurately maintains robots' perception of dynamic scene information.
