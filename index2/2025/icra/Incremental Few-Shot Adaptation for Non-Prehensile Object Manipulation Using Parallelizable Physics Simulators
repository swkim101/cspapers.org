Few-shot adaptation is an important capability for intelligent robots that perform tasks in open-world settings such as everyday environments or flexible production. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for non-prehensile manipulation which incrementally adapts a physics-based dynamics model for model-predictive control (MPC). The model prediction is aligned with a few examples of robot-object interactions collected with the MPC. This is achieved by using a parallelizable rigid-body physics simulation as dynamic world model and sampling-based optimization of the model parameters. In turn, the optimized dynamics model can be used for MPC using efficient sampling-based optimization. We evaluate our fewshot adaptation approach in object pushing experiments in simulation and with a real robot.
