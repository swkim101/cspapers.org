Size reconfigurable robots have been introduced for coverage applications to improve performance. The size reconfiguration ability allows a robot to access narrow areas in a smaller size while covering open spaces in a larger size, improving productivity. This paper proposes a novel CPP method consisting of an Overlapping Reduction Criterion (ORC) and a Reconfiguration Reduction Criterion (RRC) for a size-reconfigurable robot to improve performance in dynamic workspaces. A Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network (GBNN) is adapted to guide the robot toward unvisited cells considering neural activity variation. The size variation is managed by utilizing a collection of grid maps generated for various size configurations of the robot. The RRC and ORC penalize the movements requiring size reconfigurations or creating isolated unvisited regions in the decision-making process of next movement selection yielding to reduce reconfigurations and overlapping. According to the results, the proposed CPP method surpasses state of the art in terms of performance indexes reconfiguration count, overlapping, path distance, and coverage time by significant margins.
