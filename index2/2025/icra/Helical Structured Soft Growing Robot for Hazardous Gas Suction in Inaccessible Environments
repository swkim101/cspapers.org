Immediate removal of hazardous gases is critical for ensuring safety. Traditional methods, such as portable ventilation equipment, are difficult to use when hazardous gases are released in inaccessible environments. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism that integrates an inflatable helical structure into a soft growing robot. The proposed mechanism is capable of performing suction through its inner channel after navigating complex environments, while maintaining the inherent advantages of the soft growing robot as it grows. The mechanism operates in two phases: a growing phase, in which the robot extends by eversion, and a suction phase, in which suction is performed through the inner channel of the robot. Experiments and demonstrations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. The experimental results confirmed the ability to maintain the passageway shape of the inner channel during suction operations and provided a design guideline. The demonstration validated that the mechanism can effectively navigate inaccessible environments and perform suction to remove hazardous gases.
