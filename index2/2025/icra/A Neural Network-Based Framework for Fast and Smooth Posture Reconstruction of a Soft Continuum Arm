A neural network-based framework is developed and experimentally demonstrated for the problem of estimating the shape of a soft continuum arm (SCA) from noisy measurements of the pose at a finite number of locations along the length of the arm. The neural network takes as input these measurements and produces as output a finitedimensional approximation of the strain, which is further used to reconstruct the infinite-dimensional smooth posture. This problem is important for various soft robotic applications. It is challenging due to the flexible aspects that lead to the infinitedimensional reconstruction problem for the continuous posture and strains. Because of this, past solutions to this problem are computationally intensive. The proposed fast smooth reconstruction method is shown to be five orders of magnitude faster while having comparable accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two testbeds: a simulated octopus muscular arm and a physical BR2 pneumatic soft manipulator.
