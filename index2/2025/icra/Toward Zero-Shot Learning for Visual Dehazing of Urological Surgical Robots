Robot-assisted surgery has profoundly influenced current forms of minimally invasive surgery. However, in transurethral urological surgical robots, they need to work in a liquid environment. This causes vaporization of the liquid when shearing and heating is performed, resulting in bubble atomization that affects the visual perception of the robot. This can lead to the need for uninterrupted pauses in the surgical procedure, which makes the surgery take longer. To address the atomization characteristics of liquids under urological surgical robotic vision, we propose an unsupervised zero-shot dehaze method (RSF-Dehaze). Specifically, the proposed Region Similarity Filling Module (RSFM) of RSF-Dehaze significantly improves the recovery of blurred region tissues. In addition, we organize and propose a dehaze dataset for robotic vision in urological surgery (USRobot-Dehaze dataset). In particular, this dataset contains the three most common urological surgical robot operation scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to organize and propose a publicly available dehaze dataset for urological surgical robot vision. The proposed RSF-Dehaze proves the effectiveness of our method in three urological surgical robot operation scenarios with extensive comparative experiments with 20 most classical and advanced dehazing and image recovery algorithms. The proposed source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wurenkai/RSF-Dehaze.
