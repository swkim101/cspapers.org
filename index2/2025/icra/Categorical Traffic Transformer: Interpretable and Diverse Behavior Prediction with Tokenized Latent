Adept traffic models are critical to both real-time prediction/planning and closed-loop simulation for autonomous vehicles (AV). Key design objectives include accuracy, diverse multimodal behaviors, interpretability, and compatibility with other modules in the autonomy stack, e.g., the downstream planner. We present Categorical Traffic Transformer (CTT), a traffic model that outputs both continuous trajectory predictions and categorical predictions with clear semantic meanings (lane modes, homotopies, etc.). The most outstanding feature of CTT is its fully interpretable latent space, which enables direct supervision of the latent variables from the ground truth during training and avoids mode collapse completely. As a result, CTT can generate diverse behaviors conditioned on different semantic modes while significantly beating SOTA on prediction accuracy. In addition, CTT's ability to input and output tokens enables direct integration with semantic-heavy modules such as behavior planners and language models, bridging the tokenized representation and the continuous trajectory space.
