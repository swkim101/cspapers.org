A common robotics sensing problem is to place sensors to robustly monitor a set of assets, where robustness is assured by requiring asset $p$ to be monitored by at least $\kappa(p)$ sen-sors. Given $n$ assets that must be observed by $m$ sensors, each with a disk-shaped sensing region, where should the sensors be placed to minimize the total area observed? We provide and analyze a fast heuristic for this problem. We then use the heuristic to initialize an exact Integer Program-ming solution. Subsequently, we enforce separation constraints between the sensors by modifying the integer program formulation and by changing the disk candidate set.
