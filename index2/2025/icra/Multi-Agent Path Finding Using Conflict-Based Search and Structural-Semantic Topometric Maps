As industries increasingly adopt large robotic fleets, there is a pressing need for computationally efficient, practical, and optimal conflict-free path planning for multiple robots. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular method for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) due to its completeness and optimality; however, it is often impractical for real-world applications, as it is computationally intensive to solve and relies on assumptions about agents and operating environments that are difficult to realize. This article proposes a solution to overcome computational challenges and practicality issues of CBS by utilizing structural-semantic topometric maps. Instead of running CBS over large grid-based maps, the proposed solution runs CBS over a sparse topometric map containing structural-semantic cells representing intersections, pathways, and dead ends. This approach significantly accelerates the MAPF process and reduces the number of conflict resolutions handled by CBS while operating in continuous time. In the proposed method, robots are assigned time ranges to move between topometric regions, departing from the traditional CBS assumption that a robot can move to any connected cell in a single time step. The approach is validated through real-world multi-robot path-finding experiments and benchmarking simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed MAPF method can be applied to real-world non-holonomic robots and yields significant improvement in computational efficiency compared to traditional CBS methods while improving conflict detection and resolution in cases of corridor symmetries.
