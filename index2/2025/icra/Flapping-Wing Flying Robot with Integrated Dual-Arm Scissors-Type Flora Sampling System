The flapping-wing robotic birds were inspired by nature to present an alternative way of thrust and lift generation instead of conventional high-speed rotary propellers in unmanned aerial platforms. The advances in flapping technology recently led to the prototyping of leg-claw mechanisms for perching and occasionally very lightweight arms for sampling or tiny object aerial manipulation. A dual-arm manipulator on top of a robotic bird might not be bio-inspired and safe in case of a collision with the environment or human-robot interaction. Here in this work, the previously designed dual-arm scissors-type manipulator has been improved in terms of workspace, mechanism, vision system, and blade placement to present a more natural way of sampling. The new dual-arm, with 100.2(g) weight, is redesigned inside a beak to have protection against possible collisions and also secure the cutting blades within a protected shield. During the flight, the dual-arm system is inside the cover and invisible; the lower beak is opened before manipulation and sets out the arm in a proper place for sampling. This new safety cover (beak) along with the new blade mechanism enhanced the cutting power and the safety of the operation. The experimental results show the successful cutting of a series of plant samples.
