This work establishes the concept of commonsense scene composition, with a focus on extending Belief Scene Graphs by estimating the spatial distribution of unseen objects. Specifically, the commonsense scene composition capability refers to the understanding of the spatial relationships among related objects in the scene, which in this article is modeled as a joint probability distribution for all possible locations of the semantic object class. The proposed framework includes two variants of a Correlation Information (CECI) model for learning probability distributions: (i) a baseline approach based on a Graph Convolutional Network, and (ii) a neuro-symbolic extension that integrates a spatial ontology based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, this article provides a detailed description of the dataset generation process for such tasks. Finally, the framework has been validated through multiple runs on simulated data, as well as in a real-world indoor environment, demonstrating its ability to spatially interpret scenes across different room types.
