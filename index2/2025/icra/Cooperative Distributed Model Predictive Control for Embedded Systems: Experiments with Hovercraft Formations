This paper presents experiments for embedded cooperative distributed model predictive control applied to a team of hovercraft floating on an air hockey table. The hovercraft collectively solve a centralized optimal control problem in each sampling step via a stabilizing decentralized real-time iteration scheme using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The efficient implementation does not require a central coordinator, executes onboard the hovercraft, and facilitates sampling intervals in the millisecond range. The formation control experiments showcase the flexibility of the approach on scenarios with point-to-point transitions, trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, and moving obstacles.
