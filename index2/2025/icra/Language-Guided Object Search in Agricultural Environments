Creating robots that can assist in farms and gardens can help reduce the mental and physical workload experienced by farm workers. We tackle the problem of object search in a farm environment, providing a method that allows a robot to semantically reason about the location of an unseen target object among a set of previously seen objects in the environment using a Large Language Model (LLM). We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path through the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate our target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without needing high-level room or area-level semantic relationships. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed a current state-of-the-art baseline and our ablations. Our offline testing yielded an average path efficiency of 84 %, reflecting how closely the predicted path aligns with the ideal path. Upon deploying our system on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a real-world farm environment, we found that our system had a success rate of 80 %, with a success weighted by path length of 0.67, which demonstrates a reasonable trade-off between task success and path efficiency under real-world conditions.
