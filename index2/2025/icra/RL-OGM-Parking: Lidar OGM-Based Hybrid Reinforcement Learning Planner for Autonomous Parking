Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving research and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the real-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy, consisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learningbased reinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDARbased Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) representation is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real gap, leading the hybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted extensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world scenarios, and the result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms pure rule-based and learningbased methods. The real-world experiment further validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.
