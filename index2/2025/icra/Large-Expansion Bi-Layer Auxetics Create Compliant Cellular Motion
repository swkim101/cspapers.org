There is significant interest in creating compliant modular robots that can change their volume. Inspired by how biological cells move, these systems can potentially combine the resilience of modular robotics with the increased environmental interactions of soft robotics. However, current versions have limited speed, expansion, and portability. In this paper, we address these concerns through AuxSwarm, a compliant system composed of auxetic-based robotic voxels. These voxels control their volume through a scissor-like bi-layer auxetic design, growing up to 1.57 times their original size in 0.2 seconds. This combination of speed and expansion is unique across modular soft robots, enabling dynamic locomotion capabilities. We characterize the voxels and demonstrate the versatility of this approach through case studies of 2D bending and 3D cube flipping. AuxSwarm provides a first step towards addressable voxel-based smart materials, while simultaneously addressing the robustness and actuation challenges faced by soft robots.
