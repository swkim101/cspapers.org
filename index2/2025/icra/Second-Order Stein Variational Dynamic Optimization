We present a novel second-order trajectory optimization algorithm based on Stein Variational Newton's Method and Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming. The proposed algorithm, called Stein Variational Differential Dynamic Programming, is a kernel-based extension of Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming that combines the best of the two worlds of sampling-based and gradient-based optimization. The resulting algorithm avoids known drawbacks of gradient-based dynamic optimization in terms of getting stuck at local minima, while it overcomes limitations of sampling-based stochastic optimization in terms of introducing undesirable stochasticity when applied in online fashion. To test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, experiments are conducted in Model Predictive Control mode. The experiments include comparisons with unimodal and multimodal Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming as well as Model Predictive Path Integral Control and its multimodal and Stein Variational extensions. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms and confirm the hypothesis that there is a middle ground between sampling-and gradient-based optimization that is indeed beneficial for dynamic optimization.
