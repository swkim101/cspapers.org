The prevailing and most effective approach to teleoperate a robotic arm involves a direct position-to-position mapping, imposing robotic end-effector movements that mirrors those of the user, Fig. 1-top. However, due to this one-to-one mapping, the robot's motions are limited by the user's capability, particularly in translation. Drawing inspiration from head pointers utilized in the 1980s, originally designed to enable drawing with limited head motions for tetraplegic individuals, we proposed a “virtual wand” mapping which could be used by participants with reduced mobility. This mapping employs a virtual rigid linkage between the hand and the robot's endeffector, Fig. 1-bottom. With this approach, rotations produce amplified translations through a lever arm, creating a “rotation-to-position” coupling and expanding the translation workspace at the expense of a reduced rotation space. In this study, we compare the virtual wand approach to the one-to-one position mapping through the realization of 6-DoF reaching tasks. Results indicate that the two different mappings perform comparably well, are equally well-received by users, and exhibit similar motor control behaviors. Nevertheless, the virtual wand mapping is anticipated to outperform in tasks characterized by large translations and minimal effector rotations, whereas direct mapping is expected to demonstrate advantages in large rotations with minimal translations. These results pave the way for new interactions and interfaces, particularly in disability assistance utilizing residual body movements (instead of hands) as control input. Leveraging body parts with substantial rotations could enable the accomplishment of tasks previously deemed infeasible with standard direct coupling interfaces.
