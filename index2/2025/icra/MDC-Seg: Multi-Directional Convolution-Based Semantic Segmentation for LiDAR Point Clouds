LiDAR point clouds 3D semantic segmentation enables efficient and accurate environmental sensing for intelligent vehicles and autonomous robots, greatly advancing these domains. Existing advanced methods that use 3D sparse convolutional often suffer from a small Effective Receptive Field (ERF), which limits context sensing and challenging highperformance segmentation. Building on this observation, we propose MDC-Seg for efficient ERF enlargement. We design Multi-directional Convolution (MDConv), which simultaneously performs sparse feature encoding on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Range View (RV) planes to enlarge the ERF of 3D sparse convolution. To enhance feature fusion in MDConv, we introduce an attention mechanism and design an efficient multifeature fusion (EMFF) module suitable for both 3D and 2D sparse features. To improve segmentation accuracy, we design a point-voxel constraint (PVC) module to handle edge voxels containing multiple point cloud categories, optimizing the final inference results. These modules add minimal memory and inference time but significantly improve performance compared to the baseline. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate MDC-Seg's excellent performance, with supplementary tests on nuScenes further confirming its superiority by yielding good results.
