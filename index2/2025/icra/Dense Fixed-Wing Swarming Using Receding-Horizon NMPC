In this paper, we present an approach for controlling a team of agile fixed-wing aerial vehicles in close proximity to one another. Our approach relies on recedinghorizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan maneuvers across an expanded flight envelope to enable interagent collision avoidance. To facilitate robust collision avoidance and characterize the likelihood of inter-agent collisions, we compute a statistical bound on the probability of the system leaving a tube around the planned nominal trajectory. Finally, we propose a metric for evaluating highly dynamic swarms and use this metric to evaluate our approach. We successfully demonstrated our approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, and to our knowledge, this the first time close-quarters swarming has been achieved with physical aerobatic fixed-wing vehicles.
