Human-robot collaboration has great potential in enhancing robot deployment at close proximity with people, especially in non-dyadic collaborations with multiple users. However, autonomous systems that are capable of handling such interactions in a physical domain are rare. This work proposes TriHRCBot, a robotic architecture designed to handle a collaborative task that involves two concurrent users. The architecture is sensitive to position, orientation, body lengths and state of the users in the interaction, and uses this information to adjust the pose of a target object to enable both users to act on it at the same time. A robotic system equipped with the TriHRCBot architecture was deployed in a user study in which 30 participants from the BAE Systems Academy for Skills and Knowledge Centre interacted with it during such multi-user collaborative task. The study shows that the participants considered TriHRCBot acceptable for the task at hand. The code repository of the architecture is publicly available11Code repository: https://github.com/francescosemeraro/TriHRCBot,
