The moving target traveling salesman problem with obstacles (MT-TSP-O) seeks an obstacle-free trajectory for an agent that intercepts a given set of moving targets, each within specified time windows, and returns to the agent's starting position. Each target moves with a constant velocity within its time windows, and the agent has a speed limit no smaller than any target's speed. We present FMC*-TSP, the first complete and bounded-suboptimal algorithm for the MT-TSP-O, and results for an agent whose configuration space is $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Our algorithm interleaves a high-level search and a lowlevel search, where the high-level search solves a generalized traveling salesman problem with time windows (GTSP-TW) to find a sequence of targets and corresponding time windows for the agent to visit. Given such a sequence, the low-level search then finds an associated agent trajectory. To solve the low-level planning problem, we develop a new algorithm called FMC*, which finds a shortest path on a graph of convex sets (GCS) via implicit graph search and pruning techniques specialized for problems with moving targets. We test FMC*-TSP on 280 problem instances with up to 40 targets and demonstrate its smaller median runtime than a baseline based on prior work.
