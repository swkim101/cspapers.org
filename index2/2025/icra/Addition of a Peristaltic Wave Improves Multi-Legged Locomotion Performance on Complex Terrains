Characterized by their elongate bodies and relatively simple legs, multi-legged robots have the potential to locomote through complex terrains for applications such as search-and-rescue and terrain inspection. Prior work has developed effective and reliable locomotion strategies for multilegged robots by propagating the two waves of lateral body undulation and leg stepping, which we will refer to as the twowave template. However, these robots have limited capability to climb over obstacles with sizes comparable to their heights. We hypothesize that such limitations stem from the twowave template that we used to prescribe the multi-legged locomotion. Seeking effective alternative waves for obstacleclimbing, we designed a five-segment robot with static (nonactuated) legs, where each cable-driven joint has a rotational degree-of-freedom (DoF) in the sagittal plane (vertical wave) and a linear DoF (peristaltic wave). We tested robot locomotion performance on a flat terrain and a rugose terrain. While the benefit of peristalsis on flat-ground locomotion is marginal, the inclusion of a peristaltic wave substantially improves the locomotion performance in rugose terrains: it not only enables obstacle-climbing capabilities with obstacles having a similar height as the robot, but it also significantly improves the traversing capabilities of the robot in such terrains. Our results demonstrate an alternative actuation mechanism for multilegged robots, paving the way towards all-terrain multi-legged robots.
