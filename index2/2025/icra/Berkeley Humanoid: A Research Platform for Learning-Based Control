We introduce Berkeley Humanoid, a reliable and low-cost mid-scale humanoid research platform for learningbased control. Our lightweight, in-house-built robot is designed specifically for learning algorithms with accurate simulation, low simulation complexity, anthropomorphic motion, and high reliability against falls. The narrow sim-to-real gap enables agile and robust locomotion across various terrains in outdoor environments, achieved with a simple reinforcement learning controller using light domain randomization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robot traversing for hundreds of meters, walking on a steep unpaved trail, and hopping with single and double legs as a testimony to its high performance in dynamic walking. Capable of omnidirectional locomotion and withstanding large perturbations with a compact setup, our system aims for rapid sim-to-real deployment of learningbased humanoid systems.
