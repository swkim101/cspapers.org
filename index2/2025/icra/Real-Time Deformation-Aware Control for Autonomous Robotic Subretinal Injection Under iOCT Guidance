Robotic platforms provide consistent and precise tool positioning that significantly enhances retinal microsurgery. Integrating such systems with intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) enables image-guided robotic interventions, allowing autonomous performance of advanced treatments, such as injecting therapeutic agents into the subretinal space. However, tissue deformations due to tool-tissue interactions constitute a significant challenge in autonomous iOCT-guided robotic subretinal injections. Such interactions impact correct needle positioning and procedure outcomes. This paper presents a novel method for autonomous subretinal injection under iOCT guidance that considers tissue deformations during the insertion procedure. The technique is achieved through real-time segmentation and 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene from densely sampled iOCT B-scans, which we refer to as B5_ scans. Using B5-scans we monitor the position of the instrument relative to a virtual target layer between the ILM and RPE. Our experiments on ex-vivo porcine eyes demonstrate dynamic adjustment of the insertion depth and overall improved accuracy in needle positioning compared to prior autonomous insertion approaches. Compared to a 35% success rate in subretinal bleb generation with previous approaches, our method reliably created subretinal blebs in 90% our experiments.
