Humans learn from observations and experiences to adjust their behaviours towards better performance. Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer others' behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot. We demonstrate through longterm experiments in both simulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes safety and efficiency in downstream robot planning.
