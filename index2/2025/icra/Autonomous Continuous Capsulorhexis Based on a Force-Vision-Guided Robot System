Capsulorhexis is challenging in cataract surgery, since the size, centering, and circularity of the capsule are important. Those indicators are closely related to the subsequent step of phacoemulsification and the postoperative position of the intraocular lens. It takes 3-5 years for a resident to practice, while the occurrence of deficient capsulorhexis is still inevitable. This paper proposes a robotic system to automate Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis (CCC) in cataract surgery. A typical ophthalmic microscope system and a triaxial force sensor are utilized to guide the robot system with a force-vision method. The constraint of a Remote Center of Motion (RCM) is designed to perform the surgery route. The experimental results on exvivo porcine eyes show our autonomous method can achieve a satisfactory 6 mm capsule. With an average centering deviation below 7.6 % and circularity of 0.993, the consistency of the capsulorhexis is comparable to a surgeon-made one.
