Traffic simulation, complementing real-world data with a long-tail distribution, allows for effective evaluation and enhancement of the ability of autonomous vehicles to handle accident-prone scenarios. Simulating such safety-critical scenarios is nontrivial, however, from log data that are typically regular scenarios, especially in consideration of dynamic adversarial interactions between the future motions of autonomous vehicles and surrounding traffic participants. To address it, this paper proposes an innovative and efficient strategy, termed IntSim, that explicitly decouples the driving intentions of surrounding actors from their motion planning for realistic and efficient safety-critical simulation. We formulate the adversarial transfer of driving intention as an optimization problem, facilitating extensive exploration of diverse attack behaviors and efficient solution convergence. Simultaneously, intention-conditioned motion planning benefits from powerful deep models and large-scale real-world data, permitting the simulation of realistic motion behaviors for actors. Specially, through adapting driving intentions based on environments, IntSim facilitates the flexible realization of dynamic adversarial interactions with autonomous vehicles. Finally, extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments on real-world datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that the proposed IntSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulating realistic safety-critical scenarios and further improves planners in handling such scenarios.
