Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating a sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate Cur-ricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in the real-world. Project website is https://iconlab.negarmehr.com/CurricuLLM/
