Hybrid aerial underwater vehicles (HAUVs) exhibit significant potential due to their ability to operate seamlessly in the air and water domains. However, balancing rapid maneuverability in both media and achieving stability during the cross-domain phase remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the retractable limbs of a tortoise, this paper presented a novel morphing HAUV, Nezha-MB. Nezha-MB utilizes linear actuators combined with a gear and rack system for arm transformation during the transition phase, replacing conventional servos. The transformation mechanism accounts for 11 % of the total weight. In aerial mode, Nezha-MB exhibits flight performance comparable to a quadrotor configuration. In underwater mode, NezhaMB retracts its quadrotor arms into a bullet-shaped shell, significantly reducing drag and energy consumption, while enabling passage through narrow gaps with diameters as small as 134 mm. Simulations and field tests conducted in both aerial and underwater domains demonstrate that NezhaMB combines the swift maneuverability of a streamlined underwater vehicle with the stability of a traditional multirotor vehicle, highlighting its robust and rapid cross-domain capabilities.
