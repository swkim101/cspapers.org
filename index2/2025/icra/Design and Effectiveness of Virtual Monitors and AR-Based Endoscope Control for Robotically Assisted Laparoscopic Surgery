Managing indirect access in laparoscopy as a minimally invasive procedure poses challenges to physicians. In particular, an endoscope must be navigated to achieve adequate visualization of the surgical anatomy, while coping with unergonomic poses, tremor, and fatigue. Furthermore, the alignment of visual perception and physical movement, dictated by the endoscope's position relative to the monitor, can lead to hand-eye coordination challenges. We propose unified deployment of a robotic endoscope holder together with an augmented reality display to counteract the aforementioned challenges in laparoscopy. Our augmented reality system provides an interactive, stereoscopic, virtual monitor displaying an endoscopic stream. In addition, our method design enables direct control of the robotic endoscope holder. Our user study demonstrates the potential of the proposed method to significantly improve hand-eye coordination, while insights from our usability study for robotic control indicate promising trends, including high usability and low cognitive demand.
