Recent advancements in learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) have demonstrated significant improvements over traditional counterpart, primarily due to the extensive availability of multi-view training images with ground-truth metric depths in the terrestrial in-air domain. However, underwater multi-view stereo (UwMVS) faces substantial challenges arising from the domain gap between in-air and underwater environments, leading to degraded performance when applying in-air MVS models to underwater scenarios. Furthermore, the progress of learning-based UwMVS methods has been hindered by the scarcity of underwater multi-view images with ground-truth depth maps and point clouds. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a physically-guided approach for synthesizing underwater multi-view images and present the first large-scale UwMVS dataset for end-to-end training and evaluation of learning-based UwMVS methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel UwMVS network that enhances geometric cue encoding to achieve more accurate and complete point cloud reconstruction. Extensive experiments on our dataset and real-world underwater scenes demonstrate that our dataset enables the trained models for underwater dense reconstruction and that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater reconstruction.
