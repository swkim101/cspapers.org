Visual pattern recognition usually plays important roles in robotics and automation society where the pattern recognition relies on representation learning. Existing representation learning often neglects two important issues, the diversity of intra-class representation and under-exploited label utilization, especially the negative feedback during training process. Fortunately, prototype learning potentially raises label utilization and encourages intra-class diversity. In this paper, we investigate the intra-class diversity and effective updates in prototype learning for enhanced visual pattern recognition. Specifically, we propose a Label-aware multi-Prototype learning, LamPro, by incorporating the label awareness into both prototype formation and update to improve the representation quality. Firstly, we design a supervised contrastive learning to achieve class-discriminative representations. Secondly, we randomly initialize multiple prototypes and update the nearest prototype upon the arrival of instance, to preserve intra-class diversity. Thirdly, we propose a novel Label-guided Adaptive Updating. We separate the prototype updates from the representation optimization and exploit the label indexes to directly implement the prediction feedback. To correct the model optimization directions, we identify the negative feedback, and correct the prototype updates via queries of labels. Finally, we design a memory-based counter to alternately update these deviated prototypes. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our label-aware and joint multi-prototype updating strategies.
