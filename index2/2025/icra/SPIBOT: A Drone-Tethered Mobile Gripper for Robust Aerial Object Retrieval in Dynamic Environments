In real-world field operations, aerial grasping systems face significant challenges in dynamic environments due to strong winds, shifting surfaces, and the need to handle heavy loads. Particularly when dealing with heavy objects, the powerful propellers of the drone can inadvertently blow the target object away as it approaches, making the task even more difficult. To address these challenges, we introduce SPI- BOT, a novel drone-tethered mobile gripper system designed for robust and stable autonomous target retrieval. SPIBOT operates via a tether, much like a spider, allowing the drone to maintain a safe distance from the target. To ensure both stable mobility and secure grasping capabilities, SPIBOT is equipped with six legs and sensors to estimate the robot's and mission's states. It is designed with a reduced volume and weight compared to other hexapod robots, allowing it to be easily stowed under the drone and reeled in as needed. Designed for the 2024 MBZIRC Maritime Grand Challenge, SPIBOT is built to retrieve a 1kg target object in the highly dynamic conditions of the moving deck of a ship. This system integrates a real-time action selection algorithm that dynamically adjusts the robot's actions based on proximity to the mission goal and environmental conditions, enabling rapid and robust mission execution. Experimental results across various terrains, including a pontoon on a lake, a grass field, and rubber mats on coastal sand, demonstrate SPIBOT's ability to efficiently and reliably retrieve targets. SPIBOT swiftly converges on the target and completes its mission, even when dealing with irregular initial states and noisy information introduced by the drone.
