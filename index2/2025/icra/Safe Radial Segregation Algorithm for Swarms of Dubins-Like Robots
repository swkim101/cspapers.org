This work addresses the problem of radially segregating heterogeneous robotic swarms. Such swarms are those composed of different groups of robots. Unlike other works on segregation in the literature, we propose a controller for Dubins-like robots, motivated by autonomous aerial, wheeled, and underwater vehicles. Our controller can drive the robots individually to converge to circles that are shared only by robots of the same group. We present a heuristic and a collision avoidance scheme in which the information required is locally acquired. We present several simulations widely varying the number of robots per group and the number of groups in which segregation is always reached and collisions between robots are always avoided.
