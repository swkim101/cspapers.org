This paper presents a mixed traffic control policy designed to optimize traffic efficiency across diverse road topologies, addressing issues of congestion prevalent in urban environments. A model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach is developed to manage large-scale traffic flow, using data collected by autonomous vehicles to influence human-driven vehicles. A real-world mixed traffic control benchmark is also released, which includes 444 scenarios from 20 countries, representing a wide geographic distribution and covering a variety of scenarios and road topologies. This benchmark serves as a foundation for future research, providing a realistic simulation environment for the development of effective policies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method, achieving better performance than existing traffic control methods in both intersection and roundabout scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first project to introduce a real-world complex scenarios mixed traffic control benchmark.
