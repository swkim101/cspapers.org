This paper introduces the design, fabrication, and autonomous control of MicroASV, a low-cost, centimeter-scale autonomous surface Vehicle (ASV). MicroASV has a square footprint with a side length of 85 mm. Its propulsion system consists of four custom water jets arranged in a “Diamond” shaped actuator configuration, powered by magnetically coupled brushless motors. This setup allows for complete 2D mobility, enabling forward and backward motion, lateral translation, and in-place rotation. The MicroASV is built using commercially available motors and 3D-printed components, creating a modular, appendage-free structure that is simple to assemble. An onboard camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) are integrated to enable real-time localization, with position and heading controllers developed to provide autonomous feedback control. Preliminary experiments validate the platform's effectiveness in motion, sensing, and control, establishing MicroASV as a valuable tool for studying centimeter-scale ASV control, both individually and in collective swarm operations.
