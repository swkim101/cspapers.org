Map-based LiDAR localization, while widely used in autonomous systems, faces significant challenges in degraded environments due to the lack of distinct geometric features. This paper introduces SuperLoc, a robust LiDAR localization package that addresses key limitations in existing methods. SuperLoc features a novel predictive alignment risk assessment technique, enabling early detection and mitigation of potential failures before optimization. This approach significantly improves performance in challenging scenarios such as corridors, tunnels, and caves. Unlike existing degeneracy mitigation algorithms that rely on post-optimization analysis and heuristic thresholds, SuperLoc evaluates the localizability of raw sensor measurements. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across various degraded environments. Our approach achieves a 54% increase in accuracy and exhibits better robustness. To facilitate further research, we release our implementation along with datasets from eight challenging scenarios.
