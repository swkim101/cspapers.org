Recent studies have made significant progress in addressing dexterous manipulation problems, particularly in inhand object reorientation. However, there are few existing works that explore the potential utilization of developed dexterous manipulation controllers for downstream tasks. In this study, we focus on constrained dexterous manipulation for food peeling. Food peeling presents various constraints on the reorientation controller, such as the requirement for the hand to securely hold the object after reorientation for peeling. We propose a simple system for learning a reorientation controller that facilitates the subsequent peeling task. Videos are available at: https://taochenshh.github.io/projects/veg-peeling.
