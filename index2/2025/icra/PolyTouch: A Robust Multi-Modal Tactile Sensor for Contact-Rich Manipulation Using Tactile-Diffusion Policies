Achieving robust dexterous manipulation in un-structured domestic environments remains a significant challenge in robotics. Even with state-of-the-art robot learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions, visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To address these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that integrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral visual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch provides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales, which is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks. Experiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over commercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and scalable. We then use this multimodal tactile feedback along with visuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from human demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly outperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation policies. This paper highlights how effectively integrating multimodal contact sensing can hasten the development of effective contact-aware manipulation policies, paving the way for more reliable and versatile domestic robots.
