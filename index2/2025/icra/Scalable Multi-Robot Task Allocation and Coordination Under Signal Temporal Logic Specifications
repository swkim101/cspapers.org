Motion planning with simple objectives, such as collision-avoidance and goal-reaching, can be solved efficiently using modern planners. However, the complexity of the allowed tasks for these planners is limited. On the other hand, signal temporal logic (STL) can specify complex requirements, but STL-based motion planning and control algorithms often face scalability issues, especially in large multi-robot systems with complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that leverages the best of the two worlds. We first use a single-robot motion planner to efficiently generate a set of alternative reference paths for each robot. Then coordination requirements are specified using STL, which is defined over the assignment of paths and robots' progress along those paths. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute task assignments and robot progress targets over time such that the STL specification is satisfied. Finally, a local controller is used to track the target progress. Simulations demonstrate that our method can handle tasks with complex constraints and scales to large multi-robot teams and intricate task allocation scenarios.
