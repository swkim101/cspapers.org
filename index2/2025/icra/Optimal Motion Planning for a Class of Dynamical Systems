A novel method for optimal motion planning in the context of a class of dynamical system is proposed in this work. Our approach is based on the design of a provably safe and convergent actor structure, which is optimized via a policy iteration method. The proposed actor has wide applications, from control of mechanical systems to providing acceleration commands for more complex robotic platforms. Extra care is taken to provide theoretical guarantees, and the scheme is validated against an existing sampling-based planner.
