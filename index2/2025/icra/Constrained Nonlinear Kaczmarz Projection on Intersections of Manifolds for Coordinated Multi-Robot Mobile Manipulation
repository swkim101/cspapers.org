Cooperative manipulation tasks impose various structure-, task-, and robot-specific constraints on mobile manip-ulators. However, current methods struggle to model and solve these myriad constraints simultaneously. We propose a twofold solution: first, we model constraints as a family of manifolds amenable to simultaneous solving. Second, we introduce the constrained nonlinear Kaczmarz (cNKZ) projection technique to produce constraint-satisfying solutions. Experiments show that cNKZ dramatically outperforms baseline approaches, which cannot find solutions at all. We integrate cNKZ with a sampling-based motion planning algorithm to generate complex, coordi-nated motions for 3–6 mobile manipulators (18–36 DoF), with cNKZ solving up to 80 nonlinear constraints simultaneously and achieving up to a 92% success rate in cluttered environments. We also demonstrate our approach on hardware using three Thrtlebot3 Waffle Pi robots with OpenMANIPULATOR-X arms.
