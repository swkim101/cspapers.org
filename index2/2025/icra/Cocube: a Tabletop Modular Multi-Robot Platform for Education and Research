This paper presents CoCube a tabletop modular robotics platform designed for robotics education and multirobot algorithm research. CoCube is characterized by its low cost low floors high ceilings and wide walls offering flexibility and broad applicability across various use cases. The platform comprises four key components: CoCube robots which integrate wireless communication movement and interaction; CoModules which provide versatile external functionality; CoMaps which enable high-precision localization via microdot patterns on regular printed paper; and CoTags for interaction. CoCube operates on MicroBlocks a blocks programming language for physical computing inspired by MIT Scratch a widely-used coding language with a simple visual interface that makes programming accessible to young learners. It offers users both flexibility and ease of use with advanced API support for more complex applications. This paper details the design of the CoCube platform and demonstrates its potential in both educational and research contexts.
