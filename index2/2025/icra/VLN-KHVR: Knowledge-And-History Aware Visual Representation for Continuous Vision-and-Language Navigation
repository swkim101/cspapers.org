Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to navigate with lowlevel actions following natural language instructions in 3D environments. Most existing approaches utilize observation features from the current step to represent the viewpoint. However, these representations often conflate redundant and essential information for navigation, introducing ambiguity into the agent's action prediction. To address the problem of inadequate representation, we propose a Knowledge-andHistory Aware Visual Representation for Continuous Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN-KHVR). The proposed approach constructs enriched visual representations tailored to navigation instructions, enhancing agents' navigation performance. Specifically, VLN-KHVR extracts image features from the current observation, retrieves relevant knowledge in the knowledge base, and obtains the history of the navigation episode. Subsequently, the knowledge and history features are filtered to eliminate the information irrelevant to navigation instruction. These refined features are integrated with the instruction for further interaction. Finally, the aggregated features are used to guide navigation. Our model outperforms previous methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
