Robot manipulation researchers reference human performance as a goal for their work, however, human data is seldom present in robotics benchmarks. We introduce a real-world benchmark targeting manipulation skills for performing electrical circuit inspection with a multimeter using an Internet-connected electronic task board. We present timing study results and an exemplary robot solution across six different tasks from the Robothon Grand Challenge at the automatica conference in 2023. Contributions from 16 robot teams were collected using task boards we manufactured and distributed as part of the 30-day international competition as an initial performance database. Our work systematically highlights the skill gap between the winning robot solution and the best human performance from a group of 30 subjects. Our goal is to chronicle progress over time in robot manipulation skills and provide a standardized, physical benchmark across the global community. Videos of the team submissions, the exemplary robot solution, as well as the project reproduction code are provided in the included repository.
