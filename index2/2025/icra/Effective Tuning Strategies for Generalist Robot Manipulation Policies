Generalist robot manipulation policies (GMPs) have the potential to generalize across a wide range of tasks, devices, and environments. However, existing policies continue to struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to the inherent difficulty of collecting sufficient action data to cover extensively diverse domains. While fine-tuning offers a practical way to quickly adapt a GMPs to novel domains and tasks with limited samples, we observe that the performance of the resulting GMPs differs significantly with respect to the design choices of fine-tuning strategies. In this work, we first conduct an indepth empirical study to investigate the effect of key factors in GMPs fine-tuning strategies, covering the action space, policy head, supervision signal and the choice of tunable parameters, where 2,500 rollouts are evaluated for a single configuration. We systematically discuss and summarize our findings and identify the key design choices, which we believe give a practical guideline for GMPs fine-tuning. We observe that in a lowdata regime, with carefully chosen fine-tuning strategies, a GMPs significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms. The results presented in this work establish a new baseline for future studies on fine-tuned GMPs.
