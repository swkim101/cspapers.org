Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects, temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks, especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication. It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration and intermittent communication (called the “spread mode”), where the robots collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles (called the”relay mode”), such that all requested assistance can be provided with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments are performed over numerous challenging scenes.
