Smart glasses devices are emerging with egocentric cameras and gaze tracking, raising the possibility of new interaction techniques that enable users to reference real-world objects they wish to digitally interact with. However, many of these devices lack a display, making precise object referencing difficult due to the lack of continuous visual feedback. We introduce Squiggle, an interaction technique that enables users to reference real-world objects without continuous feedback by drawing an invisible loop or “lasso” with an imagined ray-cast pointer. Through a virtual reality data collection, we observed that this gesture can elicit useful gaze behavior in addition to providing drawing input itself. Based on these results we implemented and evaluated a real-world prototype of Squiggle, demonstrating that it can improve accuracy of object referencing over Gaze + Pinch alone, particularly for selecting compound objects and groups.
