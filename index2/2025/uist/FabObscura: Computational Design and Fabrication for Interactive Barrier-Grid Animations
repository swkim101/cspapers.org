We present FabObscura: a system for creating interactive barrier-grid animations, a classic technique that uses occlusion patterns to create the illusion of motion. Whereas traditional barrier-grid animations are constrained to simple linear occlusion patterns, FabObscura introduces a parameterization that represents patterns as mathematical functions. Our parameterization offers two key advantages over existing barrier-grid animation design methods: first, it has a high expressive ceiling by enabling the systematic design of novel patterns; second, it is versatile enough to represent all established forms of barrier-grid animations. Using this parameterization, our computational design tool enables an end-to-end workflow for authoring, visualizing, and fabricating these animations without domain expertise. Our applications demonstrate how FabObscura can be used to create animations that respond to a range of user interactions, such as translations, rotations, and changes in viewpoint. By formalizing barrier-grid animation as a computational design material, FabObscura extends its expressiveness as an interactive medium.
