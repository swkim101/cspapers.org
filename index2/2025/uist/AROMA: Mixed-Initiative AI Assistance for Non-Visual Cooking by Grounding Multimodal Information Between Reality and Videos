Videos offer rich audiovisual information that can support people in performing activities of daily living (ADLs), but they remain largely inaccessible to blind or low-vision (BLV) individuals. In cooking, BLV people often rely on non-visual cues—such as touch, taste, and smell—to navigate their environment, making it difficult to follow the predominantly audiovisual instructions found in video recipes. To address this problem, we introduce Aroma, an AI system that provides timely responses to the user based on real-time, context-aware assistance by integrating non-visual cues perceived by the user, a wearable camera feed, and video recipe content. Aroma uses a mixed-initiative approach: it responds to user requests while also proactively monitoring the video stream to offer timely alerts and guidance. This collaborative design leverages the complementary strengths of the user and AI system to align the physical environment with the video recipe, helping the user interpret their current state and make sense of the steps. We evaluated Aroma through a study with eight BLV participants and offered insights for designing interactive AI systems to support BLV individuals in performing ADLs.
