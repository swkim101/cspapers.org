Keyboards are widely used as an input method for computers due to their ability to enable fast text entry and shortcut usage. However, their shape is fixed and often not optimized for human use. Even keyboards designed based on ergonomics cannot fully accommodate individual differences and varying use cases. In this paper, we propose MorphKeys, a keyboard that allows users to freely and three-dimensionally arrange keys. In MorphKeys, each key is an independent, battery-free key module. These modules are powered and read using near-field communication (NFC) only while the user presses a key, enabling key input detection. Additionally, by incorporating relay resonators in the NFC reader, we achieve both a sufficient reading range and high reading performance. Furthermore, we employ a base made of clay and iron sand, which enables magnetic fixation of the keys without interfering with NFC operation. Our implemented prototype demonstrates that a large number of keys can be arranged in a sufficiently three-dimensional manner and that the system functions properly as a keyboard.
