Effective communication between pilots and air traffic control (ATC) is essential for aviation safety, but verbal exchanges over radios are prone to miscommunication, especially under high workload conditions. While cockpit-embedded visual aids offer the potential to enhance ATC communication, little is known about how to design and integrate such aids. We present an exploratory, user-centered investigation into the design and integration of icon-based visual aids, named ATCion, to support in-cockpit ATC communication, through four phases involving 22 pilots and 1 ATC controller. This study contributes a validated set of design principles and visual icon components for ATC messages. In a comparative study of ATCion, text-based visual aids, and no visual aids, we found that our design improved readback accuracy and reduced memory workload, without negatively impacting flight operations; most participants preferred ATCion over text-based aids, citing their clarity, low cognitive cost, and fast interpretability. Further, we point to implications and opportunities for integrating icon-based aids into future multimodal ATC communication systems to improve both safety and efficiency.
