Orthoses are essential components of rehabilitation, yet limited in functionality. Static braces immobilize joints, which, especially for hand and finger injuries, interfere with users’ daily activities. Additionally, early mobilization schedules require users to take off and reapply their static orthoses frequently, which is cumbersome. To facilitate both rehabilitation and dexterity, we introduce a novel multifunctional yet unpowered finger orthosis design. Our design supports easy switching between two distinct states: a stiff state for immobilization and a flexible state for mobilization. A key benefit is that it can be customized using our computational design tool, and 3D printed in one piece. Our computational design pipeline supports tailoring the switching thresholds of the brace based on patients’ individual finger strengths and range of motion. Following a preliminary study with 10 healthy people that validates the usability and wearability of the brace, our two-week case study with a patient indicates that our brace supports everyday activities and assists with rehabilitation.
