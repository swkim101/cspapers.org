We present ViviClay, a design and fabrication method that integrates thermochromic coatings with internal pipe structures to produce dynamic surface effects on ceramics. By channeling thermal fluid through embedded pathways, the surface exhibits reversible color changes, enabling animated patterns that are more programmable and varied than those of conventional thermochromic mugs. To address challenges in 3D printing clay—such as deformation and pipe clogging—we propose key design strategies, optimize fabrication parameters, and introduce a relief-style technique for curved surfaces. Building on this method, we develop a software tool and a set of structured design exemplars to support diverse form exploration while lowering design barriers. We demonstrate its potential through conceptual prototypes inspired by everyday everyday fluid interaction. This work represents the first exploration of 3D-printed ceramics that enable animated surface behavior in HCI, opening new directions for interactive and expressive ceramic practices.
