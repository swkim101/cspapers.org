People naturally sketch strokes over graphical scenes to convey scene changes. We propose automatically interpreting these strokes to execute scene changes with squidgets (sketch-widgets), a novel sketch-based UI framework for direct scene manipulation. Squidgets are motivated by the observation that curves resulting from visually abstracting scene elements provide natural handles for the direct manipulation of scene parameters. Additional curves can be defined by users to author custom handles associated with scene attributes. Users manipulate a scene by simply drawing strokes, that are partially matched against scene curves to select a squidget and interactively control scene parameters associated with the squidget. We present an implementation of squidgets within the 3D animation system Maya, showing 2D/3D stroke input to manipulate 2D/3D scenes. We report on a controlled experiment evaluating squidgets on 2D object translation and deformation tasks, and a broader informal study on squidget creation and manipulation.
