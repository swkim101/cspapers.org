We introduce AttraCar, a novel multisensory in-car Virtual Reality (VR) platform that delivers thermal, airflow, and motion feedback using built-in vehicle systems. Leveraging the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system for airflow and thermal variation, and the power seat for motion feedback, perceptual thresholds were determined through Just Noticeable Difference (JND) experiments. A user study evaluated six feedback conditions (Baseline, Ambient Airflow, Thermal Airflow, Seat Motion, Ambient Airflow + Seat Motion, Thermal Airflow + Seat Motion) during on-road VR scenarios. A subsequent on-road study demonstrates that different combinations of feedback are not only perceptually distinct but also highly effective in a dynamic VR context, significantly mitigating motion sickness and enhancing presence and haptic experience. We conclude with reflections on design considerations, integration challenges, and real-world applicability for scalable multisensory in-car VR systems utilizing existing vehicle components.
