Textiles offer many advantages as a fabrication material, particularly when viewed from the perspective of human use. Until recently most textile fabrication processes were limited to the creation of surface-based forms. Prior work on Solid Knitting demonstrated that it is possible to create some solid knitted forms. We present a different machine design using a 2D bed of knitting needles to fabricate additional solid knitted forms. This approach provides substantially more flexibility on how to structure stitches as yarn paths inside a volume. We describe a small prototype 6x6 needle machine, and demonstrate that it can create traditional knits, horizontal knits (knitted in the plane of the needles), and solid knits, including overhangs, and pyramidal forms. We conclude by considering future directions and the current limitation of this proof-of-concept design and how it holds the promise of creating knitted objects with engineered stiffness, elasticity, and density properties throughout their volume.
