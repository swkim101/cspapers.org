Dynamic physical interfaces are often dedicated devices designed to adapt their physical properties to user needs. In this paper, we present an actuation system that allows users to transform their existing objects into dynamic physical user interfaces. We design our actuation system to integrate as a self-contained locomotion layer into existing objects that are small-scale, i.e., hand-size rather than furniture-size. We envision that such objects can act as collaborators: as a studio assistant in a painter’s palette, as tutors in a student’s ruler, or as caretakers for plants evading direct sunlight. The key idea is to decompose the actuation into (1) energy input and (2) steering to achieve a flat form factor. The energy input is provided by simple vibration. We implement steering through differential friction controlled by flat-foldable compliant structures that can be activated electrically. We study the mechanism and its performance, and show its application scenarios enabling dynamic interactions with objects.
