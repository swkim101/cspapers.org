Designing compelling multi-party conversations involving both humans and AI agents presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing scripted structure with emergent, human-like interactions. We introduce DialogLab, a prototyping toolkit for authoring, simulating, and testing hybrid human-AI dialogues. DialogLab provides a unified interface to configure conversational scenes, define agent personas, manage group structures, specify turn-taking rules, and orchestrate transitions between scripted narratives and improvisation. Crucially, DialogLab allows designers to introduce controlled deviations from the script—through configurable agents that emulate human unpredictability—to systematically probe how conversations adapt and recover. DialogLab facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of complex, dynamic multi-party human-AI dialogues. An evaluation with both end users and domain experts demonstrates that DialogLab supports efficient iteration and structured verification, with applications in training, rehearsal, and research on social dynamics. Our findings show the value of integrating real-time, human-in-the-loop improvisation with structured scripting to support more realistic and adaptable multi-party conversation design.
