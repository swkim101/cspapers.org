The tactile display of visual images on touchscreens improves the immersion in multimodal applications. Tactile rendering methods considering discrimination thresholds highlight the perceptual differences of friction variations. In this paper, we present a tactile rendering method using frequency modulation of square wave driven signal under the Weber Fractions (WFs) constraint by electrovibration. Firstly, we report the frequency WFs of square wave under conditions of rising frequency (RF) and falling frequency (FF). Then, we determine the variation of the WFs affected by texel length, sliding speed and applied voltage. Finally, we propose the image-based tactile rendering method. The results indicate that the WFs increase from 0.18 and 0.16 to 0.35 and 0.24 in the range of <50Hz and remain constant in 50-500Hz under RF and FF, respectively. Sliding speed has a significant effect on the WFs under RF. And the rendering fidelity of proposed method has a significantly increase by 17.9% in tactile display.
