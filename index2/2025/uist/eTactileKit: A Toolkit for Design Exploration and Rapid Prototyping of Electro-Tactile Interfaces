Electro-tactile interfaces are becoming increasingly popular due to their unique advantages, such as delivering fast and localised tactile response, thin and flexible form factors, and the potential to create novel tactile experiences. However, insights from a formative study with typical designers highlighted the lack of resources, limited access to information and complexity of software and hardware tools. This establishes a high barrier to entry and limits the ability to rapidly prototype and experiment with electro-tactile interfaces. To address these challenges, we propose eTactileKit, a scalable and accessible toolkit providing end-to-end support for designing and prototyping electro-tactile interfaces. eTactileKit comprises a hardware platform and a software framework for designing, simulating and exploring electro-tactile stimuli. We evaluated the impact and usability of eTactileKit through a three-week long take-home study, which demonstrated increased accessibility, ease of use, and the toolkit’s positive impact on design workflow. Additionally, we implemented a set of use cases to demonstrate the toolkit’s practicality and effectiveness across various applications.
