Soil-based Microbial Fuel Cells (SMFCs) offer a sustainable method for powering low-energy computing devices by harnessing electricity from microbial activity in soil. In this paper, we introduce SoilSense, a novel approach that repurposes SMFCs as tangible interfaces, transforming soil into an interactive, computationally responsive medium, instead of energy sources. We explore the voltage variations that occur when pressure is applied to the cathode and systematically characterize this mechanism across different electrode configurations and soil moisture levels. To demonstrate the feasibility of SMFC-based interfaces, we present a series of modular and proof-of-concept prototypes that support diverse interaction modalities. We further illustrate how SoilSense enables interactions through example applications and provide implications and envision for future studies to employ soil as an ecologically compatible material in interactive system design.
