We present HandOver, an extended reality (XR) interaction technique designed to unify the precision of traditional mouse input for object selection with the expressiveness of hand-tracking for object manipulation. With HandOver, the mouse is used to drive a depth-aware 3D cursor enabling precise and restful targeting — by hovering their hand over the mouse, the user can then seamlessly transition into direct 3D manipulation of the target object. In a formal user study, we compare HandOver against two ray-based techniques: traditional raycasting (Ray) and a hybrid method (Ray+Hand) in a 3D docking task. Results show HandOver yields lower task errors across all distances, and moreover improves interaction ergonomics as highlighted by a RULA posture analysis and self-reported measures (NASA-TLX). These findings illustrate the benefits of blending traditional precise input devices with the expressive gestural inputs afforded by hand-tracking in XR, leading to improved user comfort and task performance. This blended paradigm yields a unified workflow allowing users to leverage the best of each input modality as they interact in immersive environments.
