Virtual reality (VR) applications require massive high-quality 3D assets to create immersive environments. Generating mesh-based 3D assets typically involves a significant amount of manpower and effort, which makes VR applications less accessible. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted much attention for its ability to quickly create digital replicas of real-life scenes and its compatibility with traditional rendering pipelines. However, it remains a challenge to edit 3DGS in a flexible and controllable manner. We propose GaussianShopVR, a system that leverages VR user interfaces to specify target areas to achieve flexible and controllable editing of reconstructed 3DGS. In addition, selected areas can provide 3D information to generative AI models to facilitate the editing. GaussianShopVR integrates object hierarchy management while keeping the backpropagated gradient flow to allow local editing with context information.
