As mobile phone use while walking becomes increasingly prevalent, users often divide their visual attention between their surroundings and phone displays, raising concerns around safety and interaction efficiency. Alternative input and output modalities—such as eyes-free touch gestures and audio feedback—offer a promising avenue for reducing visual demands in these contexts. However, the design of seamless transitions between visual and audio modalities for mobile interaction on the go remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted a design probe study with ten participants, simulating screen reader-like experiences across diverse applications to identify five key design insights and three design guidelines. Informed by these insights, we developed Viago, a background service that facilitates fluid transitions between visual and audio modalities for mobile task management while walking. A subsequent evaluation with thirteen participants demonstrated that Viago effectively supports on-the-go interactions by enabling users to interleave modalities as needed. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of visual-audio modality transitions and their potential to enhance mobile interactions in everyday, dynamic environments.
