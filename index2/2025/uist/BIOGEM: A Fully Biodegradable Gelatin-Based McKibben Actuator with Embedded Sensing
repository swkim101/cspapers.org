We present BIOGEM, a fully biodegradable McKibben actuator with integrated sensing, made from gelatin-based composites. By tailoring the material compositions, we customize the mechanical and electrical properties of the biodegradable composites, creating an integrated biodegradable system that combines both actuation and sensing functionalities. BIOGEM integrates a McKibben actuating structure by using stiff gelatin as outer braiding and the stretchable gelatin as air chambers. It also integrates resistive strain sensing through ionic gelatin, allowing the actuator to monitor its own deformation without relying on conventional electronics. We characterize the actuator’s performance across key parameters including braid angle, wall thickness, and material stiffness, demonstrating reliable contraction and repeatable force output at low pressures. Biodegradation is validated through both enzyme-assisted and backyard soil studies, confirming the material’s sustainable end-of-life behavior under realistic conditions. We illustrate the potential of this platform through interactive, edible, and environmentally-degradable prototypes across human–computer interaction and soft robotics scenarios.
