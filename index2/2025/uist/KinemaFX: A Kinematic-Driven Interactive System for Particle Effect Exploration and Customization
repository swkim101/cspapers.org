Particle effects are widely used in games and animation to simulate natural phenomena or stylized visual effects. However, creating effect artworks is challenging for non-expert users due to their lack of specialized skills, particularly in finding particle effects with kinematic behaviors that match their intent. To address these issues, we propose a conceptual model of particle effects that captures both semantic features and kinematic behaviors. Based on the model, we present KinemaFX, a kinematic-driven interactive system, to assist non-expert users in constructing customized particle effect artworks. KinemaFX adopts a workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that supports intent expression through combined semantic and kinematic inputs, while enabling implicit preference-guided exploration and subsequent creation of customized particle effect artworks based on exploration results. Additionally, we developed a kinematic-driven method to facilitate efficient interactive particle effect search within KinemaFX via structured representation and measurement of particle effects. To evaluate KinemaFX, we illustrate usage scenarios and conduct a user study employing an ablation approach. Evaluation results demonstrate that KinemaFX effectively supports users in efficiently and customarily creating particle effect artworks.
