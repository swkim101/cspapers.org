Researchers actively engage in informal discussions about academic papers on social media. They share insights, promote papers, and discuss emerging ideas in an engaging and accessible way. Yet, this rich source of scholarly discourse is often isolated from the paper reading process and remains underutilized. A natural question thus arises: What if we bring these peer discussions on social media into the reading experience? What might be the benefits of reading research papers alongside informal social insights? To explore the design space of such integration, we conducted a formative study with eight researchers. Participants recognized the value of social media in expanding their perspectives and connecting with fellow researchers. However, they also reported significant distraction and cognitive overload when confronted with streams of noisy, unstructured social media comments. Guided by the design goals derived from their feedback, we introduce Surf, a novel reading interface that enriches academic papers with Social Understanding of Research Findings. Surf organizes social media clutter into digestible threads and presents them contextually within the paper, allowing readers to seamlessly access peer insights without disrupting their reading process. In a within-subjects usability study (N=18), participants achieved significantly deeper comprehension and higher self-efficacy with Surf, while reporting lower cognitive load. They also noted Surf’s various benefits beyond paper reading, such as facilitating literature review and fostering social engagement within the academic community. Some participants envisioned Surf and academic social media as a potential supplement to the traditional peer‑review process.
