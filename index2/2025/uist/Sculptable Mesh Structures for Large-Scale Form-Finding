It can be hard to design a physical structure entirely within the confines of a computer monitor. To better capture the interplay between real-world objects and a designer’s work-in-progress, practitioners will often go through a sequence of low-fidelity prototypes (paper, clay, foam) before arriving at a form that satisfies both functional and aesthetic concerns. While necessary, this model-making process can be quite time-consuming, particularly at larger scales, and the resulting geometry can be difficult to translate into a CAD environment, where it will be further refined. This paper introduces a user-adjustable, room-scale, "shape-aware" mesh structure for low-fidelity prototyping. A user physically manipulates the mesh by lengthening and shortening the edges, altering the overall curvature and sculpting coarse forms. The edges are equipped with resistive length sensors, and transmit their configuration to a central computer. The structure can later be reproduced in software, connecting this prototyping stage to the larger computational design pipeline.
