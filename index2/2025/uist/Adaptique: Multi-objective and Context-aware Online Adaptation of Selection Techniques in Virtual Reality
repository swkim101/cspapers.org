Selection is a fundamental task that is challenging in virtual reality due to issues such as distant and small targets, occlusion, and target-dense environments. Previous research has tackled these challenges through various selection techniques, but complicates selection and can be seen as tedious outside of their designed use case. We present Adaptique, an adaptive model that infers and switches to the most optimal selection technique based on user and environmental information. Adaptique considers contextual information such as target size, distance, occlusion, and user posture combined with four objectives: speed, accuracy, comfort, and familiarity which are based on fundamental predictive models of human movement for technique selection. This enables Adaptique to select simple techniques when they are sufficiently efficient and more advanced techniques when necessary. We show that Adaptique is more preferred and performant than single techniques in a user study, and demonstrate Adaptique’s versatility in an application.
