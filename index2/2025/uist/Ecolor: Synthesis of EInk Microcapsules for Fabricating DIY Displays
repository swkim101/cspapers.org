Recent HCI research has explored active materials for programmable displays, yet accessibility remains a key challenge. While some programmable materials, such as thermochromic ink, are widely available, others—like electronic ink (EInk)—remain confined to industrial production. Despite its versatility, EInk is rarely used in HCI due to complex production processes that require expert knowledge in chemistry. We address this limitation by adapting existing microencapsulation techniques from other fields and identifying barriers to broader adoption. We present a simplified, safe, and more accessible method for producing EInk microcapsules. Through a series of analyses, we evaluate the viability of the resulting EInk and we evaluated the process with six participants unfamiliar with EInk fabrication and found it to be accessible and easy to follow. Our work represents a step toward democratizing EInk, bridging the gap between chemical engineering and practical application in HCI, and enabling broader integration of EInk into the design of diverse interactive devices.
