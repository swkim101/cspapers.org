Palm scanning, a cutting-edge payment technology, has garnered widespread attention from industry leaders such as Amazon, Tencent, and Mastercard due to the stability and non-intrusive properties of palmprints. Unlike facial biometrics, palmprints are not easily forged using publicly available social media data. Furthermore, contactless scanning solutions better meets the public hygiene needs than contact ones such as fingerprint. However, all current solutions rely on costly dedicated devices, such as Amazon One. Moreover, existing palmprint payment technologies remain limited to coarse-level textures (i.e., creases), while fine-level textures (i.e., ridges) have not been leveraged by these solutions. Currently, the reconstruction of fine-level palmprints is typically achieved using costly dedicated scanning equipment. This paper pioneers the design of an ultra-compact smartphone add-on (less than 3 mm thick), costing less than $21, which, paired with ubiquitous smartphones and a custom companion app, delivers the first holistic solution for fine-grained 3D palmprint reconstruction on smartphones. This ubiquitous smartphone-based solution significantly enhances user-friendliness (e.g., remote registration), usability (i.e., ultra-low-cost and tiny form factor) for interactions with payment devices, and hygiene in authenticating others (e.g., biometric-based ticketing at concerts or stadiums). Extensive evaluations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the reconstructed 3D texture, which can be reliably used as a biometric feature and has received positive feedback from participants.
