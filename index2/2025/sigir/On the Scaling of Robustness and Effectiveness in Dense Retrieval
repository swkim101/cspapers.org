Robustness and Effectiveness are critical aspects of developing dense retrieval models for real-world applications. It is known that there is a trade-off between the two. Recent work has addressed scaling laws of effectiveness in dense retrieval, revealing a power-law relationship between effectiveness and the size of models and data. Does robustness follow scaling laws too? If so, can scaling improve both robustness and effectiveness together, or do they remain locked in a trade-off? To answer these questions, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study. We find that:(i) Robustness, including out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, also follows a scaling law.(ii) Robustness and effectiveness exhibit different scaling patterns, leading to significant resource costs when jointly improving both. Given these findings, we shift to the third factor that affects model performance, namely the optimization strategy, beyond the model size and data size. We find that: (i) By fitting different optimization strategies, the joint performance of robustness and effectiveness traces out a Pareto frontier. (ii) When the optimization strategy strays from Pareto efficiency, the joint performance scales in a sub-optimal direction. (iii) By adjusting the optimization weights to fit the Pareto efficiency, we can achieve Pareto training, where the scaling of joint performance becomes most efficient. Even without requiring additional resources, Pareto training is comparable to the performance of scaling resources several times under optimization strategies that overly prioritize either robustness or effectiveness. Finally, we demonstrate that our findings can help deploy dense retrieval models in real-world applications that scale efficiently and are balanced for robustness and effectiveness.
