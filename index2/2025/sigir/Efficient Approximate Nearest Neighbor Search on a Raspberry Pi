Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search is a core task in Information Retrieval. However, the high computational demands and reliance on expensive infrastructures limit broader contributions to ANN research. Enabling efficient and effective ANN search on low-resource devices would allow researchers in low-income countries to participate in the ANN community, thereby democratizing the field. Despite its potential, the IR literature offers little work on the feasibility of ANN search under resource constraints. In this proposal, we explore efficient solutions for large-scale ANN search on low-resource devices. We report a preliminary experimentation highlighting current limitations and outlining future challenges.
