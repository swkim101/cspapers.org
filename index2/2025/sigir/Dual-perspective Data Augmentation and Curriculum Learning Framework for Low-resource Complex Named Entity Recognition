Low-resource complex named entity recognition focuses on identifying complex entities such as creative work, product name and so on, in scenarios where annotated training data is limited. Recent advanced works deal with this task through data augmentation and make substantial progress. However, existing methods ignore the influence of different types or levels of augmented data on model optimization in different learning stages. To address it, we propose a dual-perspective data augmentation and curriculum learning framework. Specifically, we first employ the large language model (LLM) to construct two kinds of augmented datasets from context-perspective and entity-perspective, respectively. Then, we present a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy including a novel adaptive curriculum arrangement algorithm to automatically select the most suitable kind of augmented set to optimize the target model at each training epoch, thus using the augmented data more effectively and controllably. Experimental results on the public benchmark across various low-resource settings show that our framework outperforms previous works.
