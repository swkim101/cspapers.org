With the advancement of information retrieval (IR) technologies, robustness is increasingly attracting attention. When deploying technology into practice, we consider not only its average performance under normal conditions but, more importantly, its ability to maintain functionality across a variety of exceptional situations. In recent years, the research on IR robustness covers theory, evaluation, methodology, and application, and all of them show a growing trend. The purpose of this workshop is to systematize the latest results of each research aspect, to foster comprehensive communication within this niche domain while also bridging robust IR research with the broader community, and to promote further future development of robust IR. To avoid the one-sided talk of mini-conferences, this workshop adopts a highly interactive format, including round-table and panel discussion sessions, to encourage active participation and meaningful exchange among attendees.
