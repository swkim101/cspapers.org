Nowadays, the explosive growth of academic literature has been going far beyond scientists' limited capability to read through, making it increasingly difficult for them to absorb disciplinary insights and extract intellectual essences critical for generating novel research ideas in interdisciplinary studies. To address this, we develop DeepReport, an AI-assisted scientific idea generation system to alleviate the research burden. Technically, DeepReport maintains evolving concept co-occurrence graphs to extract core insights from over 260 million publications across all disciplines. These concepts are periodically collected and updated, enabling the automatic extraction of hidden cross-domain connections. Combining temporal link prediction and analysis techniques with large language models, DeepReport is able to further transform these patterns of insights into actionable ideas. With the function of integrating up-to-date academic databases, visualizing dynamic relationships of concepts, and automatically generating new ideas, DeepReport empowers researchers to navigate complex knowledge landscapes, reduce cognitive burdens, and accelerate the generation of groundbreaking concepts. This work provides an in-depth exploration of DeepReport's architecture, functionalities, and applications, highlighting its transformative potential for advancing interdisciplinary research and fostering innovation. DeepReport is available at https://idea.acemap.cn/.
