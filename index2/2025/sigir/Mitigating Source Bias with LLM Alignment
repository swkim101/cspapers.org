Recent studies have revealed a phenomenon known as source bias, where PLM-based retrievers assign higher relevance scores to LLM-generated content despite its semantic quality being comparable to human-written content. As LLMs rapidly advance and become more widely used, effectively counteracting source bias is crucial for the sustainable development of the information retrieval (IR) ecosystem. Existing methods primarily attempt to address source bias from the retriever side, adopting a "passive defense" approach that intervenes only after biased content has entered the retrieval pipeline. These solutions are limited by frequent retriever updates in industrial applications, high recurring costs, and their inability to address the root cause of source bias. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for mitigating source bias by actively aligning LLM outputs at the data generation stage. Specifically, we introduce LLM-SBM, a novel LLM alignment framework for source bias mitigation. First, we construct high-quality alignment datasets using an automatic preference data construction pipeline. This pipeline leverages LLMs to generate multiple rephrasings of content and employs a PLM-based retriever to assign corresponding specific preference values for each generated document, thereby forming preference pairs according to these preferences. Moreover, to fully utilize these scalar values of preference and enhance the efficiency of the alignment process, LLM-SBM incorporates these preference differences as weighting factors in the loss function during policy training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and PLM-based retrievers demonstrate that LLMs aligned with LLM-SBM successfully reduce source bias while preserving their general capabilities.
