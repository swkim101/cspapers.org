Measuring effectiveness and efficiency in information retrieval has a strong empirical background. While modern retrieval systems substantially improve effectiveness, the community has not yet agreed on how to measure efficiency, making it difficult to contrast effectiveness and efficiency fairly. Efficiency-oriented system comparisons are difficult due to factors such as hardware configurations, software versioning, and experimental settings. Efficiency affects users, researchers, and the environment and can be measured in many dimensions beyond time and space, such as resource consumption, water usage, and sample efficiency. Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and their trade-off with effectiveness requires revisiting and establishing new standards and principles, from defining relevant concepts to designing new measures and guidelines to assess the findings' significance. ReNeuIR's fourth iteration aims to bring the community together to debate these questions and collaboratively test and improve benchmarking frameworks for efficiency based on discussions and collaborations of its previous iterations, including a shared task focused on efficiency and reproducibility.
