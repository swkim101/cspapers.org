We introduce ROKSANA, an open-source Python toolkit designed to support research in graph-based keyword search under adversarial settings. ROKSANA provides a modular environment for dataset handling, graph neural network (GNN)-based retrieval, and adversarial attack modeling, enabling systematic evaluation of search robustness. The framework integrates built-in retrieval and attack methods while allowing seamless customization of search algorithms and perturbation strategies. Users can benchmark performance on a centralized leaderboard, generate reproducible evaluation reports, and explore ranking behaviors through an interactive web-based visualization interface. By centering around reproducibility, extensibility, and collaborative benchmarking, ROKSANA serves as a comprehensive platform for advancing robust and interpretable keyword search in graphs. This demonstration will showcase ROKSANA's capabilities in real-time, illustrating its impact on experimental workflows and adversarial robustness analysis in graph IR research.
