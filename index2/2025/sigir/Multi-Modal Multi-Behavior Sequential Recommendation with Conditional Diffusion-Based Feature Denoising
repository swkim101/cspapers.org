The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
