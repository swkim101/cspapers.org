The MANILA25 workshop is aimed at collaborative agenda setting around the general area of information retrieval for climate impact in general and around adaptation tracking in particular. To this end, the workshop starts by creating a shared understanding of the problem space through invited talks around information needs in climate impact, search and analysis of climate impact literature, adaptation tracking, and resources. It then brings in different perspectives on the four topics through a number of brief “flash” presentations by participants in the workshop. Then, the participants will work to co-develop a research agenda in a small-scale, highly interactive setting.
