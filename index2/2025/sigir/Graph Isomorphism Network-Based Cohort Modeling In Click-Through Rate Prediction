Accurate Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is vital for search engines and recommendation systems, yet it is often hindered by the ''cold start problem'', which arises from insufficient historical data for new users. Recent approaches have sought to tackle this by training encoder-decoder networks on data from warm users to generate virtual behavior embeddings for cold users. However, these methods have shortcomings in terms of simplistic encoding techniques for warm user behaviors and direct utilization of virtual behavior embeddings, leading to limitations in user interest expression and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that leverages Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) for cohort modeling within CTR prediction. GIN effectively captures high-order user-item interactions, providing a more nuanced understanding of users' diverse interests. Additionally, the cohort modeling strategy minimizes deviations in constructed embeddings, enhancing the model's generalization abilities. We validate our approach through experiments on public and industrial datasets, demonstrating significant improvements for both warm and cold users compared to existing methodologies. Furthermore, we implemented the GIN Cohort Modeling (GINCM) in a large-scale online advertising system, optimizing for both pre-computation and real-time processing to reduce latency. The implementation yields notable enhancements of 2.13% in CTR and Revenue Per Mille(RPM), showcasing the practical effectiveness and real-world applicability of our model.
