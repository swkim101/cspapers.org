Social media platforms rely heavily on ad revenue, making cost-efficient recommendation systems essential for sustaining profitability while preserving user satisfaction, especially in regions with low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). We present a comprehensive approach that combines model-side optimizations (e.g., fused operations, reducing system responsiveness) with system-side enhancements (e.g., improved load balancing, half precision) to lower infrastructure costs without significantly compromising user engagement. Some of the optimizations below were deployed in production to serve 180M users, these optimizations deliver 57% cloud cost savings with less than 0.4% drop in retention and increase net profitability. This work provides a scalable blueprint for cost-efficient recommendation systems and offers actionable insights for deploying such systems in resource-constrained environments.
