Transformer-based sequential recommendation (TSR) models have shown superior performance in recommendation systems, where the quality of item representations plays a crucial role. Classical representation methods integrate item features using concatenation or neural networks to generate homogeneous representation sequences. While straightforward, these methods overlook the heterogeneity of item features, limiting the transformer's ability to capture fine-grained patterns and restricting scalability. Recent studies have attempted to integrate user-side heterogeneous features into item representation sequences, but item-side heterogeneous features, which are vital for performance, remain excluded. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous Information Transformer model for Sequential Recommendation (HeterRec), which incorporates Heterogeneous Token Flatten Layer (HTFL) and Hierarchical Causal Transformer Layer (HCT). Our HTFL is a novel item tokenization method that converts items into a heterogeneous token set and organizes these tokens into heterogeneous sequences, effectively enhancing performance gains when scaling up the model. Moreover, HCT introduces token-level and item-level causal transformers to extract fine-grained patterns from the heterogeneous sequences. Additionally, we design a Listwise Multi-step Prediction (LMP) Loss function to further improve performance. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets show that the HeterRec model achieves superior performance.
