Information retrieval (IR) plays a critical role in financial decision-making across investment research, trading, risk management, and reporting. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), IR systems have evolved to support more natural, context-aware workflows. In this tutorial, we survey recent advances in applying IR and LLM technologies in finance, covering agent-based simulations, investor recommender systems, retrieval-augmented research management, and LLM-driven portfolio construction. We highlight practical challenges and propose future research directions at the intersection of IR, LLMs, and financial innovation. More materials can be found at http://irfin.nlpfin.com/.
