While Personalised PageRank (PPR) is widely used for ranking nodes in certain graphs, research on PPR for uncertain graphs remains limited. Real-world graphs often exhibit uncertainty in some edges with interdependent probabilities. The best-of-breed work by Kim et al.[13] proposed a fast approximate algorithm, UPPR, leveraging the Sherman-Morrison formula with singular value decomposition. However, UPPR lacks error guarantees, and struggles to scale on large graphs due to the high cost to precompute block matrix inverses over the certain part of the graph. To address these problems, we propose UPPR+, an efficient scheme to retrieve PPR on billion-scale uncertain graphs. 1) We first propose an efficient approach that groupifies uncertain edges to remove duplicates of source node set and maps uncertainties into a small subspace using low-dimensional embeddings. 2) To further accelerate the computation, we devise a novel uncertain subspace reduction method and advance the aggregation of PPRs over all possible worlds within the subspace via ''subset embedding''. 3) We provide theoretical guarantees on the exactness of UPPR+ and analyse its time and space complexities. Extensive empirical studies on various real datasets validate that UPPR+ is 23-106x faster than state-of-the-art competitors, and scales well on billion-edge graphs without compromising accuracy.
