Multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has become a core component of various online platforms, but its increasing model size has also brought attention to its efficiency optimization. An important effort is to find effective and efficient feature embedding layers for MSR, and existing work focuses on scenario-level feature selection, i.e., all instance embeddings in the same scenario get the same filtering results on the feature set, and the filtering results are different for different scenarios. However, this ignores the information redundancy of the dimension set and the individuality of different instances in the same scenario. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-scenario instance embedding learning (MultiEmb) framework that implements exclusive feature-dimension redundant information removal for different instances within a scenario to obtain the optimal individual embeddings. The core of our MultiEmb is to introduce an instance embedding selection network to effectively complete the above challenging tasks, in which a set of feature selection and dimension selection adaptive components are equipped for each scenario, and their combination completes the optimal embedding selection for each instance. Finally, we evaluate MultiEmb through extensive experiments on two public multi-scenario benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness, compatibility, transferability, etc.
