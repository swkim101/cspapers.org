The LiveRAG Challenge at SIGIR 2025 provides a competitive platform for advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies. Participants from academia and industry have been invited to build a RAG-based question answering system using a fixed corpus (Fineweb-10BT) and a common open-source LLM (Falcon3-10B-Instruct). The goal is to enable fair, focused comparisons on retrieval and prompting strategies. During the Live Challenge Day, the competing teams must provide answers and supportive information to 500 unseen questions within a strict two-hour window. Evaluation is conducted in two stages: automated LLM-as-a-judge scoring mechanism for correctness and faithfulness, followed by a manual review of top ranked submissions. The winners will be announced and prizes awarded during the LiveRAG Workshop at SIGIR 2025 in Padua, Italy.
