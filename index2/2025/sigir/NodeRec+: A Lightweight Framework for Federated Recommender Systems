Data privacy is a critical concern in today's data-driven world. To this end, Federated Learning (FL) has been researched extensively, as it allows sensitive data to be kept secure on local devices while training global Machine Learning (ML) models across multiple devices. Several FL topologies have been introduced to address different users' needs. FL fits well within the Recommender Systems (RS) domain, with decentralised large-scale datasets and user privacy issues, as it improves personalised recommendations and accuracy while keeping users' sensitive data secure. In this paper, we introduce NodeRec+, the prototype of an FL framework, geared towards enabling the design and evaluation of decentralised RS. NodeRec+ allows quick and easy composition of various FL topologies in simple Python code and comes ready integrated with a number of RS models and evaluation protocols, enabling rapid benchmarking of models in various FL topologies. In contrast to most similar frameworks that are either used for simulations or focused solely on a single FL topology, NodeRec+ provides a framework to build real decentralised networks of nodes that can work jointly using several FL topologies in RS settings.
