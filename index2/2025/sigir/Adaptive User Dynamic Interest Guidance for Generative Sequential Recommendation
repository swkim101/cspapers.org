Recently, diffusion model-based methods have utilized user interest features as guidance conditions to achieve stable generation results in sequential recommendation tasks. However, these models struggle to capture users' dynamic interests, as the interests of different users are often inconsistent. Moreover, the fixed number of interests predefined by existing models cannot adapt to the diverse preferences of users, making it difficult to further improve recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative sequential recommendation framework named ADIGRec (Adaptive User Dynamic Interest Guidance for Generative Sequential Recommendation), which adaptively focuses on users' dynamic interest features. Specifically, our framework combines users' dynamic features and inherent interest features encoded from historical sequences as new guidance conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a module that injects dynamic interest features into the noise item embeddings, enabling explicit interaction with the guidance conditions during the generation phase. This approach essentially fits the noise in the target space rather than the user preference space, leading to improved recommendation diversity. Additionally, we propose a novel regularization method to mitigate the impact of user interest routing collapse on the generation results. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods.
