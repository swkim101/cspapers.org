How can AI and LLMs facilitate the work of scientists in different stages of the research process? Can technology even make scientists obsolete? The role of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in science as the target application domain has recently been rapidly growing. This includes assessing the impact of scientific work, facilitating writing and revising manuscripts as well as intelligent support for manuscript quality assessment, peer-review and scientific discussions. The talk will illustrate such methods and models using several tasks from the scientific domain. We argue that while AI and LLMs can effectively support and augment specific steps of the research process, expert-AI collaboration may be a more promising mode for complex research tasks.
