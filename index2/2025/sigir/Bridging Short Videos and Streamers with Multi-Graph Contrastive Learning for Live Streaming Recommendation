Recently, live streaming services have seen a surge in popularity, prompting many platforms to offer both short video and live streaming services to meet the diverse needs of users and streamers. This has resulted in a close connection between short videos and live streaming within these platforms. Incorporating short video data into live streaming recommendation through cross-domain approaches can effectively mitigate the sparsity of live streaming gifting data. However, existing cross-domain recommendation methods primarily focus on transferring information across domains through overlapping users or items, while overlooking the strong connection between non-overlapping short videos and streamers. In this paper, we propose MGCCDR, a Multi-Graph Contrastive learning framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation, which leverages both overlapping users and non-overlapping items to enhance information transfer. Specifically, we first learn global representations from a global graph to establish connections between streamers and short videos. Subsequently, we construct three bipartite graphs among users, authors, and videos and introduce multi-graph learning to capture preferences within the target domain view, the source domain view, and the cross-domain view. Additionally, to address the varying contributions of each graph to the final recommendation task, we design an attention-based method to effectively integrate these representations, facilitating the information aggregation across domains. Extensive experiments on both commercial and public datasets demonstrate that our MGCCDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
