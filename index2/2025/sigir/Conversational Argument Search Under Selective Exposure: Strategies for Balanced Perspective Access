Conversational argument search systems influence how users access diverse perspectives but are prone to selective exposure. To address this, we propose two strategies: an interface-level multi-agent framework that structures perspective presentation and an interaction-level questioning strategy that encourages deeper engagement. We evaluate these strategies through a 2 x 2 factorial user study, examining their impact on selective exposure. Results show that the multi-agent setup facilitates broader perspective comparison, while agent-initiated questioning fosters deeper reflection; together, they promote more balanced argument access. Based on these findings, we discuss conversational search systems to mitigate selective exposure by implementing multi-agent interactions and questioning mechanisms.
