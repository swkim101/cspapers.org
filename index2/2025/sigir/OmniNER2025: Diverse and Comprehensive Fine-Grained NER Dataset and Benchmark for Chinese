As Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks have evolved, artificial intelligence has been widely applied in this field. However, most benchmarks are limited to English, making it challenging to replicate successful experiences in other languages. To expand NER to informal and diverse Chinese text scenarios, we have proposed a new large-scale Chinese NER dataset, OmniNER2025. This dataset, obtained from user posts on a popular Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, contains 195,568 samples and 89 categories, all manually annotated. To our knowledge, it is currently the largest Chinese open-source NER dataset in terms of sample size, category diversity, and domain coverage. This dataset is more challenging than existing Chinese NER datasets and better reflects real-world applications. The large sample size and diverse entity types provide valuable research resources. Additionally, we introduced the ERRTA tool for error analysis and teacher model guidance, significantly reducing model errors and improving performance. In the future, we will refine the ERRTA framework and explore optimization strategies to enhance the practical value of NER models. By releasing the OmniNER2025 dataset and introducing the ERRTA tool, we have advanced fine-grained NER research and improved model performance, promoting its application and development in real-world scenarios.
