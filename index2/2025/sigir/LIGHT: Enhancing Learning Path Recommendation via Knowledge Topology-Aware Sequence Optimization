Learning path recommendation (LPR) aims to provide individualized and effective learning item routes by modeling learners' learning histories and goals, which has been widely considered a essential task in the field of personalized education. Indeed, considerable research efforts have been dedicated to this direction in recent years, focusing on step-based and sequence-based modeling approaches. However, most of existing studies overlook the complementarity between explicit and implicit relationships among knowledge concepts, while failing to harmonize static knowledge structures with dynamic path generation. To this end, in this paper, we propose LIGHT, a knowLedge topology-aware sequence optImization model for enhancing learninG patH recommendaTion. Specifically, we first construct a composite concept graph that incorporates explicit prerequisite relationships and implicit collaborative relationships, achieved by mining interaction statistics and collaborative signals from learners' learning processes. Next, we design a complementary contrastive fusion module to fully capture the interplay between the two relational views of concepts through graph structure learning and contrastive constraints, which enhances the effectiveness of the learned representations. Following this, we introduce a knowledge topology-aware modeling module that integrates structural semantics clustering with candidate path sampling. Finally, we develop a bidirectional sensing path optimization network to deeply model and optimize the sampled paths from a sequential perspective, thereby enhancing modeling efficiency while preserving structural semantics. Extensive experiments on three real-world educational datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LIGHT model in the LPR task.
