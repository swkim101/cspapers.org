The significant societal impact of online public opinion has spurred extensive research into the underlying mechanisms of information diffusion. While existing diffusion prediction models have effectively leveraged network structure, they often lack a deep understanding of the intrinsic patterns governing information dissemination, thus limiting their predictive power. To address this critical gap, we introduce PMRCA, a novel information diffusion prediction model inspired by social psychology and driven by fundamental propagation patterns. PMRCA posits that two key patterns underpin topic propagation: multisource resonance, where consensus emerges from consistent narratives across multiple sources, and cognitive adaptation, where information is tailored to align with audience cognitive features. Correspondingly, PMRCA incorporates two dedicated learning tasks: structural contrastive learning based on node homogeneity to capture multisource resonance, and clustering contrastive learning based on cognitive clusters to model cognitive adaptation. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that PMRCA significantly outperforms existing mainstream models. Importantly, our pattern-driven approach is model-agnostic, allowing it to be flexibly applied to various diffusion prediction scenarios and enhance performance.
