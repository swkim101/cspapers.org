Personalized recommender systems, which focus on predicting users' interests, have significantly enhanced user experiences across diverse applications. However, existing approaches implicitly model users' preferences through fitting the fine-grained labels (e.g., click labels), but often neglecting the coarse-grained interest information inherent in the inputs themselves. Relying solely on the fine-grained labels could bring negative impact on interest modeling and limit the performance, as the labels may carry inevitable noise in real-world scenarios. In addition, it is considerably demanding in terms of data for most existing approaches to effectively model users' multi-granularity interests with limited or no supporting examples, resulting in subpar performance due to the significant long-tail phenomenon. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel learning framework named the Multi-Granularity Interest Prediction Framework (MGIPF), for better modeling users' diverse interests. Unlike prior work, our key idea is to utilize both the coarse-grained and fine-grained interests for supervising the training of models. Specifically, we introduce a pseudo-labeling approach explicitly mining users' potential multi-granularity interests from the raw data, and propose coarse-grained interest prediction modules that collaborate to utilize the multi-granularity supervision signals to enhance the learning of low-frequency items. The corresponding coarse-grained losses are softly weighted, taking into account the varying confidence of potential multi-granularity preferences on positive and negative samples. Importantly, our framework is lightweight and adaptable, capable of being applied effectively to mainstream recommendation models, establishing a comprehensive end-to-end training process. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/MGIPF.
