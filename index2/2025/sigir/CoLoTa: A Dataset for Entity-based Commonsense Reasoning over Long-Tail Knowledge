The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined the AI landscape, particularly due to their ability to encode factual and commonsense knowledge, and their outstanding performance in tasks requiring reasoning. Despite these advances, hallucinations and reasoning errors remain a significant barrier to their deployment in high-stakes settings. In this work, we observe that even the most prominent LLMs, such as OpenAI-o1, suffer from high rates of reasoning errors and hallucinations on tasks requiring commonsense reasoning over obscure, long-tail entities. To investigate this limitation, we present a new dataset for Commonsense reasoning over Long-Tail entities (CoLoTa), that consists of 3,300 queries from question answering and claim verification tasks and covers a diverse range of commonsense reasoning skills. We remark that CoLoTa can also serve as a Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) dataset since the support of knowledge required to answer its queries is present in the Wikidata knowledge graph. However, as opposed to existing KGQA benchmarks that merely focus on factoid questions, our CoLoTa queries also require commonsense reasoning. Our experiments with strong LLM-based KGQA methodologies indicate their severe inability to answer queries involving commonsense reasoning. Hence, we propose CoLoTa as a novel benchmark for assessing both (i) LLM commonsense reasoning capabilities and their robustness to hallucinations on long-tail entities and (ii) the commonsense reasoning capabilities of KGQA methods.
