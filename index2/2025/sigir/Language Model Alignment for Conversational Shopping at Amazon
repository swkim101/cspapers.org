The rapid growth of online shopping stores, such as Amazon, has led to services reaching billions of people worldwide. With global retail sales exceeding $6 trillion in 2024, customer expectations for personalized and seamless shopping experiences have heightened. Traditional online shopping experiences, such as search and navigation systems, often fall short in addressing complex shopping journeys. Conversational shopping (such as Amazon Rufus) offers a transformative approach by enabling dynamic, multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble human interactions. This allows customers to explore product options, seek clarifications, and receive personalized recommendations, thereby enhancing product discovery and informed decision-making. In this paper, we share our year-long journey of using language models for conversational shopping at Amazon and introduce how we use LLM fine-tuning techniques to enhance LLMs for a conversational shopping experience like Amazon Rufus. We also introduce innovative strategies for training data collection and demonstrate real-world applications, including product recommendations, clarification mechanisms, and internationalization for global customers.
