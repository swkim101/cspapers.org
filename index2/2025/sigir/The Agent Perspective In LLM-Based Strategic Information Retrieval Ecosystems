The rise of generative AI and the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a new line of research on the evolution of strategic information retrieval ecosystems. My research adopts an agent-based perspective to analyze sponsored search and competitive search ecosystems. The primary motivation of my work is to examine how agent strategies influence social welfare and the existence of equilibrium. To that end, I leverage frameworks from game theory and mechanism design.
