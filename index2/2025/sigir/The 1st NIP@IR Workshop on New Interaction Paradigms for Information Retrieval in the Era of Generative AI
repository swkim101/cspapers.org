The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), driven by advancements in large language models (LLMs), has unlocked transformative possibilities for information retrieval (IR), giving rise to a new wave of interactive and conversational paradigms. This workshop, titled New Interaction Paradigms for Information Retrieval in the Era of Generative AI, aims to serve as a collaborative platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the challenges and opportunities of integrating generative AI into IR systems. By focusing on tasks such as multi-turn conversational search, adaptive retrieval interfaces, and context-aware response generation, this workshop will address key areas including system design, user engagement, and evaluation methodologies. The workshop will also delve into broader concerns such as trust, transparency, and fairness, emphasizing the ethical implications of deploying generative AI in IR systems. Through panel discussions, poster sessions, and interactive roundtables, this workshop will foster critical dialogue and innovation, paving the way for a new era of user-centric, generative AI-powered IR systems.
