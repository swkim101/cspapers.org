The volume of ads ranked impacts the performance of ad ranking systems. To enhance efficiency, multi-stage ranking systems are widely studied in academia and adopted across industry. However, as large-scale deep learning recommendation models gain prevalence, resource constraints-especially CPU and GPU limitations-have become a significant bottleneck. These constraints can hinder model iteration and lead to incomplete ranking, causing regressions in user experience and ad performance. To address these issues, we analyzed ad ranking metrics and found that ad rankings for individual users remain relatively stable over short periods. Based on this insight, we introduce Negative Exclusion Filtering, a framework that optimizes the balance between ranked ad volume and computing resources. By skipping re-ranking of consistently low-ranked ads for each user request, it reduces computing cost in large-scale social media environments. Negative Exclusion Filtering has achieved CPU reductions of 3.7-7.4% and GPU reductions of 4.0-7.9% in power consumption across various Meta products, along with a 0.5-2.0% reduction in latency, all while maintaining recommendation quality and performance.
