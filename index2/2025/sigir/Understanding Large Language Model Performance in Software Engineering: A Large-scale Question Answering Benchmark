In this work, we introduce CodeRepoQA, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed for evaluating repository-level question-answering capabilities in the field of software engineering. CodeRepoQA encompasses five programming languages and covers a wide range of scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation of language models.To construct this dataset, we crawl data from 30 well-known repositories in GitHub, the largest platform for hosting and collaborating on code, and carefully filter the raw data.In total, CodeRepoQA is a multi-turn question-answering benchmark with 585,687 entries. It covers a diverse array of software engineering scenarios, with an average of 6.62 dialogue turns per entry. We evaluate ten popular large language models on our dataset and provide in-depth analysis. We find that LLMs still have limitations in question-answering capabilities in the field of software engineering, and medium-length contexts are more conducive to their performance. The entire benchmark and details are publicly available at https://github.com/kinesiatricssxilm14/CodeRepoQA.
