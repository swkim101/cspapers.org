The eCommerce search and recommendations space is a unique and dynamic domain within information retrieval (IR), characterized by its multimodality and industry-driven challenges. While the basic task of fulfilling a user's information need aligns with web search, the methodologies employed are distinct. On eCommerce platforms (e.g. Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Flipkart, Walmart), the data available for retrieval and ranking differs significantly, as do the success signals (e.g. adding items to a cart, purchasing). Our focus for 2025 is on fostering deeper engagement through interactive discussions, exploring crucial topics such as navigating irreproducibility in research-to-product pipelines, and addressing emerging topics such as evaluation metrics for LLMs, multimodality, and the interplay between organic and sponsored search. With our discussion-heavy format and structured facilitation, we aim to spark conversation among all participants.
