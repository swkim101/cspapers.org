Conversational recommender systems aim to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing and utilizing contextual information related to dialogue. However, existing methods typically model the dialogue context as a whole, neglecting the inherent complexity and entanglement within the dialogue. Specifically, a dialogue comprises both focus information and background information, which mutually influence each other. Current methods tend to model these two types of information mixedly, leading to misinterpretation of users' actual needs, thereby lowering the accuracy of recommendations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel model to introduce contextual disentanglement for improving conversational recommender systems, named DisenCRS. The proposed model DisenCRS employs a dual disentanglement framework, including self-supervised contrastive disentanglement and counterfactual inference disentanglement, to effectively distinguish focus information and background information from the dialogue context under unsupervised conditions. Moreover, we design an adaptive prompt learning module to automatically select the most suitable prompt based on the specific dialogue context, fully leveraging the power of large language models. Experimental results on two widely used public datasets demonstrate that DisenCRS significantly outperforms existing conversational recommendation models, achieving superior performance on both item recommendation and response generation tasks.
