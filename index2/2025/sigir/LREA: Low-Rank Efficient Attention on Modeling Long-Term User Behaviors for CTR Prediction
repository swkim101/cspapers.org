With the rapid growth of user historical behavior data, user interest modeling has become a prominent aspect in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, focusing on learning user intent representations. However, this complexity poses computational challenges, requiring a balance between model performance and acceptable response times for online services. Traditional methods often utilize filtering techniques. These techniques can lead to the loss of significant information by prioritizing top K items based on item attributes or employing low-precision attention mechanisms. In this study, we introduce LREA, a novel attention mechanism that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches while ensuring computational efficiency. LREA leverages low-rank matrix decomposition to optimize runtime performance and incorporates a specially designed loss function to maintain attention capabilities while preserving information integrity. During the inference phase, matrix absorption and pre-storage strategies are employed to effectively meet runtime constraints. The results of extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
