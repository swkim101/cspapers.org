In recent years, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, attracting considerable attention in a variety of fields. By integrating the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, these systems have shown immense potential to push the boundaries of machine learning applications. Nevertheless, RAG systems still face significant challenges and offer ample room for advancement and innovation. This workshop aims to highlight the central role of information retrieval within RAG frameworks, which we believe has often been overshadowed by the emphasis on the generative components. While the generative models are integral to these systems, the quality and effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism is equally critical, as it has a direct impact on the overall system performance and outcomes. We invite papers that rethink and prioritise the fundamental aspects of RAG systems, particularly in strengthening the information retrieval component. Through this workshop, we aim to gain deeper insights into how improved retrieval methods can enhance the performance and reliability of RAG systems. The event will bring together leading experts, researchers and practitioners to provide a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing results and fostering innovation. Our aim is to stimulate research and discussion that reaffirms the essential role of information retrieval in shaping the next generation of generative systems.
