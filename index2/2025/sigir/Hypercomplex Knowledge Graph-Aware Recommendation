Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of well-organized external information and have been proven to enhance recommendation quality effectively. Most KG-aware recommender systems are developed using real number space embeddings. In recent years, learning representations in the hypercomplex space has gained success and attention. Compared to single-component real-valued vectors, multi-component hypercomplex embeddings offer greater expressiveness, facilitating more meaningful modeling of users, items, entities, and their relations in the user-item interaction graph and KG. In this paper, we explore the integration of hypercomplex algebras in KG-aware recommendation and propose a Hypercomplex Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender (HKGR) method. Our HKGR models the interaction graph and KG in the hypercomplex space by utilizing specially designed hypercomplex graph neural networks. In particular, HKGR employs a hypercomplex attention-based aggregator to capture the structure and semantics of the KG. In the recommendation prediction phase, we design a hypercomplex interaction network that can approximate the high-order component interactions between users and items. Furthermore, we introduce a hypercomplex contrastive learning operator to strengthen cooperative signals between the interaction graph and KG modelings. Experiment results on the four real-world datasets show that our HKGR outperforms the state-of-the-art recommender baselines.
