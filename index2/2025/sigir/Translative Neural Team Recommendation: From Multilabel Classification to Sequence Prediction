Neural team recommendation has achieved state-of-the-art performance in forming teams of experts whose success in completing complex tasks is almost surely guaranteed. The proposed models frame the problem as a Boolean multilabel classification, mapping the dense vector representations of required skills to the sparse occurrence (multi-hot) vector representation of an optimum subset of experts using multilayer feedforward neural networks. Such approaches, however, suffer from the curse of sparsity in the high-dimensional vector of optimum experts in the output layer. In this paper, we propose to reformulate the team recommendation problem into a sequence prediction task and leverage seq-to-seq models, including transformers, to map an input sequence of the required subset of skills onto an output sequence of the optimum subset of experts. Our experiments on four large-scale datasets from various domains, with distinct distributions of skills in teams, show that the seq-to-seq approach is consistently superior overall in a host of classification and information retrieval metrics.
