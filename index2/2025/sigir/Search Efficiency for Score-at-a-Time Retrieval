Impact-ordered indexes, and thus Score-at-a-Time (SaaT) retrieval, is seeing a resurgence due to the emergence of learned sparse representations [4] (LSR) which employ the use of neural networks to learn the term-document weights. Within this context, SaaT has been found to be a competitive alternative to the more studied Document-at-a-Time (DaaT) approach. Even so, JASSv2 [2, 6] and IOQP [4] remain the only well-known open-source SaaT search engines.We believe that a thorough study into their operation and components may provide valuable insights. We wish to use this knowledge to build a better baseline system for SaaT retrieval. Once established, we aim to improve upon it. Specifically, we ask: (1) Can we build a better baseline for Score-at-a-Time retrieval by finding the most efficient and effective components from existing systems? (2) Can we improve upon the baseline by updating QMX to make use of more recent SIMD technologies? (3) Can we improve upon the baseline with a new accumulator management strategy? (4) Can we improve upon the baseline with a new approach to early termination/pruning? It is not obvious what the current baseline for SaaT should be, or what components are the most efficient. Through investigating various aspects of the search engines - specifically integer compression, accumulator management, and early termination (ρ) - we will build a more indicative baseline system. We highlight these components in particular as we have reason to believe they will be influential.
