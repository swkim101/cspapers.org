A large item catalogue is a major challenge for deploying modern sequential recommender models, since it makes the memory footprint of the model large and increases inference latency. One promising approach to address this is RecJPQ, which replaces item embeddings with sub-item embeddings. However, slow inference remains problematic because finding the top highest-scored items usually requires scoring all items in the catalogue, which may not be feasible for large catalogues. By adapting dynamic pruning concepts from document retrieval, we propose the RecJPQPrune dynamic pruning algorithm to efficiently find the top highest-scored items without computing the scores of all items in the catalogue. Our RecJPQPrune algorithm is safe-up-to-rank K since it theoretically guarantees that no potentially high-scored item is excluded from the final top K recommendation list, thereby ensuring no impact on effectiveness. Our experiments on two large datasets and three recommendation models demonstrate the efficiency achievable using RecJPQPrune: for instance, on the Tmall dataset with 2.2M items, we can reduce the median model scoring time by 64 times compared to the Transformer Default baseline, and 5.3 times compared to a recent scoring approach called PQTopK. Overall, this paper demonstrates the effective and efficient inference of Transformer-based recommendation models at catalogue scales not previously reported in the literature. Indeed, our RecJPQPrune algorithm can score 2 million items in under 10 milliseconds without GPUs, and without relying on Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) techniques.
