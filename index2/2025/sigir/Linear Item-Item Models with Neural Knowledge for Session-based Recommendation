Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict users' subsequent actions by modeling short-term interactions within sessions. Existing neural models primarily focus on capturing complex dependencies for sequential item transitions. As an alternative solution, linear item-item models mainly identify strong co-occurrence patterns across items and support faster inference speed. Although each paradigm has been actively studied in SBR, their fundamental differences in capturing item relationships and how to bridge these distinct modeling paradigms effectively remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel SBR model, namely Linear Item-Item model with Neural Knowledge (LINK), which integrates both types of knowledge into a unified linear framework. Specifically, we design two specialized components of LINK: (i) Linear knowledge-enhanced Item-item Similarity model (LIS), which refines the item similarity correlation via self-distillation, and (ii) Neural knowledge-enhanced Item-item Transition model (NIT), which seamlessly incorporates complicated neural knowledge distilled from the off-the-shelf neural model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LINK outperforms state-of-the-art linear SBR models across six real-world datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.78% and 11.04% in Recall@20 and MRR@20 while showing up to 813x fewer inference FLOPs.
