The reproducibility and transparency of retrieval experiments depends on the availability of information about the experimental setup. However, the manual collection of experiment metadata can be tedious, error-prone, and inconsistent, which calls for an automated systematic collection. Expanding ir_metadata, we present the TIREx tracker, a tool that records hardware configurations, power/CPU/RAM/GPU usage, and experiment/system versions. Implemented as a lightweight platform-independent C binary, the TIREx tracker integrates seamlessly into Python, Java, or C/C++ workflows and can be easily integrated into shard task submissions, as we demonstrate for the TIRA/TIREx platform. Code, binaries, and documentation of the TIREx tracker are publicly available at https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker.
