Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects sensory perception, making spatial exploration difficult. Recommender systems can assist ASD users by suggesting Points of Interest (POIs) aligned with their sensory preferences. However, demographic constraints, difficulties in engaging ASD users, and the complexity of obtaining sensory data position POI recommendation for ASD people as a low-resource problem. In this paper, we identify key challenges in developing such systems and present our ongoing efforts. Using a local ASD center as a use case, we are developing a structured user involvement protocol. From the limited data, we are deriving knowledge graphs (KGs) to model preferences and sensory aspects. We are then exploring KG-based techniques to generate paths from users to POIs to suggest. With psychologists, we are refining the paths structure to match varying complexity levels and translate them into natural language accessible for people with ASD.
