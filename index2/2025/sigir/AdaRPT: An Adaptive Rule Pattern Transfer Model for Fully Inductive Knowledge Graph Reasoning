Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is a key technology that infers missing facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). Given that real-world scenarios typically encounter unseen KGs with new entities and new relations, researchers have begun to explore fully inductive KGR methods. This setting presents greater challenges and has not been fully explored. Current methods primarily construct relation graphs based on the original KG to facilitate message passing between relations. These models have made significant progress in achieving fully inductive reasoning. However, as relation graphs focus solely on the co-occurrence patterns between relations, they often fail to capture reasoning patterns in KGs, which causes the model to struggle in effectively distinguishing between different relations and entities. This limitation severely restrict the reasoning capabilities of existing methods. In light of this, we propose the Adaptive Rule Pattern Transfer model (AdaRPT) for KGR. It aims to leverage logical rules for each relation in the KG to learn more comprehensive and transferable knowledge representations for entities and relations. For entities, we design a non-parameter message passing model that aggregates path information from the query entity to other entities. The path information for each entity is then matched with rules to obtain the transferable feature of each entity. And for relations, we extract both reasoning and co-occurrence patterns from KGs as transferable relation features. Finally, a path-based graph neural network (GNN) is employed on the transferable features of entities and relations to perform reasoning on KGs. Extensive experimental evaluations on 43 datasets for both inductive and transductive reasoning demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of AdaRPT.
