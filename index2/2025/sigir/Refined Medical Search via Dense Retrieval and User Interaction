Users formulate search queries that reflect an information need. Those queries are then submitted to a search service in the expectation that the retrieved results will allow the user to complete an external task, and align with their broader information context. In this study, we reimplement and reproduce the log-augmented dense retrieval approach introduced by Jin, Shin, and Lu in 2023. As part of our study we extend the experimentation by: (1) using all of the available training data rather than a subset; (2) exploring a second dense retrieval model; and (3) enhancing the approach by incorporating user reformulation behavior into the dense retrieval computation so as to improve ranking effectiveness. To evaluate these modifications, we again utilize the TripClick IR benchmark, which comprises approximately four million click log entries from a health domain web search engine. Although we were unable to exactly replicate the results of Jin, Shin, and Lu, our findings confirm the overall trends reported in their study. Specifically, our results support the conclusion that incorporating user interactions into dense retrieval models improves ranking effectiveness compared to when no user information is available. Moreover, our enhanced formulation allows further small gains to be made in retrieval effectiveness.
