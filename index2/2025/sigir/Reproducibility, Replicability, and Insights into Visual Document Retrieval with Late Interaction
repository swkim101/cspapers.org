Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) is an emerging research area that focuses on encoding and retrieving document images directly, bypassing the dependence on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for document search. A recent advance in VDR was introduced by ColPali, which significantly improved retrieval effectiveness through a late interaction mechanism. ColPali's approach demonstrated substantial performance gains over existing baselines that do not use late interaction on an established benchmark. In this study, we investigate the reproducibility and replicability of VDR methods with and without late interaction mechanisms by systematically evaluating their performance across multiple pre-trained vision-language models. Our findings confirm that late interaction yields considerable improvements in retrieval effectiveness; however, it also introduces computational inefficiencies during inference. Additionally, we examine the adaptability of VDR models to textual inputs and assess their robustness across text-intensive datasets within the proposed benchmark, particularly when scaling the indexing mechanism. Furthermore, our research investigates the specific contributions of late interaction by looking into query-patch matching in the context of visual document retrieval. We find that although query tokens cannot explicitly match image patches as in the text retrieval scenario, they tend to match the patch contains visually similar tokens or their surrounding patches.
