Extensive research exists on user interactions with search engine result pages (SERPs) in desktop and mobile environments. However, relatively little work has focused on understanding how virtual reality (VR) users interact with SERPs in 3D immersive virtual environments (IVEs). Unlike 2D displays with established paradigms (e.g., ranked lists), 3D IVEs lack standardized methods for presenting search results. This work explores how different information arrangements in 3D virtual space impact users' search behaviors and preferences. This paper presents the results of an exploratory within-subjects user study that investigated search behaviors, perceptions, and eye-tracking behaviors for four different spatial arrangements of search results (''list'' - 2D list; ''curve3'' - 3x3 curved grid; ''curve4'' - 4x4 curved grid; and ''sphere'' - 4x4 semi-spherical grid) in a virtual reality across two different task types (Find All relevant, Pick 3 best). Thirty-two (32) participants completed 5 search trials in 8 experimental conditions (4 displays x 2 task types) for 40 total search trials. The findings from our analysis show: (1) participants were accepting of and more often preferred using the more immersive displays than the conventional list display (2) they generally preferred turning their heads (''physical navigation'') to scrolling (''virtual navigation'') for viewing results (3) they perceived scrolling back up a display as an act of backtracking but did not perceived head movements to previously viewed results as backtracking, and (4) they spent less time gazing at the right-most columns in the exhaustive search task. We discuss the implications of the results on designs for SERPs in 3D IVEs.
