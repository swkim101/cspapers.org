In many cases it is desirable to navigate an arbitrary text collection. While current technologies allow for fast and efficient text collection search, comparable technologies do not yet exist for navigation. Our prior work has proposed Hypergraph of Text (HoT) as a structure that could enable such navigation, but there is not yet a general system that allows users to interact with such a structure. To address this challenge, we introduce Text Information Navigation Kit (TINK) a novel tool-kit that allows users to turn any collection of plain text documents into a navigable collection. We discuss the modular and extensible two-part structure of TINK. In this demonstration paper we discuss this novel system, its strengths and its weaknesses. The code for TINK can be found in our GitHub repo here:https://github.com/TIMAN-group/TINK
