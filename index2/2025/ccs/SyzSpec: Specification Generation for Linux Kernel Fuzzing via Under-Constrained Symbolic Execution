Fuzzing has become one of the most effective and widely used techniques for discovering bugs and vulnerabilities, particularly in large-scale and complex programs like operating system kernels. A notable example is the kernel fuzzer syzkaller, which has identified over 6,800 bugs in the Linux kernel, with more than 5,500 already fixed. A crucial reason behind the success of the syzkaller is its collection of syscall descriptions, which are typically provided by human experts. Although some methods exist for automatically generating these syscall descriptions for device drivers, they often fall short when dealing with complex user inputs. These existing methods either lack precision or have a limited analysis scope, resulting in incomplete syscall descriptions. In this paper, we present SyzSpec, a tool designed to address these limitations by performing fully inter-procedural under- constrained symbolic execution on syscall handler functions. This approach enables SyzSpec to explore all possible user inputs and generate syscall descriptions with more precision. The primary innovation in SyzSpec is a novel method to improve symbolic pointer reasoning in under-constrained symbolic execution, working along with the under-under-constrained memory object (UCMO). We compared SyzSpec with existing automated solutions and manually written syscall descriptions from syzkaller. Our results demonstrate that SyzSpec achieves better coverage than other automated tools and offers coverage comparable to that of manually written syscall descriptions. Additionally, we evaluated SyzSpec on the latest stable version of the Linux kernel (v6.10)
