Searchable encryption enables secure searches over encrypted data in the cloud. Among all paradigms, public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is particularly desirable by privacy-preserving distributed computing and IoT applications, since it allows multiple parties (i.e., writers) to independently contribute encrypted data. However, a PEKS search usually requires a linear scan over the entire dataset for keyword search, causing unacceptable latency when facing a large amount of data. All existing efforts to speed up multi-writer searchable encryption are based on conventional hardness assumptions for security, which can be broken provided the advent of quantum computers. In this work, we propose a lattice-based multi-writer searchable encryption scheme, which lets writers build indices for their outsourced data to make keyword searches faster. Meanwhile, the security of the proposed solution relies on the learning with errors assumption, which is known to withstand the potential attack from quantum computers.
