Software developers face risks of leaking their software secrets, such as API keys or passwords, which can result in significant harm. Secret management tools (SMTs), such as HashiCorp Vault Secrets or Infisical, are highly recommended by industry, academia, and security guidelines to manage secrets securely. SMTs are designed to help developers secure their secrets in a central location, yet secrets leaks are still commonplace, and developers report difficulty in learning how to setup and use SMTs. While SMTs typically come with publicly available help resources (e.g., tool documentation and interfaces), it is unclear if these actually help developers learn to effectively use SMTs. Without usable help resources that onboards developers, quick adoption and effective use of SMTs may be unrealistic. In a qualitative two-step study, we observed 21 new users in person while they used SMTs to perform two secret management tasks: secret storage and access, then secret injection. We interviewed participants after each task to identify their challenges and experiences using SMTs, with the assistance of help resources. While our study sample is narrow, it serves as a reasonable proxy for new developers who are likely to adopt SMTs early in their careers. We found that even in a laboratory setting where new users found tool functionality, interface flexibility helpful, they still experienced increased difficulty to effectively use SMTs to securely remediate a hard-coded secret when they felt tool documentation was insufficient and it motivated participants to deviate from official tool documentation to access secondary sources or attempt workaround methods. Specific challenges reported by participants were tool documentation content quality, navigation difficulties with both tool documentation and web interfaces for finding helpful content, and supportive tool features.
