This paper presents the first non-interactive, succinct, and secure representation of a PoW-based blockchain that operates under variable mining difficulty while satisfying both completeness and on-lineness properties. Completeness ensures that provers can up-date an existing NIPoPoW by incorporating a newly mined block, whereas onlineness ensures that miners can extend the chain directly from a NIPoPoW. The time complexity for both the prover (to update a NIPoPoW with a new block) and the verifier is logarithmic in the number of blocks of the underlying PoW blockchain. The communication complexity required for synchronization is polylog-arithmic in the length of the blockchain. We prove the correctness of our scheme in the presence of a 1 / 3-bounded PPT adversary.
