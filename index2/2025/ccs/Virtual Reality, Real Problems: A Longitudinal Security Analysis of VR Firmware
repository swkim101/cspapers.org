Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly growing in recent years. VR devices such as Meta Quest 3 utilize numerous sensors to collect users'data to provide an immersive experience. Due to the extensive data collection and the immersive nature, the security of VR devices is paramount. Leading VR devices often adopt and customize Android systems, which makes them susceptible to both Android-based vulnerabilities and new issues introduced by VR-specific customizations (e.g., system services to support continuous head and hand tracking). While prior work has extensively examined the security properties of the Android software stack, how these security properties hold for VR systems remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of VR firmware. We collect over 300 versions of VR firmware from two major vendors, Quest and Pico, and perform a longitudinal analysis across the kernel layer, the system binary and library layer, and the application layer. We have identified several security issues in these VR firmware, including missing kernel-level security features, insufficient binary hardening, inconsistent permission enforcement, and inadequate SELinux policy enforcement. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for VR vendors to improve security and trust for VR devices. This paper will act as an important security resource for VR developers, users, and vendors, and will also direct future advancements in secure VR ecosystem.
