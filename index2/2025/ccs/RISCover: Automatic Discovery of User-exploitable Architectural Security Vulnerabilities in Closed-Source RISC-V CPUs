The open and extensible RISC-V instruction set has enabled many new CPU vendors and implementations, but most commercial CPUs are closed-source, significantly hindering vulnerability analysis— especially for bugs exploitable from unprivileged user space. We present RISCover, a user-space framework for detecting architectural vulnerabilities in closed-source RISC-V CPUs. It compares instruction-sequence behavior across CPUs, identifying deviations without source code, hardware changes, or models, and achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups over RTL-based methods. Unlike prior work, RISCover runs user code on Linux directly on real hardware, exposing vulnerabilities exploitable by unprivi-leged attackers. Evaluated on 8 off-the-shelf CPUs from 3 different vendors, it uncovers 4 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Notably, GhostWrite lets unprivileged code write chosen bytes to physical memory, enabling arbitrary data leakage and full machine-mode execution, while 3 unprivileged “halt-and-catch-fire” bugs halt CPUs and misaligned zero-stores silently corrupt data. Our re-sults highlight the pressing need for post-silicon fuzzing techniques. RISCover complements existing RTL-level fuzzers by enabling rapid and automated security analysis of closed-source CPUs.
