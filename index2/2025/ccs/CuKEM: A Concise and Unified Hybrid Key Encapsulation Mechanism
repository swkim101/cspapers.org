In the post-quantum migration of the traditional key establishment protocol, hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) are recommended by standards bodies, including NIST, ETSI, and national security agencies like NCSC-UK, BSI-Germany etc. Recently, several hybrid KEMs with CCA security such as XOR-then-MAC, Dual-PRF and X-Wing (being standardized by IETF) are proposed based on CCA KEMs obtained by applying the complicated Fujisaki-Okamoto transform to public-key encryption (PKE) schemes. In some cryptographic protocols such as PQ-Noise and Signal, 1CCA security (similar to CCA security except that the adversary is restricted to one single decapsulation query) is required. However, no specific scheme has been designed to specifically achieve 1CCA security (excluding the schemes that aim to achieve CCA security, as they inherently encompass 1CCA security). In this paper, we propose CUKEM, a concise and unified hybrid KEM framework built directly on PKEs, and its variant CUKEM+, which achieves CCA security by replacing one PKE component with a nominal group. We prove that our schemes, equipped with different modules, achieve standard security notions in both the random oracle model and the quantum random oracle model, including IND-CPA, IND-1CCA, and IND-CCA. Compared to existing KEM-based constructions, CUKEM and CUKEM+ are more concise, as they simplify or even eliminate certain hash operations without compromising security. Our evaluation shows that the CCA-secure CUKEM+ achieves encapsulation and decapsulation speedups of up to 22.28% and 16.22%, respectively, over X-Wing, while the 1CCA-secure CUKEM attains gains of up to 13.97% and 104.31%.
