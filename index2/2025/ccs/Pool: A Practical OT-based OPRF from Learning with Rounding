We propose Pool: a conceptually simple post-quantum (PQ) oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF) protocol, that is round-optimal (with input-independent preprocessing), practically efficient, and has security based on the well-understood hardness of the learning with rounding (LWR) problem. Specifically, our design permits oblivious computation of the LWR-based pseudorandom function 𝐹 sk ( 𝑥 ) = ⌈ 𝐻 ( 𝑥 ) ⊤ · sk ⌋ 𝑞,𝑝 , for random oracle 𝐻 : { 0 , 1 } ∗ ↦→ Z 𝑛𝑞 and uniformly chosen sk ∈ { 0 , 1 } 𝑛 . For 128-bits of semi-honest security, the Pool OPRF has an online communication cost of 11.9 kB, and a computational runtime of less than 2 ms on a single thread (via an open-source software implementation). This is more efficient (in either online communication cost or runtime) than constructions from well-known PQ PRFs, and is competitive even with constructions that only conjecture PQ security on lesser-known assumptions. As a result, our design gives high-performance, post-quantum variants of established OPRF applications in multi-party computation and private set operation protocols.
