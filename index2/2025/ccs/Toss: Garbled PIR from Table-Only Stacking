Garbled Circuits (GC) is a foundational primitive for secure two-party computation (2PC). Garbled Private Information Retrieval (GPIR) is a GC technique for looking up a public array or database (DB) on a private index unknown to either player. GPIR immediately implies GC evaluation of functions implemented as a publicly known look-up table (LUT). GPIR is costly: it can be obtained by a linear scan, adapting Garbled RAM, stacking GC branches implementing access to table elements, and, most recently, from GC Look-up Table logrow (Heath et al., Eurocrypt 2024). For a N -row DB lookup of m -bit rows, logrow ’s computation is ≈ O ( Nmκ ) , and communication is O ( m (log N · κ + N )) . logrow thus can be effectively used on tables of sizes up to ≈ 2 15 . We propose Toss , a new efficient GPIR with dramatically reduced bandwidth consumption (a scarce resource in MPC!), both asymptotically and concretely. Our communication cost is O ( √ Nm √ κ ) with a small constant, sublinear both in N and security parameter κ . Our computation cost is O ( Nmκ + ( (cid:112) N/κm + N ) c κ ) , where c κ is the computational cost of hash evaluation. This computation cost is about the same as or slightly lower than logrow ’s. In concrete terms, for a 2 20 -row LUT of 8 -bit items, we improve over logrow by factor > 31 × in communication. On a laptop over 100 Mbps channel, the throughput increases from ≈ 10 . 6 lookup/s to ≈ 81 lookup/s, achieving > 7 . 5 × improvement. For 10 Mbps channel, Toss ’s throughput is > 28 × better. Communication improvement grows with N : e.g., for N = 2 25 , m = 32 , improvement is > 512 × . Toss builds on
