We present the first formally-verified Internet router, which is part of the SCION Internet architecture. SCION routers run a cryptographic protocol for secure packet forwarding in an adversarial environment. We verify both the protocol’s network-wide security properties and the low-level properties of its implementation. Namely, we develop a series of protocol models by refinement in Isabelle/HOL and we use an automated program verifier to prove that the router’s Go code satisfies crash freedom, freedom from data races, and adheres to the most concrete model in our series of refinements. Both verification efforts are soundly linked together. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of coherently verifying a security-critical network component from high-level protocol models down to performance-optimized production code, developed by an independent team. In the process, we uncovered critical attacks and bugs in both the protocol and its implementation, which were confirmed by the code developers, and we strengthened the protocol’s security properties. This paper presents the challenges we faced when verifying an existing real-world system, explains our approach to tackling these challenges, summarizes the main results, and distills valuable lessons for the verification of secure systems, in particular for the techniques and tools employed.
