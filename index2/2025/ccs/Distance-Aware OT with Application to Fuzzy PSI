A two-party fuzzy private set intersection (PSI) protocol between Alice and Bob with input sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 allows Alice to learn nothing more than the points of Bob that are “ 𝛿 -close” to its points in some metric space dist . More formally, Alice learns only the set { 𝑏 | dist ( 𝑎,𝑏 ) ≤ 𝛿,𝑎 ∈ 𝐴,𝑏 ∈ 𝐵 } for a predefined threshold 𝛿 and distance metric dist , while Bob learns nothing about Alice’s set. Fuzzy PSI is a valuable privacy tool in scenarios where private set intersection needs to be computed over imprecise or measurement-based data, such as GPS coordinates or healthcare data. Previous approaches to fuzzy PSI rely on asymmetric cryptographic primitives, generic two-party computation (2PC) techniques like garbled circuits, or function secret sharing methods, all of which are computationally intensive and lead to poor concrete efficiency. This work introduces a new modular framework for fuzzy PSI, primarily built on efficient symmetric key primitives. Our framework reduces the design of efficient fuzzy PSI to a novel variant of oblivious transfer (OT), which we term distance-aware random OT (da-ROT). This variant enables the sender to obtain two random strings ( 𝑟 0 ,𝑟 1 ) , while the receiver obtains one of these values 𝑟 𝑏 , depending on whether the receiver’s input keyword 𝑎 and the sender’s input keyword 𝑏 are close in some metric space i.e., dist ( 𝑎,𝑏 ) ≤ 𝛿 . The da-ROT can be viewed as a natural extension of traditional OT, where the condition (choice bit) is known to the receiver. We propose efficient constructions for da-ROT based on standard OT techniques tailored for small domains,
