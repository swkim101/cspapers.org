Git services such as GitHub, have been widely used to manage projects and enable collaborations among multiple entities. Just as in messaging and cloud storage, where end-to-end security has been gaining increased attention, such a level of security is also demanded for Git services. Content in the repositories (and the data/code supply-chain facilitated by Git services) could be highly valuable, whereas the threat of system breaches has become routine nowadays. However, existing studies of Git security to date (mostly open source projects) suffer in two ways: they provide only very weak security, and they have a large overhead. In this paper, we initiate the needed study of efficient end-to-end encrypted Git services. Specifically, we formally define the syntax and critical security properties, and then propose two constructions that provably meet those properties. Moreover, our constructions have the important property of platform-compatibility: They are compatible with current Git servers and reserve all basic Git operations, thus can be directly tested and deployed on top of existing platforms. Furthermore, the overhead we achieve is only proportional to the actual difference caused by each edit, instead of the whole file (or even the whole repository) as is the case with existing works. We implemented both constructions and tested them directly on several public GitHub repositories. Our evaluations show (1) the effectiveness of platform-compatibility, and (2) the significant efficiency improvement we got (while provably providing much stronger security than prior ad-hoc treatments).
