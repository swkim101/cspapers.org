Ensuring compliance with Information Flow Security (IFS) is known to be challenging, especially for concurrent systems with large codebases such as multicore operating system (OS) kernels. Refinement, which verifies that an implementation preserves certain properties of a more abstract specification, is promising for tackling such challenges. However, in terms of refinement-based verification of security properties, existing techniques are still restricted to sequential systems or lack the expressiveness needed to capture complex security policies for concurrent systems. In this work, we present a generalized security-preserving refinement technique, particularly for verifying the IFS of concurrent systems governed by potentially complex security policies. We formalize the IFS properties for concurrent systems and present a refinement-based compositional approach to prove that the generalized security properties (e.g., intransitive noninterference) are preserved between implementation and abstraction. The key intuition enabling such reasoning, compared to previous refinement work, is to establish a step-mapping relation between the implementation and the abstraction, which is sufficient to ensure that every paired step (in the abstraction and the implementation, respectively) is either permitted or prohibited by the security policy. We apply our approach to verify two non-trivial case studies against a collection of security policies. Our proofs are fully mechanized in Isabelle/HOL, during which we identified that two covert channels previously reported in the ARINC 653 single-core standard also exist in the ARINC 653 multicore standard. We subsequently proved the correctness of the revised mechanism, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.
