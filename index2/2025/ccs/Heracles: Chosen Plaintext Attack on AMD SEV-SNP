Confidential computing needs hardware support that stops privileged software from learning secrets of a guest virtual machine. AMD offers such hardware support in the form of SEV-SNP to create confidential virtual machines, such that hardware encrypts all the VM memory. Specifically, SEV-SNP uses the XEX encryption mode with address-dependent tweak values such that the same plaintext at different memory addresses yields different ciphertexts. Heracles makes three observations: the hypervisor can move encrypted guest pages in DRAM using three APIs; when it moves the guest pages to a new DRAM address, pages are re-encrypted; re-encryption is deterministic. By re-encrypting guest data at precisely chosen DRAM locations, we can create a chosen plaintext oracle allowing us to leak guest memory at block granularity. We build four primitives that leverage the victim’s access patterns to amplify Heracles’s impact to not only leak data at block but at byte granularity. In our case studies, we leak kernel memory, crypto keys, and user passwords, as well as demonstrate web session hijacking.
