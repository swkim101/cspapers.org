Encrypted matrix-vector multiplication is a fundamental component of a variety of applications that involve data privacy concerns. Current algorithms utilizing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) generally use batching to enhance computational efficiency while neglecting the sparsity of the matrices, a characteristic that exists naturally in many practical situations. Alternatively, porting plain-text algorithms that skip zero elements to address sparsity may fail to utilize batching and introduce additional privacy concerns. We propose Lodia, an efficient outsourced sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) algorithm for batched FHE schemes without sacrificing privacy. It only requires Θ (( 𝑛 + 𝑚 ) log ( 𝑛 + 𝑚 )/ 𝑠 ) FHE operations, where 𝑛 is thenumber ofrows/columns, 𝑚 is thenumber of non-zero elements of the matrix, and 𝑠 is the batch size of the FHE scheme. This is optimal for 𝑚 = Ω ( 𝑛 ) and 𝑚 = 𝑂 ( 𝑛 𝜌 ) for some 𝜌 < 2 (i.e., 𝑎𝑛 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑏𝑛 𝜌 asymptotically), covering most practical cases. To our knowledge, no method has been published with better than Θ ( 𝑛 2 / 𝑠 ) FHE operations, suitable for any sparse matrix, and without privacy concerns.
