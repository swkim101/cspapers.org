Extended Reality (XR) headsets are increasingly serving as repositories for substantial volumes of sensitive data and gateways to web applications. This transition highlights the need for convenient and secure user authentication solutions. Traditional password/PIN-based schemes are ill-suited to the XR’s gesture-and voice-based interfaces and are prone to shoulder-surfing attacks. Some recent XR systems incorporate two-factor authentication, but it requires additional operations on a second device (e.g., a smartphone or wearable). In this work, we introduce the first effortless and in-built XR user authentication system by leveraging the harmonics of vibrations excited by users’ vital signs. The system is transparent to users (no efforts during enrollment and authentication) and requires no additional hardware. The key idea is that vital signs (i.e., breathing and heart beating) naturally generate low-frequency mechanical vibrations, causing human skull to vibrate and produces harmonic signals. When the harmonics pass the human head, they carry rich biometrics associated with the wearer’s skull structure and soft tissues, which can be captured by the XR motion sensors. Instead of directly utilizing the vibrations, we extract more reliable biometrics from the ratios among different harmonic frequencies, which capture wearers’ unique head and facial attenuation properties and are non-volatile when the periodicity and amplitude of vital signs fluctuate. We further design an adaptive filter to mitigate the body motion distortions in common XR interactions. By adopting advanced deep learning models with the attention mechanism, our system realizes effective and robust authentication across XR
