In Pakistan, where dating apps are subject to censorship, Facebook matrimony groups -- also referred to as marriage groups -- serve as alternative virtual spaces for members to search for potential life partners. To participate in these groups, members often share sensitive personal information such as photos, addresses, and phone numbers, which exposes them to risks such as fraud, blackmail, and identity theft. To better protect users of Facebook matrimony groups, we need to understand aspects related to user safety, such as how users perceive risks, what influences their trust in sharing personal information, and how they navigate security and privacy concerns when seeking potential partners online. In this study, through 23 semi-structured interviews, we explore how Pakistani users of Facebook matrimony groups perceive and navigate risks of sharing personal information, and how cultural norms and expectations influence their behavior in these groups. We find elevated privacy concerns among participants, leading them to share limited personal information and creating mistrust among potential partners. Many also expressed concerns about the authenticity of profiles and major security risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and social judgment. Our work highlights the challenges of safely navigating Facebook matrimony groups in Pakistan and offers recommendations for such as implementing stronger identity verification by group admins, enforcing stricter cybersecurity laws, clear platform guidelines to ensure accountability, and technical feature enhancements -- including restricting screenshots, picture downloads, and implementing anonymous chats -- to protect user data and build trust.
