The increasing prevalence of Python has spurred interest in decom-piling Python PYC bytecode. This work presents the first large-scale study on human-assisted Python decompilation in the wild , leveraging extensive data from pylingual.io, spanning 181,646 PYC binaries, 9,003 user-submitted patches, and 393 accuracy-verified patches. We investigate how reverse engineers respond to inaccurate de-compilation and identify factors influencing their efforts to achieve accurate decompilation. We complement this unprecedented observational data with a controlled user study that isolates the technical difficulty of patching imperfect Python decompilations. By contrasting real-world patching behavior with that of the controlled setting, we discover that reversers’ decision to repair a decompilation result is more strongly driven by the semantic content of the program ( e.g., malware binaries or malicious tools) than by the technical difficulty of the patch. That is, a reverser’s motivation is more important than their expertise. Our study reveals common patterns observed in the patching process, including how users approached the patching task, the types of errors they encountered, and the strategies they employed to resolve them. We also examine the strengths and limitations of assistive tools in the pursuit of perfect decompilation. Our findings offer unique insights into the practical dynamics of human-decompiler interaction, providing actionable recommendations for integrating human intelligence into the decompilation workflow and demonstrating the research potential of reliable decompilation accuracy verification.
