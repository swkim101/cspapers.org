Finetuning-free personalized image generation can synthesize customized images without test-time finetuning, attracting wide research interest owing to its high efficiency. Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single training stage with a simple image reconstruction task, and they typically generate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during test-time. To mitigate this problem, inspired by the recent DPO (i.e., direct preference optimization) technique, this work proposes an additional training stage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However, traditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two samples, which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the generated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in some local image patches. To tackle this problem, this work proposes PatchDPO that estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and accordingly trains the model. To this end, PatchDPO first leverages the pre-trained vision model with a proposed self-supervised training method to estimate the patch quality. Next, PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach to train the model with the estimated patch quality, which rewards the image patches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality. Experiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the performance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object personalized image generation.
