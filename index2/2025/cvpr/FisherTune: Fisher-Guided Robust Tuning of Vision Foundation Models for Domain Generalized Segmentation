Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel in generalization due to large-scale pretraining, but fine-tuning them for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) while maintaining this ability remains a challenge. Existing approaches either selectively fine-tune parameters or freeze the VFMs and update only the adapters, both of which may underutilize the VFMsâ€™ full potential in DGSS tasks. We observe that domain-sensitive parameters in VFMs, arising from task and distribution differences, can hinder generalization. To address this, we propose FisherTune, a robust fine-tuning method guided by the Domain-Related Fisher Information Matrix (DR-FIM). DR-FIM measures parameter sensitivity across tasks and domains, enabling selective updates that preserve generalization and enhance DGSS adaptability. To stabilize DR-FIM estimation, FisherTune incorporates variational inference, treating parameters as Gaussian-Distributed variables and leveraging pre-trained priors. Extensive experiments show that Fisher-Tune achieves superior cross-domain segmentation while maintaining generalization, outperforming both selective-parameter and adapter-based methods.
