We introduce Sketchtopia, a large-scale dataset and AI framework designed to explore goal-driven, multimodal communication through asynchronous interactions in a Pictionary-inspired setup. Sketchtopia captures natural human interactions, including freehand sketches, open-ended guesses, and iconic feedback gestures, showcasing the complex dynamics of cooperative communication under constraints. It features over 20K gameplay sessions from 916 players, capturing 263K sketches, 10K erases, 56K guesses and 19.4K iconic feedbacks. We introduce multimodal foundational agents with capabilities for generative sketching, guess generation and asynchronous communication. Our dataset also includes 800 human-agent sessions for benchmarking the agents. We introduce novel metrics to char-acterize collaborative success, responsiveness to feedback and inter-agent asynchronous communication. Sketchtopia pushes the boundaries of multimodal AI, establishing a new benchmark for studying asynchronous, goal-oriented interactions between humans and AI agents.
