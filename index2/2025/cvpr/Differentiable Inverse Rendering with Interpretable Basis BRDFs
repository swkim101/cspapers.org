Inverse rendering seeks to reconstruct both geometry and spatially varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs) from captured images. To address the inherent ill-posedness of inverse rendering, basis BRDF representations are commonly used, modeling SVBRDFs as spatially varying blends of a set of basis BRDFs. However, existing methods often yield basis BRDFs that lack intuitive separation and have limited scalability to scenes of varying complexity. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable inverse rendering method that produces interpretable basis BRDFs. Our approach models a scene using 2D Gaussians, where the reflectance of each Gaussian is defined by a weighted blend of basis BRDFs. We efficiently render an image from the 2D Gaussians and basis BRDFs using differentiable rasterization and impose a specular-weighted rendering loss with the input flash photography images. During this analysis-by-synthesis optimization process of differentiable inverse rendering, we dynamically adjust the number of basis BRDFs to fit the target scene while encouraging sparsity in the basis weights. This ensures that the reflectance of each Gaussian is represented by only a few basis BRDFs. This approach enables the reconstruction of accurate geometry and interpretable basis BRDFs that are spatially separated. Consequently, the resulting scene representation, comprising basis BRDFs and 2D Gaussians, supports physically-based novel-view relighting and intuitive scene editing.
