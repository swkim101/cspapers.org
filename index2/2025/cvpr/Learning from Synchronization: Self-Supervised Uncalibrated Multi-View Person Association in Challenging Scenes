Multi-view person association is a fundamental step towards multi-view analysis of human activities. Although the person re-identification features have been proven effective, they become unreliable in challenging scenes where persons share similar appearances. Therefore, cross-view geometric constraints are required for a more robust association. However, most existing approaches are either fully-supervised using ground-truth identity labels or require calibrated camera parameters that are hard to obtain. In this work, we investigate the potential of learning from synchronization, and propose a self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view person association approach, Self-MVA, without using any annotations. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised learning framework, consisting of an encoder-decoder model and a self-supervised pretext task, cross-view image synchronization, which aims to distinguish whether two images from different views are captured at the same time. The model encodes each personâ€™s unified geometric and appearance features, and we train it by utilizing synchronization labels for supervision after applying Hungarian matching to bridge the gap between instance-wise and image-wise distances. To further reduce the solution space, we propose two types of self-supervised linear constraints: multi-view re-projection and pairwise edge association. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmark datasets (WILDTRACK, MVOR, and SOLDIERS) show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing unsupervised and fully-supervised approaches.
