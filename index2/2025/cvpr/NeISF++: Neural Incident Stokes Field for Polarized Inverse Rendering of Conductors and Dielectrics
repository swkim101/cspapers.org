Recent inverse rendering methods have improved shape, material, and illumination reconstruction using polarization cues. However, they only support dielectrics, ignoring conductors, which are common in everyday life. Since conductors and dielectrics have different reflection properties, using previous dielectrics-based methods will lead to obvious errors. In addition, conductors are glossy, which may cause strong specular reflection and is hard to reconstruct. To solve the above issues, we propose NeISF++, an inverse rendering pipeline that supports conductors and dielectrics. The key ingredient for our proposal is a general pBRDF that describes both conductors and dielectrics. As for the strong specular reflection problem, we propose a novel geometry initialization method using DoLP images. This physical cue is invariant to intensities and thus robust to strong specular reflections. Experimental results on our synthetic and real datasets show that our method surpasses the existing polarized inverse rendering methods for geometry and material decomposition as well as downstream tasks like relighting.
