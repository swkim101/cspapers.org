We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study of the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across various modalities.
