With the rapid evolution of 3D generation algorithms, the cost of producing 3D humanoid character models has plummeted, yet the field is impeded by the lack of a comprehensive dataset for automatic riggingâ€”a pivotal step in character animation. Addressing this gap, we present HumanRig, the first large-scale dataset specifically designed for 3D humanoid character rigging, encompassing 11,434 meticulously curated T-posed meshes adhered to a uniform skeleton topology. Capitalizing on this dataset, we introduce an innovative, data-driven automatic rigging framework, which overcomes the limitations of GNNbased methods in handling complex AI-generated meshes. Our approach integrates a Prior-Guided Skeleton Estimator (PGSE) module, which uses 2D skeleton joints to provide a preliminary 3D skeleton, and a Mesh-Skeleton Mutual Attention Network (MSMAN) that fuses skeleton features with 3D mesh features extracted by a U-shaped point transformer. This enables a coarse-to-fine 3D skeleton joint regression and a robust skinning estimation, surpassing previous methods in quality and versatility. This work not only remedies the dataset deficiency in rigging research but also propels the animation industry towards more efficient and automated character rigging pipelines.
