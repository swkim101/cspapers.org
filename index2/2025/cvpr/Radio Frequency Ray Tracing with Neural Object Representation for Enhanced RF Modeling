Radio frequency (RF) propagation modeling poses unique electromagnetic simulation challenges. While recent neural representations have shown success in visible spectrum rendering, the fundamentally different scales and physics of RF signals require novel modeling paradigms. In this paper, we introduce RFScape, a novel framework that bridges the gap between neural scene representation and RF propagation modeling. Our key insight is that complex RF-object interactions can be captured through object-centric neural representations while preserving the composability of traditional ray tracing. Unlike previous approaches that either rely on crude geometric approximations or require dense spatial sampling of entire scenes, RFScape learns perobject electromagnetic properties and enables flexible scene composition. Through extensive evaluation on real-world RF testbeds, we demonstrate that our approach achieves 13 dB improvement over conventional ray tracing and 5 dB over state-of-the-art neural baselines in modeling accuracy, while requiring only sparse training samples.
