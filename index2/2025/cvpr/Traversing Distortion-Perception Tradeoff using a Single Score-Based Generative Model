The distortion-perception (DP) tradeoff reveals a fundamental conflict between distortion metrics (e.g., MSE and PSNR) and perceptual quality. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on evaluating denoising algorithms within the DP framework. However, existing algorithms either prioritize perceptual quality by sacrificing acceptable distortion, or focus on minimizing MSE for faithful restoration. When the goal shifts or noisy measurements vary, adapting to different points on the DP plane needs retraining or even re-designing the model. Inspired by recent advances in solving inverse problems using score-based generative models, we explore the potential of flexibly and optimally traversing DP tradeoffs using a single pre-trained score-based model. Specifically, we introduce a variance-scaled reverse diffusion process and theoretically characterize the marginal distribution. We then prove that the proposed sample process is an optimal solution to the DP tradeoff for conditional Gaussian distribution. Experimental results on two-dimensional and image datasets illustrate that a single score network can effectively and flexibly traverse the DP tradeoff for general denoising problems.
