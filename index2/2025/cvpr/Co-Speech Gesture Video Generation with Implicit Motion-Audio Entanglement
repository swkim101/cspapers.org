Co-speech gestures are essential to non-verbal communication, enhancing both the naturalness and effectiveness of human interaction. Although recent methods have made progress in generating co-speech gesture videos, many rely on strong visual controls, such as pose images or TPS key-point movements, which often lead to artifacts like blurry hands and distorted fingers. In response to these challenges, we present the Implicit Motion-Audio Entanglement (IMAE) method for co-speech gesture video generation. IMAE strengthens audio control by entangling implicit motion parameters, including pose and expression, with audio inputs. Our method utilizes a two-branch framework that combines an audio-to-motion generation branch with a video diffusion branch, enabling realistic gesture generation without requiring additional inputs during inference. To improve training efficiency, we propose a two-stage slow-fast training strategy that balances memory constraints while facilitating the learning of meaningful gestures from long frame sequences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. Project Page.
