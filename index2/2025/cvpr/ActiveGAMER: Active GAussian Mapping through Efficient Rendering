We introduce ActiveGAMER, an active mapping system that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve high-quality scene mapping and efficient exploration. Unlike recent NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and limit mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS to enable effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMERâ€™s effectiveness in active mapping tasks.
