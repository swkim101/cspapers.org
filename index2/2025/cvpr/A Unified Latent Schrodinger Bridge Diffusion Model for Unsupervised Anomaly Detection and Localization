Anomaly detection and localization remain pivotal challenges in computer vision, with applications ranging from industrial inspection to medical diagnostics. While current supervised methods offer high precision, they are often impractical due to the scarcity of annotated data and the infrequent occurrence of anomalies. Recent advancements in unsupervised approaches, particularly reconstruction-based methods, have addressed these issues by training models exclusively on normal data, enabling them to identify anomalies during inference. However, these methods frequently rely on auxiliary networks or specialized adaptations, which can limit their robustness and practicality. This work introduces the Latent Anomaly Schrödinger Bridge (LASB), a unified unsupervised anomaly detection model that operates entirely in the latent space without requiring additional networks or custom modifications. LASB transforms anomaly images into normal images by preserving structural integrity across varying anomaly classes, lighting, and pose conditions, making it highly robust and versatile. Unlike previous methods, LASB does not focus solely on reconstructing anomaly features, but emphasizes anomaly transformation, achieving smooth anomaly-to-normal image conversions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, excelling in detection and localization tasks.
