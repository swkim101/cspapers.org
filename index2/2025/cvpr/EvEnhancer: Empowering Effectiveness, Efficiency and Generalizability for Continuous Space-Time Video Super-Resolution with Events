Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) endeavors to upscale videos simultaneously at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, which has recently garnered increasing interest. However, prevailing methods struggle to yield satisfactory videos at out-of-distribution spatial and temporal scales. On the other hand, event streams characterized by high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, exhibit compelling promise in vision tasks. This paper presents EvEnhancer, an innovative approach that marries the unique advantages of event streams to elevate effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability for C-STVSR. Our approach hinges on two pivotal components: 1) Event-adapted synthesis capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and events to discern and learn long-term motion trajectories, enabling the adaptive interpolation and fusion of informative spatiotemporal features; 2) Local implicit video transformer integrates local implicit video neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous video representations utilized to generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions and frame rates. Experiments show that EvEnhancer achieves superiority on synthetic and real-world datasets and preferable generalizability on out-of-distribution scales against state-of-the-art methods.
