In this paper, we introduce SearchDet, a training-free long-tail object detection framework that significantly enhances open-vocabulary object detection performance. SearchDet retrieves a set of positive and negative images of an object to ground, embeds these images, and computes an input imageâ€“weighted query which is used to detect the desired concept in the image. Our proposed method is simple and training-free, yet achieves over 16.81% mAP improvement on ODinW and 59.85% mAP improvement on LVIS compared to state-of-the-art models such as GroundingDINO. We further show that our approach of basing object detection on a set of Web-retrieved exemplars is stable with respect to variations in the exemplars, suggesting a path towards eliminating costly data annotation and training procedures.1
