Adversarial attacks exploit the vulnerability of deep models against adversarial samples. Existing point cloud attackers are tailored to specific models, iteratively optimizing perturbations based on gradients in either a white-box or black-box setting. Despite their promising attack performance, they often struggle to produce transferable adversarial samples due to overfitting to the specific parameters of surrogate models. To overcome this issue, we shift our focus to the data distribution itself and introduce a novel approach named NoPain, which employs optimal transport (OT) to identify the inherent singular boundaries of the data manifold for cross-network point cloud attacks. Specifically, we first calculate the OT mapping from noise to the target feature space, then identify singular boundaries by locating non-differentiable positions. Finally, we sample along singular boundaries to generate adversarial point clouds. Once the singular boundaries are determined, NoPain can efficiently produce adversarial samples without the need of iterative updates or guidance from the surrogate classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of both transferability and efficiency, while also maintaining notable advantages even against defense strategies.
