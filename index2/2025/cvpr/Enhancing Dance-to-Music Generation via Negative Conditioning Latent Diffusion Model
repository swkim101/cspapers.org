Conditional diffusion models have gained increasing attention since their impressive results for cross-modal synthesis, where the strong alignment between conditioning input and generated output can be achieved by training a time-conditioned U-Net augmented with cross-attention mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the problem of generating music synchronized with rhythmic visual cues of the given dance video. Considering that bi-directional guidance is more beneficial for training a diffusion model, we propose to enhance the quality of generated music and its synchronization with dance videos by adopting both positive rhythmic information and negative ones (PN-Diffusion) as conditions, where a dual diffusion and reverse processes is devised. Specifically, to train a sequential multi-modal U-Net structure, PN-Diffusion consists of a noise prediction objective for positive conditioning and an additional noise prediction objective for negative conditioning. To accurately define and select both positive and negative conditioning, we ingeniously utilize temporal correlations in dance videos, capturing positive and negative rhythmic cues by playing them forward and backward, respectively. Through subjective and objective evaluations of input-output correspondence in terms of dance-music beat alignment and the quality of generated music, experimental results on the AIST++ and TikTok dance video datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA dance-to-music generation models.
