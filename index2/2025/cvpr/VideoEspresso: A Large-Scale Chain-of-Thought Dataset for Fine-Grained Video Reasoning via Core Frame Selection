The advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly improved multimodal understanding, yet challenges remain in video reasoning tasks due to the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale datasets. Existing video question-answering (VideoQA) datasets often rely on costly manual annotations with insufficient granularity or automatic construction methods with redundant frame-by-frame analysis, limiting their scalability and effectiveness for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoEspresso, a novel dataset that features VideoQA pairs preserving essential spatial details and temporal coherence, along with multimodal annotations of intermediate reasoning steps. Our construction pipeline employs a semantic-aware method to reduce redundancy, followed by generating QA pairs using GPT-4o. We further develop video Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations to enrich reasoning processes, guiding GPT-4o in extracting logical relationships from QA pairs and video content. To exploit the potential of high-quality VideoQA pairs, we propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework, featuring a Frame Selector and a two-stage instruction fine-tuned reasoning LVLM. This framework adaptively selects core frames and performs CoT reasoning using multimodal evidence. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark with 14 tasks against 9 popular LVLMs, our method outperforms existing baselines on most tasks, demonstrating superior video reasoning capabilities.
