How can we troubleshoot a deep visual model, i.e. understand why it makes certain mistakes and further take action to correct its behavior? We design a ${\mathbf{M}}$ odel ${\mathbf{D}}$ iagnosis and ${\mathbf{C}}$ orrection system (MDC), an automated framework that analyzes the pattern of errors, proposes candidate causes of attributes, conducts hypothesis testing via attribute editing, and ultimately generates counterfactual training samples to improve the performance of the model. Unlike previous methods, in addition to the linguistic attributes, our method also incorporates the analysis for implicit causal attributes, those cannot to be accurately described by natural language. To achieve this, we propose an image editing module capable of leveraging both implicit and linguistic attributes to generate counterfactual images depicting error patterns and further experimentally validate causality relationships. Lastly, we enrich the training set with synthetic samples depicting verified causal attributes and retrain the model, further boosting accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on both generalized and specialized domains demonstrate the superiority of MDC in model diagnosis and correction. Specifically, we achieve an average relative improvement of 62.01% in HTER for face security application over state-of-the-art methods.
