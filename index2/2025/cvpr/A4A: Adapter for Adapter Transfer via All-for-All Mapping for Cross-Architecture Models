Large-scale text-to-image models evolve rapidly in size and architecture. The existing adapters struggle to keep pace with these models, requiring extensive retraining. This paper proposes a novel adapter transfer framework, A4A (Adapter for Adapter), which uses an all-for-all mapping approach to seamlessly transfer attention-based adapters across different model architectures (e.g., U-Net to transformer). The framework consists of Coupling Space Projection and Upgraded Space Mapping. During Coupling Space Projection, all attention features of the pretrained adapter are aggregated to fully capture the coupling relationship before being projected into a unified space. The unified space maintains coupling features in a consistent dimension, effectively and efficiently addressing feature scale discrepancies arising from the base model’s architecture. In the Upgraded Space Mapping Module, randomly initialized learnable features are introduced to connect the unified and upgraded spaces by integrating reference features via the attention mechanism. The learned features are adaptively injected into the upgrade model through the Alignment module, which bridges the discrepancies between the models using the all-for-all mapping. Experimental results on personalized image generation tasks demonstrate that A4A outperforms previous methods in transferring adapters while being the first to achieve adapter transfer across model architectures.
