Diffusion models, especially denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), are prevalent tools in generative AI, making their intellectual property (IP) protection increasingly important. Most existing IP protection methods for DDPMs are invasive, e.g., model watermarking, which alter model parameters and raise concerns about performance degradation, also with requirement for extra computational resources for retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the first non-invasive fingerprinting scheme for DDPMs, requiring no parameter changes or fine-tuning, and keeping generation quality intact. We introduce a discriminative and robust fingerprint latent space based on the well-designed "crossing route" of noisy samples that span the performance border-zone of DDPMs, with only black-box access required for the diffusion denoiser in ownership verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fingerprinting approach enjoys both robustness against the often-seen attacks and distinctiveness on various DDPMs, providing an alternative for protecting DDPMs’ IP rights without compromising their performance or integrity1.
