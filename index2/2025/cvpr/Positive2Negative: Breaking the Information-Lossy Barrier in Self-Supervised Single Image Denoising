Image denoising enhances image quality, serving as a foundational technique across various computational photography applications. The obstacle to clean image acquisition in real scenarios necessitates the development of self-supervised image denoising methods only depending on noisy images, especially a single noisy image. Existing self-supervised image denoising paradigms (Noise2Noise and Noise2Void) rely heavily on information-lossy operations, such as downsampling and masking, culminating in low-quality denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised single image denoising paradigm, Positive2Negative, to break the information-lossy barrier. Our paradigm involves two key steps: Renoised Data Construction (RDC) and Denoised Consistency Supervision (DCS). RDC renoises the predicted denoised image by the predicted noise to construct multiple noisy images, preserving all the information of the original image. DCS ensures consistency across the multiple denoised images, supervising the network to learn robust denoising. Our Positive2Negative paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised single image denoising with significant speed improvements.
