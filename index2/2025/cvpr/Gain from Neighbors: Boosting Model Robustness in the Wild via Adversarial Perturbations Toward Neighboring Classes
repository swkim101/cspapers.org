Recent approaches, such as data augmentation, adversarial training, and transfer learning, have shown potential in addressing the issue of performance degradation caused by distributional shifts. However, they typically demand careful design in terms of data or models and lack awareness of the impact of distributional shifts. In this paper, we observe that classification errors arising from distribution shifts tend to cluster near the true values, suggesting that misclassifications commonly occur in semantically similar, neighboring categories. Furthermore, robust advanced vision foundation models maintain larger inter-class distances while preserving semantic consistency, making them less vulnerable to such shifts. Building on these findings, we propose a new method called GFN (Gain From Neighbors), which uses gradient priors from neighboring classes to perturb input images and incorporates an inter-class distance-weighted loss to improve class separation. This approach encourages the model to learn more resilient features from data prone to errors, enhancing its robustness against shifts in diverse settings. In extensive experiments across various model architectures and benchmark datasets, GFN consistently demonstrated superior performance. For instance, compared to the current state-of-the-art TAPADL method, our approach achieved a higher corruption robustness of 41.4% on ImageNet-C (+2.3%), without requiring additional parameters and using only minimal data.
