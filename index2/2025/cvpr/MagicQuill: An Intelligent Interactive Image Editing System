As a highly practical application, image editing encounters a variety of user demands and thus prioritizes excellent ease of use. In this paper, we unveil MagicQuill, an integrated image editing system designed to support users in swiftly actualizing their creativity. Our system starts with a streamlined yet functionally robust interface, enabling users to articulate their ideas (e.g., inserting elements, erasing objects, altering color, etc.) with just a few strokes. These interactions are then monitored by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to anticipate user intentions in real time, bypassing the need for prompt entry. Finally, we apply the powerful diffusion prior, enhanced by a carefully learned two-branch plug-in module, to process the editing request with precise control.
