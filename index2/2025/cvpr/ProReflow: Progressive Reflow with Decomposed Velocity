Diffusion models have achieved significant progress in both image and video generation while still suffering from huge computation costs. As an effective solution, rectified flow aims to rectify the diffusion process of diffusion models into a straight line for few-step and even one-step generation. However, in this paper, we suggest that the original training pipeline of reflow is not optimal and introduce two techniques to improve it. Firstly, we introduce progressive reflow, which progressively reflows the diffusion models in local timesteps until the whole diffusion progresses, reducing the difficulty of flow matching. Second, we introduce aligned v-prediction, which highlights the importance of direction matching in flow matching over magnitude matching. Experimental results on SDv1.5 and SDXL demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, for example, conducting on SDv1.5 achieves an FID of 10.70 on MSCOCO2014 validation set with only 4 sampling steps, close to our teacher model (32 DDIM steps, FID = 10.05). Our codes will be released at Github.
