Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been widely applied in various computer vision and vision-language tasks. To gain insights into their robustness in practical scenarios, transferable adversarial examples on ViTs have been extensively studied. A typical approach to improving adversarial transferability is by refining the surrogate model. However, existing work on ViTs has restricted their surrogate refinement to backward propagation. In this work, we instead focus on Forward Propagation Refinement (FPR) and specifically refine two key modules of ViTs: attention maps and token embeddings. For attention maps, we propose Attention Map Diversification (AMD), which diversifies certain attention maps and also implicitly imposes beneficial gradient vanishing during backward propagation. For token embeddings, we propose Momentum Token Embedding (MTE), which accumulates historical token embeddings to stabilize the forward updates in both the Attention and MLP blocks. We conduct extensive experiments with adversarial examples transferred from ViTs to various CNNs and ViTs, demonstrating that our FPR outperforms the current best (backward) surrogate refinement by up to 7.0% on average. We also validate its superiority against popular defenses and its compatibility with other transfer methods. Codes and appendix are available at https://github.com/RYC-98/FPR.
