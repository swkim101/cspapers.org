A dexterous hand capable of grasping any object is essential for the development of general-purpose embodied intelligent robots. However, due to the high degree of freedom in dexterous hands and the vast diversity of objects, generating high-quality, usable grasping poses in a robust manner is a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DexGrasp Anything, a method that effectively integrates physical constraints into both the training and sampling phases of a diffusion-based generative model, achieving state-of-the-art performance across nearly all open datasets. Additionally, we present a new dexterous grasping dataset containing over 3.4 million diverse grasping poses for more than 15k different objects, demonstrating its potential to advance universal dexterous grasping.
