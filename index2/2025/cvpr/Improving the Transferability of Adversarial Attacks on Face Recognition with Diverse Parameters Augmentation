Face Recognition (FR) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that subtly manipulate benign face images, underscoring the urgent need to improve the transferability of adversarial attacks in order to expose the blind spots of these systems. Existing adversarial attack methods often overlook the potential benefits of augmenting the surrogate model with diverse initializations, which limits the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. To address this gap, we propose a novel method called Diverse Parameters Augmentation (DPA) attack method, which enhances surrogate models by incorporating diverse parameter initializations, resulting in a broader and more diverse set of surrogate models. Specifically, DPA consists of two key stages: Diverse Parameters Optimization (DPO) and Hard Model Aggregation (HMA). In the DPO stage, we initialize the parameters of the surrogate model using both pre-trained and random parameters. Subsequently, we save the models in the intermediate training process to obtain a diverse set of surrogate models. During the HMA stage, we enhance the feature maps of the diversified surrogate models by incorporating beneficial perturbations, thereby further improving the transferability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed attack method can effectively enhance the transferability of the crafted adversarial face examples.
