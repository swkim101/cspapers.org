Maintaining stable tracking of objects in domain shift scenarios is crucial for RGB-T tracking, prompting us to explore the use of unlabeled test sample information for effective online model adaptation. However, current Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods in RGB-T tracking dramatically change the modelâ€™s internal parameters during long-term adaptation. At the same time, the gradient computations involved in the optimization process impose a significant computational burden. To address these challenges, we propose a Parameter Update-Recovery Adaptation (PURA) framework based on parameter decomposition. Firstly, our fast parameter update strategy adjusts model parameters using statistical information from test samples without requiring gradient calculations, ensuring consistency between the model and test data distribution. Secondly, our parameter decomposition recovery employs orthogonal decomposition to identify the principal update direction and recover parameters in this direction, aiding in the retention of critical knowledge. Finally, we leverage the information obtained from decomposition to provide feedback on the momentum during the update phase, ensuring a stable updating process. Experimental results demonstrate that PURA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, validating its effectiveness. The project page is at https://melantech.github.io/PURA.
