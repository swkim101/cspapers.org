Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to adapt to new classes with limited samples, presenting greater difficulties than traditional class-incremental learning. While existing approaches rely heavily on visual models and require additional training during base or incremental phases, we propose a training-free framework that leverages pre-trained visual-language models like CLIP. At the core of our approach is a novel Bi-level Modality Calibration (BiMC) strategy. Our framework initially performs intra-modal calibration, combining LLM-generated fine-grained category descriptions with visual prototypes from the base session to achieve precise classifier estimation. This is further complemented by inter-modal calibration that fuses pre-trained linguistic knowledge with task-specific visual priors to mitigate modality-specific biases. To enhance prediction robustness, we introduce additional metrics and strategies that maximize the utilization of limited data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/yychen016/BiMC.
