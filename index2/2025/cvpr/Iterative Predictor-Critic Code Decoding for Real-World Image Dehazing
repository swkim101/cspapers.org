We propose a novel Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding framework for real-world image dehazing, abbreviated as IPC-Dehaze, which leverages the high-quality codebook prior encapsulated in a pre-trained VQGAN. Apart from previous codebook-based methods that rely on oneshot decoding, our method utilizes high-quality codes obtained in the previous iteration to guide the prediction of the Code-Predictor in the subsequent iteration, improving code prediction accuracy and ensuring stable dehazing performance. Our idea stems from the observations that 1) the degradation of hazy images varies with haze density and scene depth, and 2) clear regions play crucial cues in restoring dense haze regions. However, it is nontrivial to progressively refine the obtained codes in subsequent iterations, owing to the difficulty in determining which codes should be retained or replaced at each iteration. Another key insight of our study is to propose CodeCritic to capture interrelations among codes. The CodeCritic is used to evaluate code correlations and then resample a set of codes with the highest mask scores, i.e., a higher score indicates that the code is more likely to be rejected, which helps retain more accurate codes and predict difficult ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in real-world dehazing. Our project page can be found at https://github.com/Jiayi-Fu/IPC-Dehaze.
