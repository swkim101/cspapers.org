Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet they face limitations in real-world applications requiring complex reasoning over a large number of images. Existing benchmarks for multi-image question-answering are limited in scope, each question is paired with only up to 30 images, which does not fully capture the demands of large-scale retrieval tasks encountered in the real-world usages. To reduce these gaps, we introduce two document haystack benchmarks, dubbed DocHaystack and InfoHaystack, designed to evaluate LMM performance on large-scale visual document retrieval and understanding. Additionally, we propose V-RAG, a novel, vision-centric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a suite of multimodal vision encoders, each optimized for specific strengths, and a dedicated question-document relevance module. V-RAG sets a new standard, with a 9% and 11% improvement in Recall@1 on the challenging DocHaystack-1000 and InfoHaystack-1000 benchmarks, respectively, compared to the previous best baseline models. Additionally, integrating V-RAG with LMMs enables them to efficiently operate across thousands of images, yielding significant improvements on our DocHaystack and InfoHaystack benchmarks.
