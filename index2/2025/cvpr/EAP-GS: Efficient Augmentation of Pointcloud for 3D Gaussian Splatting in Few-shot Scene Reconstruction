3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive performance in 3D scene reconstruction. However, it suffers from severe degradation when the number of training views is limited, resulting in blur and floaters. Many works have been devoted to standardize the optimization process of 3DGS through regularization techniques. However, we identify that inadequate initialization is a critical issue overlooked by current studies. To address this, we propose EAP-GS, a method to enhance initialization for fast, accurate, and stable few-shot scene reconstruction. Specifically, we introduce an Attentional Pointcloud Augmentation (APA) technique, which retains two-view tracks as an option for pointcloud generation. Additionally, the scene complexity is used to determine the required density distribution, thereby constructing a better pointcloud. We implemented APA by extending Structure-From-Motion (SFM) to focus on pointcloud generation in regions with complex structure but sparse pointcloud distribution, which significantly increases the number of valuable points and effectively harmonizes the density distribution. A better pointcloud leads to more accurate scene geometry and mitigates local overfitting during reconstruction stage. Furthermore, our APA can be framed as a modular augmentation to existing methods with minimal overhead. Experimental results from various indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate that the proposed EAP-GS achieves outstanding scene reconstruction performance and surpasses state-of-the-art methods.
