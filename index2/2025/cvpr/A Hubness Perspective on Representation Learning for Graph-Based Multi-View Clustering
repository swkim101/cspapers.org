Recent graph-based multi-view clustering (GMVC) methods typically encode view features into high-dimensional spaces and construct graphs based on distance similarity. However, the high dimensionality of the embeddings often leads to the hubness problem, where a few points repeatedly appear in the nearest neighbor lists of other points. We show that this negatively impacts the extracted graph structures and message passing, thus degrading clustering performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to highlight the detrimental effect of hubness in GMVC methods and introduce the hubREP (hub-aware Representation Embedding and Pairing) framework. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective encoder that reduces hubness while preserving neighborhood topology within each view. Additionally, we propose a hub-aware pairing module to maintain structure consistency across views, efficiently enhancing the view-specific representations. The proposed hubREP is lightweight compared to the conventional autoencoders used in state-of-the-art GMVC methods and can be integrated into existing GMVC methods that mostly focus on novel fusion mechanisms, further boosting their performance. Comprehensive experiments performed on eight benchmarks confirm the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/zmxu196/hubREP.
