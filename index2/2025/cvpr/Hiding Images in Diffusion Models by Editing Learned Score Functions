Hiding data using neural networks (i.e., neural steganography) has achieved remarkable success across both discriminative classifiers and generative adversarial networks. However, the potential of data hiding in diffusion models remains relatively unexplored. Current methods exhibit limitations in achieving high extraction accuracy, model fidelity, and hiding efficiency due primarily to the entanglement of the hiding and extraction processes with multiple denoising diffusion steps. To address these, we describe a simple yet effective approach that embeds images at specific timesteps in the reverse diffusion process by editing the learned score functions. Additionally, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines gradient-based parameter selection with low-rank adaptation to enhance model fidelity and hiding efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method extracts high-quality images at human-indistinguishable levels, replicates the original model behaviors at both sample and population levels, and embeds images orders of magnitude faster than prior methods. Besides, our method naturally supports multi-recipient scenarios through independent extraction channels.
