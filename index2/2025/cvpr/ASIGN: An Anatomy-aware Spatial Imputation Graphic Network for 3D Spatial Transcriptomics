Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables medical computer vision scientists to automatically interpret the molecular profiles underlying morphological features. Currently, however, most deep learning-based ST analyses are limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections, which can introduce diagnostic errors due to the heterogeneity of pathological tissues across 3D sections. Expanding ST to three-dimensional (3D) volumes is challenging due to the prohibitive costs; a 2D ST acquisition already costs over 50 times more than whole slide imaging (WSI), and a full 3D volume with 10 sections can be an order of magnitude more expensive. To reduce costs, scientists have attempted to predict ST data directly from WSI without performing actual ST acquisition. However, these methods typically yield unsatisfying results. To address this, we introduce a novel problem setting: 3D ST imputation using 3D WSI histology sections combined with a single 2D ST slide. To do so, we present the Anatomy-aware Spatial Imputation Graph Network (ASIGN) for more precise, yet affordable, 3D ST modeling. The ASIGN architecture extends existing 2D spatial relationships into 3D by leveraging cross-layer overlap and similarity-based expansion. Moreover, a multi-level spatial attention graph network integrates features comprehensively across different data sources. We evaluated ASIGN on three public spatial transcriptomics datasets, with experimental results demonstrating that ASIGN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D scenarios.
