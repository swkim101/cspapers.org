Point cloud upsampling can improve the quality of the initial point cloud, significantly enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Existing methods mostly focus on generating the geometric details of point clouds, neglecting noise suppression. To address this, we propose a novel network based on a conditional diffusion model, incorporating the Adaptive Noise Suppression (ANS) module, which we refer to as PDANS. The ANS module assigns weights to each point and determines the removal strategy based on these weights, reducing the impact of noisy points on the sampling process. The module first selects the neighborhood set for each point in the point cloud and performs a weighted sum between the point and its neighbors. It then adjusts the removal points based on the weighted sum, effectively mitigating the bias caused by outliers. We introduce the TreeTrans (TT) module to capture more correlated feature information. This module learns the interaction between high-level and low-level features, resulting in a more comprehensive and refined feature representation. Our results on several widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that PDANS exhibits exceptional robustness in noisy point cloud processing and outperforms current state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods in terms of performance.
