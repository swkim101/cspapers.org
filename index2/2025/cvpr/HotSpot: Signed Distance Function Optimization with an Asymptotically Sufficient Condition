We propose a method, HOTSPOT, for optimizing neural signed distance functions. Existing losses, such as the eikonal loss, act as necessary but insufficient constraints and cannot guarantee that the recovered implicit function represents a true distance function, even if the output minimizes these losses almost everywhere. Furthermore, the eikonal loss suffers from stability issues in optimization. Finally, in conventional methods, regularization losses that penalize surface area distort the reconstructed signed distance function. We address these challenges by designing a loss function using the solution of a screened Poisson equation. Our loss, when minimized, provides an asymptotically sufficient condition to ensure the output converges to a true distance function. Our loss also leads to stable optimization and naturally penalizes large surface areas. We present theoretical analysis and experiments on both challenging 2D and 3D datasets and show that our method provides better surface reconstruction and a more accurate distance approximation.
