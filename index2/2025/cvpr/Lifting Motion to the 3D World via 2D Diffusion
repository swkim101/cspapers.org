Estimating 3D motion from 2D observations is a longstanding research challenge. Prior work typically requires training on datasets containing ground truth 3D motions, limiting their applicability to activities well-represented in existing motion capture data. This dependency particularly hinders generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios or subjects where collecting 3D ground truth is challenging, such as complex athletic movements or animal motion. We introduce MVLift, a novel approach to predict global 3D motion—including both joint rotations and root trajectories in the world coordinate system—using only 2D pose sequences for training. Our multi-stage framework leverages 2D motion diffusion models to progressively generate consistent 2D pose sequences across multiple views, a key step in recovering accurate global 3D motion. MVLift generalizes across various domains, including human poses, human-object interactions, and animal poses. Despite not requiring 3D supervision, it outperforms prior work on five datasets, including those methods that require 3D supervision.
