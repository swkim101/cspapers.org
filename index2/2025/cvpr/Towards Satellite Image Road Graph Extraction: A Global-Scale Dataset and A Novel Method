Recently, road graph extraction has garnered increasing attention due to its crucial role in autonomous driving, navigation, etc. However, accurately and efficiently extracting road graphs remains a persistent challenge, primarily due to the severe scarcity of labeled data. To address this limitation, we collect a global-scale satellite road graph extraction dataset, i.e. Global-Scale dataset. Specifically, the Global-Scale dataset is ∼ 20× larger than the largest existing public road extraction dataset and spans over 13,800 km2 globally. Additionally, we develop a novel road graph extraction model, i.e. SAM-Road++, which adopts a node-guided resampling method to alleviate the mismatch issue between training and inference in SAM-Road [17], a pioneering state-of-the-art road graph extraction model. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective "extended-line" strategy in SAM-Road++ to mitigate the occlusion issue on the road. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity of the collected Global-Scale dataset and the proposed SAM-Road++ method, particularly highlighting its superior predictive power in unseen regions.
