Palmprint recognition is significantly limited by the lack of large-scale publicly available datasets. Previous methods have adopted BÃ©zier curves to simulate the palm creases, which then serve as input for conditional GANs to generate realistic palmprints. However, without employing real data fine-tuning, the performance of the recognition model trained on these synthetic datasets would drastically decline, indicating a large gap between generated and real palmprints. This is primarily due to the utilization of an inaccurate palm crease representation and challenges in balancing intra-class variation with identity consistency. To address this, we introduce a polynomial-based palm crease representation that provides a new palm crease generation mechanism more closely aligned with the real distribution. We also propose the palm creases conditioned diffusion model with a novel intra-class variation control method. By applying our proposed K-step noise-sharing sampling, we are able to synthesize palmprint datasets with large intra-class variation and high identity consistency. Experimental results show that, for the first time, recognition models trained solely on our synthetic datasets, without any fine-tuning, outperform those trained on real datasets. Furthermore, our approach achieves superior recognition performance as the number of generated identities increases.
