Global contextual information and local detail features are essential for haze removal tasks. Deep learning models perform well on small, low-resolution images, but they encounter difficulties with large, high-resolution ones due to GPU memory limitations. As a compromise, they often resort to image slicing or downsampling. The former diminishes global information, while the latter discards high-frequency details. To address these challenges, we propose DehazeXL, a haze removal method that effectively balances global context and local feature extraction, enabling end-to-end modeling of large images on mainstream GPU hardware. Additionally, to evaluate the efficiency of global context utilization in haze removal performance, we design a visual attribution method tailored to the characteristics of haze removal tasks. Finally, recognizing the lack of benchmark datasets for haze removal in large images, we have developed an ultra-high-resolution haze removal dataset (8KDehaze) to support model training and testing. It includes 10000 pairs of clear and hazy remote sensing images, each sized at 8192 × 8192 pixels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeXL can infer images up to 10240 × 10240 pixels with only 21 GB of memory, achieving state-of-the-art results among all evaluated methods.
