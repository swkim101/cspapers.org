Change detection (CD) holds significant implications for Earth observation, in which pseudo-changes between bitemporal images induced by imaging environmental factors are key challenges. Existing methods mainly regard pseudo-changes as a kind of style shift and alleviate it by transforming bitemporal images into the same style using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Nevertheless, their efforts are limited by the complexity of optimizing GANs and the absence of guidance from physical properties. This paper finds that the spectrum transformation (ST) has the potential to mitigate pseudo-changes by aligning in the frequency domain carrying the style. However, the benefit of ST is largely constrained by two drawbacks: 1) limited transformation space and 2) inefficient parameter search. To address these limitations, we propose a Feature Spectrum learning (FeaSpect) that adaptively eliminate pseudo-changes in the latent space. For the drawback 1), FeaSpect directs the transformation towards stylealigned discriminative features via feature spectrum transformation (FST). For the drawback 2), FeaSpect allows FST to be trainable, efficiently discovering optimal parameters via extraction box with adaptive attention and extraction box with learnable strides. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing methods and achieves a commendable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Importantly, our method can be easily injected into other frameworks, achieving consistent improvements.
