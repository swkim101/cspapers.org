Semi-supervised crowd counting is crucial for addressing the high annotation costs of densely populated scenes. Although several methods based on pseudo-labeling have been proposed, it remains challenging to effectively and accurately utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Taste More Taste Better (TMTB), which emphasizes both data and model aspects. Firstly, we explore a data augmentation technique well-suited for the crowd counting task. By inpainting the background regions, this technique can effectively enhance data diversity while preserving the fidelity of the entire scenes. Secondly, we introduce the Visual State Space Model as backbone to capture the global context information from crowd scenes, which is crucial for extremely crowded, lowlight, and adverse weather scenarios. In addition to the traditional regression head for exact prediction, we employ an Anti-Noise classification head to provide less exact but more accurate supervision, since the regression head is sensitive to noise in manual annotations. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.
