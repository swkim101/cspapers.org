Obtaining high-quality, practically usable 3D models of biological plants remains a significant challenge in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating realistic 3D plant models from single-view photographs. Our approach employs a neural decomposition technique to learn a lightweight hierarchical box representation from the image, effectively capturing the structures and botanical features of plants. Then, this representation can be subsequently refined through a shape-guided parametric modeling module to produce complete 3D plant models. By combining hierarchical learning and parametric modeling, our method generates structured 3D plant assets with fine geometric details. Notably, through learning the decomposition in different levels of detail, our method can adapt to two distinct plant categories: outdoor trees and houseplants, each with unique appearance features. Within the scope of plant modeling, our method is the first comprehensive solution capable of reconstructing both plant categories from single-view images.
