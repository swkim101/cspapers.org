In the Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) field, accurately assessing the quality of authentically distorted images presents a substantial challenge due to the diverse distortion types in natural settings. Existing state-of-the-art IQA methods mix a sequence of distortions into entire images to establish global distortion priors, but are inadequate for authentic images with spatially varied distortions. To address this, we introduce a novel IQA framework that employs knowledge distillation tailored to perceive spatially heterogeneous distortions, enhancing quality-distortion awareness. Specifically, we introduce a novel Block-wise Degradation Modelling approach that applies distinct distortions to different spatial blocks of an image, thereby expanding local distortion priors. Following this, we present a Block-wise Aggregation and Filtering module that enables fine-grained attention to the quality information within different distortion areas of the image. Furthermore, to effectively capture the complex relationships between distortions across different regions while preserving overall quality perception, we introduce Contrastive Knowledge Distillation to enhance the model’s ability to discriminate between different types of distortions and Affinity Knowledge Distillation to model the correlation among distortions in different regions. Extensive experiments on standard BIQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method.
