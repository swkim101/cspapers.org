We introduce MaDCoW, a method for correcting marginal distortion of arbitrary objects in wide-angle photography. People often use wide-angle photography—it is the default in smartphone cameras—but very-wide-fields-of-view produce distorted object appearance in image margins. In our system, a user annotates straight lines and regions of interest. MaDCoW solves for a separate linear perspective projection for each region and then jointly solves for a distortion-minimizing projection for the whole photograph. We show that MaDCoW can produce good results in cases where previous methods yield visible distortions.
