Category-agnostic pose estimation aims to locate keypoints on query images according to a few annotated support images for arbitrary novel classes. Existing methods generally extract support features via heatmap pooling, and obtain interacted features from support and query via cross-attention. Hence, these works neglect to mine fine-grained and structure-aware (FGSA) features from both support and query images, which are crucial for pixel-level keypoint localization. To this end, we propose a novel yet concise framework, which recurrently mines FGSA features from both support and query images. Specifically, we design a FGSA mining module based on deformable attention mechanism. On the one hand, we mine fine-grained features by applying deformable attention head over multi-scale feature maps. On the other hand, we mine structure-aware features by offsetting the reference points of keypoints to their linked keypoints. By means of above module, we recurrently mine FGSA features from support and query images, and thus obtain better support features and query estimations. In addition, we propose to use mixup keypoints to pad various classes to a unified keypoint number, which could provide richer supervision than the zero padding used in existing works. We conduct extensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset, and outperform SOTA method dramatically (+3.2%PCK@0.05).
