Thanks to the introduction of large-scale datasets, deep-learning has become the mainstream approach for appearance-based gaze estimation problems. However, current large-scale datasets contain annotation errors and provide only a single vector for gaze annotation, lacking key information such as 3D eyeball structures. Limitations in annotation accuracy and variety have constrained the progress in research and development of deep-learning methods for appearance-based gaze-related tasks. In this paper, we present GazeGene, a new large-scale synthetic gaze dataset with photo-realistic samples. More importantly, GazeGene not only provides accurate gaze annotations, but also offers 3D annotations of vital eye structures such as the pupil, iris, eyeball, optical and visual axes for the first time. Experiments show that GazeGene achieves comparable quality and generalization ability with real-world datasets, even outperforms most existing datasets on high-resolution images. Furthermore, its 3D eyeball annotations expand the application of deep-learning methods on various gaze-related tasks, offering new insights into this field.
