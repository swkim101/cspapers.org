Conditional image synthesis is a crucial task with broad applications, such as artistic creation and virtual reality. However, current generative methods are often task-oriented with a narrow scope, handling a restricted condition with constrained applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that treats conditional image synthesis as the modular combination of diverse fundamental condition units. Specifically, we divide conditions into three primary units: text, layout, and drag. To enable effective control over these conditions, we design a dedicated alignment module for each. For the text condition, we introduce a Dense Concept Alignment (DCA) module, which achieves dense visual-text alignment by drawing on diverse textual concepts. For the layout condition, we propose a Dense Geometry Alignment (DGA) module to enforce comprehensive geometric constraints that preserve the spatial configuration. For the drag condition, we introduce a Dense Motion Alignment (DMA) module to apply multi-level motion regularization, ensuring that each pixel follows its desired trajectory without visual artifacts. By flexibly inserting and combining these alignment modules, our framework enhances the modelâ€™s adaptability to diverse conditional generation tasks and greatly expands its application range. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework across a variety of conditions, including textual description, segmentation mask (bounding box), drag manipulation, and their combinations.
