We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn cross-modal mappings—often at high computational cost and with limited flexibility—our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation comprising three core primitives: $\color{blue}{\text{functions}}$, $\color{green}{\text{parameters}}$, and $\color {Purple}{\text{topological}}\,{\text{logic}}$. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner. Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.
