Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on tokens as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specific model (e.g., SAM). However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map, which reveals that what the token contributes to is semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, the token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image, while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMsâ€™ resilient REAsoning capability of where to attenD under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to -like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.
