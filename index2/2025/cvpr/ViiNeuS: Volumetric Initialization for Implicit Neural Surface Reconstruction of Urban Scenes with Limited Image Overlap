Neural implicit surface representation methods have recently shown impressive 3D reconstruction results. However, existing solutions struggle to reconstruct driving scenes due to their large size, highly complex nature and their limited visual observation overlap. Hence, to achieve accurate reconstructions, additional supervision data such as LiDAR, strong geometric priors, and long training times are required. To tackle such limitations, we present ViiNeuS, a new hybrid implicit surface learning method that efficiently initializes the signed distance field to reconstruct large driving scenes from 2D street view images. ViiNeuSâ€™s hybrid architecture models two separate implicit fields: one representing the volumetric density of the scene, and another one representing the signed distance to the surface. To accurately reconstruct urban outdoor driving scenarios, we introduce a novel volume-rendering strategy that relies on self-supervised probabilistic density estimation to sample points near the surface and transition progressively from volumetric to surface representation. Our solution permits a proper and fast initialization of the signed distance field without relying on any geometric prior on the scene, compared to concurrent methods. By conducting extensive experiments on four outdoor driving datasets, we show that ViiNeuS can learn an accurate and detailed 3D surface representation of various urban scene while being two times faster to train compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions.
