Pansharpening aims at integrating complementary information from panchromatic and multispectral images. Available deep-learning based pansharpening methods typically perform exceptionally with particular satellite datasets. At the same time, it has been observed that these models also exhibit scene dependence, for example, if the majority of the training samples come from the urban scenes, the model’s performance may decline in the river scene. To address the domain gap produced by varying satellite sensors and distinct scenes, we propose a dual-granularity semantic guided sparse routing diffusion model for general pansharpening. By utilizing the large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the field of geoscience, e.g, GeoChat, we introduce the dual granularity semantics to generate dynamic sparse routing scores for adaptation of different satellite sensors and scenes. This scene-level and region-level dual-granularity semantic information serves as guidance for dynamically activating specialized experts within the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on WorldView-3, QuickBird, and GaoFen-2 datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the proposed method outperforms the comparison approaches in adapting to new satellite sensors and scenes. The codes are available at https://github.com/codgodtao/SGDiff.
