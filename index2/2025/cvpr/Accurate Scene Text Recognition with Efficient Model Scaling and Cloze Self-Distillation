Scaling architectures have been proven effective for improving Scene Text Recognition (STR), but the individual contribution of vision encoder and text decoder scaling remain under-explored. In this work, we present an in-depth empirical analysis and demonstrate that, contrary to previous observations, scaling the decoder yields significant performance gains, always exceeding those achieved by encoder scaling alone. We also identify label noise as a key challenge in STR, particularly in real-world data, which can limit the effectiveness of STR models. To address this, we propose Cloze Self-Distillation (CSD), a method that mitigates label noise by distilling a student model from context-aware soft predictions and pseudolabels generated by a teacher model. Additionally, we enhance the decoder architecture by introducing differential cross-attention for STR. Our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 11 benchmarks using only real data, while significantly reducing the parameter size and computational costs.
