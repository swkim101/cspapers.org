The proliferation of digital images on the Internet has provided unprecedented convenience, but also poses significant risks of malicious theft and misuse. Digital watermarking has long been researched as an effective tool for copyright protection. However, it often falls short when addressing partial image theft, a common yet little-researched issue in practical applications. Most existing schemes typically require the entire image as input to extract watermarks. However, in practice, malicious users often steal only a portion of the image to create new content. The stolen portion can have arbitrary shape or content, being fused with a new background and may have undergone geometric transformations, making it challenging for current methods to extract correctly. To address the issues above, we propose WOFA (Watermarking One for All), a robust watermarking scheme against partial image theft. First of all, we define the entire process of partial image theft and construct a dataset accordingly. To gain robustness against partial image theft, we then design a comprehensive distortion layer that incorporates the process of partial image theft and several common distortions in channel. For easier network convergence, we employ a multi-level network structure on the basis of the commonly used embedder-distortion layer-extractor architecture and adopt a progressive training strategy. Abundant experiments demonstrate that our superior performance in the scenario of partial image theft, offering a more reliable solution for protecting digital images against unauthorized use in practical use.
