Mirror detection is a challenging task because a mirror’s visual appearance varies depending on the reflected content. Due to limited annotated data, current methods failed to generalize well for detecting diverse mirror scenes. Semi-supervised learning with large-scale unlabeled data can improve generalization capabilities on mirror detection, but these methods often suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels due to distribution differences between labeled and unlabeled data, therefore affecting the learning process. To address this issue, we first collect a large-scale dataset of approximately 0.4 million mirror-related images from the internet, significantly expanding the data scale for mirror detection. To effectively exploit this unlabeled dataset, we propose the first semi-supervised framework (namely an iterative data engine) consisting of four steps: (1) mirror detection model training, (2) pseudo label prediction, (3) dual guidance scoring, and (4) selection of highly reliable pseudo labels. In each iteration of the data engine, we employ a geometric accuracy scoring approach to assess pseudo labels based on multiple segmentation metrics, and design a multi-modal agent-driven semantic scoring approach to enhance the semantic perception of pseudo labels. These two scoring approaches can effectively improve the reliability of pseudo labels by selecting unlabeled samples with higher scores. Our method demonstrates promising performance across three mirror detection tasks and exhibits strong generalization on unseen examples.
