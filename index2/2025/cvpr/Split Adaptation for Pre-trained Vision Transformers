Vision Transformers (ViTs), extensively pre-trained on large-scale datasets, have become fundamental to foundation models, enabling adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. Existing adaptation methods typically require direct data access, rendering them infeasible in privacy-sensitive domains where clients are often reluctant to share their data. A straightforward solution may be sending the pre-trained ViT to clients for local adaptation, which poses issues of model intellectual property and incurs heavy client computation overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel split adaptation (SA) method that enables effective downstream adaptation while protecting data and models. SA, inspired by split learning (SL), segments the pre-trained ViT into a frontend and a backend, with only the frontend shared with the client for data representation extraction. But unlike regular SL, SA replaces frontend parameters with low-bit quantized values, preventing direct exposure of the model. SA allows the client to add bi-level noise to the frontend and the extracted data representations, ensuring data protection. Accordingly, SA incorporates data-level and model-level out-of-distribution enhancements to mitigate noise injection’s impact. Our SA focuses on the challenging few-shot adaptation and adopts patch retrieval augmentation for overfitting alleviation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate SA’s superiority over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its defense against advanced data reconstruction attacks while preventing model leakage with minimal computation cost on the client side.
