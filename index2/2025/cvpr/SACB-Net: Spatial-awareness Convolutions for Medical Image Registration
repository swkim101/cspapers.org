Deep learning-based image registration methods have shown state-of-the-art performance and rapid inference speeds. Despite these advances, many existing approaches fall short in capturing spatially varying information in non-local regions of feature maps due to the reliance on spatially-shared convolution kernels. This limitation leads to suboptimal estimation of deformation fields. In this paper, we propose a 3D Spatial-Awareness Convolution Block (SACB) to enhance the spatial information within feature representations. Our SACB estimates the spatial clusters within feature maps by leveraging feature similarity and subsequently parameterizes the adaptive convolution kernels across diverse regions. This adaptive mechanism generates the convolution kernels (weights and biases) tailored to spatial variations, thereby enabling the network to effectively capture spatially varying information. Building on SACB, we introduce a pyramid flow estimator (named SACB-Net) that integrates SACBs to facilitate multi-scale flow composition, particularly addressing large deformations. Experimental results on the brain IXI and LPBA datasets as well as Abdomen CT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SACB and the superiority of SACB-Net over the state-of-the-art learning-based registration methods.
