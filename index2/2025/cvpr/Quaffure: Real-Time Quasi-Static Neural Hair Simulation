Realistic hair motion is crucial for high-quality avatars, but it is often limited by the computational resources available for real-time applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel neural approach to predict physically plausible hair deformations that generalizes to various body poses, shapes, and hairstyles. Our model is trained using a self-supervised loss, eliminating the need for expensive data generation and storage. We demonstrate our methodâ€™s effectiveness through numerous results across a wide range of pose and shape variations, showcasing its robust generalization capabilities and temporally smooth results. Our approach is highly suitable for real-time applications with an inference time of only a few milliseconds on consumer hardware and its ability to scale to predicting the drape of 1000 grooms in 0.3 seconds.
