In clinical practice of echocardiography examinations, multiple planes containing the heart structures of different view are usually required in screening, diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. AI models for echocardiogra-phy have to be tailored for each specific plane due to the dramatic structure differences, thus resulting in repetition development and extra complexity. Effective solution for such a multi-plane segmentation (MPS) problem is highly demanded for medical images, yet has not been well investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, EchoONE, for this problem with an SAM-based segmentation architecture, a prior-composable mask learning (PC-Mask) module for semantic-aware dense prompt generation, and a learnable CNN-branch with a simple yet effective local feature fusion and adaption (LFFA) module for SAM adapting. We extensively evaluated our method on multiple internal and external echocardiography datasets and achieved consistently state-of-the-art performance for multi-source datasets with different heart planes. This is the first time the MPS problem has been solved in one model for echocardiography data. The code will be available at https://github.com/a2502503/EchoONE.
