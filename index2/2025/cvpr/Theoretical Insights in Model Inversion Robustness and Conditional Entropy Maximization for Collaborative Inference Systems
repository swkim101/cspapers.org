By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9% to 48.2%.
