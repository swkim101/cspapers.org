Training large foundation models from scratch for domain-specific applications is almost impossible due to data limits and long-tailed distributions — taking remote sensing (RS) as an example. Fine-tuning natural image pre-trained models on RS images is a straightforward solution. To reduce computational costs and improve performance on tail classes, existing methods apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA and AdaptFormer. However, we observe that fixed hyperparameters — such as intra-layer positions, layer depth, and scaling factors, can considerably hinder PEFT performance, as fine-tuning on RS images proves highly sensitive to these settings. To address this, we propose MetaPEFT, a method incorporating adaptive scalers that dynamically adjust module influence during fine-tuning. MetaPEFT dynamically adjusts three key factors of PEFT on RS images: module insertion, layer selection, and module-wise learning rates, which collectively control the influence of PEFT modules across the network. We conduct extensive experiments on three transfer-learning scenarios and five datasets in both RS and natural image domains. The results show that MetaPEFT achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-spectral adaptation, requiring only a small amount of trainable parameters and improving tail-class accuracy significantly. 1
