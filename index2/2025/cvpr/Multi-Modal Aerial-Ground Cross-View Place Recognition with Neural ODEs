Place recognition (PR) aims at retrieving the query place from a database and plays a crucial role in various applications, including navigation, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. While previous multi-modal PR works have mainly focused on the same-view scenario in which ground-view descriptors are matched with a database of ground-view descriptors during inference, the multi-modal cross-view scenario, in which ground-view descriptors are matched with aerial-view descriptors in a database, remains underexplored. We propose AGPlace, a model that effectively integrates information from multi-modal ground sensors (cameras and LiDARs) to achieve accurate aerial-ground PR. AGPlace achieves effective aerial-ground cross-view PR by leveraging a manifold-based neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework with a multi-domain alignment loss. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-view PR models on large-scale datasets. As most existing PR models are designed for ground-ground PR, we adapt these baselines into our cross-view pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that this direct adaptation performs worse than our overall model architecture AGPlace. AGPlace represents a significant advancement in multi-modal aerial-ground PR, with promising implications for real-world applications.
