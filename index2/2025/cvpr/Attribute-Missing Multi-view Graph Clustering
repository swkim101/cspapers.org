The success of existing deep multi-view graph clustering methods is based on the assumption that node attributes are fully available across all views. However, in practical scenarios, node attributes are frequently missing due to factors such as data privacy concerns or failures in data collection devices. Although some methods have been proposed to address the issue of missing node attributes, they come with the following limitations: i) Existing methods are often not tailored specifically for clustering tasks and struggle to address missing attributes effectively. ii) They tend to ignore the relational dependencies between nodes and their neighboring nodes. This oversight results in unreliable imputations, thereby degrading clustering performance. To address the above issues, we propose an Attribute-Missing Multi-view Graph Clustering (AMMGC). Specifically, we first impute missing node attributes by leveraging neighbor-hood information through an adjacency matrix. Then, to improve the consistency, we integrate a dual structure consistency module that aligns graph structures across multiple views, reducing redundancy and retaining key information. Furthermore, we introduce a high-confidence guidance module to improve the reliability of clustering. Extensive experiment results showcase the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method on multiple benchmark datasets.
