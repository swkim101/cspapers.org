Instance detection (InsDet) aims to localize specific object instances within a novel scene imagery based on given visual references. Technically, it requires proposal detection to identify all possible object instances, followed by instance-level matching to pinpoint the ones of interest. Its open-world nature supports its broad applications from robotics to AR/VR but also presents significant challenges: methods must generalize to unknown testing data distributions because (1) the testing scene imagery is unseen during training, and (2) there are domain gaps between visual references and detected proposals. Existing methods tackle these challenges by synthesizing diverse training examples or utilizing off-the-shelf foundation models (FMs). However, they only partially capitalize the available open-world information. In contrast, we approach InsDet from an Open-World perspective, introducing our method IDOW. We find that, while pretrained FMs yield high recall in instance detection, they are not specifically optimized for instance-level feature matching. Therefore, we adapt pretrained FMs for improved instance-level matching using open-world data. Our approach incorporates metric learning along with novel data augmentations, which sample distractors as negative examples and synthesize novel-view instances to enrich the visual references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior works, achieving >10 AP over previous results on two recently released challenging benchmark datasets in both conventional and novel instance detection settings.
