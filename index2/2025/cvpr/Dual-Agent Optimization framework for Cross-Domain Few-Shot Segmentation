Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) extends the generalization ability of Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) beyond a single domain, enabling more practical applications. However, directly employing conventional FSS methods suffers from severe performance degradation in cross-domain settings, primarily due to feature sensitivity and support-to-query matching process sensitivity across domains. Existing methods for CD-FSS either focus on domain adaptation of features or delve into designing matching strategies for enhanced cross-domain robustness. Nonetheless, they overlook the fact that these two issues are interdependent and should be addressed jointly. In this work, we tackle these two issues within a unified framework by optimizing features in the frequency domain and enhancing the matching process in the spatial domain, working jointly to handle the deviations introduced by the domain gap. To this end, we propose a coherent Dual-Agent Optimization (DATO) framework, including a consistent mutual aggregation (CMA) and a correlation rectification strategy (CRS). In the consistent mutual aggregation module, we employ a set of agents to learn domain-invariant features across domains, and then use these features to enhance the original representations for feature adaptation. In the correlation rectification strategy, the agent-aggregated domain-invariant features serve as a bridge, transforming the support-to-query matching process into a referable feature space and reducing its domain sensitivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
