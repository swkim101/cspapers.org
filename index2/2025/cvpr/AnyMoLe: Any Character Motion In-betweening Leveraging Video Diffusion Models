Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a "motion-video mimicking" optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.
