Pre-trained on tremendous image-text pairs, vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization across numerous image-based tasks. However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing learnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all video sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the modelâ€™s ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video understanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal variation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight the varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce inter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal dependencies across sequences. Extensive experiments on various video benchmarks demonstrate that STOP consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods.
