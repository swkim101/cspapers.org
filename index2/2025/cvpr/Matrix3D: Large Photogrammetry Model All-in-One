We present Matrix3D, a unified model that performs several photogrammetry subtasks, including pose estimation, depth prediction, and novel view synthesis using just the same model. Matrix3D utilizes a multi-modal diffusion transformer (DiT) to integrate transformations across several modalities, such as images, camera parameters, and depth maps. The key to Matrix3Dâ€™s large-scale multi-modal training lies in the incorporation of a mask learning strategy. This enables full-modality model training even with partially complete data, such as bi-modality data of image-pose and image-depth pairs, thus significantly increases the pool of available training data. Matrix3D demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and novel view synthesis tasks. Additionally, it offers fine-grained control through multi-round interactions, making it an innovative tool for 3D content creation. Project page: https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/matrix3d.
