Camera pose estimation is crucial for many computer vision applications, yet existing benchmarks offer limited insight into method limitations across different geometric challenges. We introduce RUBIK, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates image matching methods across well-defined geometric difficulty levels. Using three complementary criteria - overlap, scale ratio, and viewpoint angle - we organize 16.5K image pairs from nuScenes into 33 difficulty levels. Our comprehensive evaluation of 14 methods reveals that while recent detector-free approaches achieve the best performance (>47% success rate), they come with significant computational overhead compared to detector-based methods (150-600ms vs. 40-70ms). Even the best performing method succeeds on only 54.8% of the pairs, highlighting substantial room for improvement, particularly in challenging scenarios combining low overlap, large scale differences, and extreme viewpoint changes. Benchmark will be made publicly available.
