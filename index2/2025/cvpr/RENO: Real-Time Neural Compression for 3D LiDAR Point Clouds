Despite the substantial advancements demonstrated by learning-based neural models in the LiDAR Point Cloud Compression (LPCC) task, realizing real-time compression—an indispensable criterion for numerous industrial applications—remains a formidable challenge. This paper proposes RENO, the first real-time neural codec for 3D LiDAR point clouds, achieving superior performance with a lightweight model. RENO skips the octree construction and directly builds upon the multiscale sparse tensor representation. Instead of the multi-stage inferring, RENO devises sparse occupancy codes, which exploit cross-scale correlation and derive voxels’ occupancy in a one-shot manner, greatly saving processing time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RENO achieves real-time coding speed, 10 fps at 14-bit depth on a desktop platform (e.g., one RTX 3090 GPU) for both encoding and decoding processes, while providing 12.25% and 48.34% bit-rate savings compared to G-PCCv23 and Draco, respectively, at a similar quality. RENO model size is merely 1MB, making it attractive for practical applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/NJUVISION/RENO.
