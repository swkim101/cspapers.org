Inferring signed distance functions (SDFs) from sparse point clouds remains a challenge in surface reconstruction. The key lies in the lack of detailed geometric information in sparse point clouds, which is essential for learning a continuous field. To resolve this issue, we present a novel approach that learns a dynamic deformation network to predict SDFs in an end-to-end manner. To parameterize a continuous surface from sparse points, we propose a bijective surface parameterization (BSP) that learns the global shape from local patches. Specifically, we construct a bijective mapping for sparse points from the parametric domain to 3D local patches, integrating patches into the global surface. Meanwhile, we introduce grid deformation optimization (GDO) into the surface approximation to optimize the deformation of grid points and further refine the parametric surfaces. Experimental results on synthetic and real scanned datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.
