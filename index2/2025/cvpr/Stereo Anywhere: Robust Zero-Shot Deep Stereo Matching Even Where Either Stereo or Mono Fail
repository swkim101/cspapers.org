We introduce Stereo Anywhere, a novel stereo-matching framework that combines geometric constraints with robust priors from monocular depth Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). By elegantly coupling these complementary worlds through a dual-branch architecture, we seamlessly integrate stereo matching with learned contextual cues. Following this design, our framework introduces novel cost volume fusion mechanisms that effectively handle critical challenges such as textureless regions, occlusions, and nonLambertian surfaces. Through our novel optical illusion dataset, MonoTrap, and extensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our synthetic-only trained model achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot generalization, significantly outperforming existing solutions while showing remarkable robustness to challenging cases such as mirrors and transparencies.
