Most previous scene text spotting methods rely on high-quality manual annotations to achieve promising performance. To reduce their expensive costs, we study semi-supervised text spotting (SSTS) to exploit useful information from unlabeled images. However, directly applying existing semi-supervised methods of general scenes to SSTS will face new challenges: 1) inconsistent pseudo labels between detection and recognition tasks, and 2) sub-optimal supervisions caused by inconsistency between teacher/student. Thus, we propose a new Semi-supervised framework for End-to-end Text Spotting, namely SemiETS that leverages the complementarity of text detection and recognition. Specifically, it gradually generates reliable hierarchical pseudo labels for each task, thereby reducing noisy labels. Meanwhile, it extracts important information in locations and transcriptions from bidirectional flows to improve consistency. Extensive experiments on three datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of SemiETS on arbitrary-shaped text. For example, it outperforms previous state-of-the-art SSL methods by a large margin on end-to-end spotting (+8.7%, +5.6%, and +2.6% H-mean under 0.5%, 1%, and 2% labeled data settings on Total-Text, respectively). More importantly, it still improves upon a strongly supervised text spotter trained with plenty of labeled data by 2.0%. Compelling domain adaptation ability shows practical potential. Moreover, our method demonstrates consistent improvement on different text spotters. Code will be available at https://github.com/DrLuo/SemiETS.
