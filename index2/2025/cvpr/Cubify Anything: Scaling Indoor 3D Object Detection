We consider indoor 3D object detection with respect to a single RGB(-D) frame acquired from a commodity handheld device. We seek to significantly advance the status quo with respect to both data and modeling. First, we establish that existing datasets have significant limitations to scale, accuracy, and diversity of objects. As a result, we introduce the Cubify-Anything 1M (CA-1M) dataset, which exhaustively labels over 400K 3D objects on over 1K highly accurate laser-scanned scenes with near-perfect registration to over 3.5K handheld, egocentric captures. Next, we establish Cubify Transformer (CuTR), a fully Transformer 3D object detection baseline which rather than operating in 3D on point or voxel-based representations, predicts 3D boxes directly from 2D features derived from RGB(-D) inputs. While this approach lacks any 3D inductive biases, we show that paired with CA-1M, CuTR outperforms pointbased methods — accurately recalling over 62%c of objects in 3D, and is significantly more capable at handling noise and uncertainty present in commodity LiDAR-derived depth maps while also providing promising RGB only performance without architecture changes. Furthermore, by pre-training on CA-1M, CuTR can outperform point-based methods on a more diverse variant of SUN RGB-D — supporting the notion that while inductive biases in 3D are useful at the smaller sizes of existing datasets, they fail to scale to the data-rich regime of CA-1M. Overall, this dataset and baseline model provide strong evidence that we are moving towards models which can effectively Cubify Anything.
