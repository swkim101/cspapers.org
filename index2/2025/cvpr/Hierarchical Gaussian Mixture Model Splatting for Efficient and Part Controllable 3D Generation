3D content creation has achieved significant progress in terms of both quality and speed. Although current Gaussian Splatting-based methods can produce 3D objects within seconds, they are still limited by complex preprocessing or low controllability. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework designed to efficiently and controllably generate high-resolution 3D models from text prompts or images. Our key insights are three-fold: 1) Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Model Splatting: We propose a hybrid hierarchical representation to extract fixed number of fine-grained Gaussians with multiscale details from textured object, also establish part-level representation of Gaussians primitives. 2) Mamba with adaptive tree topology: We present a diffusion mamba with tree-topology to adaptively generate Gaussians with disordered spatial structures, without the need for complex preprocessing and maintain linear complexity generation. 3) Controllable Generation: Building on the HGMM tree, we introduce a cascaded diffusion framework combining controllable implicit latent generation, which progressively generates condition-driven latents, and explicit splatting generation, which transforms latents into high-quality Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high fidelity and efficiency of our approach.
