High-quality semantic segmentation relies on three key capabilities: global context modeling, local detail encoding, and multi-scale feature extraction. However, recent methods struggle to possess all these capabilities simultaneously. Hence, we aim to empower segmentation networks to simultaneously carry out efficient global context modeling, high-quality local detail encoding, and rich multi-scale feature representation for varying input resolutions. In this paper, we introduce SegMAN, a novel linear-time model comprising a hybrid feature encoder dubbed SegMAN Encoder, and a decoder based on state space models. Specifically, the SegMAN Encoder synergistically integrates sliding local attention with dynamic state space models, enabling highly efficient global context modeling while preserving fine-grained local details. Meanwhile, the MMSCopE module in our decoder enhances multi-scale context feature extraction and adaptively scales with the input resolution. Our SegMAN-B Encoder achieves 85.1% ImageNet-1k accuracy (+1.5% over VMamba-S with fewer parameters). When paired with our decoder, the full SegMAN-B model achieves 52.6% mIoU on ADE20K (+1.6% over SegNeXt-L with 15% fewer GFLOPs), 83.8% mIoU on Cityscapes (+2.1% over SegFormer-B3 with half the GFLOPs), and 1.6% higher mIoU than VWFormer-B3 on COCO-Stuff with lower GFLOPs.
