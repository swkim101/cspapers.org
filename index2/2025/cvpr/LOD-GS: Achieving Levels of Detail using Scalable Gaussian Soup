Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods often overlook structured information, leading to disorganized 3D Gaussians that compromise memory and structure efficiency, particularly in Level-of-Detail (LOD) management. This inefficiency results in excessive memory use, limiting their application in resource-sensitive environments like virtual reality and interactive simulations. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable Gaussian Soup that enables high-performance LOD management with progressively reduced memory usage. Our method utilizes triangle primitives with Gaussian splats embedded and adaptive pruning/growing strategies to ensure high-quality scene rendering with significantly reduced memory demands. By embedding neural Gaussians within the triangle primitives through the triangle-MLP, we achieve further memory savings while maintaining rendering fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves consistently superior performance than recent leading techniques across various LOD while progressively reducing memory usage.
