Domain generalization is proposed to address distribution shift, arising from statistical disparities between training source and unseen target domains. The widely used first-order meta-learning algorithms demonstrate strong performance for domain generalization by leveraging the gradient matching theory, which aims to establish balanced parameters across source domains to reduce overfitting to any particular domain. However, our analysis reveals that there are actually numerous directions to achieve gradient matching, with current methods representing just one possible path. These methods actually overlook another critical factor that the balanced parameters should be close to the centroid of optimal parameters of each source domain. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective arithmetic meta-learning with arithmetic-weighted gradients. This approach, while adhering to the principles of gradient matching, promotes a more precise balance by estimating the centroid between domain-specific optimal parameters. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our strategy. Our code is available at https://github.com/zzwdx/ARITH.
