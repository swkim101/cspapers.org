Image rendering from line drawings is vital in design and image generation technologies reduce costs, yet professional line drawings demand preserving complex details. Text prompts struggle with accuracy, and image translation struggles with consistency and fine-grained control. We present LineArt, a framework that transfers complex appearance onto detailed design drawings, facilitating design and artistic creation. It generates high-fidelity appearance while preserving structural accuracy by simulating hierarchical visual cognition and integrating human artistic experience to guide the diffusion process. LineArt overcomes the limitations of current methods in terms of difficulty in fine-grained control and style degradation in design drawings. It requires no precise 3D modeling, physical property specifications, or network training, making it more convenient for design tasks. LineArt consists of two stages: a multi-frequency lines fusion module to supplement the input design drawing with detailed structural information and a two-part painting process for Base Layer Shaping and Surface Layer Coloring. We also present a new design drawing dataset, ProLines, for evaluation. The experiments show that LineArt performs better in accuracy, realism, and material precision compared to SOTAs.
