Traditional segmentation models, while effective in isolated tasks, often fail to generalize to more complex and open-ended segmentation problems, such as free-form, open-vocabulary, and in-the-wild scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose to scale up image segmentation across diverse datasets and tasks such that the knowledge across different tasks and datasets can be integrated while improving the generalization ability. Mixed-Query Transformer (MQ-Former), a novel segmentation framework, is introduced and designed to scale seamlessly across both data size and task diversity. It is built upon a dynamic object query mechanism called mixed query, which fuses different types of queries using cross-attention. This hybrid approach enables the model to balance between instance- and stuff-level segmentation, providing enhanced scalability for handling diverse object types. We further enhance scalability by leveraging synthetic data-generating segmentation masks and captions for pixel-level and open-vocabulary tasks-drastically reducing the need for costly human annotations. By training on multiple datasets and tasks at scale, MQ-Former continuously improves performance as the volume and diversity of data and tasks increase. It exhibits strong generalization capabilities, boosting performance in open-set segmentation tasks SeginW by 7 points. These advancements mark a key step toward universal, scalable segmentation models capable of addressing the demands of real-world applications.
