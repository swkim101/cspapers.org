Interactive segmentation is a pivotal task in computer vision, focused on predicting precise masks with minimal user input. Although the click has recently become the most prevalent form of interaction due to its flexibility and efficiency, its advantages diminish as the complexity and details of target objects increase because it’s time-consuming and user-unfriendly to precisely locate and click on narrow, fine regions. To tackle this problem, we propose NTClick, a powerful click-based interactive segmentation method capable of predicting accurate masks even with imprecise user clicks when dealing with intricate targets. We first introduce a novel interaction form called noise-tolerant click, a type of click that does not require user’s precise localization when selecting fine regions. Then, we design a two-stage workflow, consisting of an Explicit Coarse Perception network for initial estimation and a High Resolution Refinement network for final classification. Quantitative results across extensive datasets demonstrate that NTClick not only maintains an efficient and user-friendly interaction mode but also significantly outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy.
