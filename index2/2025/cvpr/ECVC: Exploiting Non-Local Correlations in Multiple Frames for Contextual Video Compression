In Learned Video Compression (LVC), improving inter prediction, such as enhancing temporal context mining and mitigating accumulated errors, is crucial for boosting rate-distortion performance. Existing LVCs mainly focus on mining the temporal movements while neglecting non-local correlations among frames. Additionally, current contextual video compression models use a single reference frame, which is insufficient for handling complex movements. To address these issues, we propose leveraging non-local correlations across multiple frames to enhance temporal priors, significantly boosting rate-distortion performance. To mitigate error accumulation, we introduce a partial cascaded fine-tuning strategy that supports fine-tuning on full-length sequences with constrained computational resources. This method reduces the train-test mismatch in sequence lengths and significantly decreases accumulated errors. Based on the proposed techniques, we present a video compression scheme ECVC. Experiments demonstrate that our ECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing 10.5% and 11.5% more bit-rates than previous SOTA method DCVC-FM over VTM-13.2 low delay B (LDB) under the intra period (IP) of 32 and âˆ’11, respectively.
