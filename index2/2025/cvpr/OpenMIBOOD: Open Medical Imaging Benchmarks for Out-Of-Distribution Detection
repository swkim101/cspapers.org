The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare demands robust mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of these systems, especially when faced with unexpected or anomalous inputs. This paper introduces the Open Medical Imaging Benchmarks for Out-Of-Distribution Detection (OpenMI-BOOD), a comprehensive framework for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods specifically in medical imaging contexts. OpenMIBOOD includes three benchmarks from diverse medical domains, encompassing 14 datasets divided into covariate-shifted in-distribution, near-OOD, and far-OOD categories. We evaluate 24 post-hoc methods across these benchmarks, providing a standardized reference to advance the development and fair comparison of OOD detection methods. Results reveal that findings from broad-scale OOD benchmarks in natural image domains do not translate to medical applications, underscoring the critical need for such benchmarks in the medical field. By mitigating the risk of exposing AI models to inputs outside their training distribution, OpenMIBOOD aims to support the advancement of reliable and trustworthy AI systems in healthcare.
