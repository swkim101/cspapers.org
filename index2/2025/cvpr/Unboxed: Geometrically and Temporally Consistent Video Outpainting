Extending the field of view of video content beyond its original version has many applications: immersive viewing experience with VR devices, reformatting 4:3 legacy content to today’s viewing conditions with wide screens, or simply extending vertically captured phone videos. Many existing works focus on synthesizing the video using generative models only. Despite promising results, this strategy seems at the moment limited in terms of quality. In this work, we address this problem using two key ideas: 3D supported outpainting for the static regions of the images, and leveraging pre-trained video diffusion model to ensure realistic and temporally coherent results, particularly for the dynamic parts. In the first stage, we iterate between image outpainting and updating the 3D scene representation - we use 3D Gaussian Splatting. Then we consider dynamic objects independently per frame and in-paint missing pixels. Finally, we propose a denoising scheme that allows to maintain known reliable regions and update the dynamic parts to obtain temporally realistic results. We achieve state-of-the-art video outpainting. This is validated quantitatively and through a user study. We are also able to extend the field of view largely beyond the limits reached by existing methods.
