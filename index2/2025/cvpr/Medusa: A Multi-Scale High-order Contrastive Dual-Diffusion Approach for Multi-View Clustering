Deep multi-view clustering methods utilize information from multiple views to achieve enhanced clustering results and have gained increasing popularity in recent years. Most existing methods typically focus on either inter-view or intra-view relationships, aiming to align information across views or analyze structural patterns within individual views. However, they often incorporate inter-view complementary information in a simplistic manner, while overlooking the complex, high-order relationships within multi-view data and the interactions among samples, resulting in an incomplete utilization of the rich information available. Instead, we propose a multi-scale approach that exploits all of the available information. We first introduce a dual graph diffusion module guided by a consensus graph. This module leverages inter-view information to enhance the representation of both nodes and edges within each view. Secondly, we propose a novel contrastive loss function based on hypergraphs to more effectively model and leverage complex intra-view data relationships. Finally, we propose to adaptively learn fusion weights at the sample level, which enables a more flexible and dynamic aggregation of multi-view information. Extensive experiments on eight datasets show favorable performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse scenarios.
