This paper aims to reconstruct the scene geometry from multi-view images with strong robustness and high quality. Previous learning-based methods incorporate neural networks into the multi-view stereo matching and have shown impressive reconstruction results. However, due to the reliance on matching across input images, they typically suffer from high GPU memory consumption and tend to fail in sparse view scenarios. To overcome this problem, we develop a new pipeline, named Murre, for multi-view geometry reconstruction of 3D scenes based on SfM-guided monocular depth estimation. For input images, Murre first recovers the SfM point cloud that captures the global scene structure, and then use it to guide a conditional diffusion model to produce multi-view metric depth maps for the final TSDF fusion. By predicting the depth map from a single image, Murre bypasses the multi-view matching step and naturally resolves the issues of previous MVS-based methods. In addition, the diffusion-based model can easily leverage the powerful priors of 2D foundation models, achieving good generalization ability across diverse real-world scenes. To obtain multi-view consistent depth maps, our key design is providing effective guidance on the diffusion model through the SfM point cloud, which is a condensed form of multiview information, highlighting the sceneâ€™s salient structure, and can be readily transformed into sparse depth maps to drive the image-space estimation process. We evaluate the reconstruction quality of Murre in various types of real-world datasets including indoor, streetscapes, and aerial scenes, surpassing state-of-the-art MVS-based and implicit neural reconstruction-based methods.
