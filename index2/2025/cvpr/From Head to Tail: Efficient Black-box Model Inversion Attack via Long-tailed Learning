Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct private training data from models, leading to privacy leakage, particularly in facial recognition systems. Although many studies have enhanced the effectiveness of white-box MIAs, less attention has been paid to improving efficiency and utility under limited attacker capabilities. Existing black-box MIAs necessitate an impractical number of queries, incurring significant overhead. Therefore, we analyze the limitations of existing MIAs and introduce Surrogate Model-based Inversion with Long-tailed Enhancement (SMILE), a high-resolution oriented and query-efficient MIA for the black-box setting. We begin by analyzing the initialization of MIAs from a data distribution perspective and propose a long-tailed surrogate training method to obtain high-quality initial points. We then enhance the attackâ€™s effectiveness by employing the gradient-free black-box optimization algorithm selected by NGOpt. Our experiments show that SMILE outperforms existing state-of-the-art black-box MIAs while requiring only about 5% of the query overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/L1ziang/SMILE.
