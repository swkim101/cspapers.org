Recent large-scale text-to-image diffusion models generate photorealistic images but often struggle to accurately depict interactions between humans and objects due to their limited ability to differentiate various interaction words. In this work, we propose VerbDiff to address the challenge of capturing nuanced interactions within text-to-image diffusion models. VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches.
