Precise Event Spotting (PES) aims to identify events and their class from long, untrimmed videos, particularly in sports. The main objective of PES is to detect the event at the exact moment it occurs. Existing methods mainly rely on features from a large pre-trained network, which may not be ideal for the task. Furthermore, these methods overlook the issue of imbalanced event class distribution present in the data, negatively impacting performance in challenging scenarios. This paper demonstrates that an appropriately designed network, trained end-to-end, can outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Particularly, we propose a network with a convolutional spatial-temporal feature extractor enhanced with our proposed Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Refinement Module (ASTRM) and a long-range temporal module. The ASTRM enhances the features with spatio-temporal information. Meanwhile, the long-range temporal module helps extract global context from the data by modeling long-range dependencies. To address the class imbalance issue, we introduce the Soft Instance Contrastive (Soft-Ic) loss that promotes feature compactness and class separation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms the SOTA methods, specifically in more challenging settings.
