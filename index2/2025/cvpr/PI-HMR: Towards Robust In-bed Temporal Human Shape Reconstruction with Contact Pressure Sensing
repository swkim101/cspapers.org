Long-term in-bed monitoring benefits automatic and real-time health management within healthcare, and the advancement of human shape reconstruction technologies further enhances the representation and visualization of usersâ€™ activity patterns. However, existing technologies are primarily based on visual cues, facing serious challenges in non-light-of-sight and privacy-sensitive in-bed scenes. Pressure-sensing bedsheets offer a promising solution for real-time motion reconstruction. Yet, limited exploration in model designs and data have hindered its further development. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework that bridges gaps in data annotation and model design. Firstly, we introduce SMPLify-IB, an optimization method that overcomes the depth ambiguity issue in top-view scenarios through gravity constraints, enabling generating high-quality 3D human shape annotations for in-bed datasets. Then we present PI-HMR, a temporal-based human shape estimator to regress meshes from pressure sequences. By integrating multi-scale feature fusion with high-pressure distribution and spatial position priors, PIHMR outperforms SOTA methods with 17.01mm Mean-Per-Joint-Error decrease. This work provides a whole tool-chain to support the development of in-bed monitoring with pressure contact sensing.
