Active learning (AL) is a label-efficient machine learning paradigm that focuses on selectively annotating high-value instances to maximize learning efficiency. Its effectiveness can be further enhanced by incorporating weak supervision, which uses rough yet cost-effective annotations instead of exact (i.e., full) but expensive annotations. We introduce a novel AL framework, Instance-wise Supervision-Level Optimization (ISO), which not only selects the instances to annotate but also determines their optimal annotation level within a fixed annotation budget. Its optimization criterion leverages the value-to-cost ratio (VCR) of each instance while ensuring diversity among the selected instances. In classification experiments, ISO consistently outperforms traditional AL methods and surpasses a state-of-the-art AL approach that combines full and weak supervision, achieving higher accuracy at a lower overall cost.
