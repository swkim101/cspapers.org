Neural 3D representations, such as Neural Radiation Fields (NeRF), excel at producing photorealistic rendering results but lack the flexibility for manipulation and editing which is crucial for content creation. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of 3DGS manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering. In addition, our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments demonstrate our methodâ€™s effectiveness and superiority over baseline approaches.
