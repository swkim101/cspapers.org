We propose GO-N3RDet, a scene-geometry optimized multi-view 3D object detector enhanced by neural radiance fields. The key to accurate 3D object detection is in effective voxel representation. However, due to occlusion and lack of 3D information, constructing 3D features from multi-view 2D images is challenging. Addressing that, we introduce a unique 3D positional information embedded voxel optimization mechanism to fuse multi-view features. To prioritize neural field reconstruction in object regions, we also devise a double importance sampling scheme for the NeRF branch of our detector. We additionally propose an opacity optimization module for precise voxel opacity prediction by enforcing multi-view consistency constraints. Moreover, to further improve voxel density consistency across multiple perspectives, we incorporate ray distance as a weighting factor to minimize cumulative ray errors. Our unique modules synergetically form an end-to-end neural model that establishes new state-of-the-art in NeRF-based multi-view 3D detection, verified with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKITScenes.
