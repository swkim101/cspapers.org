The distributed nature of training makes Federated Learning (FL) vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious model updates aim to compromise the global modelâ€™s performance on specific tasks. Existing defense methods show limited efficacy as they overlook the inconsistency between benign and malicious model updates regarding both general and fine-grained directions. To fill this gap, we introduce AlignIns, a novel defense method designed to safeguard FL systems against backdoor attacks. AlignIns looks into the direction of each model update through a direction alignment inspection process. Specifically, it examines the alignment of model updates with the overall update direction and analyzes the distribution of the signs of their significant parameters, comparing them with the principle sign across all model updates. Model updates that exhibit an unusual degree of alignment are considered malicious and thus be filtered out. We provide the theoretical analysis of the robustness of AlignIns and its propagation error in FL. Our empirical results on both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets demonstrate that AlignIns achieves higher robustness compared to the state-of-the-art defense methods.
