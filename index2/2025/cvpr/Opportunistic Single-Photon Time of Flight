Scattered light from pulsed lasers is increasingly part of our ambient illumination, as many devices rely on them for active 3D sensing. In this work, we ask: can these “ambient” light signals be detected and leveraged for passive 3D vision? We show that pulsed lasers, despite being weak and fluctuating at MHz to GHz frequencies, leave a distinctive sinc comb pattern in the temporal frequency domain of incident flux that is specific to each laser and invariant to the scene. This enables their passive detection and analysis with a free-running SPAD camera, even when they are unknown, asynchronous, out of sight, and emitting concurrently. We show how to synchronize with such lasers computationally, characterize their pulse emissions, separate their contributions, and—if many are present—localize them in 3D and recover a depth map of the camera’s field of view. We use our camera prototype to demonstrate (1) a first-of-its-kind visualization of asynchronously propagating light pulses from multiple lasers through the same scene, (2) passive estimation of a laser’s MHz-scale pulse repetition frequency with mHz precision, and (3) mm-scale 3D imaging over room-scale distances by passively harvesting photons from two or more out-of-view lasers.
