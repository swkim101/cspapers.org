Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to exploit complementary information from diverse views to enhance clustering performance. Since pseudo-labels can provide additional semantic information, many MVC methods have been proposed to guide unsupervised multi-view learning through pseudo-labels. These methods implicitly assume that the predicted pseudo-labels are predicted correctly. However, due to the challenges in training a flawless unsupervised model, this assumption can be easily violated, thereby leading to the Noisy Pseudo-label Problem (NPP). Moreover, these existing approaches typically rely on the assumption of perfect cross-view alignment. In practice, it is frequently compromised due to noise or sensor differences, thereby resulting in the Noisy Correspondence Problem (NCP). Based on the above observations, we reveal and study unsupervised multi-view learning under NPP and NCP. To this end, we propose Robust Noisy Pseudo-label Learning (ROLL) to prevent the overfitting problem caused by both NPP and NCP. Specifically, we first adopt traditional contrastive learning to warm up the model, thereby generating the pseudo-labels in a self-supervised manner. Afterward, we propose noise-tolerance pseudo-label learning to deal with the noise in the predicted pseudo-labels, thereby embracing the robustness against NPP. To further mitigate the overfitting problem, we present robust multi-view contrastive learning to mitigate the negative impact of NCP. Extensive experiments on five multi-view datasets demonstrate the superior clustering performance of our ROLL compared to 11 state-of-the-art methods.
