Visual artifacts remain a persistent challenge in diffusion models, even with training on massive datasets. Current solutions primarily rely on supervised detectors, yet lack understanding of why these artifacts occur in the first place. In our analysis, we identify three distinct phases in the diffusion generative process: Profiling, Mutation, and Refinement. Artifacts typically emerge during the Mutation phase, where certain regions exhibit anomalous score dynamics over time, causing abrupt disruptions in the normal evolution pattern. This temporal nature explains why existing methods focusing only on spatial uncertainty of the final output fail at effective artifact localization. Based on these insights, we propose ASCED (Abnormal Score Correction for Enhancing Diffusion), that detects artifacts by monitoring abnormal score dynamics during the diffusion process, with a trajectory-aware on-the-fly mitigation strategy that appropriate generation of noise in the detected areas. Unlike most existing methods that apply post hoc corrections, e.g., by applying a noising-denoising scheme after generation, our mitigation strategy operates seamlessly within the existing diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces artifacts across diverse domains, matching or surpassing existing supervised methods without additional training.
