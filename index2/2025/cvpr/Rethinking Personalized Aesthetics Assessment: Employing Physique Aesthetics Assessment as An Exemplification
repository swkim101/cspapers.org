The Personalized Aesthetics Assessment (PAA) aims to accurately predict an individual’s unique perception of aesthetics. With the surging demand for customization, PAA enables applications to generate personalized outcomes by aligning with individual aesthetic preferences. The prevailing PAA paradigm involves two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning, but it faces three inherent challenges: 1) The model is pre-trained using datasets of the Generic Aesthetics Assessment (GAA), but the collective preferences of GAA lead to conflicts in individualized aesthetic predictions. 2) The scope and stage of personalized surveys are related to both the user and the assessed object; however, the prevailing personalized surveys fail to adequately address assessed objects’ characteristics. 3) During application usage, the cumulative multimodal feedback from an individual holds great value that should be considered for improving the PAA model but unfortunately attracts insufficient attention. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a new PAA paradigm called PAA+, which is structured into three distinct stages: pre-training, fine-tuning, and continual learning. Furthermore, to better reflect individual differences, we employ a familiar and intuitive application, physique aesthetics assessment (PhysiqueAA), to validate the PAA+ paradigm. We propose a dataset called PhysiqueAA50K, consisting of over 50,000 annotated physique images. Furthermore, we develop a PhysiqueAA framework (PhysiqueFrame) and conduct a large-scale benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our research is expected to provide an innovative roadmap and application for the PAA community. The code and dataset are available in here.
