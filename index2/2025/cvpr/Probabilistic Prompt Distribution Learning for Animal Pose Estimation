Multi-species animal pose estimation has emerged as a challenging yet critical task, hindered by substantial visual diversity and uncertainty. This paper challenges the problem by efficient prompt learning for Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, e.g. CLIP, aiming to resolve the cross-species generalization problem. At the core of the solution lies in the prompt designing, probabilistic prompt modeling and cross-modal adaptation, thereby enabling prompts to compensate for cross-modal information and effectively overcome large data variances under unbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic prompting approach to fully explore textual descriptions, which could alleviate the diversity issues caused by long-tail property and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen category instance. Specifically, we first introduce a set of learnable prompts and propose a diversity loss to maintain distinctiveness among prompts, thus representing diverse image attributes. Diverse textual probabilistic representations are sampled and used as the guidance for the pose estimation. Subsequently, we explore three different cross-modal fusion strategies at spatial level to alleviate the adverse impacts of visual uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multi-species animal pose benchmarks show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance under both supervised and zero-shot settings.
