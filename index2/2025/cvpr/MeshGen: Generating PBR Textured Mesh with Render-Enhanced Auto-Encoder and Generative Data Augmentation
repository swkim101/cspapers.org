In this paper, we introduce MeshGen, an advanced image-to-3D pipeline that generates high-quality 3D meshes with detailed geometry and physically based rendering (PBR) textures. Addressing the challenges faced by existing 3D native diffusion models, such as suboptimal auto-encoder performance, limited controllability, poor generalization, and inconsistent image-based PBR texturing, Mesh-Gen employs several key innovations to overcome these limitations. We pioneer a render-enhanced point-to-shape auto-encoder that compresses meshes into a compact latent space by designing perceptual optimization with ray-based regularization. This ensures that the 3D shapes are accurately represented and reconstructed to preserve geometric details within the latent space. To address data scarcity and image-shape misalignment, we further propose geometric augmentation and generative rendering augmentation techniques, which enhance the modelâ€™s controllability and gen-eralization ability, allowing it to perform well even with limited public datasets. For the texture generation, Mesh-Gen employs a reference attention-based multi-view Con-trolNet for consistent appearance synthesis. This is further complemented by our multi-view PBR decomposer that estimates PBR components and a UV inpainter that fills invisible areas, ensuring a seamless and consistent texture across the 3D mesh. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshGen largely outperforms previous methods in both shape and texture generation, setting a new standard for the quality of 3D meshes generated with PBR textures.
