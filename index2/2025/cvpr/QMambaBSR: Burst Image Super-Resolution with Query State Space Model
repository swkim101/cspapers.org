Burst super-resolution (BurstSR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images by fusing subpixel details from multiple low-resolution burst frames. The primary challenge lies in effectively extracting useful information while mitigating the impact of high-frequency noise. Most existing methods rely on frame-by-frame fusion, which often struggles to distinguish informative subpixels from noise, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Query Mamba Burst Super-Resolution (QMambaBSR) network. Specifically, we observe that sub-pixels have consistent spatial distribution while noise appears randomly. Considering the entire burst sequence during fusion allows for more reliable extraction of consistent subpixels and better suppression of noise outliers. Based on this, a Query State Space Model (QSSM) is proposed for both inter-frame querying and intra-frame scanning, enabling a more efficient fusion of useful subpixels. Additionally, to overcome the limitations of static upsampling methods that often result in over-smoothing, we propose an Adaptive Upsampling (AdaUp) module that dynamically adjusts the upsampling kernel to suit the characteristics of different burst scenes, achieving superior detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets—spanning both synthetic and real-world images—demonstrate that QMambaBSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
