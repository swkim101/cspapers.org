High-dynamic scene optical flow is a challenging task, which suffers spatial blur and temporal discontinuous motion due to large displacement in frame imaging, thus deteriorating the spatiotemporal feature of optical flow. Typically, existing methods mainly introduce event camera to directly fuse the spatiotemporal features between the two modalities. However, this direct fusion is ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to the heterogeneous data representation between frame and event modalities. To address this issue, we explore a common-latent space as an intermediate bridge to mitigate the modality gap. In this work, we propose a novel common spatiotemporal fusion between frame and event modalities for high-dynamic scene optical flow, including visual boundary localization and motion correlation fusion. Specifically, in visual boundary localization, we figure out that frame and event share the similar spatiotemporal gradients, whose similarity distribution is consistent with the extracted boundary distribution. This motivates us to design the common spatiotemporal gradient to constrain the reference boundary localization. In motion correlation fusion, we discover that the frame-based motion possesses spatially dense but temporally discontinuous correlation, while the event-based motion has spatially sparse but temporally continuous correlation. This inspires us to use the reference boundary to guide the complementary motion knowledge fusion between the two modalities. Moreover, common spatiotemporal fusion can not only relieve the cross-modal feature discrepancy, but also make the fusion process interpretable for dense and continuous optical flow. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.
