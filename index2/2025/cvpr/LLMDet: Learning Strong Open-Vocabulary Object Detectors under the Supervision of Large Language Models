Recent open-vocabulary detectors achieve promising performance with abundant region-level annotated data. In this work, we show that an open-vocabulary detector co-training with a large language model by generating image-level detailed captions for each image can further improve performance. To achieve the goal, we first collect a dataset, GroundingCap-1M, wherein each image is accompanied by associated grounding labels and an image-level detailed caption. With this dataset, we finetune an open-vocabulary detector with training objectives including a standard grounding loss and a caption generation loss. We take advantage of a large language model to generate both region-level short captions for each region of interest and image-level long captions for the whole image. Under the supervision of the large language model, the resulting detector, LLMDet, outperforms the baseline by a clear margin, enjoying superior open-vocabulary ability. Further, we show that the improved LLMDet can in turn build a stronger large multi-modal model, achieving mutual benefits.
