Semantic segmentation in urban scene analysis has mainly focused on images or point clouds, while textured meshes—offering richer spatial representation—remain underexplored. This paper introduces SUM Parts, the first large-scale dataset for urban textured meshes with part-level semantic labels, covering about 2.5 km2 with 21 classes. The dataset was created using our own annotation tool, which supports both face- and texture-based annotations with efficient interactive selection. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation of 3D semantic segmentation and interactive annotation methods on this dataset. Our project page is available at https://tudelft3d.github.io/SUMParts/.
