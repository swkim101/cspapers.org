Human image generation is a key focus in image synthesis due to its broad applications, but even slight inaccuracies in anatomy, pose, or details can compromise realism. To address these challenges, we explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains models to generate preferred (winning) images while diverging from non-preferred (losing) ones. However, conventional DPO methods use generated images as winning images, limiting realism. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced DPO approach that incorporates high-quality real images as winning images, encouraging outputs to resemble real images rather than generated ones. However, implementing this concept is not a trivial task. Therefore, our approach, HG-DPO (Human image Generation through DPO), employs a novel curriculum learning framework that gradually improves the output of the model toward greater realism, making training more feasible. Furthermore, HG-DPO effectively adapts to personalized text-to-image tasks, generating high-quality and identity-specific images, which highlights the practical value of our approach.
