While deep neural networks have revolutionized image de-noising capabilities, their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to substantial computational and memory requirements. To this end, we present DnLUT, an ultra-efficient lookup table-based framework that achieves high-quality color image denoising with minimal resource consumption. Our key innovation lies in two complementary components: a Pairwise Channel Mixer (PCM) that effectively captures inter-channel correlations and spatial dependencies in parallel, and a novel L-shaped convolution design that maximizes receptive field coverage while minimizing storage overhead. By converting these components into optimized lookup tables post-training, DnLUT achieves remarkable efficiency - requiring only 500KB storage and 0.1% energy consumption compared to its CNN contestant DnCNN, while delivering 20Ã— faster inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DnLUT outperforms all existing LUT-based methods by over 1dB in PSNR, establishing a new state-of-the-art in resource-efficient color image de-noising.
