Modern vision-language models (VLMs) develop patch embedding and convolution backbone within vector space, especially Euclidean ones, at the very founding. When expanding VLMs to a galaxy scale for understanding astronomical phenomena, the integration of spherical space for planetary orbits and hyperbolic spaces for black holes raises two formidable challenges. a) The current pretraining model is confined to Euclidean space rather than a comprehensive geometric embedding. b) The predominant architecture lacks suitable backbones for anisotropic physical geometries. In this paper, we introduced Galaxy-Walker, a geometry-aware VLM, for the universe-level vision understanding tasks. We proposed the geometry prompt that generates geometry tokens by random walks across diverse spaces on a multi-scale physical graph, along with a geometry adapter that compresses and reshapes the space anisotropy in a mixture-of-experts manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with Galaxy-Walker achieving state-of-the-art performance in both galaxy property estimation (R2 scores up to 0.91 ) and morphology classification tasks (up to +0.17 F1 improvement in challenging features), significantly outperforming both domain-specific models and general-purpose VLMs.
