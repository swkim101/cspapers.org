Recent years have witnessed the great success of denoising diffusion samplers in improving the generative capability and sampling efficiency given a pre-trained diffusion model. However, most sampling schedulers in diffusion models lack the sampling dynamics and planning capability for future generation results, leading to suboptimal solutions. To overcome this, we propose the Reinforced Active Sampling Scheduler, termed RaSS, intending to find the optimal sampling trajectory by actively planning and adjusting the sampling steps for each sampling process in time. Concretely, RaSS divides the whole sampling process into five stages and introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to continuously monitor the generated instance and perceive the potential generation results, thereby achieving optimal instance-and state-adaptive sampling steps decision. Meanwhile, a sampling reward is designed to assist the planning capability of the RL agent by balancing the sampling efficiency and generation quality. The RaSS is a plug-and-play module, which is applicable to multiple denoising diffusion samplers of diffusion models. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks have shown that our RaSS can consistently improve the generation quality and efficiency across various tasks, without introducing significant computational overhead.
