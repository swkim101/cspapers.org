We present Turbo3D, an ultra-fast text-to-3D system capable of generating high-quality Gaussian splatting assets in under one second. Turbo3D employs a rapid 4-step, 4-view diffusion generator and an efficient feed-forward Gaussian reconstructor, both operating in latent space, as shown in Fig. 1. The 4-step, 4-view generator is a student model distilled through a novel Dual-Teacher approach, which encourages the student to learn view consistency from a multiview teacher and photo-realism from a single-view teacher. By shifting the Gaussian reconstructorâ€™s inputs from pixel space to latent space, we eliminate the extra image decoding time and halve the transformer sequence length for maximum efficiency. Our method demonstrates superior 3D generation results compared to previous baselines, while operating in a fraction of their runtime.
