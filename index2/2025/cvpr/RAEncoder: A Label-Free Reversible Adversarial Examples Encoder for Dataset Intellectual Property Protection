Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE) are designed to protect the intellectual property of datasets. Such examples can function as imperceptible adversarial examples to erode the model performance of unauthorized users while allowing authorized users to remove the adversarial perturbations and recover the original samples for normal model training. With the rise of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), an increasing number of unlabeled datasets and pre-trained encoders are available in the community. However, existing RAE methods not only rely on well-labeled datasets for training Supervised Learning (SL) models but also exhibit poor adversarial transferability when attacking SSL pre-trained encoders. To address these challenges, we propose RAEncoder, the first framework for RAEs without the need for labeled samples. RAEncoder aims to generate universal adversarial perturbations by targeting SSL pretrained encoders. Unlike traditional RAE approaches, the pre-trained encoder outputs the feature distribution of the protected dataset rather than classification labels, enhancing both the attack success rate and transferability of RAEs. Extensive experiments are conducted on six pre-trained encoders and four SL models, covering aspects such as imperceptibility and transferability. Our results demonstrate that RAEncoder effectively protects unlabeled datasets from malicious infringements. Additional robustness experiments further confirm the security of RAEncoder in practical application scenarios.
