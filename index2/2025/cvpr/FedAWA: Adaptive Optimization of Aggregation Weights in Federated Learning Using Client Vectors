Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing local data, thereby preserving privacy and enhancing security. However, data heterogeneity resulting from differences across user behav-iors, preferences, and device characteristics poses a significant challenge for federated learning. Most previous works overlook the adjustment of aggregation weights, relying solely on dataset size for weight assignment, which often leads to unstable convergence and reduced model performance. Recently, several studies have sought to refine aggregation strategies by incorporating dataset characteristics and model alignment. However, adaptively adjusting aggregation weights while ensuring data security—without requiring additional proxy data—remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Federated learning with Adaptive Weight Aggregation (FedAWA), a novel method that adaptively adjusts aggregation weights based on client vectors during the learning process. The client vector captures the direction of model updates, reflecting local data variations, and is used to optimize the aggregation weight without requiring additional datasets or violating privacy. By assigning higher aggregation weights to local models whose updates align closely with the global optimization direction, FedAWA enhances the stability and generalization of the global model. Extensive experiments under diverse scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method, providing a promising solution to the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning.
