We introduce Fish-Visual Trait Analysis (Fish-Vista), the first organismal image dataset designed for the analysis of visual traits of aquatic species directly from images using machine learning and computer vision methods. Fish-Vista contains 69,269 annotated images spanning 4,316 fish species, curated and organized to serve three downstream tasks: species classification, trait identification, and trait segmentation. Our work makes two key contributions. First, we provide a fully reproducible data processing pipeline to process fish images sourced from various museum collections, contributing to the advancement of AI in biodiversity science. We annotate the images with carefully curated labels from biological databases and manual annotations to create an AI-ready dataset of visual traits. Second, our work offers fertile grounds for researchers to develop novel methods for a variety of problems in computer vision such as handling long-tailed distributions, out-of-distribution generalization, learning with weak labels, explainable AI, and segmenting small objects.
