The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human’s daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs’ personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user’s name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts’ information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.
