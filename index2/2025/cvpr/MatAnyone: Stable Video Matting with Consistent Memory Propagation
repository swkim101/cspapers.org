Auxiliary-free human video matting methods, which rely solely on input frames, often struggle with complex or ambiguous backgrounds. To address this, we propose MatAnyone, a robust framework tailored for target-assigned video matting. Specifically, building on a memory-based paradigm, we introduce a consistent memory propagation module via region-adaptive memory fusion, which adaptively integrates memory from the previous frame. This ensures semantic stability in core regions while preserving fine-grained details along object boundaries. For robust training, we present a larger, high-quality, and diverse dataset for video matting. Additionally, we incorporate a novel training strategy that efficiently leverages large-scale segmentation data, boosting matting stability. With this new network design, dataset, and training strategy, MatAnyone delivers robust and accurate video matting results in diverse real-world scenarios, outperforming existing methods.
