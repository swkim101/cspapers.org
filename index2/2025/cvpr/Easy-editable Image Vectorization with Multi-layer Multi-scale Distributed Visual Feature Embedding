Current parameterized image representations embed visual information along the semantic boundaries and struggle to express the internal detailed texture structures of image components, leading to a lack of content consistency after image editing and driving. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel parameterized representation based on hierarchical image proxy geometry, utilizing multi-layer hierarchically interrelated proxy geometric control points to embed multi-scale long-range structures and fine-grained texture details. The proposed representation enables smoother and more continuous interpolation during image rendering and ensures high-quality consistency within image components during image editing. Additionally, under the layer-wise representation strategy based on semantic-aware image layer decomposition, we enable decoupled image shape/texture editing of the targets of interest within the image. Extensive experimental results on image vectorization and editing tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high rendering accuracy of general images, including natural images, with a significantly higher image parameter compression ratio, facilitating user-friendly editing of image semantic components.
