3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive performance in scene reconstruction, offering high rendering quality and rapid rendering speed with short training time. However, it often yields unsatisfactory results when applied to indoor scenes due to its poor ability to learn geometries without enough textural information. In this paper, we propose a new 3DGS-based method "IndoorGS", that leverages the commonly found yet important geometric cues in indoor scenes to improve the reconstruction quality. Specifically, we first extract 2D lines from input images and fuse them into 3D line cues via feature-based matching, which can provide a structural understanding of the target scene. We then apply the statistical outlier removal to refine Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points, ensuring robust cues in texture-rich areas. Based on these two types of cues, we further extract reliable 3D plane-like cues for textureless regions. Such geometric information will be utilized not only for initialization but also in the realization of a geometric-cue-guided adaptive density control (ADC) strategy. The proposed ADC approach is grounded in the principle of divide-and-conquer and optimizes the use of each type of geometric cues to enhance overall reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments on multiple indoor datasets show that our method can deliver much more accurate geometry and higher rendering quality for indoor scenes than existing 3DGS approaches.
