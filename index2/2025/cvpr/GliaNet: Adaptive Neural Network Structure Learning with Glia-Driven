Neural networks derived from the M-P model have excelled in various visual tasks. However, as a simplified simulation version of the brain neural pathway, their structures are locked during training, causing over-fitting and over-parameterization. Although recent models have begun using the biomimetic concept and empirical pruning, they still result in irrational pruning, potentially affecting the accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce the Glia unit, composed of oligodendrocytes (Oli) and astrocytes (Ast), to emulate the exact workflow of the mammalian brain, thereby enhancing the biological plausibility of neural functions. Oli selects neurons involved in signal transmission during neural communication and, together with Ast, adaptively optimizes the neural structure. Specifically, we first construct the artificial Glia-Neuron (G-N) model, which is formulated at the instance, group, and interaction levels with adaptive and collaborative mechanisms. Then, we construct GliaNet based on our G-N model, whose structure and connections can be continuously optimized during training. Experiments show that our GliaNet advances state-of-the-art on multiple tasks while significantly reducing its parameters.
