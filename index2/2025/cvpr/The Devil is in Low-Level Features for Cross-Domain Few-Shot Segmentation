Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CDFSS) is proposed to transfer the pixel-level segmentation capabilities learned from large-scale source-domain datasets to downstream target-domain datasets, with only a few annotated images per class. In this paper, we focus on a well-observed but under-explored phenomenon in CDFSS: for target domains, particularly those distant from the source domain, segmentation performance peaks at the very early epochs, and declines sharply as the source-domain training proceeds. We delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation: low-level features are vulnerable to domain shifts, leading to sharper loss landscapes during the source-domain training, which is the devil of CDFSS. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a method that includes two plug-and-play modules: one to flatten the loss landscapes for low-level features during source-domain training as a novel sharpness-aware minimization method, and the other to directly supplement target-domain information to the model during target-domain testing by low-level-based calibration. Extensive experiments on four target datasets validate our rationale and demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CDFSS signifcantly by 3.71% and 5.34% average MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.
