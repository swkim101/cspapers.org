Recent contrastive multimodal vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated robust open-world semantic understanding, becoming the standard image backbones for vision-language applications. However, recent findings suggest high semantic similarity between well-trained unimodal encoders, which raises a key question: Is there a plausible way to connect unimodal backbones for vision-language tasks? To this end, we propose a novel framework that aligns vision and language using frozen unimodal encoders. It involves selecting semantically similar encoders in the latent space, curating a concept-rich dataset of image-caption pairs, and training simple MLP projectors. We evaluated our approach on 12 zero-shot classification datasets and 2 image-text retrieval datasets. Our best model, utilizing DINOv2 and All-Roberta-Large text encoder, achieves 76% accuracy on ImageNet with a 20-fold reduction in data and 65-fold reduction in compute requirements compared multi-modal alignment where models are trained from scratch. The proposed framework enhances the accessibility of multimodal model development while enabling flexible adaptation across diverse scenarios.
