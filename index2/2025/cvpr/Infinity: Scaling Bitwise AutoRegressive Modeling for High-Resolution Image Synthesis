We present Infinity, a Bitwise Visual AutoRegressive Modeling capable of generating high-resolution, photorealistic images following language instruction. Infinity refactors visual autoregressive model under a bitwise token prediction framework with an infinite-vocabulary classifier and bit-wise self-correction mechanism. By theoretically expanding the tokenizer vocabulary size to infinity in Transformer, our method significantly unleashes powerful scaling capabilities to infinity compared to vanilla VAR. Extensive experiments indicate Infinity outperforms AutoRegressive Text-to-Image models by large margins, matches or surpasses leading diffusion models. Without extra optimization, Infinity generates a 1024×1024 image in 0.8s, 2.6× faster than SD3-Medium, making it the fastest Text-to-Image model. All the code and models are available to promote further exploration of Infinity for visual generation.
