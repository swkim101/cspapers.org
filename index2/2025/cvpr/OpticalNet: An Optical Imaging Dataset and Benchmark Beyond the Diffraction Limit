Optical imaging capable of resolving nanoscale features would revolutionize scientific research and engineering applications across biomedicine, smart manufacturing, and semiconductor quality control. However, due to the physical phenomenon of diffraction, the optical resolution is limited to approximately half the wavelength of light, which impedes the observation of subwavelength objects such as the native state coronavirus, typically smaller than 200 nm. Fortunately, deep learning methods have shown remarkable potential in uncovering underlying patterns within data, promising to overcome the diffraction limit by revealing the mapping pattern between diffraction images and their corresponding ground truth object images. However, the absence of suitable datasets has hindered progress in this field–collecting high-quality optical data of subwavelength objects is highly difficult as these objects are inherently invisible under conventional microscopy, making it impossible to perform standard visual calibration and drift correction. Therefore, we provide the first general optical imaging dataset based on the "building block" concept for challenging the diffraction limit. Drawing an analogy to modular construction principles, we construct a comprehensive optical imaging dataset comprising subwavelength fundamental elements, i.e., small square units that can be assembled into larger and more complex objects. We then frame the task as an image-to-image translation task and evaluate various vision methods. Experimental results validate our "building block" concept, demonstrating that models trained on basic square units can effectively generalize to realistic, more complex unseen objects. Most importantly, by highlighting this underexplored AI-for-science area and its potential, we aspire to advance optical science by fostering collaboration with the vision and machine learning communities.
