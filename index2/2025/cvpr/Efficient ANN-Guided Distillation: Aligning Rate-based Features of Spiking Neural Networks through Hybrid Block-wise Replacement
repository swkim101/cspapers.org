Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as a potential alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Recent studies have highlighted SNNsâ€™ potential on large-scale datasets. For SNN training, two main approaches exist: direct training and ANN-to-SNN (ANN2SNN) conversion. To fully leverage existing ANN models in guiding SNN learning, either direct ANN-to-SNN conversion or ANN-SNN distillation training can be employed. In this paper, we propose an ANN-SNN distillation framework from the ANN-to-SNN perspective, designed with a block-wise replacement strategy for ANN-guided learning. By generating intermediate hybrid models that progressively align SNN feature spaces to those of ANN through rate-based features, our framework naturally incorporates rate-based backpropagation as a training method. Our approach achieves results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art SNN distillation methods, showing both training and learning efficiency.
