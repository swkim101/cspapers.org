Problems in differentiable rendering often involve optimizing scene parameters that cause motion in image space. The gradients for such parameters tend to be sparse, leading to poor convergence. While existing methods address this sparsity through proxy gradients such as topological derivatives or lagrangian derivatives, they make simplifying assumptions about rendering. Multi-resolution image pyramids offer an alternative approach but prove unreliable in practice. We introduce a method that uses locally orderless images â€” where each pixel maps to a histogram of intensities that preserves local variations in appearance. Using an inverse rendering objective that minimizes histogram distance, our method extends support for sparsely defined image gradients and recovers optimal parameters. We validate our method on various inverse problems using both synthetic and real data.
