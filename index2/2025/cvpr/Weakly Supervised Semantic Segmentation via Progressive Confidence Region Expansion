Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has garnered considerable attention due to its effective reduction of annotation costs. Most approaches utilize Class Activation Maps (CAM) to produce pseudo-labels, thereby localizing target regions using only image-level annotations. However, the prevalent methods relying on vision transformers (ViT) encounter an "over-expansion" issue, i.e., CAM incorrectly expands high activation value from the target object to the background regions, as it is difficult to learn pixel-level local intrinsic inductive bias in ViT from weak supervisions. To solve this problem, we propose a Progressive Confidence Region Expansion (PCRE) framework for WSSS, it gradually learns a faithful mask over the target region and utilizes this mask to correct the confusion in CAM. PCRE has two key components: Confidence Region Mask Expansion (CRME) and Class-Prototype Enhancement (CPE). CRME progressively expands the mask in the small region with the highest confidence, eventually encompassing the entire target, thereby avoiding unintended coverage of background areas. CPE aims to enhance mask generation in CRME by leveraging the similarity between the learned, dataset-level class prototypes and patch features as supervision to optimize the mask output from CRME. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing single-stage and multi-stage approaches on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmark.
