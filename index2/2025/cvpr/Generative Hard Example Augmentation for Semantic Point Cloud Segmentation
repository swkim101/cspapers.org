The recent progress in semantic point cloud segmentation is attributed to deep networks, which require a large amount of point cloud data for training. However, how to collect substantial point-wise annotations of the point clouds at affordable cost for the end-to-end network training still needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose Generative Hard Example Augmentation (GHEA) to achieve novel examples of point clouds, which enrich the data for training the segmentation network. Firstly, GHEA employs the generative network to embed the discrepancy between the point clouds into the latent space. From the latent space, we sample multiple discrepancies for reshaping a point cloud to various examples, contributing to the richness of the training data. Secondly, GHEA mixes the reshaped point clouds by respecting their segmentation errors. This mixup allows the reshaped point clouds, which are difficult to segment, to join as the challenging example for network training. We evaluate the effectiveness of GHEA, which helps the popular segmentation networks to improve the performances.
