Current structural pruning methods face two significant limitations: (i) they often limit pruning to finer-grained levels like channels, making aggressive parameter reduction challenging, and (ii) they focus heavily on parameter and FLOP reduction, with existing latency-aware methods frequently relying on simplistic, suboptimal linear models that fail to generalize well to transformers, where multiple interacting dimensions impact latency. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing Multi-Dimensional Pruning(MDP), a novel paradigm that jointly optimizes across a variety of pruning granularitiesâ€”including channels, query/key, heads, embeddings, and blocks. MDP employs an advanced latency modeling technique to accurately capture latency variations across all prunable dimensions, achieving an optimal balance between latency and accuracy. By reformulating pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), MDP efficiently identifies the optimal pruned structure across all prunable dimensions while respecting latency constraints. This versatile framework supports both CNNs and transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDP significantly outperforms previous methods, especially at high pruning ratios. On ImageNet, MDP achieves a 28% speed increase with a +1.4 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior work like HALP for ResNet50 pruning. Against the latest transformer pruning method, Isomorphic, MDP delivers an additional 37% acceleration with a +0.7 Top-1 accuracy improvement.
