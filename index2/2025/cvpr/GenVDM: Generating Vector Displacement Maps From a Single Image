We introduce the first method for generating Vector Displacement Maps (VDMs): parameterized, detailed geometric stamps commonly used in 3D modeling. Given a single input image, our method first generates multi-view normal maps and then reconstructs a VDM from the normals via a novel reconstruction pipeline. We also propose an efficient algorithm for extracting VDMs from 3D objects, and present the first academic VDM dataset. Compared to existing 3D generative models focusing on complete shapes, we focus on generating parts that can be seamlessly attached to shape surfaces. The method gives artists rich control over adding geometric details to a 3D shape. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines. Generating VDMs offers additional benefits, such as using 2D image editing to customize and refine 3D details. Code and data are available at https://yyuezhi.github.io/GenVDM/.
