Since 2023, Vector Quantization (VQ)-based discrete generation methods have rapidly dominated human motion generation, primarily surpassing diffusion-based continuous generation methods in standard performance metrics. However, VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion data as limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces the diversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to function effectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, the continuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes them well-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for model scalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-based methods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution. Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of a diffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it with inspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motion diffusion model enabled to perform masked autoregression, optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution. Additionally, we propose a more robust evaluation method to assess different approaches. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.
