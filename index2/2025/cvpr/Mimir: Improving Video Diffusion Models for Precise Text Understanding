Text serves as the key control signal in video generation due to its narrative nature. To render text descriptions into video clips, current video diffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited text comprehension. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) showcases the power of decoder-only transformers, which offers three clear benefits for text-to-video (T2V) generation, namely, precise text understanding resulting from the superior scalability, imagination beyond the input text enabled by next token prediction, and flexibility to prioritize user interests through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, the feature distribution gap emerging from the two different text modeling paradigms hinders the direct use of LLMs in established T2V models. This work addresses this challenge with Mimir, an end-to-end training framework featuring a carefully tailored token fuser to harmonize the outputs from text encoders and LLMs. Such a design allows the T2V model to fully leverage learned video priors while capitalizing on the text-related capability of LLMs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mimir in generating high-quality videos with excellent text comprehension, especially when processing short captions and managing shifting motions.
