While virtual try-on for clothes and shoes with diffusion models has gained attraction, virtual try-on for ornaments, such as bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, remains largely unexplored. Due to the intricate tiny patterns and repeated geometric sub-structures in most ornaments, it is much more difficult to guarantee identity and appearance consistency under large pose and scale variances between ornaments and models. This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects.
