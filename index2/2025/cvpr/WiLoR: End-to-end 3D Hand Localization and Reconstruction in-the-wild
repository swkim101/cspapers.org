In recent years, 3D hand pose estimation methods have garnered significant attention due to their extensive applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and robotics. In contrast, there has been a notable gap in hand detection pipelines, posing significant challenges in constructing effective real-world multi-hand reconstruction systems. In this work, we present a data-driven pipeline for efficient multi-hand reconstruction in the wild. The proposed pipeline is composed of two components: a real-time fully convolutional hand localization and a high-fidelity transformer-based 3D hand reconstruction model. To tackle the limitations of previous methods and build a robust and stable detection network, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over than 2M in-the-wild hand images with diverse lighting, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Our approach outperforms previous methods in both efficiency and accuracy on popular 2D and 3D benchmarks. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline to achieve smooth 3D hand tracking from monocular videos, without utilizing any temporal components.
