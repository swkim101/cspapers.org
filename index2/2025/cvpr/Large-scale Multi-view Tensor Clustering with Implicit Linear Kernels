Multi-view clustering is a long-standing hot topic in machine learning communities, due to its capability of integrating data information from multiple sources and modalities. By utilizing tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) technique with the tensor rotation trick, recent advances have achieved remarkable improvements on clustering performance. However, we find this is attributed to the inadvertent use of sequential information of sorted data samples, i.e. inadvertent label use, which violates the unsupervised learning setting. On the other hand, existing large-scale approaches are mostly developed on the basis of matrix factorization or anchor techniques, thereby fail to consider the similarities among all data samples, preventing from further performance improvement. To address the above issues, we first analyze the tensor rotation trick and recommend to remove it from tensor clustering. On its basis, a novel large-scale multi-view tensor clustering method is developed by incorporating the pair-wise similarities with implicit linear kernel function. To solve the resultant optimization problem, we design an efficient algorithm of linear complexity. Moreover, extensive experiments are conducted and corresponding results well support the aforementioned finding and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
