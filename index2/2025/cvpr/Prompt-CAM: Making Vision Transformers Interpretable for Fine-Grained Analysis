We present a simple approach to make pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) interpretable for fine-grained analysis, aiming to identify and localize the traits that distinguish visually similar categories, such as bird species. Pretrained ViTs, such as DINO, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in extracting localized, discriminative features. However, saliency maps like Grad-CAM often fail to identify these traits, producing blurred, coarse heatmaps that highlight entire objects instead. We propose a novel approach, Prompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM), to address this limitation. Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To correctly classify an image, the true-class prompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes’ images (i.e., traits). As a result, the true class’s multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a "free lunch," requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply, in stark contrast to other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and training processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars) validate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM.
