Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, simplifying the process of producing diverse and individual content. Current methods excel in generating short videos (up to 16s), but produce hard-cuts when naively extended to long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we present StreamingT2V, an autoregressive method that generates long videos of up to 2 minutes or longer with seamless transitions. The key components are: (i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the preceding chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a longterm memory block called appearance preservation module (APM), which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that allows for the autoregressive application of a video enhancer on videos of indefinite length, ensuring consistency across chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V produces more motion, while competing methods suffer from video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive fashion. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator, surpassing competitors in both consistency and motion.
