Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical applications, with hard samples playing a key role in segmentation accuracy. We propose an effective image segmentation framework that includes mechanisms for identifying and segmenting hard samples. It derives a novel image segmentation paradigm: 1) Learning to identify hard samples: automatically selecting inherent hard samples from different datasets, and 2) Learning to segment hard samples: achieving the segmentation of hard samples through effective feature augmentation on dedicated networks. We name our method ‘Learning to Segment hard samples’ (L2S). The hard sample identification module comprises a backbone model and a classifier, which dynamically uncovers inherent dataset patterns. The hard sample segmentation module utilizes the diffusion process for feature augmentation and incorporates a more sophisticated segmentation network to achieve precise segmentation. We justify our motivation through solid theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. Evaluations across various modalities show that our L2S outperforms other SOTA methods, particularly by substantially improving the segmentation accuracy of hard samples. On ISIC dataset, our L2S improves the Dice score on hard samples and overall segmentation by 8.97% and 1.01%, respectively, compared to SOTA methods.
