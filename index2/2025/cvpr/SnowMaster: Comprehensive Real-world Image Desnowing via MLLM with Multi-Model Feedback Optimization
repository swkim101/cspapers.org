Snowfall presents significant challenges for visual data processing, necessitating specialized desnowing algorithms. However, existing models often fail to generalize effectively due to their heavy reliance on synthetic datasets. Furthermore, current real-world snowfall datasets are limited in scale and lack dedicated evaluation metrics designed specifically for snowfall degradation, thus hindering the effective integration of real snowy images into model training to reduce domain gaps. To address these challenges, we first introduce RealSnow10K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset consisting of over 10,000 annotated real-world snowy images. In addition, we curate a preference dataset comprising 36,000 expert-ranked image pairs, enabling the adaptation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to better perceive snowy image quality through our innovative Multi-Model Preference Optimization (MMPO). Finally, we propose the SnowMaster, which employs MMPO-enhanced MLLM to perform accurate snowy image evaluation and pseudo-label filtering for semi-supervised training. Experiments demonstrate that SnowMaster delivers superior desnowing performance under real-world conditions.
