Driven by the great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the 2D image domain, their application in 3D scene understanding has emerged as a new trend. A key difference between 3D and 2D is that the situation of an egocentric observer in 3D scenes can change, resulting in different descriptions (e.g., "left" or "right"). However, current LLM-based methods overlook the egocentric perspective and use datasets from a global viewpoint. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate a situation-aware dataset by leveraging the scanning trajectory during data collection and utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce high-quality captions and question-answer pairs. Furthermore, we introduce a situation grounding module to explicitly predict the position and orientation of the observerâ€™s viewpoint, thereby enabling LLMs to ground situation descriptions in 3D scenes. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, demonstrating that our method effectively enhances the 3D situational awareness of LLMs while significantly expanding existing datasets and reducing manual effort.
