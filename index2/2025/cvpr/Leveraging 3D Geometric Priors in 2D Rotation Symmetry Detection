Symmetry plays a vital role in understanding structural patterns, aiding object recognition and scene interpretation. This paper focuses on rotation symmetry, where objects remain unchanged when rotated around a central axis, requiring detection of rotation centers and supporting vertices. Traditional methods relied on hand-crafted feature matching, while recent segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) detect rotation centers but struggle with 3D geometric consistency due to viewpoint distortions. To overcome this, we propose a model that directly predicts rotation centers and vertices in 3D space and projects the results back to 2D while preserving structural integrity. By incorporating a vertex reconstruction stage enforcing 3D geometric priors—such as equal side lengths and interior angles—our model enhances robustness and accuracy. Experiments on the DENDI dataset show superior performance in rotation axis detection and validate the impact of 3D priors through ablation studies.
