Diffusion models achieved unprecedented fidelity and diversity for synthesizing image, video, 3D assets, etc. However, subject mixing is an unresolved issue for diffusion-based image synthesis, particularly for synthesizing multiple similar-looking subjects. We propose Self-Cross Diffusion Guidance to penalize the overlap between cross-attention maps and the aggregated self-attention map. Compared to previous methods based on self-attention or cross-attention alone, our guidance is more effective in eliminating subject mixing. Whatâ€™s more, our guidance addresses subject mixing for all relevant patches beyond the most discriminant one, e.g., the beak of a bird. For each subject, we aggregate self-attention maps of patches with higher cross-attention values. Thus, the aggregated self-attention map forms a region that the whole subject attends to. Our training-free method boosts the performance of both Unet-based and Transformer-based diffusion models such as the Stable Diffusion series. We also release a similar subjects dataset (SSD), a challenging benchmark, and utilize GPT-4o for automatic and reliable evaluation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-cross diffusion guidance.
