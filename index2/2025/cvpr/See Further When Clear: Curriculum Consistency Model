Significant advances have been made in the sampling efficiency of diffusion and flow matching models, driven by Consistency Distillation (CD), which trains a student model to mimic the output of a teacher model at a later timestep. However, we found that the knowledge discrepancy between student and teacher varies significantly across different timesteps, leading to suboptimal performance in CD. To address this issue, we propose the Curriculum Consistency Model (CCM), which stabilizes and balances the knowledge discrepancy across timesteps. Specifically, we regard the distillation process at each timestep as a curriculum and introduce a metric based on the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to quantify the knowledge discrepancy of this curriculum, then ensure that the curriculum maintains consistent knowledge discrepancy across different timesteps by having the teacher model iterate more steps when the noise intensity is low. Our method achieves competitive single-step sampling Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 1.64 on CIFAR-10 and 2.18 on ImageNet 64x64. Moreover, we have extended our method to large-scale text-to-image models and confirmed that it generalizes well to both diffusion models (Stable Diffusion XL) and flow matching models (Stable Diffusion 3). The generated samples demonstrate improved image-text alignment and semantic structure since CCM enlarges the distillation step at large timesteps and reduces the accumulated error.
