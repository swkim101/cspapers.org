3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream for novel view synthesis, leveraging continuous aggregations of Gaussian functions to model scene geometry. However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the large amount of Gaussians, hindering its efficiency and practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification objective as a constrained optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution for the formulated problem, alternately solving two independent sub-problems and gradually imposing substantial sparsity onto the Gaussians in the 3DGS training process. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations on various datasets, demonstrating the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10Ã— fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.
