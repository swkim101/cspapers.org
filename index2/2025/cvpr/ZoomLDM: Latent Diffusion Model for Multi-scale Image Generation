Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, yet several challenges restrict their application to large-image domains, such as digital pathology and satellite imagery. Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on ’whole’ images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different ’zoom’ levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM synthesizes coherent histopathology images that remain contextually accurate and detailed at different zoom levels, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales and excelling in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to 4096 × 4096 pixels and 4 × super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments. 1
