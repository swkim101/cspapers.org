Ensuring adherence to traffic sign regulations is essential for both human and autonomous vehicle navigation. While current online mapping solutions often prioritize the construction of the geometric and connectivity layers of HD maps, overlooking the construction of the traffic regulation layer within HD maps. Addressing this gap, we introduce MapDR, a novel dataset designed for the extraction of Driving Rules from traffic signs and their association with vectorized, locally perceived HD Maps. MapDR features over 10,000 annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes. Built upon this benchmark and the newly defined task of integrating traffic regulations into online HD maps, we provide modular and end-to-end solutions: VLE-MEE and RuleVLM, offering a strong baseline for advancing autonomous driving technology. It fills a critical gap in the integration of traffic sign rules, contributing to the development of reliable autonomous driving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/MIV-XJTU/MapDR.
