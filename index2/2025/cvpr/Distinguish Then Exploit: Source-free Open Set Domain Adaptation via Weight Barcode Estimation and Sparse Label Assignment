Nowadays, domain adaptation techniques have been widely investigated for knowledge sharing from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. However, target domain may include some data samples that belong to unknown categories in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the target domain cannot access the source data samples due to privacy-preserving restrictions. In this paper, we focus on the source-free open set domain adaptation problem which includes two main challenges, i.e., how to distinguish known and unknown target samples and how to exploit useful source information to provide trustworthy pseudo labels for known target samples. Existing approaches that directly apply conventional domain alignment methods could lead to sample mismatch and misclassification in this scenario. To overcome these issues, we propose a Distinguish Then Exploit model (DTE) with two components, i.e., weight barcode estimation and sparse label assignment. Weight barcode estimation first calculates the marginal probability of target samples via partially unbalanced optimal transport, then quantize barcode results to distinguish unknown target samples. Sparse label assignment utilizes sparse sample-label matching via proximal term to fully exploit useful source information. Our empirically study on several datasets shows that DTE outperforms the state-of-the-art models on tackling the source-free open set domain adaptation problem.
