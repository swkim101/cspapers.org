Despite advancements in Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) generation, direct generation of complex Boundary Representation (B-rep) CAD models remains challenging. The difficulty arises from the parametric nature of B-rep data, complicating the encoding and generation of its geometric and topological information. In this paper, we introduce BrepGiff, a lightweight generation approach for high-quality and complex B-rep based on 3D Graph Diffusion. First, we transfer B-rep models into 3D graphs representation. Specifically, BrepGiff extracts and integrates topological and geometric features to construct a 3D graph where nodes correspond to face centroids in 3D space, preserving adjacency and degree information. Geometric features are derived by sampling points in the UV domain and extracting face and edge features. BrepGiff then applies Graph Attention Network (GAT) to enforce topological constraints from local to global during the degree-guided diffusion process. With the 3D graph representation and diffusion process, BrepGiff significantly reduces the computational cost and improves the quality, thus achieving lightweight generation of complex models. Experiments show that BrepGiff can generate complex B-rep models (>100 faces) using only 2 RTX4090 GPUs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in B-rep generation.
