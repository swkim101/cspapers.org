Long-term sports assessment is a challenging task in video understanding since it requires judging complex movement variations and action-music coordination. However, there is no direct correlation between the diverse background music and movements in sporting events. Previous works require a large number of model parameters to learn potential associations between actions and music. To address this issue, we propose a language-guided audio-visual learning (MLAVL) framework that models "audio-action-visual" correlations guided by low-cost language modality. In our framework, multidimensional domain-based actions form action knowledge graphs, motivating audio-visual modalities to focus on task-relevant actions. We further design a shared-specific context encoder to integrate deep multimodal semantics, and an audio-visual cross-modal fusion module to evaluate action-music consistency. To match the sport’s rules, we then propose a dual-branch prompt-guided grading module to weigh both visual and audio-visual performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on four public long-term sports benchmarks while maintaining low parameters.1
