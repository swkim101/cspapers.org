Dataset distillation has become a popular method for compressing large datasets into smaller, more efficient representations while preserving critical information for model training. Data features are broadly categorized into two types: instance-specific features, which capture unique, fine-grained details of individual examples, and class-general features, which represent shared, broad patterns across a class. However, previous approaches often struggle to balance these featuresâ€”some focus solely on class-general patterns, neglecting finer instance details, while others prioritize instance-specific features, overlooking the shared characteristics essential for class-level understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Non-Critical Region Refinement Dataset Distillation (NRR-DD) method, which preserves instance-specific details and fine-grained regions in synthetic data while enriching non-critical regions with class-general information. This approach enables models to leverage all pixel information, capturing both feature types and enhancing overall performance. Additionally, we present Distance-Based Representative (DBR) knowledge transfer, which eliminates the need for soft labels in training by relying on the distance between synthetic data predictions and one-hot encoded labels. Experimental results show that NRR-DD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both small- and large-scale datasets. Furthermore, by storing only two distances per instance, our method delivers comparable results across various settings. The code is available at https://github.com/tmtuan1307/NRR-DD.
