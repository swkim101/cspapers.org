Robotic manipulation in embodied AI critically depends on large-scale, high-quality datasets that reflect realistic object interactions and physical dynamics. However, existing data collection pipelines are often slow, expensive, and heavily reliant on manual efforts. We present DynScene, a diffusion-based framework for generating dynamic robotic manipulation scenes directly from textual instructions. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on static environments or isolated robot actions, DynScene decomposes the generation into two phases static scene synthesis and action trajectory generation allowing fine-grained control and diversity. Our model enhances realism and physical feasibility through scene refinement (layout sampling, quaternion quantization) and leverages residual action representation to enable action augmentation, generating multiple diverse trajectories from a single static configuration. Experiments show DynScene achieves 26.8× faster generation, 1.84× higher accuracy, and 28% greater action diversity than human-crafted data. Furthermore, agents trained with DynScene exhibit up to 19.4% higher success rates across complex manipulation tasks. Our approach paves the way for scalable, automated dataset generation in robot learning.
