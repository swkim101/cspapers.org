Recent real-time semantic segmentation models, whether single-branch or multi-branch, achieve good performance and speed. However, their speed is limited by multi-path blocks, and some depend on high-performance teacher models for training. To overcome these issues, we propose Golden Cudgel Network (GCNet). Specifically, GC-Net uses vertical multi-convolutions and horizontal multi-paths for training, which are reparameterized into a single convolution for inference, optimizing both performance and speed. This design allows GCNet to self-enlarge during training and self-contract during inference, effectively becoming a "teacher model" without needing external ones. Experimental results show that GCNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of performance and speed on the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets.
