Previous research on lightweight models has primarily focused on CNNs and Transformer-based designs. CNNs, with their local receptive fields, struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Transformers, despite their global modeling capabilities, are limited by quadratic computational complexity in high-resolution scenarios. Recently, state-space models have gained popularity in the visual domain due to their linear computational complexity. Despite their low FLOPs, current lightweight Mamba-based models exhibit suboptimal throughput. In this work, we propose the MobileMamba framework, which balances efficiency and performance. We design a three-stage network to enhance inference speed significantly. At a fine-grained level, we introduce the Multi-Receptive Field Feature Interaction (MRFFI) module, comprising the Long-Range Wavelet Transform-Enhanced Mamba (WTE-Mamba), Efficient Multi-Kernel Depthwise Convolution (MK-DeConv), and Eliminate Redundant Identity components. This module integrates multi-receptive field information and enhances high-frequency detail extraction. Additionally, we employ training and testing strategies to further improve performance and efficiency. MobileMamba achieves up to 83.6% on Top-1, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods which is maximum ×21↑ faster than LocalVim on GPU. Extensive experiments on high-resolution downstream tasks demonstrate that MobileMamba surpasses current efficient models, achieving an optimal balance between speed and accuracy.
