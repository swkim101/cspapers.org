Foundation models have significantly reduced the need for task-specific training, while also enhancing generaliz-ability. However, state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators either require further training with pose supervision or neglect advances obtainable from 3D foundation models. The latter is a missed opportunity, since these models are better equipped to predict 3D-consistent features, which are of significant utility for the pose estimation task. To address this gap, we propose Pos3R, a method for estimating the 6D pose of any object from a single RGB image, making extensive use of a 3D reconstruction foundation model and requiring no additional training. We identify template selection as a particular bottleneck for existing methods that is significantly alleviated by the use of a 3D model, which can more easily distinguish between template poses than a 2D model. Despite its simplicity, Pos3R achieves competitive performance on the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation (BOP), matching or surpassing existing refinement-free methods. Additionally, Pos3R integrates seamlessly with render-and-compare refinement techniques, demonstrating adaptability for high-precision applications.
