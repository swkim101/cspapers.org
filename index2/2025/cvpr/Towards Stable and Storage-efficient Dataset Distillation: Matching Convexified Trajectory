The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT creates convex combinations of expert trajectories by selecting a few expert models, guiding student networks to converge quickly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables continuous sampling strategies during the distillation process, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. The comprehensive experiment of three public datasets verified that MCT is superior to the traditional MTT method.
