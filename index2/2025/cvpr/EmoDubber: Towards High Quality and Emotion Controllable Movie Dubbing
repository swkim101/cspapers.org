Given a piece of text, a video clip, and a reference audio, the movie dubbing task aims to generate speech that aligns with the video while cloning the desired voice. The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences by efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker identity adapting module decodes acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the userâ€™s emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others. Extensive experimental results demonstrate favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The code and trained models will be made available at https://github.com/GalaxyCong/DubFlow.
