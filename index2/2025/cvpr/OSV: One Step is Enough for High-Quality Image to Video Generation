Video diffusion models have shown great potential in generating high-quality videos, making them an increasingly popular focus. However, their inherent iterative nature leads to substantial computational and time costs. Although techniques such as consistency distillation and adversarial training have been employed to accelerate video diffusion by reducing inference steps, these methods often simply transfer the generation approaches from Image diffusion models to video diffusion models. As a result, these methods frequently fall short in terms of both performance and training stability. In this work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that effectively combines consistency distillation with adversarial training to address these challenges. Additionally, we propose a novel video discriminator design, which eliminates the need for decoding the video latents and improves the final performance. Our model is capable of producing high-quality videos in merely one-step, with the flexibility to perform multi-step refinement for further performance enhancement. Our quantitative evaluation on the OpenVid-1M benchmark shows that our model significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, our 1-step performance (FVD 171.15) exceeds the 8-step performance of the consistency distillation based method, AnimateLCM (FVD 184.79), and approaches the 25-step performance of advanced Stable Video Diffusion (FVD 156.94).
