Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown their competence in handling spatial-temporal event-based data with low energy consumption. Similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are also vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks, wherein gradients are calculated by spatial-temporal back-propagation (STBP) and surrogate gradients (SGs). However, the SGs may be invisible for an inference-only model as they do not influence the inference results, and current gradient-based attacks are ineffective for binary dynamic images captured by the dynamic vision sensor (DVS). While some approaches addressed the issue of invisible SGs through universal SGs, their SGs lack a correlation with the victim model, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, the imperceptibility of existing SNN-based binary attacks is still insufficient. In this paper, we introduce an innovative potential-dependent surrogate gradient (PDSG) method to establish a robust connection between the SG and the model, thereby enhancing the adaptability of adversarial attacks across various models with invisible SGs. Additionally, we propose the sparse dynamic attack (SDA) to effectively attack binary dynamic images. Utilizing a generation-reduction paradigm, SDA can fully optimize the sparsity of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that our PDSG and SDA outperform state-of-the-art SNN-based attacks across various models and datasets. Specifically, our PDSG achieves 100% attack success rate on ImageNet, and our SDA obtains 82% attack success rate by modifying only 0.24% of the pixels on CIFAR10DVS.
