Existing point cloud completion methods, which typically depend on predefined synthetic training datasets, encounter significant challenges when applied to out-of-distribution, real-world scans. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a zero-shot completion framework, termed GenPC, designed to reconstruct high-quality real-world scans by leveraging explicit 3D generative priors. Our key insight is that recent feed-forward 3D generative models, trained on extensive internet-scale data, have demonstrated the ability to perform 3D generation from single-view images in a zero-shot setting. To harness this for completion, we first develop a Depth Prompting module that links partial point clouds with image-to-3D generative models by leveraging depth images as a stepping stone. To retain the original partial structure in the final results, we design the Geometric Preserving Fusion module that aligns the generated shape with input by adaptively adjusting its pose and scale. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks validate the superiority and gen-eralizability of our approach, bringing us a step closer to robust real-world scan completion.
