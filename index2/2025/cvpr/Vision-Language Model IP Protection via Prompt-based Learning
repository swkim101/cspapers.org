Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) have seen remarkable success in visual recognition, highlighting the increasing need to safeguard the intellectual property (IP) of well-trained models. Effective IP protection extends beyond ensuring authorized usage; it also necessitates restricting model deployment to authorized data domains, particularly when the model is fine-tuned for specific target domains. However, current IP protection methods often rely solely on the visual backbone, which may lack sufficient semantic richness. To bridge this gap, we introduce IP-CLIP, a lightweight IP protection strategy tailored to CLIP, employing a prompt-based learning approach. By leveraging the frozen visual backbone of CLIP, we extract both image style and content information, incorporating them into the learning of IP prompt. This strategy acts as a robust barrier, effectively preventing the unauthorized transfer of features from authorized domains to unauthorized ones. Additionally, we propose a style-enhancement branch that constructs feature banks for both authorized and unauthorized domains. This branch integrates self-enhanced and cross-domain features, further strengthening IP-CLIPâ€™s capability to block features from unauthorized domains. Finally, we present new three metrics designed to better balance the performance degradation of authorized and unauthorized domains. Comprehensive experiments in various scenarios demonstrate its promising potential for application in IP protection tasks for VLMs.
