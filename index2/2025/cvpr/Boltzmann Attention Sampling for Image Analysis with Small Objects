Detecting and segmenting small objects, such as lung nodules and tumor lesions, remains a critical challenge in image analysis. These objects often occupy less than 0.1% of an image, making traditional transformer architectures inefficient and prone to performance degradation due to redundant attention computations on irrelevant regions. Existing sparse attention mechanisms rely on rigid hierarchical structures, which are poorly suited for detecting small, variable, and uncertain object locations. In this paper, we propose BoltzFormer, a novel transformer-based architecture designed to address these challenges through dynamic sparse attention. BoltzFormer identifies and focuses attention on relevant areas by modeling uncertainty using a Boltzmann distribution with an annealing schedule. Initially, a higher temperature allows broader area sampling in early layers, when object location uncertainty is greatest. As the temperature decreases in later layers, attention becomes more focused, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. BoltzFormer seamlessly integrates into existing transformer architectures via a modular Boltzmann attention sampling mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BoltzFormer significantly improves segmentation performance for small objects while reducing attention computation by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
