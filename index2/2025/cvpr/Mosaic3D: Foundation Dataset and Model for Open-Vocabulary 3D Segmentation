We tackle open-vocabulary 3D scene segmentation tasks by introducing a novel data generation pipeline and training framework. Our work targets three essential aspects required for an effective dataset: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware vision-language models (VLM), we develop an automatic pipeline capable of producing high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of more than 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs - significantly larger than existing datasets. Building on these data, we propose Mosaic3D, a 3D visiual foundation model (3D-VFM) combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation benchmarks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data. https://nvlabs.github.io/Mosaic3D/
