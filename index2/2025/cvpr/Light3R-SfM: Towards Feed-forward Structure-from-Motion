We present Light3R-SfM, a feed-forward, end-to-end learnable framework for efficient large-scale Structure-from-Motion (SfM) from unconstrained image collections. Unlike existing SfM solutions that rely on costly matching and global optimization to achieve accurate 3D reconstructions, Light3R-SfM addresses this limitation through a novel latent global alignment module. This module replaces traditional global optimization with a learnable attention mechanism, effectively capturing multi-view constraints across images for robust and precise camera pose estimation. Light3R-SfM constructs a sparse scene graph via retrieval-score-guided shortest path tree to dramatically reduce memory usage and computational overhead compared to the naive approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light3R-SfM achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks in real-world applications with a runtime constraint.
