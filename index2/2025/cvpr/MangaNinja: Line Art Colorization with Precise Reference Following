Derived from diffusion models, MangaNinja specializes in the task of reference-guided line art colorization. We incorporate two thoughtful designs to ensure precise character detail transcription, including a patch shuffling module to facilitate correspondence learning between the reference color image and the target line art, and a point-driven control scheme to enable fine-grained color matching. Experiments on a self-collected benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our model over current solutions in terms of precise colorization. We further showcase the potential of the proposed interactive point control in handling challenging cases (e.g., extreme poses and shadows), cross-character colorization, multi-reference harmonization, etc., beyond the reach of existing algorithms. Our code and model could be found here.
