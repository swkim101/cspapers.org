Reconstructing 3D shapes from a single image plays an important role in computer vision. Many methods have been proposed and achieve impressive performance. However, existing methods mainly focus on extracting semantic information from images and then simply concatenating it with 3D point clouds without further exploring the concatenated semantics. As a result, these entangled semantic features significantly hinder the reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel single-image 3D reconstruction method called Mining Effective Semantic Cues for 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image (MESC-3D), which can actively mine effective semantic cues from entangled features. Specifically, we design an Effective Semantic Mining Module, which incorporates a point-selection map establish connections between point clouds and semantic attributes, enabling the point clouds to autonomously select the necessary information. Furthermore, to address the potential insufficiencies in semantic information from a single image, such as occlusions, inspired by the human ability to represent 3D objects using prior knowledge drawn from daily experiences, we introduce a 3D Semantic Prior Learning Module. This module employs contrastive learning paradigm along with a learnable text prompt to incorporates semantic understanding of spatial structures, enabling the model to interpret and reconstruct 3D objects with greater accuracy and realism, closely mirroring human perception of complex 3D environments. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality and robustness compared to prior works. Additionally, further experiments validate the strong generalization capabilities and excels in zero-shot preformance on unseen classes. Code is available at https://github.com/QINGQINGLE/MESC-3D.
