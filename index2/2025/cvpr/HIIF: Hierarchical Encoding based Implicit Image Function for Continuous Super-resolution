Recent advances in implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown significant promise in modeling visual signals for various low-vision tasks including image super-resolution (ISR). INR-based ISR methods typically learn continuous representations, providing flexibility for generating high-resolution images at any desired scale from their low-resolution counterparts. However, existing INR-based ISR methods utilize multi-layer perceptrons for parameterization in the network; this does not take account of the hierarchical structure existing in local sampling points and hence constrains the representation capability. In this paper, we propose a new Hierarchical encoding based Implicit Image Function for continuous image super-resolution, HIIF, which leverages a novel hierarchical positional encoding that enhances the local implicit representation, enabling it to capture fine details at multiple scales. Our approach also embeds a multi-head linear attention mechanism within the implicit attention network by taking additional non-local information into account. Our experiments show that, when integrated with different backbone encoders, HIIF outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous image super-resolution methods by up to 0.17dB in PSNR. The source code of HIIF will be made publicly available at https://github.com/YuxuanJJ/HIIF.
