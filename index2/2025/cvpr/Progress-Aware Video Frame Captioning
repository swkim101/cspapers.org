While image captioning provides isolated descriptions for individual images, and video captioning offers one single narrative for an entire video clip, our work explores an important middle ground: progress-aware video captioning at the frame level. This novel task aims to generate temporally fine-grained captions that not only accurately describe each frame but also capture the subtle progression of actions throughout a video sequence. Despite the strong capabilities of existing leading vision language models, they often struggle to discern the nuances of frame-wise differences. To address this, we propose ProgressCaptioner, a captioning model designed to capture the fine-grained temporal dynamics within an action sequence. Alongside, we develop the FrameCap dataset to support training and the Frame-CapEval benchmark to assess caption quality. The results demonstrate that ProgressCaptioner significantly surpasses leading captioning models, producing precise captions that accurately capture action progression and set a new standard for temporal precision in video captioning. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our approach, specifically in aiding keyframe selection and advancing video understanding, highlighting its broad utility.1
