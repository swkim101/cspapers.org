While event-based deblurring have demonstrated impressive results, they are impractical for consumer photos captured by cell phones and digital cameras that are not equipped with the event sensor. To address this problem, we in this paper propose a novel deblurring framework called Event Generation Deblurring (EGDeblurring), which allows to effectively deblur an image by generating event guidance describing the motion information using a diffusion model. Specifically, we design a motion prior generation diffusion model and a feature extractor to produce prior information beneficial for deblurring, rather than generating the raw event representation. In order to achieve effective fusion of motion prior information with blurry images and produce high-quality results, we develop a regression deblurring network embedded with a dual-attention channel fusion block. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art image deblurring methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/XinanXie/EGDeblurring.
