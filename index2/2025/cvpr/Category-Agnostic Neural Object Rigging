The motion of deformable 4D objects lies in a low-dimensional manifold. To better capture the low dimensionality and enable better controllability, traditional methods have devised several heuristic-based methods, i.e., rigging, for manipulating dynamic objects in an intuitive fashion. However, such representations are not scalable due to the need for expert knowledge of specific categories. Instead, we study the automatic exploration of such low-dimensional structures in a purely data-driven manner. Specifically, we design a novel representation that encodes deformable 4D objects into a sparse set of spatially grounded blobs and an instance-aware feature volume to disentangle the pose and instance information of the 3D shape. With such a representation, we can manipulate the pose of 3D objects intuitively by modifying the parameters of the blobs, while preserving rich instance-specific information. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of object categories and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Project page: https://guangzhaohe.com/canor.
