Sound-guided object segmentation has drawn considerable attention for its potential to enhance multimodal perception. Previous methods primarily focus on developing advanced architectures to facilitate effective audio-visual interactions, without fully addressing the inherent challenges posed by audio natures, i.e., (1) feature confusion due to the overlapping nature of audio signals, and (2) audiovisual matching difficulty from the varied sounds produced by the same object. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Derivation and Elimination (DDESeg): a novel audio-visual segmentation framework. Specifically, to mitigate feature confusion, DDESeg reconstructs the semantic content of the mixed audio signal by enriching the distinct semantic information of each individual source, deriving representations that preserve the unique characteristics of each sound. To reduce the matching difficulty, we introduce a discriminative feature learning module, which enhances the semantic distinctiveness of generated audio representations. Considering that not all derived audio representations directly correspond to visual features (e.g., off-screen sounds), we propose a dynamic elimination module to filter out non-matching elements. This module facilitates targeted interaction between sounding regions and relevant audio semantics. By scoring the interacted features, we identify and filter out irrelevant audio information, ensuring accurate audio-visual alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in AVS datasets. Our code is here.
