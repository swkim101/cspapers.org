In this paper, we propose LC-Mamba, a Mamba-based model that captures fine-grained spatiotemporal information in video frames, addressing limitations in current interpolation methods and enhancing performance. The main contributions are as follows: First, we apply a shifted local window technique to reduce historical decay and enhance local spatial features, allowing multi-scale capture of detailed motion between frames. Second, we introduce a Hilbert curve-based selective state scan to maintain continuity across window boundaries, preserving spatial correlations both within and between windows. Third, we extend the Hilbert curve to enable voxel-level scanning to effectively capture spatiotemporal characteristics between frames. The proposed LC-Mamba achieves competitive results, with a PSNR of 36.53 dB on Vimeo-90k, outperforming prior models by +0.03 dB.
