Multi-modal 3D object understanding has gained significant attention, yet current approaches often assume complete data availability and rigid alignment across all modalities. We present CrossOver, a novel framework for cross-modal 3D scene understanding via flexible, scene-level modality alignment. Unlike traditional methods that require aligned modality data for every object instance, CrossOver learns a unified, modality-agnostic embedding space for scenes by aligning modalities – RGB images, point clouds, CAD models, floorplans, and text descriptions – with relaxed constraints and without explicit object semantics. Leveraging dimensionality-specific encoders, a multi-stage training pipeline, and emergent cross-modal behaviors, CrossOver supports robust scene retrieval and object localization, even with missing modalities. Evaluations on Scan-Net and 3RScan datasets show its superior performance across diverse metrics, highlighting CrossOver’s adaptability for real-world applications in 3D scene understanding.
