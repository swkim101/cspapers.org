Based on analyzing the character of cascaded decoder architecture commonly adopted in existing DETR-like models, this paper proposes a new decoder architecture. The cascaded decoder architecture constrains object queries to update in the cascaded direction, only enabling object queries to learn relatively-limited information from image features. However, the challenges for object detection in natural scenes (e.g., extremely-small, heavily-occluded, and confusingly mixed with the background) require an object detection model to fully utilize image features, which motivates us to propose a new decoder architecture with the parallel Multi-time Inquiries (MI) mechanism. MI mechanism is very simple, enabling object queries to parallelly perform multi-time inquiries to learn more comprehensive information from image features. Our MI based model, MI-DETR, outperforms all existing DETR-like models on COCO benchmark under different backbones and training epochs, achieving +2.3 AP and +0.6 AP improvements compared to the most representative model DINO and SOTA model Relation-DETR under ResNet-50 backbone.
