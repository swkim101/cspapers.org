The rapid proliferation of large-scale text-to-image diffusion (T2ID) models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful content. Although numerous methods have been proposed for erasing undesired concepts from T2ID models, they often provide a false sense of security; concept-erased models (CEMs) can still be manipulated via adversarial attacks to regenerate the erased concept. While a few robust concept erasure methods based on adversarial training have emerged recently, they compromise on utility (generation quality for benign concepts) to achieve robustness and/or remain vulnerable to advanced embedding space attacks. These limitations stem from the failure of robust CEMs to thoroughly search for "blind spots" in the embedding space. To bridge this gap, we propose STEREO, a novel two-stage framework that employs adversarial training as a first step rather than the only step for robust concept erasure. In the first stage, STEREO employs adversarial training as a vulnerability identification mechanism to search thoroughly enough. In the second robustly erase once stage, STEREO introduces an anchor-concept-based compositional objective to robustly erase the target concept in a single fine-tuning stage, while minimizing the degradation of model utility. We benchmark STEREO against seven state-of-the-art concept erasure methods, demonstrating its superior robustness to both white-box and black-box attacks, while largely preserving utility.
