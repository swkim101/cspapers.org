Light field microscopy (LFM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to capture snapshot-based, large-scale 3D fluorescence images. However, existing LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or require hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based framework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image denoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the LF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view being independent. This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of noise2noise for effective denoising. To enhance the recovery of high-frequency details, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique, which transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in wave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature alignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their corresponding 3D intensity volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. These advancements position V2V3D as a promising solution for 3D imaging under challenging conditions. Our code and dataset will be publicly accessible at https://joey1998hub.github.io/V2V3D/.
