Deep learning approaches for marine fog detection and forecasting have outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating significant scientific and practical importance. However, the limited availability of open-source datasets remains a major challenge. Existing datasets, often focused on a single region or satellite, restrict the ability to evaluate model performance across diverse conditions and hinder the exploration of intrinsic marine fog characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MFogHub, the first multi-regional and multi-satellite dataset to integrate annotated marine fog observations from 15 coastal fog-prone regions and six geostationary satellites, comprising over 68,000 high-resolution samples. By encompassing diverse regions and satellite perspectives, MFogHub facilitates rigorous evaluation of both detection and forecasting methods under varying conditions. Extensive experiments with 16 baseline models demonstrate that MFogHub can reveal generalization fluctuations due to regional and satellite discrepancy, while also serving as a valuable resource for the development of targeted and scalable fog prediction techniques. Through MFogHub, we aim to advance both the practical monitoring and scientific understanding of marine fog dynamics on a global scale. The dataset and code are at https://github.com/kaka0910/MFogHub.
