Photorealistic 3D human modeling is essential for various applications and has seen tremendous progress. However, existing methods for monocular full-body reconstruction, typically relying on front and/or predicted back view, still struggle with satisfactory performance due to the ill-posed nature of the problem and sophisticated self-occlusions. In this paper, we propose PSHuman, a novel framework that explicitly reconstructs human meshes utilizing priors from the multiview diffusion model. It is found that directly applying multiview diffusion on single-view human images leads to severe geometric distortions, especially on generated faces. To address it, we propose a cross-scale diffusion that models the joint probability distribution of global full-body shape and local facial characteristics, enabling identity-preserved novel-view generation without geometric distortion. Moreover, to enhance cross-view body shape consistency of varied human poses, we condition the generative model on parametric models (SMPL-X), which provide body priors and prevent unnatural views inconsistent with human anatomy. Leveraging the generated multiview normal and color images, we present SMPLX-initialized explicit human carving to recover realistic textured human meshes efficiently. Extensive experiments on CAPE and THuman2.1 demonstrate PSHumanâ€™s superiority in geometry details, texture fidelity, and generalization capability.
