In environmental protection, tree monitoring plays an essential role in maintaining and improving ecosystem health. However, precise monitoring is challenging because existing datasets fail to capture continuous fine-grained changes in trees due to low-resolution images and high acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce UAVTC, a large-scale, long-term, high-resolution dataset collected using UAVs equipped with cameras, specifically designed to detect individual Tree Changes (TCs). UAVTC includes rich annotations and statistics based on biological knowledge, offering a fine-grained view for tree monitoring. To address environmental influences and effectively model the hierarchical diversity of physiological TCs, we propose a novel Hyperbolic Siamese Network (HSN) for TC detection, enabling compact and hierarchical representations of dynamic tree changes. Extensive experiments show that HSN can effectively capture complex hierarchical changes and provide a robust solution for fine-grained TC detection. In addition, HSN generalizes well to cross-domain face anti-spoofing task, highlighting its broader significance in AI. We believe our work, combining ecological insights and interdisciplinary expertise, will benefit the community by offering a new benchmark and innovative AI technologies.
