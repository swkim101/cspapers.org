Recent image-to-Ð—D reconstruction models have greatly advanced geometry generation, but they still struggle to faithfully generate realistic appearance. To address this, we introduce ARM, a novel method that reconstructs high-quality 3D meshes and realistic appearance from sparse-view images. The core of ARM lies in decoupling geometry from appearance, processing appearance within the UV texture space. Unlike previous methods, ARM improves texture quality by explicitly back-projecting measurements onto the texture map and processing them in a UV space module with a global receptive field. To resolve ambiguities between material and illumination in input images, ARM introduces a material prior that encodes semantic appearance information, enhancing the robustness of appearance decomposition. Trained on just 8 H100 GPUs, ARM outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page is available at https://arm-aigc.github.io.
