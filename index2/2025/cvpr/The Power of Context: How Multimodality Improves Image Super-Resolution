Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains challenging due to the inherent difficulty of recovering fine-grained details and preserving perceptual quality from low-resolution inputs. Existing methods often rely on limited image priors, leading to suboptimal results. We propose a novel approach that leverages the rich contextual information available in multiple modalities - including depth, segmentation, edges, and text prompts-to learn a powerful generative prior for SISR within a diffusion model framework. We introduce a flexible network architecture that effectively fuses multimodal information, accommodating an arbitrary number of input modalities without requiring significant modifications to the diffusion process. Crucially, we mitigate hallucinations, often introduced by text prompts, by using spatial information from other modalities to guide regional text-based conditioning. Each modalityâ€™s guidance strength can also be controlled independently, allowing steering outputs toward different directions, such as increasing bokeh through depth or adjusting object prominence via segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art generative SISR methods, achieving superior visual quality and fidelity.
