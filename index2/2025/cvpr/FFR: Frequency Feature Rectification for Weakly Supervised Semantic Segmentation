Image-level Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) has garnered significant attention due to its low annotation costs. Current single-stage state-of-the-art WSSS methods mainly rely on Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract features from input images, generating more complete segmentation results based on comprehensive semantic information. However, these ViT-based methods often suffer from over-smoothing issues in segmentation results. In this paper, we identify that attenuated high-frequency features mislead the decoder of ViT-based WSSS models, resulting in over-smoothed false segmentation. To address this, we propose a Frequency Feature Rectification (FFR) framework to rectify the false segmentations caused by attenuated high-frequency features and enhance the learning of high-frequency features in the decoder. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our FFR framework can effectively address the attenuated high-frequency caused over-smoothed segmentation issue and achieve new state-of-the-art WSSS performances.
