Hyperspectral images (HSI) densely sample the world in both the space and frequency domains and, therefore, are more distinctive than RGB images. Usually, HSI needs to be calibrated to minimize the impact of various illumination conditions. The traditional way to calibrate HSI utilizes a physical reference, which involves manual operations, occlusions, and/or limits camera mobility. These limitations inspire this paper to automatically calibrate HSIs using a learning-based method. Towards this goal, a large-scale HSI calibration dataset, which has 765 high-quality HSI pairs covering diversified natural scenes and illuminations, is created. The dataset is further expanded to 7650 pairs by combining with 10 different physically measured illuminations. A spectral illumination transformer (SIT) together with an illumination attention module is proposed. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate the SoTA performance of the proposed SIT. The benchmarks also indicate that low-light conditions are more challenging than normal conditions.
