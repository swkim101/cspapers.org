In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners directly utilize raw sensor data, enabling them to extract richer scene features and reduce information loss compared to traditional planners. This raises a crucial research question: how can we develop better scene feature representations to fully leverage sensor data in end-to-end driving? Self-supervised learning methods show great success in learning rich feature representations in NLP and computer vision. Inspired by this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning approach using the LAtent World model (LAW) for end-to-end driving. LAW predicts future scene features based on current features and ego trajectories. This self-supervised task can be seamlessly integrated into perception-free and perception-based frameworks, improving scene feature learning and optimizing trajectory prediction. LAW achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including real-world open-loop benchmark nuScenes, NAVSIM, and simulator-based closed-loop benchmark CARLA.
