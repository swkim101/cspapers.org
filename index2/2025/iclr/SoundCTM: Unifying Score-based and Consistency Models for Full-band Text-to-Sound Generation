Sound content creation, essential for multimedia works such as video games and films, often involves extensive trial-and-error, enabling creators to semantically reflect their artistic ideas and inspirations, which evolve throughout the creation process, into the sound. Recent high-quality diffusion-based Text-to-Sound (T2S) generative models provide valuable tools for creators. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds, imposing an undesirable burden that hinders the trial-and-error process. While existing T2S distillation models address this limitation through 1-step generation, the sample quality of $1$-step generation remains insufficient for production use. Additionally, while multi-step sampling in those distillation models improves sample quality itself, the semantic content changes due to their lack of deterministic sampling capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM), which allow flexible transitions between high-quality $1$-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step deterministic sampling. This allows creators to efficiently conduct trial-and-error with 1-step generation to semantically align samples with their intention, and subsequently refine sample quality with preserving semantic content through deterministic multi-step sampling. To develop SoundCTM, we reframe the CTM training framework, originally proposed in computer vision, and introduce a novel feature distance using the teacher network for a distillation loss. For production-level generation, we scale up our model to 1B trainable parameters, making SoundCTM-DiT-1B the first large-scale distillation model in the sound community to achieve both promising high-quality 1-step and multi-step full-band (44.1kHz) generation.
