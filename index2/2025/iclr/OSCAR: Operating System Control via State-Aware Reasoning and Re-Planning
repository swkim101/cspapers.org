Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential in automating complex tasks like web browsing and gaming. However, their ability to generalize across diverse applications remains limited, hindering broader utility. To address this challenge, we present OSCAR: Operating System Control via state-Aware reasoning and Re-planning. OSCAR is a generalist agent designed to autonomously navigate and interact with various desktop and mobile applications through standardized controls, such as mouse and keyboard inputs, while processing screen images to fulfill user commands. OSCAR translates human instructions into executable Python code, enabling precise control over graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To enhance stability and adaptability, OSCAR operates as a state machine, equipped with error-handling mechanisms and dynamic task re-planning, allowing it to efficiently adjust to real-time feedback and exceptions. We demonstrate OSCAR's effectiveness through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks across desktop and mobile platforms, where it transforms complex workflows into simple natural language commands, significantly boosting user productivity. Our code will be open-source upon publication.
