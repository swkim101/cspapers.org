The rapid development of AI highlights the pressing need for sustainable energy, a critical global challenge for decades. Nuclear fusion, generally seen as an ultimate solution, has been the focus of intensive research for nearly a century, with investments reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Recent advancements in Inertial Confinement Fusion have drawn significant attention to fusion research, in which Laser-Plasma Interaction (LPI) is critical for ensuring fusion stability and efficiency. However, the complexity of LPI upon fusion ignition makes analytical approaches impractical, leaving researchers depending on extremely computation-demanding Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations to generate data, presenting a significant bottleneck to advancing fusion research. In response, this work introduces Diff-PIC, a novel framework that leverages conditional diffusion models as a computationally efficient alternative to PIC simulations for generating high-fidelity scientific LPI data. In this work, physical patterns captured by PIC simulations are distilled into diffusion models associated with two tailored enhancements: (1) To effectively capture the complex relationships between physical parameters and corresponding outcomes, the parameters are encoded in a physically-informed manner. (2) To further enhance efficiency while maintaining high fidelity and physical validity, the rectified flow technique is employed to transform our model into a one-step conditional diffusion model. Experimental results show that Diff-PIC achieves 16,200$\times$ speedup compared to traditional PIC on a 100 picosecond simulation, with an average reduction in MAE / RMSE / FID of 59.21% / 57.15% / 39.46% with respect to two other SOTA data generation approaches.
