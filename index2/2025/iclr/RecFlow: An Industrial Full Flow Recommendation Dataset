Industrial recommendation systems (RS) rely on the multi-stage pipeline to balance effectiveness and efficiency when delivering items from a vast corpus to users. Existing RS benchmark datasets primarily focus on the exposure space, where novel RS algorithms are trained and evaluated. However, when these algorithms transition to real world industrial RS, they face a critical challenge of handling unexposed items which are a significantly larger space than the exposed one. This discrepancy profoundly impacts their practical performance. Additionally, these algorithms often overlook the intricate interplay between multiple RS stages, resulting in suboptimal overall system performance. To address this issue, we introduce RecFlow, an industrial full flow recommendation dataset designed to bridge the gap between offline RS benchmarks and the real online environment. Unlike existing datasets, RecFlow includes samples not only from the exposure space but also unexposed items filtered at each stage of the RS funnel. Our dataset comprises 38M interactions from 42K users across nearly 9M items with additional 1.9B stage samples collected from 9.3M online requests over 37 days and spanning 6 stages. Leveraging the RecFlow dataset, we conduct courageous exploration experiments, showcasing its potential in designing new algorithms to enhance effectiveness by incorporating stage-specific samples. Some of these algorithms have already been deployed online, consistently yielding significant gains. We propose RecFlow as the first comprehensive benchmark dataset for the RS community, supporting research on designing algorithms at any stage, study of selection bias, debiased algorithms, multi-stage consistency and optimality, multi-task recommendation, and user behavior modeling. The RecFlow dataset, along with the corresponding source code, is available at https://github.com/RecFlow-ICLR/RecFlow.
