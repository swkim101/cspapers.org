We propose a new task and model for dense video object captioning -- detecting, tracking and captioning trajectories of objects in a video. This task unifies spatial and temporal localization in video, whilst also requiring fine-grained visual understanding that is best described by natural language. We propose a unified model, and demonstrate how our end-to-end approach is more accurate and temporally coherent than a multi-stage pipeline combining state-of-the-art detection, tracking, and captioning models. Moreover, we propose a training strategy based on a mixture of disjoint tasks, which allows us to leverage diverse, large-scale datasets which supervise different parts of our model. Although each pretraining task only provides weak supervision, they are complementary and, when combined, result in noteworthy zero-shot ability and serve as strong initialization for additional finetuning to further improve accuracy. We carefully design new metrics capturing all components of our task, and show how we can repurpose existing video grounding datasets (e.g. VidSTG and VLN) for our new task. We show that our model improves upon a number of strong baselines for this new task. Furthermore, we can apply our model to the task of spatial grounding, outperforming prior state-of-the-art on VidSTG and VLN, without explicitly training for it.
