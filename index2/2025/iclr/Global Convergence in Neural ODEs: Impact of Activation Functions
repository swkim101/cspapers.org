Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency. However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training, particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in real-world applications.
