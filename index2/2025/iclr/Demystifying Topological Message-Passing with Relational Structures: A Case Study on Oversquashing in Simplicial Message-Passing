Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling higher-order interactions in relational data. However, phenomena such as oversquashing in topological message-passing remain understudied and lack theoretical analysis. We propose a unifying axiomatic framework that bridges graph and topological message-passing by viewing simplicial and cellular complexes and their message-passing schemes through the lens of relational structures. This approach extends graph-theoretic results and algorithms to higher-order structures, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of oversquashing in topological message-passing networks. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies on simplicial networks, we demonstrate the potential of this framework to advance TDL.
