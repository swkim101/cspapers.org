Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and enhancers, are relatively short DNA sequences that directly regulate gene expression. The fitness of CREs, measured by their ability to modulate gene expression, highly depends on the nucleotide sequences, especially specific motifs known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Designing high-fitness CREs is crucial for therapeutic and bioengineering applications. Current CRE design methods are limited by two major drawbacks: (1) they typically rely on iterative optimization strategies that modify existing sequences and are prone to local optima, and (2) they lack the guidance of biological prior knowledge in sequence optimization. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a generative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) model. Our method incorporates data-driven biological priors by deriving computational inference-based rewards that simulate the addition of activator TFBSs and removal of repressor TFBSs, which are then integrated into the RL process. We evaluate our method on promoter design tasks in two yeast media conditions and enhancer design tasks for three human cell types, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fitness CREs while maintaining sequence diversity.
