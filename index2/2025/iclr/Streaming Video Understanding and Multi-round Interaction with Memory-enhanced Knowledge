Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of Video-LLMs, advancing multimodal learning by bridging video data with language tasks. However, current video understanding models struggle with processing long video sequences, supporting multi-turn dialogues, and adapting to real-world dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose StreamChat, a training-free framework for streaming video reasoning and conversational interaction. $\StreamChat$ leverages a novel hierarchical memory system to efficiently process and compress video features over extended sequences, enabling real-time, multi-turn dialogue. Our framework incorporates a parallel system scheduling strategy that enhances processing speed and reduces latency, ensuring robust performance in real-world applications. Furthermore, we introduce StreamBench, a versatile benchmark that evaluates streaming video understanding across diverse media types and interactive scenarios, including multi-turn interactions and complex reasoning tasks. Extensive evaluations on StreamBench and other public benchmarks demonstrate that StreamChat significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and response times, confirming its effectiveness for streaming video understanding.
