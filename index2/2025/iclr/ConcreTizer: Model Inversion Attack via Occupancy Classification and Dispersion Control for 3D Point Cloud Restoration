The growing use of 3D point cloud data in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has raised serious privacy concerns, particularly due to the sensitive information that can be extracted from 3D data. While model inversion attacks have been widely studied in the context of 2D data, their application to 3D point clouds remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we present the first in-depth study of model inversion attacks aimed at restoring 3D point cloud scenes. Our analysis reveals the unique challenges, the inherent sparsity of 3D point clouds and the ambiguity between empty and non-empty voxels after voxelization, which are further exacerbated by the dispersion of non-empty voxels across feature extractor layers. To address these challenges, we introduce ConcreTizer, a simple yet effective model inversion attack designed specifically for voxel-based 3D point cloud data. ConcreTizer incorporates Voxel Occupancy Classification to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels and Dispersion-Controlled Supervision to mitigate non-empty voxel dispersion. Extensive experiments on widely used 3D feature extractors and benchmark datasets, such as KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate that ConcreTizer concretely restores the original 3D point cloud scene from disrupted 3D feature data. Our findings highlight both the vulnerability of 3D data to inversion attacks and the urgent need for robust defense strategies.
