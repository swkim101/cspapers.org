Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become the standard approach to endow them with specialized knowledge, but it poses fundamental challenges. In particular, \textit{(i)} fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where improvements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks, and \textit{(ii)} merging fine-tuned checkpoints from disparate tasks can lead to significant performance loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LiNeS, Layer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to preserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task performance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth within the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained values to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain task-specific representations. In multi-task model merging scenarios, layer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference. LiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task settings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing. It mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization, integrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines improving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost generalization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via RLHF. Our method is simple to implement, computationally efficient and complementary to many existing techniques. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wang-kee/LiNeS
