Quantum-centric supercomputing presents a compelling framework for large-scale hybrid quantum-classical tasks. Although quantum machine learning (QML) offers theoretical benefits in various applications, challenges such as large-size data encoding in the input stage and the reliance on quantum resources in the inference stage limit its practicality for tasks like fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Quantum parameter generation, a novel approach of QML, addresses these limitations by using quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate classical model weights (parameters) exclusively during training, thereby decoupling inference from quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) in the framework of quantum parameter generation, which integrates QNNs with a classical multi-layer perceptron mapping model to generate parameters for fine-tuning methods. Using Gemma-2 and GPT-2 as case studies, QPA demonstrates significant parameter reduction for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while maintaining comparable or improved performance in text generation tasks. Specifically, QPA reduces the number of parameters to $52.06\%$ of the original LoRA for GPT-2 with a slight performance gain of $0.75\%$, and to $16.84\%$ for Gemma-2, with a marginal performance improvement of $0.07\%$. These results highlight QPA's ability to achieve efficient parameter reduction without sacrificing performance in the quantum parameter generation framework. This work showcases the potential of quantum-enhanced parameter reduction, offering a scalable quantum-classical solution for fine-tuning LLMs while preserving the feasibility of inference on classical hardware.
