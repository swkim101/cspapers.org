Deep clustering has exhibited remarkable performance; however, the over confidence problem, i.e., the estimated confidence for a sample belonging to a particular cluster greatly exceeds its actual prediction accuracy, has been over looked in prior research. To tackle this critical issue, we pioneer the development of a calibrated deep clustering framework. Specifically, we propose a novel dual head (calibration head and clustering head) deep clustering model that can effectively calibrate the estimated confidence and the actual accuracy. The calibration head adjusts the overconfident predictions of the clustering head, generating prediction confidence that matches the model learning status. Then, the clustering head dynamically selects reliable high-confidence samples estimated by the calibration head for pseudo-label self-training. Additionally, we introduce an effective network initialization strategy that enhances both training speed and network robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration approach and initialization strategy are both endorsed with solid theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed calibrated deep clustering model not only surpasses the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods by 5x on average in terms of expected calibration error, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of clustering accuracy.
