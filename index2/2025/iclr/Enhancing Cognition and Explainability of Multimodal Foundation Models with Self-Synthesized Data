Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), or Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have shown impressive capabilities in a wide range of visual tasks. However, they often struggle with fine-grained visual reasoning, failing to identify domain-specific objectives and provide justifiable explanations for their predictions. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel visual rejection sampling framework to improve the cognition and explainability of LMMs using self-synthesized data. Specifically, visual fine-tuning requires images, queries, and target answers. Our approach begins by synthesizing interpretable answers that include human-verifiable visual features. These features are based on expert-defined concepts, and carefully selected based on their alignment with the image content. After each round of fine-tuning, we apply a reward model-free filtering mechanism to select the highest-quality interpretable answers for the next round of tuning. This iterative process of synthetic data generation and fine-tuning progressively improves the model's ability to generate accurate and reasonable explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving both the accuracy and explainability of specialized visual classification tasks.
