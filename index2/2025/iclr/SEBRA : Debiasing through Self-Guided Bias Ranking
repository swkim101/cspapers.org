Ranking samples by fine-grained estimates of spuriosity (the degree to which spurious cues are present) has recently been shown to significantly benefit bias mitigation, over the traditional binary biased-\textit{vs}-unbiased partitioning of train sets. However, this spuriosity ranking comes with the requirement of human supervision. In this paper, we propose a debiasing framework based on our novel \ul{Se}lf-Guided \ul{B}ias \ul{Ra}nking (\emph{Sebra}), that mitigates biases (spurious correlations) via an automatic ranking of data points by spuriosity within their respective classes. Sebra leverages a key local symmetry in Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training -- the ease of learning a sample via ERM inversely correlates with its spuriousity; the fewer spurious correlations a sample exhibits, the harder it is to learn, and vice versa. However, globally across iterations, ERM tends to deviate from this symmetry. Sebra dynamically steers ERM to correct this deviation, facilitating the sequential learning of attributes in increasing order of difficulty, \ie, decreasing order of spuriosity. As a result, the sequence in which Sebra learns samples naturally provides spuriousity rankings. We use the resulting fine-grained bias characterization in a contrastive learning framework to mitigate biases from multiple sources. Extensive experiments show that Sebra consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised debiasing techniques across multiple standard benchmarks, including UrbanCars, BAR, CelebA, and ImageNet-1K.
