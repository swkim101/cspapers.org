Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is receiving more attention in various fields such as multi-task learning. Recent works provide some effective algorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard $L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which typically do not hold for neural networks, such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) models and Transformers. In this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of generalized $\ell$-smooth loss functions, where $\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient norm. We revisit and analyze the fundamental multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) and its stochastic version with double sampling for solving the generalized $\ell$-smooth MOO problems, which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that maximizes the minimum improvement among objectives. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of these algorithms and show that they converge to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point with a guaranteed $\epsilon$-level average CA distance (i.e., the gap between the updating direction and the CA direction) over all iterations, where totally $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples are needed for deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively. We prove that they can also guarantee a tighter $\epsilon$-level CA distance in each iteration using more samples. Moreover, we analyze an efficient variant of MGDA named MGDA-FA using only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space, while achieving the same performance guarantee as MGDA.
