MetaDesigner introduces a transformative framework for artistic typography synthesis, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and grounded in a user-centric design paradigm. Its foundation is a multi-agent system comprising the Pipeline, Glyph, and Texture agents, which collectively orchestrate the creation of customizable WordArt, ranging from semantic enhancements to intricate textural elements. A central feedback mechanism leverages insights from both multimodal models and user evaluations, enabling iterative refinement of design parameters. Through this iterative process, MetaDesigner dynamically adjusts hyperparameters to align with user-defined stylistic and thematic preferences, consistently delivering WordArt that excels in visual quality and contextual resonance. Empirical evaluations underscore the system's versatility and effectiveness across diverse WordArt applications, yielding outputs that are both aesthetically compelling and context-sensitive.
