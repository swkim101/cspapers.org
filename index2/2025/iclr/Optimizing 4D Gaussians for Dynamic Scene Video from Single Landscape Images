To achieve realistic immersion in landscape images, fluids such as water and clouds need to move within the image while revealing new scenes from various camera perspectives. Recently, a field called dynamic scene video has emerged, which combines single image animation with 3D photography. These methods use pseudo 3D space, implicitly represented with Layered Depth Images (LDIs). LDIs separate a single image into depth-based layers, which enables elements like water and clouds to move within the image while revealing new scenes from different camera perspectives. However, as landscapes typically consist of continuous elements, including fluids, the representation of a 3D space separates a landscape image into discrete layers, and it can lead to diminished depth perception and potential distortions depending on camera movement. Furthermore, due to its implicit modeling of 3D space, the output may be limited to videos in the 2D domain, potentially reducing their versatility. In this paper, we propose representing a complete 3D space for dynamic scene video by modeling explicit representations, specifically 4D Gaussians, from a single image. The framework is focused on optimizing 3D Gaussians by generating multi-view images from a single image and creating 3D motion to optimize 4D Gaussians. The most important part of proposed framework is consistent 3D motion estimation, which estimates common motion among multi-view images to bring the motion in 3D space closer to actual motions. As far as we know, this is the first attempt that considers animation while representing a complete 3D space from a single landscape image. Our model demonstrates the ability to provide realistic immersion in various landscape images through diverse experiments and metrics.
