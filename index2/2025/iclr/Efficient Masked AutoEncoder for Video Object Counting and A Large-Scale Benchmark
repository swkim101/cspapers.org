The dynamic imbalance of the fore-background is a major challenge in video object counting, which is usually caused by the sparsity of target objects. This remains understudied in existing works and often leads to severe under-/over-prediction errors. To tackle this issue in video object counting, we propose a density-embedded Efficient Masked Autoencoder Counting (E-MAC) framework in this paper. To empower the model's representation ability on density regression, we develop a new $\mathtt{D}$ensity-$\mathtt{E}$mbedded $\mathtt{M}$asked m$\mathtt{O}$deling ($\mathtt{DEMO}$) method, which first takes the density map as an auxiliary modality to perform multimodal self-representation learning for image and density map. Although $\mathtt{DEMO}$ contributes to effective cross-modal regression guidance, it also brings in redundant background information, making it difficult to focus on the foreground regions. To handle this dilemma, we propose an efficient spatial adaptive masking derived from density maps to boost efficiency. Meanwhile, we employ an optical flow-based temporal collaborative fusion strategy to effectively capture the dynamic variations across frames, aligning features to derive multi-frame density residuals. The counting accuracy of the current frame is boosted by harnessing the information from adjacent frames. In addition, considering that most existing datasets are limited to human-centric scenarios, we first propose a large video bird counting dataset, DroneBird, in natural scenarios for migratory bird protection. Extensive experiments on three crowd datasets and our \textit{DroneBird} validate our superiority against the counterparts. The code and dataset are available.
