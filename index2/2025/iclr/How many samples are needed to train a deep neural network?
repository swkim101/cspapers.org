Neural networks have become standard tools in many areas, yet many important statistical questions remain open. This paper studies the question of how much data are needed to train a ReLU feed-forward neural network. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the generalization error of ReLU feed-forward neural networks scales at the rate $1/\sqrt{n}$ in the sample size $n$ rather than the usual"parametric rate"$1/n$. Thus, broadly speaking, our results underpin the common belief that neural networks need"many"training samples.
