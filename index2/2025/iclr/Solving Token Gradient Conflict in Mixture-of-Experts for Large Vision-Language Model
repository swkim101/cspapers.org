The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing attention in studying Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLM encourage different experts to specialize in different tokens, and they usually employ a router to predict the routing of each token. However, the router is not optimized concerning distinct parameter optimization directions generated from tokens within an expert. This may lead to severe interference between tokens within an expert. To address this problem, we propose to use the token-level gradient analysis to Solving Token Gradient Conflict (STGC) in this paper. Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. After that, we add a regularization loss tailored to encourage conflicting tokens routing from their current experts to other experts, for reducing interference between tokens within an expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse LVLM methods, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/longrongyang/STGC.
