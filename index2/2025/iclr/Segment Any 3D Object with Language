In this paper, we investigate Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation (OV-3DIS) with free-form language instructions. Earlier works that rely on only annotated base categories for training suffer from limited generalization to unseen novel categories. Recent works mitigate poor generalizability to novel categories by generating class-agnostic masks or projecting generalized masks from 2D to 3D, but disregard semantic or geometry information, leading to sub-optimal performance. Instead, generating generalizable but semantic-related masks directly from 3D point clouds would result in superior outcomes. In this paper, we introduce Segment any 3D Object with LanguagE (SOLE), which is a semantic and geometric-aware visual-language learning framework with strong generalizability by generating semantic-related masks directly from 3D point clouds. Specifically, we propose a multimodal fusion network to incorporate multimodal semantics in both backbone and decoder. In addition, to align the 3D segmentation model with various language instructions and enhance the mask quality, we introduce three types of multimodal associations as supervision. Our SOLE outperforms previous methods by a large margin on ScanNetv2, ScanNet200, and Replica benchmarks, and the results are even close to the fully-supervised counterpart despite the absence of class annotations in the training. Furthermore, extensive qualitative results demonstrate the versatility of our SOLE to language instructions.
