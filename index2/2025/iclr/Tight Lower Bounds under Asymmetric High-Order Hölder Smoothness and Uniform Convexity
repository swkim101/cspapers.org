In this paper, we provide tight lower bounds for the oracle complexity of minimizing high-order H\"older smooth and uniformly convex functions. Specifically, for a function whose $p^{th}$-order derivatives are H\"older continuous with degree $\nu$ and parameter $H$, and that is uniformly convex with degree $q$ and parameter $\sigma$, we focus on two asymmetric cases: (1) $q>p + \nu$, and (2) $q<p+\nu$. Given up to $p^{th}$-order oracle access, we establish worst-case oracle complexities of $\Omega\left( \left( \frac{H}{\sigma}\right)^\frac{2}{3(p+\nu)-2}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}\right)^\frac{2(q-p-\nu)}{q(3(p+\nu)-2)}\right)$ in the first case with an $\ell_\infty$-ball-truncated-Gaussian smoothed hard function and $\Omega\left(\left(\frac{H}{\sigma}\right)^\frac{2}{3(p+\nu)-2}+ \log\log\left(\left(\frac{\sigma^{p+\nu}}{H^q}\right)^\frac{1}{p+\nu-q}\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ in the second case, for reaching an $\epsilon$-approximate solution in terms of the optimality gap. Our analysis generalizes previous lower bounds for functions under first- and second-order smoothness as well as those for uniformly convex functions, and furthermore our results match the corresponding upper bounds in this general setting.
