Graph-language models (GLMs) have demonstrated great potential in graph-based semi-supervised learning. A typical GLM consists of two key stages: graph generation and text embedding, which are usually implemented by inferring a latent graph and finetuning a language model (LM), respectively. However, the former often relies on artificial assumptions about the underlying edge distribution, while the latter requires extensive data annotations. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel GLM that integrates graph generation and text embedding within a unified framework. Specifically, for graph generation, we leverage an inherent characteristic of real edge distribution--the scale-free property--as a structural prior. We unexpectedly find that this natural property can be effectively approximated by a simple k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph. For text embedding, we develop a graph-based pseudo-labeler that utilizes scale-free graphs to provide complementary supervision for improved LM finetuning. Extensive experiments on representative datasets validate our findings on the scale-free structural approximation of KNN graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph generation and text embedding with a real structural prior.
