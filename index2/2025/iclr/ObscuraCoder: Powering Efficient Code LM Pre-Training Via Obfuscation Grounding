Language models (LMs) have become a staple of the code-writing toolbox. Their pre-training recipe has, however, remained stagnant over recent years, barring the occasional changes in data sourcing and filtering strategies. In particular, research exploring modifications to Code-LMs' pre-training objectives, geared towards improving data efficiency and better disentangling between syntax and semantics, has been noticeably sparse, especially compared with corresponding efforts in natural language LMs. In this work, we examine grounding on obfuscated code as a means of helping Code-LMs look beyond the surface-form syntax and enhance their pre-training sample efficiency. To this end, we compile ObscuraX, a dataset of approximately 55M source and obfuscated code pairs in seven languages. Subsequently, we pre-train ObscuraCoder models, ranging in size from 255M to 2.8B parameters, on a 272B-token corpus that includes ObscuraX and demonstrate that our obfuscation-based pre-training recipe leads to consistent improvements in Code-LMs' abilities compared to both vanilla autoregressive pre-training as well as existing de-obfuscation (DOBF) objectives. ObscuraCoder demonstrates sizeable gains across multiple tests of syntactic and semantic code understanding, along with improved capabilities in multilingual code completion, multilingual code commit summarization, and multi-purpose library-oriented code generation.
