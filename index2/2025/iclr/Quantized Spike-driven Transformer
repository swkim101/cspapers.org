Spiking neural networks are emerging as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks due to their spike-driven paradigm. However, recent research in the SNN domain has mainly focused on enhancing accuracy by designing large-scale Transformer structures, which typically rely on substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantized spike-driven Transformer baseline (QSD-Transformer), which achieves reduced resource demands by utilizing a low bit-width parameter. Regrettably, the QSD-Transformer often suffers from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we first conduct empirical analysis and find that the bimodal distribution of quantized spike-driven self-attention (Q-SDSA) leads to spike information distortion (SID) during quantization, causing significant performance degradation. To mitigate this issue, we take inspiration from mutual information entropy and propose a bi-level optimization strategy to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. Specifically, at the lower level, we introduce an information-enhanced LIF to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. At the upper level, we propose a fine-grained distillation scheme for the QSD-Transformer to align the distribution in Q-SDSA with that in the counterpart ANN. By integrating the bi-level optimization strategy, the QSD-Transformer can attain enhanced energy efficiency without sacrificing its high-performance advantage. For instance, when compared to the prior SNN benchmark on ImageNet, the QSD-Transformer achieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy, accompanied by significant reductions of 6.0$\times$ and 8.1$\times$ in power consumption and model size, respectively.
