Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) refers to a scenario where a dynamically changing number of clients collaboratively learn an ever-increasing number of incoming tasks. FCIL is known to suffer from local forgetting due to class imbalance at each client and global forgetting due to class imbalance across clients. We develop a mathematical framework for FCIL that formulates local and global forgetting. Then, we propose an approach called Hybrid Rehearsal (HR), which utilizes latent exemplars and data-free techniques to address local and global forgetting, respectively. HR employs a customized autoencoder designed for both data classification and the generation of synthetic data. To determine the embeddings of new tasks for all clients in the latent space of the encoder, the server uses the Lennard-Jones Potential formulations. Meanwhile, at the clients, the decoder decodes the stored low-dimensional latent space exemplars back to the high-dimensional input space, used to address local forgetting. To overcome global forgetting, the decoder generates synthetic data. Furthermore, our mathematical framework proves that our proposed approach HR can, in principle, tackle the two local and global forgetting challenges. In practice, extensive experiments demonstrate that while preserving privacy, our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on multiple FCIL benchmarks with low compute and memory footprints.
