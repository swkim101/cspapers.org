The construction of Vectorized High-Definition (HD) map typically requires capturing both category and geometry information of map elements. Current state-of-the-art methods often adopt solely either point-level or instance-level representation, overlooking the strong intrinsic relationships between points and instances. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient framework named MGMapNet (Multi-Granularity Map Network) to model map element with a multi-granularity representation, integrating both coarse-grained instance-level and fine-grained point-level queries. Specifically, these two granularities of queries are generated from the multi-scale bird's eye view (BEV) features using a proposed Multi-Granularity Aggregator. In this module, instance-level query aggregates features over the entire scope covered by an instance, and the point-level query aggregates features locally. Furthermore, a Point Instance Interaction module is designed to encourage information exchange between instance-level and point-level queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MGMapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing MapTRv2 by 5.3 mAP on nuScenes and 4.4 mAP on Argoverse2 respectively.
