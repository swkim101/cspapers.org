Causal representation learning (CRL) aims at recovering latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations to solve causal downstream tasks, such as predicting the effect of new interventions or more robust classification. A plethora of methods have been developed, each tackling carefully crafted problem settings that lead to different types of identifiability. These different settings are widely assumed to be important because they are often linked to different rungs of Pearl's causal hierarchy, even though this correspondence is not always exact. This work shows that instead of strictly conforming to this hierarchical mapping, many causal representation learning approaches methodologically align their representations with inherent data symmetries. Identification of causal variables is guided by invariance principles that are not necessarily causal. This result allows us to unify many existing approaches in a single method that can mix and match different assumptions, including non-causal ones, based on the invariance relevant to the problem at hand. It also significantly benefits applicability, which we demonstrate by improving treatment effect estimation on real-world high-dimensional ecological data. Overall, this paper clarifies the role of causal assumptions in the discovery of causal variables and shifts the focus to preserving data symmetries.
