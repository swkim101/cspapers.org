Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods typically require fully observed data to infer parameters of models with intractable likelihood functions. However, datasets often contain missing values due to incomplete observations, data corruptions (common in astrophysics), or instrument limitations (e.g., in high-energy physics applications). In such scenarios, missing data must be imputed before applying any SBI method. We formalize the problem of missing data in SBI and demonstrate that naive imputation methods can introduce bias in the estimation of SBI posterior. We also introduce a novel amortized method that addresses this issue by jointly learning the imputation model and the inference network within a neural posterior estimation (NPE) framework. Extensive empirical results on SBI benchmarks show that our approach provides robust inference outcomes compared to standard baselines for varying levels of missing data. Moreover, we demonstrate the merits of our imputation model on two real-world bioactivity datasets (Adrenergic and Kinase assays). Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/RISE.
