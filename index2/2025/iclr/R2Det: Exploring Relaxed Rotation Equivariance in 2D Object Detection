Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore underlying symmetry in data, improving performance. However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as Symmetry Breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly symmetry after limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: Rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.
