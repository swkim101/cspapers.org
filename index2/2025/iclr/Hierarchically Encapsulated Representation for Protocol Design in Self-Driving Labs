Self-driving laboratories have begun to replace human experimenters in performing single experimental skills or predetermined experimental protocols. However, as the pace of idea iteration in scientific research has been intensified by Artificial Intelligence, the demand for rapid design of new protocols for new discoveries become evident. Efforts to automate protocol design have been initiated, but the capabilities of knowledge-based machine designers, such as Large Language Models, have not been fully elicited, probably for the absence of a systematic representation of experimental knowledge, as opposed to isolated, flatten pieces of information. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-faceted, multi-scale representation, where instance actions, generalized operations, and product flow models are hierarchically encapsulated using Domain-Specific Languages. We further develop a data-driven algorithm based on non-parametric modeling that autonomously customizes these representations for specific domains. The proposed representation is equipped with various machine designers to manage protocol design tasks, including planning, modification, and adjustment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively complement Large Language Models in the protocol design process, serving as an auxiliary module in the realm of machine-assisted scientific exploration.
