Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) optimizes against worst-case distributional shifts within a specified uncertainty set, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen adversarial examples, compared to standard adversarial training which focuses on pointwise adversarial perturbations. However, WDRO still suffers fundamentally from the robust overfitting problem, as it does not consider statistical error. We address this gap by proposing a novel robust optimization framework under a new uncertainty set for adversarial noise via Wasserstein distance and statistical error via Kullback-Leibler divergence, called the Statistically Robust WDRO. We establish a robust generalization bound for the new optimization framework, implying that out-of-distribution adversarial performance is at least as good as the statistically robust training loss with high probability. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which Stackelberg and Nash equilibria exist between the learner and the adversary, giving an optimal robust model in certain sense. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates robust overfitting and enhances robustness within the framework of WDRO.
