We consider the combinatorial volatile Gaussian process (GP) semi-bandit problem. Each round, an agent is provided a set of available base arms and must select a subset of them to maximize the long-term cumulative reward. We study the Bayesian setting and provide novel Bayesian cumulative regret bounds for three GP-based algorithms: GP-UCB, GP-BayesUCB and GP-TS. Our bounds extend previous results for GP-UCB and GP-TS to the infinite, volatile and combinatorial setting, and to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first regret bound for GP-BayesUCB. Volatile arms encompass other widely considered bandit problems such as contextual bandits. Furthermore, we employ our framework to address the challenging real-world problem of online energy-efficient navigation, where we demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the alternatives.
