Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to tackle distribution shifts using unlabeled test data without access to the source data. In the context of multimodal data, there are more complex noise patterns than unimodal data such as simultaneous corruptions for multiple modalities and missing modalities. Besides, in real-world applications, corruptions from different distribution shifts are always mixed. Existing TTA methods always fail in such multimodal scenario because the abrupt distribution shifts will destroy the prior knowledge from the source model, thus leading to performance degradation. To this end, we reveal a new challenge named multimodal wild TTA. To address this challenging problem, we propose two novel strategies: sample identification with interquartile range Smoothing and unimodal assistance, and Mutual information sharing (SuMi). SuMi smooths the adaptation process by interquartile range which avoids the abrupt distribution shifts. Then, SuMi fully utilizes the unimodal features to select low-entropy samples with rich multimodal information for optimization. Furthermore, mutual information sharing is introduced to align the information, reduce the discrepancies and enhance the information utilization across different modalities. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the effectiveness and superiority over existing methods under the complex noise patterns in multimodal data.
