We introduce TetSphere Splatting, a Lagrangian geometry representation designed for high-quality 3D shape modeling. TetSphere splatting leverages an underused yet powerful geometric primitive -- volumetric tetrahedral meshes. It represents 3D shapes by deforming a collection of tetrahedral spheres, with geometric regularizations and constraints that effectively resolve common mesh issues such as irregular triangles, non-manifoldness, and floating artifacts. Experimental results on multi-view and single-view reconstruction highlight TetSphere splatting's superior mesh quality while maintaining competitive reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TetSphere splatting demonstrates versatility by seamlessly integrating into generative modeling tasks, such as image-to-3D and text-to-3D generation.
