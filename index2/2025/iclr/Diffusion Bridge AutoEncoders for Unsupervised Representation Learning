Diffusion-based representation learning has achieved substantial attention due to its promising capabilities in latent representation and sample generation. Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a corresponding representation from a sample and to adjust the dimensionality of a latent variable z. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes information split problem because the diffusion and the auxiliary encoder would divide the information from the sample into two representations for each model. Particularly, the information modeled by the diffusion becomes over-regularized because of the static prior distribution on xT. To address this problem, we introduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enable z-dependent endpoint xT inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure creates an information bottleneck at z, so xT becomes dependent on z in its generation. This results in two consequences: 1) z holds the full information of samples, and 2) xT becomes a learnable distribution, not static any further. We propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and generative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably enhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement. Additionally, DBAE generates high-fidelity samples in the unconditional generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DBAE.
