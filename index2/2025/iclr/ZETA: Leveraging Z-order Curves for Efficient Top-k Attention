Over recent years, the Transformer has become a fundamental building block for sequence modeling architectures. Yet at its core is the use of self-attention, whose memory and computational cost grow quadratically with the sequence length $N$, rendering it prohibitively expensive for long sequences. A promising approach is top-$k$ attention, which selects only the $k$ most relevant tokens and achieves performance comparable to vanilla self-attention while significantly reducing space and computational demands. However, causal masks require the current query token to only attend to past tokens, preventing the existing top-$k$ attention method from efficiently searching for the most relevant tokens in parallel, thereby limiting training efficiency. In this work, we propose ZETA, leveraging \textbf{Z}-Order Curves for \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{T}op-$k$ \textbf{A}ttention, to enable parallel querying of past tokens for entire sequences. % in both space and time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. We first theoretically show that the choice of key and query dimensions involves a trade-off between the curse of dimensionality and the preservation of relative distances after projection. In light of this insight, we propose reducing the dimensionality of keys and queries in contrast to values and further leverage $Z$-order curves to map low-dimensional keys and queries into \emph{one}-dimensional space, which permits parallel sorting, thereby largely improving the efficiency for top-$k$ token selection. Experimental results demonstrate that ZETA matches the performance of standard attention on the synthetic \textsc{Multi-Query Associative Recall} task and outperforms attention and its variants on \textsc{Long Range Arena} and \textsc{WikiText-103} language modeling.
