While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, their real reasoning abilities on multiple evidence retrieval and integration on Multi-hop QA tasks remain less explored. Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate answers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and reasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation quality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA benchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final QA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning abilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes that involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from given passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are annotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for multi-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential data contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we introduce a Step-wise Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs' real reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain evaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of several LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data, deeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs usually bypass the correct reasoning chain, showing an inflated multi-step reasoning performance. We believe that our CofCA benchmark will enhance and facilitate the evaluations of trustworthy LLMs.
