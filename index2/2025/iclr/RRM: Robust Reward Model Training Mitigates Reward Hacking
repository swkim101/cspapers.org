Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, traditional RM training, which relies on response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle prompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response length and format. In this work, we expose a fundamental limitation of current RM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between contextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To address this, we introduce a causal framework that learns preferences independent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique designed to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that our approach successfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward model (RRM). Our RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model trained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to 84.15%. Additionally, we train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM, demonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies, improving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in AlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%.
