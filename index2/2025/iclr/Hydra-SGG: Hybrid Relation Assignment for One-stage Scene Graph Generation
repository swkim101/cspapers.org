DETR introduces a simplified one-stage framework for scene graph generation (SGG) but faces challenges of sparse supervision and false negative samples. The former occurs because each image typically contains fewer than 10 relation annotations, while DETR-based SGG models employ over 100 relation queries. Each ground truth relation is assigned to only one query during training. The latter arises when one ground truth relation may have multiple queries with similar matching scores, leading to suboptimally matched queries being treated as negative samples. To address these, we propose Hydra-SGG, a one-stage SGG method featuring a Hybrid Relation Assignment. This approach combines a One-to-One Relation Assignment with an IoU-based One-to-Many Relation Assignment, increasing positive training samples and mitigating sparse supervision. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that removing self-attention between relation queries leads to duplicate predictions, which actually benefits the proposed One-to-Many Relation Assignment. With this insight, we introduce Hydra Branch, an auxiliary decoder without self-attention layers, to further enhance One-to-Many Relation Assignment by promoting different queries to make the same relation prediction. Hydra-SGG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including VG150 (16.0 mR@50), Open Images V6 (50.1 weighted score), and GQA (12.7 mR@50).
