3D facial reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image is a crucial task in human-centered computer vision tasks. While existing methods can recover accurate facial shapes, there remains significant space for improvement in fine-grained expression capture. Current approaches struggle with irregular mouth shapes, exaggerated expressions, and asymmetrical facial movements. We present TEASER (Token EnhAnced Spatial modeling for Expressions Reconstruction), which addresses these challenges and enhances 3D facial geometry performance. TEASER tackles two main limitations of existing methods: insufficient photometric loss for self-reconstruction and inaccurate localization of subtle expressions. We introduce a multi-scale tokenizer to extract facial appearance information. Combined with a neural renderer, these tokens provide precise geometric guidance for expression reconstruction. Furthermore, TEASER incorporates a pose-dependent landmark loss to further improve geometric performances. Our approach not only significantly enhances expression reconstruction quality but also offers interpretable tokens suitable for various downstream applications, such as photorealistic facial video driving, expression transfer, and identity swapping. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that TEASER achieves state-of-the-art performance in precise expression reconstruction.
