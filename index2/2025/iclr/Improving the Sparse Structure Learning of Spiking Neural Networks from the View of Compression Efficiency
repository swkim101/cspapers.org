The human brain utilizes spikes for information transmission and dynamically reorganizes its network structure to boost energy efficiency and cognitive capabilities throughout its lifespan. Drawing inspiration from this spike-based computation, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed to construct event-driven models that emulate this efficiency. Despite these advances, deep SNNs continue to suffer from over-parameterization during training and inference, a stark contrast to the brain's ability to self-organize. Furthermore, existing sparse SNNs are challenged by maintaining optimal pruning levels due to a static pruning ratio, resulting in either under- or over-pruning. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic structure learning approach for deep SNNs, aimed at maintaining effective sparse training from scratch while optimizing compression efficiency. The first stage evaluates the compressibility of existing sparse subnetworks within SNNs using the PQ index, which facilitates an adaptive determination of the rewiring ratio for synaptic connections based on data compression insights. In the second stage, this rewiring ratio critically informs the dynamic synaptic connection rewiring process, including both pruning and regrowth. This approach significantly improves the exploration of sparse structure training in deep SNNs, adapting sparsity dynamically from the point view of compression efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that this sparse training approach not only aligns with the performance of current deep SNNs models but also significantly improves the efficiency of compressing sparse SNNs. Crucially, it preserves the advantages of initiating training with sparse models and offers a promising solution for implementing edge AI on neuromorphic hardware.
