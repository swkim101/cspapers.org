Visual imitation learning methods demonstrate strong performance, yet they lack generalization when faced with visual input perturbations, including variations in lighting and textures, impeding their real-world application. We propose Stem-OB that utilizes pretrained image diffusion models to suppress low-level visual differences while maintaining high-level scene structures. This image inversion process is akin to transforming the observation into a shared representation, from which other observations stem, with extraneous details removed. Stem-OB contrasts with data-augmentation approaches as it is robust to various unspecified appearance changes without the need for additional training. Our method is a simple yet highly effective plug-and-play solution. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in simulated tasks and show an exceptionally significant improvement in real-world applications, with an average increase of 22.2% in success rates compared to the best baseline.
