Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited"first-class"languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/Language-Imbalance-Driven-Rewarding
