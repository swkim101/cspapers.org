Large scale language models have achieved superior performance in tasks related to natural language processing, however, it is still unclear how model parameters affect performance improvement. Previous studies assumed that individual knowledge is stored in local parameters, and the storage form of individual knowledge is dispersed parameters, parameter layers, or parameter chains, which are not unified. We found through fidelity and reliability evaluation experiments that individual knowledge cannot be localized. Afterwards, we constructed a dataset for decoupling experiments and discovered the potential for localizing data commonalities. To further reveal this phenomenon, this paper proposes a Commonality Neuron Localization (CNL) method, which successfully locates commonality neurons and achieves a neuron overlap rate of 96.42% on the GSM8K dataset. Finally, we have demonstrated through cross data experiments that commonality neurons are a collection of capability neurons that possess the capability to enhance performance.
