This work studies the task of poisoned sample detection for defending against data poisoning based backdoor attacks. Its core challenge is finding a generalizable and discriminative metric to distinguish between clean and various types of poisoned samples (e.g., various triggers, various poisoning ratios). Inspired by a common phenomenon in backdoor attacks that the backdoored model tend to map significantly different poisoned and clean samples within the target class to similar activation areas, we introduce a novel perspective of the circular distribution of the gradients w.r.t. sample activation, dubbed gradient circular distribution (GCD). And, we find two interesting observations based on GCD. One is that the GCD of samples in the target class is much more dispersed than that in the clean class. The other is that in the GCD of target class, poisoned and clean samples are clearly separated. Inspired by above two observations, we develop an innovative three-stage poisoned sample detection approach, called Activation Gradient based Poisoned sample Detection (AGPD). First, we calculate GCDs of all classes from the model trained on the untrustworthy dataset. Then, we identify the target class(es) based on the difference on GCD dispersion between target and clean classes. Last, we filter out poisoned samples within the identified target class(es) based on the clear separation between poisoned and clean samples. Extensive experiments under various settings of backdoor attacks demonstrate the superior detection performance of the proposed method to existing poisoned detection approaches according to sample activation-based metrics.
