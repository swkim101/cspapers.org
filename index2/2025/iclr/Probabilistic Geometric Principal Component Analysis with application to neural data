Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system around the mean of data. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space around the mean. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold, especially for neural data.
