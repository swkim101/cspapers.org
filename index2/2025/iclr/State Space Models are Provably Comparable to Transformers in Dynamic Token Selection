Deep neural networks based on state space models (SSMs) are attracting significant attention in sequence modeling since their computational cost is much smaller than that of Transformers. While the capabilities of SSMs have been demonstrated through experiments in various tasks, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, most theoretical studies discuss the capabilities of SSM layers without nonlinear layers, and there is a lack of discussion on their combination with nonlinear layers. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of SSMs combined with fully connected neural networks, and show that they are comparable to Transformers in extracting the essential tokens depending on the input. As concrete examples, we consider two synthetic tasks, which are challenging for a single SSM layer, and demonstrate that SSMs combined with nonlinear layers can efficiently solve these tasks. Furthermore, we study the nonparametric regression task, and prove that the ability of SSMs is equivalent to that of Transformers in estimating functions belonging to a certain class.
