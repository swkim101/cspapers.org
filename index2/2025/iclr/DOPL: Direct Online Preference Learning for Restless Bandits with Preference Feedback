Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) has been widely used to model constrained sequential decision making problems, where the state of each restless arm evolves according to a Markov chain and each state transition generates a scalar reward. However, the success of RMAB crucially relies on the availability and quality of reward signals. Unfortunately, specifying an exact reward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of preference signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference learning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown environments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and directly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that DOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with preference feedback. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of DOPL.
