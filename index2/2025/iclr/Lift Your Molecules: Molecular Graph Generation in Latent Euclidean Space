We introduce a new framework for molecular graph generation with 3D molecular generative models. Our Synthetic Coordinate Embedding (SyCo) framework maps molecular graphs to Euclidean point clouds via synthetic conformer coordinates and learns the inverse map using an E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN). The induced point cloud-structured latent space is well-suited to apply existing 3D molecular generative models. This approach simplifies the graph generation problem - without relying on molecular fragments nor autoregressive decoding - into a point cloud generation problem followed by node and edge classification tasks. Further, we propose a novel similarity-constrained optimization scheme for 3D diffusion models based on inpainting and guidance. As a concrete implementation of our framework, we develop EDM-SyCo based on the E(3) Equivariant Diffusion Model (EDM). EDM-SyCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in distribution learning of molecular graphs, outperforming the best non-autoregressive methods by more than 30% on ZINC250K and 16% on the large-scale GuacaMol dataset while improving conditional generation by up to 3.9 times.
