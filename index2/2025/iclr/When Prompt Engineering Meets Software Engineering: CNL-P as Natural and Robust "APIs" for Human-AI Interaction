With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are increasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code generation, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the ``APIs''for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices for prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines and templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P), which not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles from software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and strict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a declarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps LLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and higher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on LLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into CNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we develop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic accuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM responses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that CNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the foundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.
