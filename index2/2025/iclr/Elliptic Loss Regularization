Regularizing neural networks is important for anticipating model behavior in regions of the data space that are not well represented. In this work, we propose a regularization technique for enforcing a level of smoothness in the mapping between the data input space and the loss value. We specify the level of regularity by requiring that the loss of the network satisfies an elliptic operator over the data domain. To do this, we modify the usual empirical risk minimization objective such that we instead minimize a new objective that satisfies an elliptic operator over points within the domain. This allows us to use existing theory on elliptic operators to anticipate the behavior of the error for points outside the training set. We propose a tractable computational method that approximates the behavior of the elliptic operator while being computationally efficient. Finally, we analyze the properties of the proposed regularization to understand the performance on common problems of distribution shift and group imbalance. Numerical experiments confirm the utility of the proposed regularization technique.
