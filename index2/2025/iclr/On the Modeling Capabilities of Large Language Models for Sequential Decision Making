Large pretrained models are showing increasingly better performance in reasoning and planning tasks across different modalities, opening the possibility to leverage them for complex sequential decision making problems. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reinforcement learning (RL) across a diversity of interactive domains. We evaluate their ability to produce decision-making policies, either directly, by generating actions, or indirectly, by first generating reward models to train an agent with RL. Our results show that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, LLMs excel at reward modeling. In particular, crafting rewards through artificial intelligence (AI) feedback yields the most generally applicable approach and can enhance performance by improving credit assignment and exploration. Finally, in environments with unfamiliar dynamics, we explore how fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data can significantly improve their reward modeling capabilities while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, further broadening their utility in sequential decision-making tasks.
