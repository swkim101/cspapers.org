Recent advances in 3D generation have been remarkable, with methods such as DreamFusion leveraging large-scale text-to-image diffusion-based models to guide 3D object generation. These methods enable the synthesis of detailed and photorealistic textured objects. However, the appearance of 3D objects produced by such text-to-3D models is often unpredictable, and it is hard for single-image-to-3D methods to deal with images lacking a clear subject, complicating the generation of appearance-controllable 3D objects from complex images. To address these challenges, we present IPDreamer, a novel method that captures intricate appearance features from complex $\textbf{I}$mage $\textbf{P}$rompts and aligns the synthesized 3D object with these extracted features, enabling high-fidelity, appearance-controllable 3D object generation. Our experiments demonstrate that IPDreamer consistently generates high-quality 3D objects that align with both the textual and complex image prompts, highlighting its promising capability in appearance-controlled, complex 3D object generation.
