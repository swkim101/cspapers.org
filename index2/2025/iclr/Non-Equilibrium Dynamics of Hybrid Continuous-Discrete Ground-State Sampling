We propose a general framework for a hybrid continuous-discrete algorithm that integrates continuous-time deterministic dynamics with Metropolis-Hastings steps to combine search dynamics with and without detailed balance. Our purpose is to study the non-equilibrium dynamics that leads to the ground state of rugged energy landscapes in this general setting. Our results show that MH-driven dynamics reach ``easy'' ground states faster, indicating a stronger bias in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the algorithm with reversible transition probabilities. To validate this, we construct a set of Ising problem instances with a controllable bias in the energy landscape that makes one degenerate solution more accessible than another. The constructed hybrid algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in convergence and ground-state sampling accuracy, achieving a 100x speedup on GPUs compared to simulated annealing, making it well-suited for large-scale applications.
