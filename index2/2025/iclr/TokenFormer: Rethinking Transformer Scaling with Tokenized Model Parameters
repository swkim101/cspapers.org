Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs.
