The multi-step sampling mechanism, a key feature of visual diffusion models, has significant potential to replicate the success of OpenAI's Strawberry in enhancing performance by increasing the inference computational cost. Sufficient prior studies have demonstrated that correctly scaling up computation in the sampling process can successfully lead to improved generation quality, enhanced image editing, and compositional generalization. While there have been rapid advancements in developing inference-heavy algorithms for improved image generation, relatively little work has explored inference scaling laws in video diffusion models (VDMs). Furthermore, existing research shows only minimal performance gains that are perceptible to the naked eye. To address this, we design a novel training-free algorithm IV-Mixed Sampler that leverages the strengths of image diffusion models (IDMs) to assist VDMs surpass their current capabilities. The core of IV-Mixed Sampler is to use IDMs to significantly enhance the quality of each video frame and VDMs ensure the temporal coherence of the video during the sampling process. Our experiments have demonstrated that IV-Mixed Sampler achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks including UCF-101-FVD, MSR-VTT-FVD, Chronomagic-Bench-150, and Chronomagic-Bench-1649. For example, the open-source Animatediff with IV-Mixed Sampler reduces the UMT-FVD score from 275.2 to 228.6, closing to 223.1 from the closed-source Pika-2.0.
