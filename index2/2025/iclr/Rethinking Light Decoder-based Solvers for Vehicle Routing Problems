Light decoder-based solvers have gained popularity for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) due to their efficiency and ease of integration with reinforcement learning algorithms. However, they often struggle with generalization to larger problem instances or different VRP variants. This paper revisits light decoder-based approaches, analyzing the implications of their reliance on static embeddings and the inherent challenges that arise. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the light decoder paradigm, the encoder is implicitly tasked with capturing information for all potential decision scenarios during solution construction within a single set of embeddings, resulting in high information density. Furthermore, our empirical analysis reveals that the overly simplistic decoder struggles to effectively utilize this dense information, particularly as task complexity increases, which limits generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Building on these insights, we show that enhancing the decoder capacity, with a simple addition of identity mapping and a feed-forward layer, can considerably alleviate the generalization issue. Experimentally, our method significantly enhances the OOD generalization of light decoder-based approaches on large-scale instances and complex VRP variants, narrowing the gap with the heavy decoder paradigm.
