With the recent development and advancement of Transformer and MLP architectures, significant strides have been made in time series analysis. Conversely, the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis has fallen short of expectations, diminishing their potential for future applications. Our research aims to enhance the representational capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis by introducing novel perspectives and design innovations. To be specific, We introduce a novel time series reshaping technique that considers the inter-patch, intra-patch, and cross-variable dimensions. Consequently, we propose TVNet, a dynamic convolutional network leveraging a 3D perspective to employ time series analysis. TVNet retains the computational efficiency of CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results in five key time series analysis tasks, offering a superior balance of efficiency and performance over the state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Additionally, our findings suggest that TVNet exhibits enhanced transferability and robustness. Therefore, it provides a new perspective for applying CNN in advanced time series analysis tasks.
