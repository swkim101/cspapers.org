Transformer has attracted increasing interest in STVG, owing to its end-to-end pipeline and promising result. Existing Transformer-based STVG approaches often leverage a set of object queries, which are initialized simply using zeros and then gradually learn target position information via iterative interactions with multimodal features, for spatial and temporal localization. Despite simplicity, these zero object queries, due to lacking target-specific cues, are hard to learn discriminative target information from interactions with multimodal features in complicated scenarios (\e.g., with distractors or occlusion), resulting in degradation. Addressing this, we introduce a novel Target-Aware Transformer for STVG (TA-STVG), which seeks to adaptively generate object queries via exploring target-specific cues from the given video-text pair, for improving STVG. The key lies in two simple yet effective modules, comprising text-guided temporal sampling (TTS) and attribute-aware spatial activation (ASA), working in a cascade. The former focuses on selecting target-relevant temporal cues from a video utilizing holistic text information, while the latter aims at further exploiting the fine-grained visual attribute information of the object from previous target-aware temporal cues, which is applied for object query initialization. Compared to existing methods leveraging zero-initialized queries, object queries in our TA-STVG, directly generated from a given video-text pair, naturally carry target-specific cues, making them adaptive and better interact with multimodal features for learning more discriminative information to improve STVG. In our experiments on three benchmarks, TA-STVG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms the baseline, validating its efficacy.
