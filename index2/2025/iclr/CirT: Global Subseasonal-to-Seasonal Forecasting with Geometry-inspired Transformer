Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) climate forecasting is pivotal for decision-making including agriculture planning and disaster preparedness but is known to be challenging due to its chaotic nature. Although recent data-driven models have shown promising results, their performance is limited by inadequate consideration of geometric inductive biases. Usually, they treat the spherical weather data as planar images, resulting in an inaccurate representation of locations and spatial relations. In this work, we propose the geometric-inspired Circular Transformer (CirT) to model the cyclic characteristic of the graticule, consisting of two key designs: (1) Decomposing the weather data by latitude into circular patches that serve as input tokens to the Transformer; (2) Leveraging Fourier transform in self-attention to capture the global information and model the spatial periodicity. Extensive experiments on the Earth Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) reanalysis dataset demonstrate our model yields a significant improvement over the advanced data-driven models, including PanguWeather and GraphCast, as well as skillful ECMWF systems. Additionally, we empirically show the effectiveness of our model designs and high-quality prediction over spatial and temporal dimensions.
