We study the integration of machine learning advice to improve upon traditional data structure designed for efficient search queries. Although there has been recent effort in improving the performance of binary search trees using machine learning advice, e.g., Lin et. al. (ICML 2022), the resulting constructions nevertheless suffer from inherent weaknesses of binary search trees, such as complexity of maintaining balance across multiple updates and the inability to handle partially-ordered or high-dimensional datasets. For these reasons, we focus on skip lists and KD trees in this work. Given access to a possibly erroneous oracle that outputs estimated fractional frequencies for search queries on a set of items, we construct skip lists and KD trees that provably provides the optimal expected search time, within nearly a factor of two. In fact, our learning-augmented skip lists and KD trees are still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant factor. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structures achieves an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list/KD tree construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect. Finally, we empirically show that our learning-augmented search data structures outperforms their corresponding traditional analogs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
