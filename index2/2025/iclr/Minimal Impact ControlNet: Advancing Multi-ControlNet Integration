With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score function's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious generation in areas with silent control signals.
