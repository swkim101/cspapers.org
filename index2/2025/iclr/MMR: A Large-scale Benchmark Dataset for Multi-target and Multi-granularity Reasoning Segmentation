The fusion of Large Language Models with vision models is pioneering new possibilities in user-interactive vision-language tasks. A notable application is reasoning segmentation, where models generate pixel-level segmentation masks by comprehending implicit meanings in human instructions. However, seamless human-AI interaction demands more than just object-level recognition; it requires understanding both objects and the functions of their detailed parts, particularly in multi-target scenarios. For example, when instructing a robot to \textit{turn on the TV"}, there could be various ways to accomplish this command. Recognizing multiple objects capable of turning on the TV, such as the TV itself or a remote control (multi-target), provides more flexible options and aids in finding the optimized scenario. Furthermore, understanding specific parts of these objects, like the TV's button or the remote's button (part-level), is important for completing the action. Unfortunately, current reasoning segmentation datasets predominantly focus on a single target object-level reasoning, which limits the detailed recognition of an object's parts in multi-target contexts. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale dataset called Multi-target and Multi-granularity Reasoning (MMR). MMR comprises 194K complex and implicit instructions that consider multi-target, object-level, and part-level aspects, based on pre-existing image-mask sets. This dataset supports diverse and context-aware interactions by hierarchically providing object and part information. Moreover, we propose a straightforward yet effective framework for multi-target, object-level, and part-level reasoning segmentation. Experimental results on MMR show that the proposed method can reason effectively in multi-target and multi-granularity scenarios, while the existing reasoning segmentation model still has room for improvement.
