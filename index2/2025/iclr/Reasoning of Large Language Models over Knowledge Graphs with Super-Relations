While large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in processing and reasoning over knowledge graphs, current methods suffer from a high non-retrieval rate. This limitation reduces the accuracy of answering questions based on these graphs. Our analysis reveals that the combination of greedy search and forward reasoning is a major contributor to this issue. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the concept of super-relations, which enables both forward and backward reasoning by summarizing and connecting various relational paths within the graph. This holistic approach not only expands the search space, but also significantly improves retrieval efficiency. In this paper, we propose the ReKnoS framework, which aims to Reason over Knowledge Graphs with Super-Relations. Our framework's key advantages include the inclusion of multiple relation paths through super-relations, enhanced forward and backward reasoning capabilities, and increased efficiency in querying LLMs. These enhancements collectively lead to a substantial improvement in the successful retrieval rate and overall reasoning performance. We conduct extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets to evaluate ReKnoS, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of ReKnoS over existing state-of-the-art baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 2.92%.
