We model the evolution of tokens within a deep stack of Transformer layers as a continuous-time flow on the unit sphere, governed by a mean-field interacting particle system, building on the framework introduced in (Geshkovski et al., 2023). Studying the corresponding mean-field Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which can be interpreted as a Wasserstein gradient flow, in this paper we provide a mathematical investigation of the long-term behavior of this system, with a particular focus on the emergence and persistence of meta-stable phases and clustering phenomena, key elements in applications like next-token prediction. More specifically, we perform a perturbative analysis of the mean-field PDE around the iid uniform initialization and prove that, in the limit of large number of tokens, the model remains close to a meta-stable manifold of solutions with a given structure (e.g., periodicity). Further, the structure characterizing the meta-stable manifold is explicitly identified, as a function of the inverse temperature parameter of the model, by the index maximizing a certain rescaling of Gegenbauer polynomials.
