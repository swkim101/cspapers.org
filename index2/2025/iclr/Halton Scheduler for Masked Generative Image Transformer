Masked Generative Image Transformers (MaskGIT) have emerged as a scalable and efficient image generation framework, able to deliver high-quality visuals with low inference costs. However, MaskGIT's token unmasking scheduler, an essential component of the framework, has not received the attention it deserves. We analyze the sampling objective in MaskGIT, based on the mutual information between tokens, and elucidate its shortcomings. We then propose a new sampling strategy based on our Halton scheduler instead of the original Confidence scheduler. More precisely, our method selects the token's position according to a quasi-random, low-discrepancy Halton sequence. Intuitively, that method spreads the tokens spatially, progressively covering the image uniformly at each step. Our analysis shows that it allows reducing non-recoverable sampling errors, leading to simpler hyper-parameters tuning and better quality images. Our scheduler does not require retraining or noise injection and may serve as a simple drop-in replacement for the original sampling strategy. Evaluation of both class-to-image synthesis on ImageNet and text-to-image generation on the COCO dataset demonstrates that the Halton scheduler outperforms the Confidence scheduler quantitatively by reducing the FID and qualitatively by generating more diverse and more detailed images.
