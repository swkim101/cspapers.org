Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for balancing various fairness notions.
