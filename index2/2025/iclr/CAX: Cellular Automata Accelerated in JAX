Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines. However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility. In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research. CAX delivers cutting-edge performance through hardware acceleration while maintaining flexibility through its modular architecture, intuitive API, and support for both discrete and continuous cellular automata in arbitrary dimensions. We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture. Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.
