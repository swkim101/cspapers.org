Distributed training methods are crucial for large language models (LLMs). However, existing distributed training methods often suffer from communication bottlenecks, stragglers, and limited elasticity, particularly in heterogeneous or large-scale environments. Local SGD methods have been proposed to address these issues, but their effectiveness remains limited to small-scale training due to additional memory overhead and lack of concerns on efficiency and stability. To tackle these issues, we propose EDiT, an innovative Efficient Distributed Training method that combines a tailored Local SGD approach with model sharding techniques to enhance large-scale training efficiency. EDiT performs layer-wise parameter synchronization during forward pass, reducing communication and memory overhead and enabling overlap. Besides, EDiT employs a pseudo gradient penalty strategy to suppress loss spikes, which ensures training stability and improves performance. Additionally, we introduce A-EDiT, a fully asynchronous variant of EDiT that accommodates heterogeneous clusters. Building on EDiT/A-EDiT, we conduct a series of experiments to validate large-scale asynchronous training for LLMs, accompanied by comprehensive analyses. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of EDiT/A-EDiT, establishing them as robust solutions for distributed LLM training in diverse computational ecosystems.
