Given the increasing residential Internet use, a thorough understanding of what services are used and how they are delivered to residential networks is crucial. However, access to residential traces is limited due to their proprietary nature. Most prior work used campus datasets from academic buildings and undergraduate dorms, and the few studies with residential traces are often outdated or use data unavailable to other researchers. We provide access to a new residential dataset-we have been collecting traffic from ~1000 off-campus residences that house faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and their families. Although our residents are university affiliates, our dataset captures their activity at home, and we show that this dataset offers a distinct perspective from the campus and dorm traffic. We investigate the serving infrastructures and services accessed by the residences, revealing several interesting findings: peer-to-peer activity is notable, comprising 47% of the total flow duration; third-party CDNs host many services but serve much less traffic (e.g., Cloudflare hosts 19% of domains but only 2% of traffic); and 11 of the top 100 services that have nearby servers often serve users from at least 1,000km farther away. This broad analysis, as well as our data sharing, pushes toward a more thorough understanding of Internet service usage and delivery, motivating and supporting future research. This extended abstract is an abridged version of our full paper.
