This study presents the first global analysis of on-demand video streaming over Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, using data from over one million households across 85 countries. We highlight Starlink's role as a major LEO provider, enhancing connectivity in underserved regions. Our findings reveal that while overall video quality on Starlink matches that of traditional networks, the inherent variability in LEO conditions---such as throughput fluctuations and packet loss---leads to an increase in bitrate switches and rebuffers. To further improve the quality of experience for the LEO community, we manipulate existing congestion control and adaptive bitrate streaming algorithms using simulation and real A/B tests deployed on over one million households. Our results underscore the need for video streaming and congestion control algorithms to adapt to rapidly evolving network landscapes, ensuring high-quality service across diverse and dynamic network types.
