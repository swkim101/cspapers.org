Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate various domains: scientific computation, machine learning, and optimization. Recently, Rydberg atom quantum computing has emerged as a promising quantum computing technology, especially with the demonstration of the zonal addressing architecture. However, this demonstration is only compatible with one type of quantum algorithm, and extending it to compile and execute general quantum algorithms is a challenge. To address it, we propose PachinQo, a framework to co-design the architecture and compilation for zonal addressing systems for any given quantum algorithm. PachinQo's evaluation demonstrates its ability to improve a quantum algorithm's estimated probability of success by 45% on average in error-prone quantum environments.
