We establish a framework that allows us to transfer results between some constraint satisfaction problems with infinite templates and promise constraint satisfaction problems. On the one hand, we obtain new algebraic results for infinite-domain CSPs giving new criteria for NP-hardness. On the other hand, we show the existence of promise CSPs with finite templates that reduce naturally to tractable infinite-domain CSPs in the scope of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture, but that are not finitely tractable, thereby showing a non-trivial connection between those two fields of research. In an important part of our proof, we also obtain uniform polynomial-time algorithms solving temporal constraint satisfaction problems.
