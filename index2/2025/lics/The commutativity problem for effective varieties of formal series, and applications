A formal series in noncommuting variables Σ over the rationals is a mapping ${\Sigma ^{\ast}} \to \mathbb{Q}$ from the free monoid generated by Σ to the rationals. We say that a series is commutative if the value in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input. The commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite presentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it is commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has not been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that constitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer’s varieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series, introduced by Schützenberger in the 1960’s, is well-known to be an effective (pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of formal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata, shuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these models recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their commutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it remarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such disparate computation models.Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of formal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power series for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential equations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks to this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive sequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are effective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.
