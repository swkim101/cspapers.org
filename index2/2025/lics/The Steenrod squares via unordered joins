The Steenrod squares are cohomology operations with important applications in algebraic topology. While these operations are well-understood classically, little is known about them in the setting of homotopy type theory. Although a definition of the Steenrod squares was put forward by Brunerie (2017), proofs of their characterising properties have remained elusive. In this paper, we revisit Brunerie’s definition and provide proofs of these properties, including stability, Cartan’s formula and the Adem relations. This is done by studying a higher inductive type called the unordered join. This approach is inherently synthetic and, consequently, many of our proofs differ significantly from their classical counterparts. Along the way, we discuss upshots and limitations of homotopy type theory as a synthetic language for homotopy theory. The paper is accompanied by a computer formalisation in Cubical Agda.
