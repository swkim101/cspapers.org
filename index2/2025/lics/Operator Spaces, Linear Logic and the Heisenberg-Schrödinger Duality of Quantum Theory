We show that the category OS of operator spaces, with complete contractions as morphisms, is locally countably presentable and a model of Intuitionistic Linear Logic in the sense of Lafont. We then describe a model of Classical Linear Logic, based on OS, whose duality is compatible with the Heisenberg-Schrödinger duality of quantum theory. We also show that OS provides a good setting for studying pure state and mixed state quantum information, the interaction between the two, and even higher-order quantum maps such as the quantum switch.
