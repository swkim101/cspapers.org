The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup F2, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline {\mathbb{Q}} $ . Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC’24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing F2 × F2, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.
