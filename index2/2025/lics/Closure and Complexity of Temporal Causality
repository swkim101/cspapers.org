Temporal causality defines what property causes some observed temporal behavior (the effect) in a given computation, based on a counterfactual analysis of similar computations. In this paper, we study its closure properties and the complexity of computing causes. For the former, we establish that safety, reachability, and recurrence properties are all closed under causal inference: If the effect is from one of these property classes, then the cause for this effect is from the same class. We also show that persistence and obligation properties are not closed in this way. These results rest on a topological characterization of causes which makes them applicable to a wide range of similarity relations between computations. Finally, our complexity analysis establishes improved upper bounds for computing causes for safety, reachability, and recurrence properties. We also present the first lower bounds for all of the classes.
