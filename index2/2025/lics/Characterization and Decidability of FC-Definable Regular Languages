FC is a first-order logic that reasons over all factors of a finite word using concatenation, and can define non-regular languages like that of all squares (ww). In this paper, we establish that there are regular languages that are not FC-definable. Moreover, we give a decidable characterization of the FC-definable regular languages in terms of algebra, automata, and regular expressions. The latter of which is natural and concise: Star-free generalized regular expressions extended with the Kleene star of terminal words.
