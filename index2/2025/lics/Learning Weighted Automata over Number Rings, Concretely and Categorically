We develop a generic reduction procedure for active learning problems. Our approach is inspired by a recent polynomial-time reduction of the exact learning problem for weighted automata over integers to that for weighted automata over rationals (Buna-Marginean et al. 2024). Our procedure improves the efficiency of a category-theoretic automata learning algorithm, and poses new questions about the complexity of its implementation when instantiated to concrete categories.As our second main contribution, we address these complexity aspects in the concrete setting of learning weighted automata over number rings, that is, rings of integers in an algebraic number field. Assuming a full representation of a number ring ${{\mathcal{O}}_K}$, we obtain an exact learning algorithm of ${{\mathcal{O}}_K}$-weighted automata that runs in polynomial time in the size of the target automaton, the logarithm of the length of the longest counterexample, the degree of the number field, and the logarithm of its discriminant. Our algorithm produces an automaton that has at most one more state than the minimal one, and we prove that doing better requires solving the principal ideal problem, for which the best currently known algorithm is in quantum polynomial time.
