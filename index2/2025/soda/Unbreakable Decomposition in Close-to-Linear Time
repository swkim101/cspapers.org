Unbreakable decomposition, introduced by Cygan et al. (SICOMP'19) and Cygan et al. (TALG'20), has proven to be one of the most powerful tools for parameterized graph cut problems in recent years. Unfortunately, all known constructions require at least $\Omega_k\left(mn^2\right)$ time, given an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and cut-size parameter $k$. In this work, we show the first close-to-linear time parameterized algorithm that computes an unbreakable decomposition. More precisely, for any $0<\epsilon\leq 1$, our algorithm runs in time $2^{O(\frac{k}{\epsilon} \log \frac{k}{\epsilon})}m^{1 + \epsilon}$ and computes a $(O(k/\epsilon), k)$ unbreakable tree decomposition of $G$, where each bag has adhesion at most $O(k/\epsilon)$. This immediately opens up possibilities for obtaining close-to-linear time algorithms for numerous problems whose only known solution is based on unbreakable decomposition.
