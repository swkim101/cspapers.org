We study online bipartite edge coloring, with nodes on one side of the graph revealed sequentially. The trivial greedy algorithm is $(2-o(1))$-competitive, which is optimal for graphs of low maximum degree, $\Delta=O(\log n)$ [BNMN IPL'92]. Numerous online edge-coloring algorithms outperforming the greedy algorithm in various settings were designed over the years (e.g., AGKM FOCS'03, BMM SODA'10, CPW FOCS'19, BGW SODA'21, KLSST STOC'22, BSVW STOC'24), all crucially relying on randomization. A commonly-held belief, first stated by [BNMN IPL'92], is that randomization is necessary to outperform greedy. Surprisingly, we refute this belief, by presenting a deterministic algorithm that beats greedy for sufficiently large $\Delta=\Omega(\log n)$, and in particular has competitive ratio $\frac{e}{e-1}+o(1)$ for all $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. We obtain our result via a new and surprisingly simple randomized algorithm that works against adaptive adversaries (as opposed to oblivious adversaries assumed by prior work), which implies the existence of a similarly-competitive deterministic algorithm [BDBKTW STOC'90].
