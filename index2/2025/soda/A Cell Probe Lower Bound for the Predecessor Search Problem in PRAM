We study the predecessor search problem in the classical PRAM model of computation. In this problem, the input is a set of n (cid:96) -bit integers and the goal is to store the input in a data structure of size S ( n ) such that given a query value q , the predecessor of q can be found eﬃciently. This is a very classical problem with an extensive history. We prove a lower bound for this problem in the strongest CRCW PRAM model. A simpliﬁed version of the lower bound states that in a K -processor PRAM model with O (log n )-bit registers, the query requires Ω(log K log n ) worst-case time under the realistic setting where the space is near-linear.
