We study bilateral trade with a broker, where a buyer and seller interact exclusively through the broker. The broker strategically maximizes her payoff through arbitrage by trading with the buyer and seller at different prices. We study whether the presence of the broker interferes with the mechanism's gains-from-trade (GFT) achieving a constant-factor approximation to the first-best gains-from-trade (FB). We first show that the GFT achieves a $1 / 36$-approximation to the FB even if the broker runs an optimal posted-pricing mechanism under symmetric agents with monotone-hazard-rate distributions. Beyond posted-pricing mechanisms, even if the broker uses an arbitrary incentive-compatible (IC) and individually-rational (IR) mechanism that maximizes her expected profit, we prove that it induces a $1 / 2$-approximation to the first-best GFT when the buyer and seller's distributions are uniform distributions with arbitrary support. This bound is shown to be tight. We complement such results by proving that if the broker uses an arbitrary profit-maximizing IC and IR mechanism, there exists a family of problem instances under which the approximation factor to the first-best GFT becomes arbitrarily bad. We show that this phenomenon persists even if we restrict one of the buyer's or seller's distributions to have a singleton support, or even in the symmetric setting where the buyer and seller have identical distributions.
