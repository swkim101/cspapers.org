We consider the foundational problem of maintaining a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum weight matching (MWM) in an $n$-node dynamic graph undergoing edge insertions and deletions. We provide a general reduction that reduces the problem on graphs with a weight range of $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ at the cost of just an additive $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ in update time. This improves upon the prior reduction of Gupta-Peng (FOCS 2013) which reduces the problem to a weight range of $\varepsilon^{-O(1/\varepsilon)}$ with a multiplicative cost of $O(\log n)$. When combined with a reduction of Bernstein-Dudeja-Langley (STOC 2021) this yields a reduction from dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate MWM in bipartite graphs with a weight range of $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ to dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum cardinality matching in bipartite graphs at the cost of a multiplicative $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ in update time, thereby resolving an open problem in [GP'13; BDL'21]. Additionally, we show that our approach is amenable to MWM problems in streaming, shared-memory work-depth, and massively parallel computation models. We also apply our techniques to obtain an efficient dynamic algorithm for rounding weighted fractional matchings in general graphs. Underlying our framework is a new structural result about MWM that we call the"matching composition lemma"and new dynamic matching subroutines that may be of independent interest.
