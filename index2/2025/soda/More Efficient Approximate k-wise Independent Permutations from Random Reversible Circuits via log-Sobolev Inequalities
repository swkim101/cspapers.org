We prove that the permutation computed by a reversible circuit with (cid:101) O ( nk · log(1 /ε )) random 3 -bit gates is ε -approximately k -wise independent. Our bound improves on currently known bounds in the regime when the approximation error ε is not too small. We obtain our results by analyzing the log-Sobolev constants of appropriate Markov chains rather than their spectral gaps.
