We consider the problem of allocating indivisible resources to players so as to maximize the minimum total value any player receives. This problem is sometimes dubbed the Santa Claus problem and its different variants have been subject to extensive research towards approximation algorithms over the past two decades. In the case where each player has a potentially different additive valuation function, Chakrabarty, Chuzhoy, and Khanna [FOCS'09] gave an $O(n^{\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm with polynomial running time for any constant $\epsilon>0$ and a polylogarithmic approximation algorithm in quasi-polynomial time. We show that the same can be achieved for monotone submodular valuation functions, improving over the previously best algorithm due to Goemans, Harvey, Iwata, and Mirrokni [SODA'09], which has an approximation ratio of more than $\sqrt{n}$. Our result builds up on a sophisticated LP relaxation, which has a recursive block structure that allows us to solve it despite having exponentially many variables and constraints.
