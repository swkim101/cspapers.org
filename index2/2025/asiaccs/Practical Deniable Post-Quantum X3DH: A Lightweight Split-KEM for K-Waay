This is the full version of a paper to appear in the proceedings of the 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025). Abstract The Signal Protocol, underpinning secure messaging for billions, faces the challenge of migrating to a post-quantum world while preserving critical properties like asynchrony and deniability. While Signal’s PQXDH key exchange protocol addresses post-quantum confidentiality, full migration of the X3DH protocol remains elusive. Relying on a split KEM ( K - Waay , USENIX ’24) offers a promising migration path, but it has so far suffered from size limitations compared to concurrent works leveraging ring signatures. Thisworkintroduces Sparrow - KEM and Sym - Sparrow - KEM , novel asymmetric and symmetric split KEMs respectively, i.e. for which keys can be used interchangeably for sending and receiving, or only in one direction. They are designed to optimize the K - Waay protocol for size efficiency. Leveraging the MLWE assumption, these constructions reduce by a factor 5 . 1 × the communication of prior post-quantum X3DH based on split KEMs, plus provides a 40 × speedup. Additionally, Sym - Sparrow - KEM is the first symmetric split-KEM to offer deniability, IND-1KCA , and IND-1BatchCCA security, capturing implicit authentication properties. We provide formal security proofs for both schemes, including deniability. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a compact and deniable post-quantum X3DH protocol based on split KEMs.
