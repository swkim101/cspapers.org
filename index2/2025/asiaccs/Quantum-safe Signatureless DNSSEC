We present SL - DNSSEC : a backward-compatible protocol that leverages a quantum-safe KEM and a MAC to perform signature-less ( SL ) DNSSEC validations in a single UDP query/response style. Our experiments targeting NIST level I security for QTYPE A query resolution show that SL - DNSSEC is practically equivalent to the presently deployed RSA-2048 in terms of bandwidth usage and resolution speeds. Compared to post-quantum signatures, SL - DNSSEC reduces bandwidth consumption and resolution times by up to 95% and 60%, respectively. Moreover, with response size < query size ≤ 1232 bytes, SL - DNSSEC obviates the long-standing issues of IP fragmentation, TCP re-transmits and DDoS amplification attacks.
