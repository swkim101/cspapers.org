We present Prism, an UI hardening technique for an Android app to safeguard its widgets against a corrupted kernel. Prism ensures secure interface rendering and allows for visual authentication, which developers could use to enable user intent confidentiality protection. Our design leverages the recent Android Virtualization Framework with minimal changes to the existing UI framework and graphics subsystem. It is much easier to deploy and use Prism on Android phones than TrustZone-based secure UI schemes, because the apps are not admitted to the Secure World and retain their full rights to manage and control their own interfaces. We have implemented the prototype of Prism and a test app on Google Pixel 7 and assessed its security, usability and performance with extensive experiments. The results successfully validate the strength of its security and show unnoticeable latency in most interface operations.
