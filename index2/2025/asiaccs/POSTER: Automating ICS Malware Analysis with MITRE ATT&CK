The increasing interconnections and rapid changes in the nature of cyber threats targeting the Industrial Control Systems (ICS), it is crucial to understand how the malware patterns and behavior have evolved over the years. Gaining the understanding allows us to assess the effectiveness of current detection and defense mechanisms. Insights from this work will help feeding to build effective defenses to counter such sophisticated behavior. Traditional threat analysis methods rely on text heavy representations, making it difficult to identify attack trends efficiently. This work improves the usability of the MITRE ATT&CK framework by automating the extraction, comparison, and visualization of malware attack techniques. By analyzing five ICS targeting malware families BlackEnergy, Industroyer, Industroyer2, Pipedream, and Triton, our developed tool identifies recurring adversary tactics and provides structured heatmaps and network graphs for improved threat intelligence. This approach enables analysts to compare malware behaviors more effectively, prioritize security strategies, and strengthen ICS cybersecurity resilience.
