—Owing to the increasing acceptance of cryptocur-rencies, there has been widespread adaptation of traditional financial applications such as lending, borrowing, margin trading, and more, into the cryptocurrency realm. In some cases, the inherently transparent and unregulated nature of cryptocur-rencies opens users of these applications to attacks. One such attack is frontrunning , where a malicious entity leverages the knowledge of currently unprocessed financial transactions and attempts to get its own transaction(s) executed ahead of the unprocessed ones. The consequences of this can be financial loss, inaccurate transactions, and even exposure to more attacks. We propose FIRST, a framework that prevents frontrunning, and as a secondary effect, also backrunning and sandwich attacks. FIRST is built using cryptographic protocols including verifiable delay functions and aggregate signatures. We formally prove the security of FIRST using the universal composability framework, and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchain data. We show that with FIRST the probability of frontrunning in both chains is near zero.
