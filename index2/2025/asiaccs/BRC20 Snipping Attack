In this paper, we introduce and implement BRC20 sniping attack. Our attack manipulates the BRC20 token transfers in open markets and disrupts the fairness among bidding participants. The long-standing principle of ``highest bidder wins'' is rendered ineffective. Typically, open BRC20 token markets rely on Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) to broadcast selling intents and wait for buying auctions. Our attack targets the BRC20 buying process (i.e., transfer) by injecting a front-running transaction to complete the full signature of the PSBT. At its core, the attack exploits the mempool's fee-based transaction selection mechanism to snipe the victim transaction, replicate metadata, and front-run the legesmate transaction. This attack applies to platforms using PSBT for BRC20 token transfers, including popular Bitcoin exchanges and marketplaces (e.g., Magic Eden, Unisat, Gate.io, OKX). We implemented and tested the attack on a Bitcoin testnet (regtest), validating its effectiveness through multiple experimental rounds. Results show that the attacker consistently replaces legitimate transactions by submitting higher-fee PSBTs. We have also made responsible disclosures to the mentioned exchanges.
