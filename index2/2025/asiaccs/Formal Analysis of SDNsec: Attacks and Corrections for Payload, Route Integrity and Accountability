Modern networks increasingly rely on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to achieve flexibility and efficiency, which makes it more critical to ensure their security. Particularly, it is crucial to ensure the integrity of packets routing within the Network. In this paper, we address key security challenges within SDN architectures with a particular focus on the data plane. We explore these challenges through the lens of a security solution called SDNsec. We identify three fundamental security properties, namely payload integrity, route integrity and accountability. We define these security properties in the formal framework of the applied Π -Calculus. Likewise, we suggest two levels of route integrity: strong and weak, depending on the protocol’s requirements. We use ProVerif, a cryptographic protocol verifier, to conduct a formal analysis of the security of SDNsec. Thanks to our models, we discover several flaws on all the afore-mentioned properties. In response, we propose corrective measures to enhance SDNsec’s security. Moreover, to ensure that such attacks are feasible and that our improvements are effective, we implement and test SDNsec and our corrected solution using the RYU controller and Mininet network emulator.
