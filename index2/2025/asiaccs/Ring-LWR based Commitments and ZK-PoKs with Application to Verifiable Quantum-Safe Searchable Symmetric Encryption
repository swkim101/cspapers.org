Prior research on ensuring trust in delegated computation through lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs mostly rely on Learning-With-Errors ( LWE ) assumption. In this work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge using the Ring Learning with Rounding ( RLWR ) assumption for an interesting and useful class of statements: linear relations on polynomials. We begin by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first efficient commitment scheme in literature based on the hardness of RLWR assumption. We establish two properties on RLWR that aid in the construction of our commitments: 1 ○ closure under addition with double rounding, and 2 ○ closure under multiplication with a short polynomial. Building upon our RLWR commitment scheme, we consequently design a RLWR based Σ 2 protocol for proving knowledge of a single committed message under linear relations with public polynomials. As an use-case of our proposed Σ 2 protocol, we showcase a construction of a quantum-safe Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) scheme by plugging a prior LWR based SSE scheme from (EuroS&P 2023) with our Σ 2 protocol. Concretely, using our Σ 2 protocol for linear relations, we prove the correctness of an encrypted search result in a zero-knowledge manner. We implement our verifiable SSE framework and show that the overhead of an extra verification round is negligible (0 . 0023 seconds) and retains the asymptotic query execution time complexity of the original SSE scheme. Our work establishes results on zero-knowledge proof systems that can be of independent interest. By shifting the setting from RLWE to RLWR , we gain significant 1 ○ efficiency improvements in terms of communication complexity by 𝑂 ( 𝑀 ) (since some prior works on RLWE require rejection sampling by a factor of 𝑀 ), as well as 2 ○ very short proof size (8 . 4 KB) and tighter parameters (since RLWR does not explicitly manipulate
