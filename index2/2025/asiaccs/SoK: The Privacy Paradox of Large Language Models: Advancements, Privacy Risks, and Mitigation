Large language models (LLMs) are sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that enable machines to generate human-like text with remarkable precision. While LLMs offer significant technological progress, their development using vast amounts of user data scraped from the web and collected from extensive user interactions poses risks of sensitive information leakage. Most existing surveys focus on the privacy implications of the training data but tend to overlook privacy risks from user interactions and advanced LLM capabilities. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of privacy in LLMs, categorizing the challenges into four main areas: (i) privacy issues in LLM training data, (ii) privacy challenges associated with user prompts, (iii) privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-generated outputs, and (iv) privacy challenges involving LLM agents. We evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of existing mitigation mechanisms targeting these proposed privacy challenges and identify areas for further research.
