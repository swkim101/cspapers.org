General frameworks such as FlowDroid, IccTA, P/Taint, Amandroid, and DroidSafe have significantly advanced the development of static analysis tools for Android security by providing fundamental facilities for them. However, while these frameworks have been instrumental in fostering progress, they often operate with inherent inefficiencies, such as redundant computations, reliance on separate tools, and unnecessary complexity, which are rarely scrutinized by the analysis tools that depend on them. This paper introduces PacDroid, a new static analysis framework for detecting security vulnerabilities in Android apps. PacDroid employs a simple yet effective pointer-analysis-centric approach that naturally manages alias information, interprocedural value propagation, and all Android features it supports (including ICC, lifecycles, and miscs), in a unified manner. Our extensive evaluation reveals that PacDroid not only outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks in achieving a superior trade-off between soundness and precision (F-measure) but also surpasses them in both analysis speed and robustness; moreover, PacDroid successfully identifies 77 real security vulnerability flows across 23 real-world Android apps that were missed by all other frameworks. With its ease of extension and provision of essential facilities, PacDroid is expected to serve as a foundational framework for various future analysis applications for Android.
