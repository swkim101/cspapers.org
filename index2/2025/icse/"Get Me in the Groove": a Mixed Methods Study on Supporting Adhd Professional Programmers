Understanding the work styles of diverse programmers can help build inclusive workplaces, enabling all software engineers to excel. An estimated 10.6 % of programmers have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition characterized by differences in attention and working memory. Prior work has just begun to explore the impact of ADHD on software development, finding that inadequate support may negatively impact team productivity and employment. This prevents software organizations from benefiting from ADHD-related strengths. To investigate these impacts, we conducted a two-phase mixed methods study. First, we qualitatively analyzed 99 threads (1,658 posts and comments) from r/ADHD_Programmers, the largest public forum dedicated to the ADHD programmer community. We constructed a mapping that reveals how ADHD programmers apply personal strategies and organizational accommodations to address software task-specific challenges. Second, we conducted a large-scale survey of 239 ADHD and 254 non-ADHD professional programmers to validate how our qualitative data generalize to the worldwide developer population. Our results show that ADHD programmers are 1.8 to 4.4 times more likely to struggle more frequently than neurotypical developers with all challenges we consider, but especially with time management and design. Our findings have implications for inclusive and effective tooland policy-building in software workplaces and motivate further research into the experiences of ADHD programmers.
