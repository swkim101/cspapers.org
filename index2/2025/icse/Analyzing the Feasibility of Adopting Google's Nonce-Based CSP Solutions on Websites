Content Security Policy (CSP) is a leading security mechanism for mitigating content injection attacks such as CrossSite Scripting (XSS). Nevertheless, despite efforts from academia and industry, CSP policies (in short, CSPs) are not widely deployed on websites, and deployed CSPs often have security issues or errors. Such low and insecure CSP deployment problems are mainly due to the complexity of the CSP mechanism. Google recently proposed four nonce-based CSP solutions which are simpler and more secure compared to traditional whitelisting-based CSP solutions. Google successfully deployed their nonce-based CSP solutions on over 160 services, covering 62% of all outgoing Google traffic. These nonce-based CSP solutions use simple CSPs but provide fine-grained control of web resources; therefore, if widely adopted on many other websites, they can be very helpful on addressing the low and insecure CSP deployment problems. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of adopting Google's nonce-based CSP solutions on the Tranco top 10K websites. We construct a crawling tool to automatically visit websites, simulate user interactions, and insert four CSPs to collect the CSP violations triggered under them. We investigate the adoptability of the nonce-based CSP solutions, adoption issues, and the stability of adopting them on websites by analyzing the CSP violations triggered under the inserted CSPs. We found that most websites can adopt the nonce-based CSP solutions on all their webpages visited in our study. For websites that cannot, usually the adoption is hard on around 40% of their webpages. Overall, our results are very encouraging and can be helpful in promoting the proper deployment of CSPs on many websites.
