Deep Learning (DL) systems have been widely adopted across various industrial domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent healthcare. As with traditional software, DL systems also need to constantly evolve to meet ever-changing user requirements. However, ensuring the quality of these continuously evolving systems presents significant challenges, especially in the context of testing. Understanding how industry developers address these challenges and what extra obstacles they are facing could provide valuable insights for further safeguarding the quality of DL systems. To reach this goal, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 DL developers from diverse domains and backgrounds. More specifically, our study focuses on exploring the challenges developers encounter in testing evolving DL systems, the practical solutions they employ, and their expectations for extra support. Our results highlight the difficulties in testing evolving DL systems (e.g., regression faults, online-offline differences, and test data collection) and identify the best practices for D L developers to address these challenges. Additionally, we pinpoint potential future research directions to enhance testing effectiveness in evolving DL systems.
