The task of content-type detection—which entails identifying the data encoded in an arbitrary byte sequence—is critical for operating systems, development, reverse engineering environments, and a variety of security applications. In this paper, we introduce Magika, a novel AI-powered content-type detection tool. Under the hood, Magika employs a deep learning model that can execute on a single CPU with just 1MB of memory to store the model's weights. We show that Magika achieves an average F1 score of 99% across over a hundred content types and a test set of more than 1M files, outperforming all existing content-type detection tools today. To foster adoption and improvements, we open source Magika under an Apache 2 license on GitHub and we make our model and training pipeline publicly available. Our tool has already seen adoption by Gmail and Google Drive for attachment scanning, by VirusTotal to aid with malware analysis, and by prominent open-source projects such as Apache Tika. While this paper focuses on the initial version, Magika continues to evolve with support for over 200 content types now available.
