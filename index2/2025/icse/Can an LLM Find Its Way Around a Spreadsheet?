Spreadsheets are routinely used in business and scientific contexts, and one of the most vexing challenges is performing data cleaning prior to analysis and evaluation. The ad-hoc and arbitrary nature of data cleaning problems, such as typos, inconsistent formatting, missing values, and a lack of standardization, often creates the need for highly specialized pipelines. We ask whether an LLM can find its way around a spreadsheet and how to support end-users in taking their free-form data processing requests to fruition. Just like RAG retrieves context to answer users' queries, we demonstrate how we can retrieve elements from a code library to compose data preprocessing pipelines. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the quality of our system and how it is able to continuously augment its vocabulary by saving new codes and pipelines back to the code library for future retrieval.
