Weighted bandwidth allocation is a powerful abstraction that has a wide range of use cases in modern data center networks. However, realizing highly agile and precise weighted bandwidth allocation for large-scale cloud environments is fundamentally challenging. In this paper, we propose S\"{o}ze, a lightweight decentralized weighted bandwidth allocation system that leverages simple network telemetry features of commodity Ethernet switches. Given the flow weights, S\"{o}ze can effectively use the telemetry information to compute and enforce the weighted bandwidth allocations without per-flow, topology, or routing knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of S\"{o}ze through simulations and testbed experiments, improving TPC-H jobs completion time by up to $0.59\times$ and $0.79\times$ on average.
