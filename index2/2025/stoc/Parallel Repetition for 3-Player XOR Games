In a 3-XOR game G, the verifier samples a challenge (x,y,z)∼ µ where µ is a probability distribution over Σ×Γ×Φ, and a map t∶ Σ×Γ×Φ→A for a finite Abelian group A defining a constraint. The verifier sends the questions x, y and z to the players Alice, Bob and Charlie respectively, receives answers f(x), g(y) and h(z) that are elements in A and accepts if f(x)+g(y)+h(z) = t(x,y,z). The value, val(G), of the game is defined to be the maximum probability the verifier accepts over all players’ strategies. We show that if G is a 3-XOR game with value strictly less than 1, whose underlying distribution over questions µ does not admit Abelian embeddings into (ℤ,+), then the value of the n-fold repetition of G is exponentially decaying. That is, there exists c=c(G)>0 such that val(G⊗ n)≤ 2−cn. This extends a previous result of [Braverman-Khot-Minzer, FOCS 2023] showing exponential decay for the GHZ game. Our proof combines tools from additive combinatorics and tools from discrete Fourier analysis.
