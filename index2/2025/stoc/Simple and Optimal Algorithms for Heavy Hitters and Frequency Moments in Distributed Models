We consider the problems of distributed heavy hitters and frequency moments in both the coordinator model and the distributed tracking model (also known as the distributed functional monitoring model). We present simple and optimal (up to logarithmic factors) algorithms for ℓp heavy hitters and Fp estimation (p ≥ 2) in these distributed models. For ℓp heavy hitters in the coordinator model, our algorithm requires only one round and uses Õ(kp−1/p) bits of communication. For p > 2, this is the first near-optimal result. By combining our algorithm with the standard recursive sketching technique, we obtain a near-optimal two-round algorithm for Fp in the coordinator model, matching a significant result from recent work by Esfandiari et al. (STOC 2024). Our algorithm and analysis are much simpler and have better costs with respect to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, our technique provides a one-round algorithm for Fp, which is a significant improvement over a result of Woodruff and Zhang (STOC 2012). Thanks to the simplicity of our heavy hitter algorithms, we manage to adapt them to the distributed tracking model with only a (n) increase in communication. For ℓp heavy hitters, our algorithm has a communication cost of Õ(kp−1/p), representing the first near-optimal algorithm for all p ≥ 2. By applying the recursive sketching technique, we also provide the first near-optimal algorithm for Fp in the distributed tracking model, with a communication cost of Õ(kp−1/2) for all p ≥ 2. Even for F2, our result improves upon the bounds established by Cormode, Muthukrishnan, and Yi (SODA 2008) and Woodruff and Zhang (STOC 2012), nearly matching the existing lower bound for the first time.
