Two matrices are said to be principal minor equivalent if they have equal corresponding principal minors of all orders. We give a characterization of principal minor equivalence and a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to check if two given matrices are principal minor equivalent. Earlier such results were known for certain special cases like symmetric matrices, skew-symmetric matrices with 0, 1, -1-entries, and matrices with no cuts (i.e., for any non-trivial partition of the indices, the top right block or the bottom left block must have rank more than 1). As an immediate application, we get an algorithm to check if the determinantal point processes corresponding to two given kernel matrices (not necessarily symmetric) are the same. As another application, we give a deterministic polynomial-time test to check the equality of two multivariate polynomials, each computed by a symbolic determinant with a rank 1 constraint on coefficient matrices.
