Time efficient decoding algorithms for error correcting codes often require linear space. However, locally decodable codes yield more efficient randomized decoders that run in time n1+o(1) and space no(1). In this work we focus on deterministic decoding. Gronemeier showed that any non-adaptive deterministic decoder for a good code running in time n1+δ must use space n1−δ. In sharp contrast, we show that all typical locally correctable codes have (non-uniform) time and space efficient adaptive deterministic decoders. To obtain the decoders, we devise a new time-space efficient derandomization technique that works by iterative correction. Further, we give a new construction of curve samplers that allow us to uniformly decode Reed-Muller codes time and space efficiently. In particular, for any constant γ > 0, we give asymptotically good Reed-Muller codes that are decodable in time n1 + γ and space nγ by a uniform, deterministic decoder. A related construction allows us to uniformly decode asymptotically good codes based on lifted Reed-Solomon codes in time n1+o(1) and space no(1).
