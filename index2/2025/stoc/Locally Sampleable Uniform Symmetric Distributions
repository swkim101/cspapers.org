We characterize the power of constant-depth Boolean circuits in generating uniform symmetric distributions. Let f∶{0,1}m→{0,1}n be a Boolean function where each output bit of f depends only on O(1) input bits. Assume the output distribution of f on uniform input bits is close to a uniform distribution D with a symmetric support. We show that D is essentially one of the following six possibilities: (1) point distribution on 0n, (2) point distribution on 1n, (3) uniform over {0n,1n}, (4) uniform over strings with even Hamming weights, (5) uniform over strings with odd Hamming weights, and (6) uniform over all strings. This confirms a conjecture of Filmus, Leigh, Riazanov, and Sokolov (RANDOM 2023). This is an extended abstract. The full paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08183v1.
