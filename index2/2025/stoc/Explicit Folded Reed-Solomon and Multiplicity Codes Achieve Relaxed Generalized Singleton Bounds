In this paper, we prove that explicit folded Reed–Solomon (RS) codes and univariate multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bounds for list size L≥1. Specifically, we show the following: (1) Any folded RS code of block length n and rate R over the alphabet Fqs with distinct evaluation points is (L/L+1(1−sR/s−L+1),L) (average-radius) list-decodable for list size L∈[s]. (2) Any univariate multiplicity code of block length n and rate R over the alphabet Fps (where p is a prime) with distinct evaluation points is (L/L+1(1−sR/s−L+1),L) (average-radius) list-decodable for list size L∈[s]. Choosing s=Θ(1/є2) and L=O(1/є), our results imply that both explicit folded RS codes and explicit univariate multiplicity codes achieve list-decoding capacity 1−R−є with optimal list size O(1/є). This exponentially improves the previous state of the art (1/є)O(1/є) established by Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, and Wootters (FOCS 2018 or SICOMP, 2023) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on folded Reed–Solomon codes fully resolve a long-standing open problem originally proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006 or IEEE TIT, 2008). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of (1−R−є,O(1/є)) (average-radius) list-decodable codes of rate R with polynomial-sized alphabets in the literature. Our methodology can also analyze the list-recoverability of folded RS codes. We provide a tighter radius upper bound that states folded RS codes cannot be (L+1−ℓ/L+1(1−mR/m−1)+o(1), ℓ, L) list-recoverable where m=⌈logℓ(L+1)⌉>1. We conjecture this bound is almost tight when L+1=ℓa for any a∈ℕ≥ 2. To give some evidences, we show folded RS codes over the alphabet Fqs are (1/2−sR/s−2,2,3) list-recoverable, which proves the tightness of this bound in the smallest non-trivial special case. As a corollary, our bound states (folded) RS codes cannot be (1−R−є, ℓ, ℓoR(1/є)) list-recoverable, which refutes the possibility that these codes could achieve list-recovery capacity (1−R−є, ℓ, O(ℓ/є)). This implies an intrinsic separation between list-decodability and list-recoverablility of (folded) RS codes.
