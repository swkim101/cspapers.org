Every known communication problem whose randomized communication cost is constant (independent of the input size) can be reduced to k-Hamming Distance, that is, solved with a constant number of deterministic queries to some k-Hamming Distance oracle. We exhibit the first examples of constant-cost problems which cannot be reduced to k-Hamming Distance. To prove this separation, we relate it to a natural coding-theoretic question. For f∶ {2,4,6}→ℕ, we say that an encoding function E∶{0,1}n→{0,1}m is an f-code if it transforms Hamming distances according to dist(E(x),E(y))=f(dist(x,y)) whenever f is defined. We prove that, if there exist f-codes for infinitely many n, then f must be affine: f(4)=(f(2)+f(6))/2.
