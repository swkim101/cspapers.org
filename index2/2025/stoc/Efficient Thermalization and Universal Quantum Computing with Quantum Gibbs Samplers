The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a crucial task in quantum computing. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially or even logarithmically with system size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or "thermofield double" states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative evolutions for inverse temperatures polynomial in the system's size is computationally equivalent to standard quantum computations. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then connecting its convergence to that of the infinite temperature limit. We further present an alternative proof that is based on showing the exponential decay of the so-called oscillator norm, yielding convergence in logarithmic times. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.
