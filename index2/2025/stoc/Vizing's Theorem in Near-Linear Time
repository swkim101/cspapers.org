Vizing’s theorem states that any n-vertex m-edge graph of maximum degree Δ can be edge colored using at most Δ + 1 different colors [Vizing, 1964]. Vizing’s original proof is algorithmic and shows that such an edge coloring can be found in O(mn) time. This was subsequently improved to Õ(m√n) time, independently by [Arjomandi, 1982] and by [Gabow et al., 1985]. Very recently, independently and concurrently, using randomization, this runtime bound was further improved to Õ(n2) by [Assadi, 2024] and Õ(mn1/3) by [Bhattacharya, Carmon, Costa, Solomon and Zhang, 2024] (and subsequently to Õ(mn1/4) by [Bhattacharya, Costa, Solomon and Zhang, 2024]). In this paper, we present a randomized algorithm that computes a (Δ+1)-edge coloring in near-linear time—in fact, only O(mlogΔ) time—with high probability, giving a near-optimal algorithm for this fundamental problem.
