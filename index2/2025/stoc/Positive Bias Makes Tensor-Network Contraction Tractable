Tensor network contraction is a powerful computational tool in quantum many-body physics, quantum information and quantum chemistry. The complexity of contracting a tensor network is thought to mainly depend on its entanglement properties, as reflected by the Schmidt rank across bipartite cuts. Here, we study how the complexity of tensor-network contraction depends on a different notion of quantumness, namely, the sign structure of its entries. We tackle this question rigorously by investigating the complexity of contracting tensor networks whose entries have a positive bias. We show that for intermediate bond dimension d≳ n, a small positive mean value ≳ 1/d of the tensor entries already dramatically decreases the computational complexity of approximately contracting random tensor networks, enabling a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for arbitrary 1/poly(n) multiplicative approximation. At the same time exactly contracting such tensor networks remains #P-hard, like for the zero-mean case. The mean value 1/d matches the phase transition point observed in previous work. Our proof makes use of Barvinok’s method for approximate counting and the technique of mapping random instances to statistical mechanical models. We further consider the worst-case complexity of approximate contraction of positive tensor networks, where all entries are non-negative. We first give a simple proof showing that a multiplicative approximation with error exponentially close to one is at least StoqMA-hard. We then show that when considering additive error in the matrix 1-norm, the contraction of positive tensor network is BPP-complete. This result compares to Arad and Landau’s result, which shows that for general tensor networks, approximate contraction up to matrix 2-norm additive error is BQP-complete. Our work thus identifies new parameter regimes in terms of the positivity of the tensor entries in which tensor networks can be (nearly) efficiently contracted.
