We introduce efficient differentially private (DP) algorithms for several linear algebraic tasks, including solving linear equalities over arbitrary fields, linear inequalities over the reals, and computing affine spans and convex hulls. As an application, we obtain efficient DP algorithms for learning halfspaces and affine subspaces. Our algorithms addressing equalities are strongly polynomial, whereas those addressing inequalities are weakly polynomial. Furthermore, this distinction is inevitable: no DP algorithm for linear programming can be strongly polynomial-time efficient.
