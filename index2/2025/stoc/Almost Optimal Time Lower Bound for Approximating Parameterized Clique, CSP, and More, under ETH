The Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis (PIH), which is an analog of the PCP theorem in parameterized complexity, asserts the following: there is a constant ε> 0 such that for any computable function f:ℕ→ℕ, no f(k)· nO(1)-time algorithm can, on input a k-variable CSP instance with domain size n, find an assignment satisfying 1−ε fraction of the constraints. A recent work by Guruswami, Lin, Ren, Sun, and Wu (STOC’24) established PIH under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). In this work, we improve the quantitative aspects of PIH and prove (under ETH) that approximating sparse parameterized CSPs within a constant factor requires nk1−o(1) time. This immediately implies, for example, that finding a (k/2)-clique in an n-vertex graph with a k-clique requires nk1−o(1) time (assuming ETH). We also prove almost optimal time lower bounds for approximating k-ExactCover and Max k-Coverage. Our proof follows the blueprint of the previous work to identify a ”vector-structured” ETH-hard CSP whose satisfiability can be checked via an appropriate form of ”parallel” PCP. Using further ideas in the reduction, we guarantee additional structures for constraints in the CSP. We then leverage this to design a parallel PCP of almost linear size based on Reed-Muller codes and derandomized low degree testing.
