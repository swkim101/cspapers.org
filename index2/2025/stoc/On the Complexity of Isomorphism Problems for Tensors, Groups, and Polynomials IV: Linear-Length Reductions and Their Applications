By giving new reductions, we show the following algorithmic results and relations between various isomorphism problems: If Graph Isomorphism is in P, then testing equivalence of cubic forms in n variables over a finite field Fq, and testing isomorphism of n-dimensional algebras over Fq, can both be solved in time qO(n), improving from the brute-force upper bound qO(n2) for both of these. Polynomial-time search- and counting-to-decision reduction for testing isomorphism of p-groups of class 2 and exponent p in the Cayley table model. This answers questions of Arvind and Torán (Bull. EATCS, 2005) for this group class, thought to be one of the hardest cases of Group Isomorphism. Combined with the |G|O((log|G|)1/2)-time isomorphism test for p-groups of Frattini class 2 (Ivanyos, Mendoza, Qiao, Sun, and Zhang, FOCS ’24), our reductions extend this runtime to p-groups of exponent p and class c < p. Our reductions show that several other Tensor Isomorphism-complete problems over a finite prime field Fq can be solved in time qÕ(n3/2), where n is the side length. This improves the previous state of the art bound, which was the brute force qO(n2), for the isomorphism problems for cubic forms, algebras, tensors, and more. The key to our reductions is to give new gadgets that improve the parameters of previous reductions around Tensor Isomorphism (Grochow and Qiao, ITCS ’21; SIAM J. Comp., ’23). In particular, several of these previous reductions incurred a quadratic increase in the length of the tensors involved. When the tensors represent p-groups, this corresponds to an increase in the order of the group of the form |G|Θ(log|G|), negating any asymptotic gains in the Cayley table model. We remedy this by presenting a new kind of tensor gadget that allows us to replace those quadratic-length reductions with linear-length ones, yielding the above consequences.
