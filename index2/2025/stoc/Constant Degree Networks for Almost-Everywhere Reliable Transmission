In the almost-everywhere reliable message transmission problem, introduced by [Dwork, Pippenger, Peleg, Upfal’86], the goal is to design a sparse communication network G that supports efficient, fault-tolerant protocols for interactions between all node pairs. By fault-tolerant, we mean that that even if an adversary corrupts a small fraction of vertices in G, then all but a small fraction of vertices can still communicate perfectly via the constructed protocols. Being successful to do so allows one to simulate, on a sparse graph, any fault-tolerant distributed computing task and secure multi-party computation protocols built for a complete network, with only minimal overhead in efficiency. Previous works on this problem achieved either constant-degree networks tolerating o(1) faults, constant-degree networks tolerating a constant fraction of faults via inefficient protocols (exponential work complexity), or poly-logarithmic degree networks tolerating a constant fraction of faults. We show a construction of constant-degree networks with efficient protocols (i.e., with polylogarithmic work complexity) that can tolerate a constant fraction of adversarial faults, thus solving the main open problem of Dwork et al.. Our main contribution is a composition technique for communication networks, based on graph products. Our technique combines two networks tolerant to adversarial edge-faults to construct a network with a smaller degree while maintaining efficiency and fault-tolerance. We apply this composition result multiple times, using the polylogarithmic-degree edge-fault tolerant networks constructed in a recent work of [Bafna, Minzer, Vyas’24] (that are based on high-dimensional expanders) with itself, and then with the constant-degree networks (albeit with inefficient protocols) of [Upfal’92].
