The complexity classification of the Holant problem has remained unresolved for the past fifteen years. Counting complex-weighted Eulerian orientations problems, denoted as #EO, is regarded as one of the most significant challenges to the comprehensive complexity classification of the Holant problem. This article presents an FPNP vs. #P dichotomy for #EO, demonstrating that #EO defined by a signature set is either #P-hard or polynomial-time computable with a specific NP oracle. This result provides a complete complexity classification for #EO, and potentially leads to a dichotomy for the Holant problem. Furthermore, we derive three additional dichotomies related to the Holant problem from that for #EO.
