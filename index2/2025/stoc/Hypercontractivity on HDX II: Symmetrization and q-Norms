Bourgain’s symmetrization theorem is a powerful technique reducing boolean analysis on product spaces to the cube. It states that for any product Ωi⊗ d, function f: Ωi⊗ d → , and q > 1: ||T_1/2f(x)||_q ≤||f(r,x)||_q ≤||T_c_qf(x)||_q where Tρf = ∑ρSf=S is the noise operator and f(r,x) = ∑rSf=S(x) ‘symmetrizes’ f by convolving its Fourier components {f=S}S ⊆ [d] with a random boolean string r ∈ {± 1}d. In this work, we extend the symmetrization theorem to high dimensional expanders (HDX). Building on (O’Donnell and Zhao 2021), we show this implies nearly-sharp (2→q)-hypercontractivity for partite HDX. This resolves the main open question of (Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu STOC 2022) and gives the first fully hypercontractive subsets X ⊂ [n]d of support n·exp((d)), an exponential improvement over Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett’s n·exp(exp(d)) bound (BHKL STOC 2022). Adapting (Bourgain JAMS 1999), we also give the first booster theorem for HDX, resolving a main open question of BHKL. Our proof is based on two elementary new ideas in the theory of high dimensional expansion. First we introduce ‘q-norm HDX’, generalizing standard spectral notions to higher moments, and observe every spectral HDX is a q-norm HDX. Second, we introduce a simple method of coordinate-wise analysis on HDX which breaks high dimensional random walks into coordinate-wise components and allows each component to be analyzed as a 1-dimensional operator locally within X. This allows for application of standard tricks such as the replacement method, greatly simplifying prior analytic techniques. This is an extended abstract.
