We exhibit a monotone function computable by a monotone circuit of quasipolynomial size such that any monotone circuit of polynomial depth requires exponential size. This is the first sizeâ€“depth tradeoff result for monotone circuits in the so-called supercritical regime. Our proof is based on an analogous result in proof complexity: We introduce a new family of unsatisfiable 3-CNF formulas (called bracket formulas) that admit resolution refutations of quasipolynomial size while any refutation of polynomial depth requires exponential size.
