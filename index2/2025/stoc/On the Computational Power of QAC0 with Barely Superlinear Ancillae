QAC0 is the family of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits consisting of arbitrary single qubit unitaries and multi-qubit Toffoli gates. It was introduced by Moore as a quantum counterpart of AC0, along with the conjecture that QAC0 circuits can not compute PARITY. In this work we make progress on this longstanding conjecture: we show that any depth-d QAC0 circuit requires n1+3−d ancillae to compute a function with approximate degree Θ(n), which includes PARITY, MAJORITY and MODk. We further establish superlinear lower bounds on quantum state synthesis and quantum channel synthesis. This is the first superlinear lower bound on the super-linear sized QAC0. Regarding PARITY, we show that any further improvement on the size of ancillae to n1+exp(−o(d)) would imply that PARITY ∉ QAC0. These lower bounds are derived by giving low-degree approximations to QAC0 circuits. We show that a depth-d QAC0 circuit with a ancillae, when applied to low-degree operators, has a degree (n+a)1−3−d polynomial approximation in the spectral norm. This implies that the class QLC0, corresponding to linear size QAC0 circuits, has approximate degree o(n). This is a quantum generalization of the result that LC0 circuits have approximate degree o(n) by Bun, Robin, and Thaler. Our result also implies that QLC0≠NC1.
