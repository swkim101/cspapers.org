Roughly, a metric space has padding parameter β if for every Δ>0, there is a stochastic decomposition of the metric points into clusters of diameter at most Δ such that every ball of radius γΔ is contained in a single cluster with probability at least e−γβ. The padding parameter is an important characteristic of a metric space with vast algorithmic implications. In this paper we prove that the shortest path metric of every Kr-minor-free graph has padding parameter O(logr), which is also tight. This resolves a long standing open question, and exponentially improves the previous bound. En route to our main result, we construct sparse covers for Kr-minor-free graphs with improved parameters, and we prove a general reduction from sparse covers to padded decompositions.
