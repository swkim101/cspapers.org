A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan, and Yang (STOCâ€™23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game, and we also provide a corresponding self-testing result. Our results employ techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. They further rely on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations, which may be of independent interest.
