We study functions f : [0, 1]d → [0, 1]d that are both monotone and contracting, and we consider the problem of finding an ε-approximate fixed point of f. We show that the problem lies in the complexity class UEOPL. We give an algorithm that finds an ε-approximate fixed point of a three-dimensional monotone contraction using O(log(1/ε)) queries to f. We also give a decomposition theorem that allows us to use this result to obtain an algorithm that finds an ε-approximate fixed point of a d-dimensional monotone contraction using O((c · log(1/ε))⌈ d / 3 ⌉) queries to f for some constant c. Moreover, each step of both of our algorithms takes time that is polynomial in the representation of f. These results are strictly better than the best-known results for functions that are only monotone, or only contracting. All of our results also apply to Shapley stochastic games, which are known to be reducible to the monotone contraction problem. Thus we put Shapley games in UEOPL, and we give a faster algorithm for approximating the value of a Shapley game.
