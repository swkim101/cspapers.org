We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating QMA from QCMA. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called “dense” distributions. Our result can be viewed as establishing a “win-win” scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of QMA from QCMA, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.
