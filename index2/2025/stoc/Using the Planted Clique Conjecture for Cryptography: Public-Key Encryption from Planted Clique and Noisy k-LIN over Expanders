We give a public key encryption scheme that is provably secure against poly-size adversaries, assuming nlogαn hardness of the standard planted clique conjecture, for any α ∈ (0,1), and a relatively mild hardness conjecture about noisy k-LIN over expanders that is not known to imply public-key encryption on its own. Both of our conjectures correspond to natural average-case variants of NP-complete problems and have been studied for multiple decades, with unconditional lower bounds supporting them in a variety of restricted models of computation. Our encryption scheme answers an open question in a seminal work by Applebaum, Barak, and Wigderson [STOC’10].
