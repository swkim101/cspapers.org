We construct quantum codes that support transversal CCZ gates over qudits of arbitrary prime power dimension q (including q=2) such that the code dimension and distance grow linearly in the block length. The only previously known construction with such linear dimension and distance required a growing alphabet size q (KrishnaTillich, 2019). Our codes imply protocols for magic state distillation with vanishing yield parameter (i.e. with sub-polylogarithmic overhead) as the block length grows. It was previously an open question to obtain such a protocol with a constant alphabet size q. We construct our codes by combining two modular components, namely, (i) a black-box transformation from classical codes satisfying certain properties to quantum codes supporting transversal CCZ gates, and (ii) a concatenation scheme for reducing the alphabet size of codes supporting transversal CCZ gates. For this scheme we introduce a quantum analogue of multiplication-friendly codes, which provide a way to express multiplication over a field in terms of a subfield. We obtain our asymptotically good construction by instantiating (i) with algebraic-geometric codes, and applying a constant number of iterations of (ii). We also give an alternative construction with nearly asymptotically good parameters (k,d=n/2O(log*n)) by instantiating (i) with Reed-Solomon codes and then performing a superconstant number of iterations of (ii).
