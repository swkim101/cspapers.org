A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet’s paradox which says that in an election where n voters rank m candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters? Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size 2 may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size 6 always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if α/1 − lnα ≥ 2/k + 1, then there always exists a committee of size k such that less than an α fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all k ≥ 2. Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.
