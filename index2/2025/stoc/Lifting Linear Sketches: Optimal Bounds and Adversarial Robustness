We introduce a novel technique for “lifting” dimension lower bounds for linear sketches in the real-valued setting to dimension lower bounds for linear sketches with polynomially-bounded integer entries when the input is a polynomially-bounded integer vector. Using this technique, we obtain the first optimal sketching lower bounds for discrete inputs in a data stream, for classical problems such as approximating the frequency moments, estimating the operator norm, and compressed sensing. Additionally, we lift the adaptive attack of Hardt and Woodruff (STOC, 2013) for breaking any real-valued linear sketch via a sequence of real-valued queries, and show how to obtain an attack on any integer-valued linear sketch using integer-valued queries. This shows that there is no linear sketch in a data stream with insertions and deletions that is adversarially robust for approximating any Lp norm of the input, resolving a central open question for adversarially robust streaming algorithms. To do so, we introduce a new pre-processing technique of independent interest which, given an integer-valued linear sketch, increases the dimension of the sketch by only a constant factor in order to make the orthogonal lattice to its row span smooth. This pre-processing then enables us to leverage results in lattice theory on discrete Gaussian distributions and reason that efficient discrete sketches imply efficient continuous sketches. Our work resolves open questions from the Banff ’14 and ’17 workshops on Communication Complexity and Applications, as well as the STOC ’21 and FOCS ’23 workshops on adaptivity and robustness.
