Neural fields are now the central focus of research in 3D vision and computer graphics. Existing methods mainly focus on various scene representations, such as neural points and 3D Gaussians. However, few works have studied the rendering process to enhance the neural fields. In this work, we propose a plug-in method named K-Buffers that leverages multiple buffers to improve the rendering performance. Our method first renders K buffers from scene representations and constructs K pixel-wise feature maps. Then, We introduce a K-Feature Fusion Network (KFN) to merge the K pixel-wise feature maps. Finally, we adopt a feature decoder to generate the rendering image. We also introduce an acceleration strategy to improve rendering speed and quality. We apply our method to well-known radiance field baselines, including neural point fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the rendering performance of neural point fields and 3DGS.
