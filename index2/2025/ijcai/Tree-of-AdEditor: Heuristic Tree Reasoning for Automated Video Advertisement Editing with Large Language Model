Video advertising has become a popular marketing strategy on e-commerce platforms, requiring high-level semantic reasoning like selling point discovery, narrative organization. Previous rule-based methods struggle with these complex tasks, and learning-based approaches demand large datasets and high training costs. Recently, Large Language Models have opened incredible opportunities for advancing intelligent video advertisement editing. However, Input-output (IO) prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) struggle to adapt to the nonlinear thinking hierarchy of video editing, where editors iteratively select shots or revert them to explore potential editing solutions. While Tree-of-Thought (ToT) offers a conceptual structure that mirrors this hierarchy, it falls short in aligning with effective video advertising strategies and lacks robust fact-checking mechanisms. To address these, we propose a novel framework, Tree-of-AdEditor (ToAE), which constructs a reasoning tree to mimic human editors, and incorporates domain-specific theories and heuristic fact-checking to identify optimal editing solutions. Specifically, motivated by effective advertisement principles, we develop a "local-global" mechanism to guide LLM in both the shot level and sequence level decision-making. We introduce a visual incoherence pruning module to provide external heuristic fact-checking, ensuring visual attractiveness and reducing computation costs. Quantitative experiments and expert evaluation demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to baselines.
