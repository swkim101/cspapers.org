Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) provides detailed subterranean insights. Nevertheless, underground diagnosis via GPR is hindered by the fact that training data typically contain only normal samples, along with the complexity of GPR data’s wave-collection characteristics. This paper proposes subsurface anomaly detection within the Cubic Correlation Reservoir Network (CuCoRes) model space. CuCoRes incorporates three reservoirs with spatial correlation adjustment in each direction to adequately and accurately capture multi-directional dynamics (i.e., changing information) within GPR data. Fitting GPR data with CuCoRes and representing data with fitted models, the original GPR data is mapped into a category-discriminative CuCoRes model space, where anomalies could be efficiently identified and categorized based on model dissimilarities. Our approach leverages only limited normal GPR data, easily accessible, to support subsequent anomaly detection and categorization, enhancing its applicability in practical scenarios. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate its effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art.
