Existing research in Stock Trend Prediction (STP) focuses on temporal features extracted from a temporal sequence of stock data with a look-back window, which frequently leads to the omission of important periodic patterns, such as weekly and monthly variations in stock prices. Furthermore, these methods examine stocks individually, ignoring the temporal variation patterns among stocks that share higher-order relationships, like those within the same industry. These relationships typically provide contextual insights into market investments influencing stock price fluctuations. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multi-Scale Temporal Neural Network (MSTNN) framework tailored for STP. This architecture explores the periodic fluctuation behaviors of individual stocks through an innovative 3D convolutional neural network, alongside examining temporal variation patterns of stocks linked to specific industries via a temporal hypergraph attention mechanism. Empirical results from two real-world benchmark datasets show that MSTNN significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art STP methods.
