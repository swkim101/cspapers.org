With the rapid advancements in quantum computing, cloud-based quantum services have gained increasing prominence. However, due to quantum noise, optimizing the deployment of quantum circuits remains an NP-hard problem with an expansive search space. Existing methods usually use heuristic algorithms to approximate the solution, such as the representative IBM Qiskit. On the one hand, they often find suboptimal deployment solutions. On the other hand, prior technologies do not consider user-specific requirements and can only provide a single deployment strategy. In this paper, we propose QCDeploy that can provide a ranked list of effective deployment strategies to optimize quantum serverless circuit deployment. Specifically, we model quantum circuits as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representations and utilize graph contrastive learning for vector embedding. Then, a tailored list-aware learning-to-rank architecture is employed to generate a list of candidate strategies (prioritizing better strategies). We conduct extensive evaluations involving 45 prevalent quantum algorithm circuits across 3~5 qubits, utilizing 3 IBM quantum physical devices with three types of chip topologies. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms IBMQ's default deployment scheme, e.g., achieving 17.95% overhead reduction and increasing the execution success rate by 20%~40%.
