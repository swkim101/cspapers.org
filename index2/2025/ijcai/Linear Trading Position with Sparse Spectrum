The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We also develop a Krasnosel'skii-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves good and robust performance in various situations.
