Thousands of Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are estimated to be operating in the United States by disguising themselves as legitimate establishments while exploiting trafficked workers, harming both the victims and the massage industry. The increasing digital presence of these illicit businesses presents an opportunity for detection, a crucial task for law enforcement and social service agencies aiming to disrupt their operations. Our research leverages user-generated business reviews from Yelp.com, enriched with data from multiple sources, including RubMaps.ch, U.S. Census records, GIS data, and licensing information. We present a feasibility study of developing a graph convolutional network (GCN) for a novel application and exploring its benefits and drawbacks in identifying IMBs. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to link and analyze businesses, reviews, and reviewers within a heterogeneous network and employ a relational GCN to capture their complex relationships.
