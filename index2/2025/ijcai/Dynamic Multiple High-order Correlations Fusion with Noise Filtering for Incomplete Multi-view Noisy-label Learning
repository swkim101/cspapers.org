Multi-view multi-label data often suffers from incomplete feature views and label noise. This paper is the first to address both challenges simultaneously, rectifying critical deficiencies in existing methodologies that inadequately extract and fuse high-order structural correlations across views while lacking robust solutions to mitigate label noise. We introduce a dynamic multiple high-order correlations fusion with noise filtering, specifically designed for incomplete multi-view noisy-label learning. By capitalizing on a dynamic multi-hypergraph neural network, inspired by the principles of ensemble learning, we adeptly capture and integrate high-order correlations among samples from different views. The model's capability is further augmented through an innovative hypergraph fusion technique based on random walk theory, which empowers it to seamlessly amalgamate both structural and feature information. Moreover, we propose sophisticated noise-filtering matrices that are tightly embedded within the hypergraph neural network, devised to counteract the detrimental impact of label noise. Recognizing that label noise perturbs the data distribution in the label space, these filtering matrices exploit the distributional disparities between feature and label spaces. The high-order structural information derived from both domains underpins the learning and efficacy of the noise-filtering matrices. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets unequivocally demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art techniques.
