Possibilistic logic is forty years old. Possibilistic logic is a logic that handles classical logic formulas

associated with weights taking values in a linearly ordered set or more generally in a lattice. Over the

decades, possibilistic logic has undergone numerous developments at both theoretical and applied

levels. The ambition of this article is to review all these developments while exposing the main ideas

behind them.
