We survey the notion of control in various areas of computational social choice (COMSOC) such as voting, fair allocation, cooperative game theory, matching under preferences, and group identification. In all these scenarios, control can be exerted, for instance, by adding or deleting agents with the goal of influencing the outcome. We conclude by briefly covering control in some other COMSOC areas including participatory budgeting, judgment aggregation, and opinion diffusion.
