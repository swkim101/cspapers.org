The rapid improvement of deep learning models with the integration of the physical world has dramatically improved embodied AI capabilities. Meanwhile, the powerful embodied AI models and their scales place an increasing burden on deployment efficiency. The efficiency issue is more apparent on embodied AI platforms than on data centers because they have more limited computational resources and memory bandwidth. Meanwhile, most embodied AI scenarios, like autonomous driving and robotics, are more sensitive to fast responses. Theoretically, the traditional model compression techniques can help embodied AI models with more efficient computation, lower memory and energy consumption, and reduced latency. Because the embodied AI models are expected to interact with the physical world, the corresponding compressed models are also expected to resist natural corruption caused by real-world events such as noise, blur, weather conditions, and even adversarial corruption. This paper explores the novel paradigm to boost the efficiency of the embodied AI models and the robust compression boundary. The efficacy of our method has been proven to find the optimal balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions.
