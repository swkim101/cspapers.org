Quality diversity (QD) algorithms, an extension of evolutionary algorithms, excel at generating diverse sets of high-quality solutions for complex problems in robotics, games, and combinatorial optimisation. Despite their success, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood due to a lack of a theoretical foundation. We address this gap by analysing QD algorithms on the all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) problem, a classical planning task that naturally seeks multiple solutions. Using Map-Elites, a prominent QD approach, we leverage its ability to evolve solutions across distinct regions of a behavioural space, which for APSP corresponds to all pairs of nodes in the graph.



Our analysis rigorously demonstrates that evolutionary algorithms using Map-Elites efficiently compute shortest paths for all node pairs in parallel by exploiting synergies in the behavioural space. By appending edges to an existing shortest path, mutation can create optimal solutions in other regions of the behavioural space. Crossover is particularly effective, as it can combine optimal paths from two regions to produce an optimal path for a third region simply by concatenating two shortest paths. Finally, refining the parent selection to facilitate successful crossovers exhibits significant speed-ups compared to standard QD approaches.
