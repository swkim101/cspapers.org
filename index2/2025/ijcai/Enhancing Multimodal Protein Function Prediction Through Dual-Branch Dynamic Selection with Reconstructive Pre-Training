Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information, ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features. Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO, MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.
