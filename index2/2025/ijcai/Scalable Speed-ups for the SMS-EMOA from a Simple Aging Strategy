Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception, a stochastic selection mechanism was recently proposed for the SMS-EMOA and was proven to speed up computing the Pareto front of the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size n and gap parameter k by a factor of max{1,2^(k/4)/n}. While this constitutes the first proven speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for k ≥ 4log(n), where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging, which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal. This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up by a factor of max{1,Θ(k)^(k-1)}, regardless of the number of objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for constant k, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed. Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than stochastic selection mechanisms.
