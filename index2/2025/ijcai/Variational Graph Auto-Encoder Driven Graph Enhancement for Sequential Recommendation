Recommender systems play a critical role in many applications by providing personalized recommendations based on user interactions. However, it remains a major challenge to capture complex sequential patterns and address noise in user interaction data. While advanced neural networks have enhanced sequential recommendation by modeling high-order item dependencies, they typically assume that the noisy interaction data as the user's preferred preferences. This assumption can lead to suboptimal recommendation results. We propose a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder driven Graph Enhancement (VGAE-GE) method for robust augmentation in sequential recommendation. Specifically, our method first constructs an item transition graph to capture higher-order interactions and employs a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) to generate latent variable distributions. By utilizing these latent variable distributions for graph reconstruction, we can improve the item representation. Next, we use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to transform these latent variables into embeddings and infer more robust user representations from the updated item embeddings. Finally, we obtain the reconstructed user check-in data, and then use a Mamba-based recommender to make the recommendation process more efficient and the recommendation results more accurate. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our VGAE-GE model improves recommendation performance and robustness.
