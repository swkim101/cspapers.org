Conventional image set methods typically learn from image sets stored in a single location. However, in real-world applications, image sets are often distributed across different locations. Learning from such distributed sets using deep neural networks poses challenges for efficient image set classification and retrieval. To address this, we propose Distributed Cascade Manifold Hashing Network (DCMHN) for compact image set representation. DCMHN represents each image set using an SPD manifold and utilizes a manifold hashing network to generate hash codes, enabling efficient classification and retrieval. The network is trained in a cascaded manner, where the bilinear mapping in the BiMap layer is learned first, followed by joint learning of the hash function and classifier in the hash layer. DCMHN enforces local consistency on global variables across neighboring nodes, allowing parallel optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image set datasets demonstrate that the proposed DCMHN achieves competitive accuracies in distributed settings, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in terms of computation and storage efficiency.
