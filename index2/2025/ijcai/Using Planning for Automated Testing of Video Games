In this demonstration, we present a system that automates regression testing for video games using automated planning techniques. Traditional test scripts are a common method for testing both video games and software in general. While effective, they require manual creation and frequent updates throughout development, making the process labor-intensive. Our system eliminates this burden by automatically generating and maintaining test scripts. The test engineer only needs to define the game’s rules using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and specify initial states and goals for individual test cases. This significantly reduces human effort while ensuring test scripts remain up to date. Additionally, our system integrates with game engine editors—supporting both Unity and Unreal to execute and evaluate test cases directly within the game. It collects detailed logs, telemetry data, and video recordings, allowing users to review test results efficiently.
