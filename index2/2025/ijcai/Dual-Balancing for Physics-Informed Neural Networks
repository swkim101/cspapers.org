Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new learning paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing the constraints of physical equations, boundary conditions (BCs), and initial conditions (ICs) into the loss function. Despite their successes, vanilla PINNs still suffer from poor accuracy and slow convergence due to the intractable multi-objective optimization issue. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by integrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance issues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance between PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an aggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies. Intra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in fitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting difficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the aggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its fitting difficulty level. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy to prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values caused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DB-PINN achieves significantly superior performance than those popular gradient-based weighting methods in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy.
