Textbook reading has long dominated classical poetry education in Chinese-speaking communities. However, research has shown that extensive text-based learning can lead to learner disengagement and a less pleasant experience. This paper aims to improve the experience of classical Chinese poetry learning by introducing LivePoem—a system that generates musical storyboards (storyboards with background music) as audiovisual aids to support poetry comprehension. We employ a pre-trained diffusion model for storyboard generation and train a prosody-based poem-to-melody generator using a Transformer model, both validated by standard objective metrics to ensure generation quality. Through a within-subjects study involving 25 non-native Chinese learners, we compared learning outcomes from textbook reading and musical storyboard viewing through standardised reading comprehension tests. Additionally, the learning experience was assessed by the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) and an inductive thematic analysis of learners' open-ended feedback. Experimental results show that musical storyboards retained the learning outcomes of textbooks, while more effectively engaging learners and providing a more pleasant learning experience.
