Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.
