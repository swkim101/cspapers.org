Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for deploying deep learning models in real-life applications. Recent studies have proposed optimization-based learning paradigms to establish task-shared representations in MTL. However, our paper empirically argues that these studies, specifically gradient-based ones, primarily emphasize the conflict issue while neglecting the potentially more significant impact of imbalance/dominance in MTL. In line with this perspective, we enhance the existing baseline method by injecting imbalance-sensitivity through the imposition of constraints on the projected norms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IMbalance-sensitive Gradient (IMGrad) descent method, we evaluate it on multiple mainstream MTL benchmarks, encompassing supervised learning tasks as well as reinforcement learning. The experimental results consistently demonstrate competitive performance.
