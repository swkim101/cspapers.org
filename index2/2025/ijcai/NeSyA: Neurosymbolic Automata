Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged as a promising direction to integrate

neural and symbolic reasoning. Unfortunately, little effort has been given 

to developing NeSy systems tailored to sequential/temporal problems. We identify

symbolic automata (which combine the power of automata for temporal reasoning

with that of propositional logic for static reasoning) as a suitable formalism for 

expressing knowledge in temporal domains. Focusing on the task of sequence classification

and tagging we show that symbolic automata can be integrated with neural-based

perception, under probabilistic semantics towards an end-to-end differentiable model. 

Our proposed hybrid model, termed NeSyA (Neuro Symbolic 

Automata) is shown to either scale or perform more accurately than previous

NeSy systems in a synthetic benchmark and to provide benefits in terms of generalization

compared to purely neural systems in a real-world event recognition task.
