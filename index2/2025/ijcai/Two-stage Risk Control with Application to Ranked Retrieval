Practical machine learning systems often operate in multiple sequential stages, as seen in ranking and recommendation systems, which typically include a retrieval phase followed by a ranking phase. Effectively assessing prediction uncertainty and ensuring effective risk control in such systems pose significant challenges due to their inherent complexity. To address these challenges, we developed two-stage risk control methods based on the recently proposed learn-then-test (LTT) and conformal risk control (CRC) frameworks. Unlike the methods in prior work that address multiple risks, our approach leverages the sequential nature of the problem, resulting in reduced computational burden. We provide theoretical guarantees for our proposed methods and design novel loss functions tailored for ranked retrieval tasks. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments on two large-scale, widely-used datasets: MSLR- Web and Yahoo LTRC.
