Conventional Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition (MMER) assumes complete access to visual, textual, and acoustic modalities. However, real-world multi-party settings often violate this assumption, as non-speakers frequently lack acoustic and textual inputs, leading to a significant degradation in model performance. Existing approaches also tend to unify heterogeneous modalities into a single representation, overlooking each modality’s unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose RAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Emotion Recognition), which refines multi-modal representations by not only exploring modality commonality and specificity but crucially by leveraging reconstructed features, enhanced by contrastive learning, to overcome data incompleteness and enrich feature quality. RAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement missing modalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning. To further strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality interdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations between labels and modality-specific features. Experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., MEmoR, CMU-MOSEI, and M³ED, demonstrate that RAMer achieves state-of-the-art performance in dyadic and multi-party MMER scenarios.
