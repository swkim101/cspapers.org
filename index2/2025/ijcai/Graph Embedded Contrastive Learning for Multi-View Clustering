Recently, numerous multi-view clustering (MVC) and multi-view graph clustering (MVGC) methods have been proposed. Despite significant progress, they still face two issues: I) MVC and MVGC are often developed independently for multi-view and multi-graph data. They have redundancy but lack a unified methodology to combine their strengths. II) Contrastive learning is usually adopted to explore the associations across multiple views. However, traditional contrastive losses ignore the neighbor relationship in multi-view scenarios and easily lead to false associations in sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Graph Embedded Contrastive Learning for Multi-View Clustering. Concretely, we propose a process of view-specific pre-training with adaptive graph convolution to make our method compatible with both multi-view and multi-graph data, which aggregates the graph information into data and leverages autoencoders to learn view-specific representations. Furthermore, to explore the view-cross associations, we introduce the process of view-cross contrastive learning and clustering, where we propose the graph-guided contrastive learning that can generate global graph to mitigate the false association issue as well as the cluster-guided contrastive clustering for improving the model robustness. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both MVC and MVGC tasks.
