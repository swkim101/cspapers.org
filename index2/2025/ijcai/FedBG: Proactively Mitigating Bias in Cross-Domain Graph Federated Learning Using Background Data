Federated graph learning is focused on aggregating knowledge from multi-source graph data and training graph neural networks. Unlike the data that traditional federated learning needs to deal with, federated graph learning also needs to face additional topological information. Further, there are also biases in features and topologies among clients, increasing the difficulty of training models. Previous methods usually seek global calibration information, however, this approach may suffer from information bias caused by data skews, and it is also difficult to naturally combine feature and topology information. Therefore, adjusting the bias before it occurs will hopefully address the learning difficulties caused by the skew. In view of this, we employ background graph data, which works as reference information for local training, to proactively correct bias before it occurs. As a kind of graph data, background graphs are naturally capable of combining feature and topology information to accomplish bias correction among clients in a comprehensive way. Mixing strategy is employed on the background graph to additionally provide privacy-preserving capabilities. Graph generation methods are employed to restore the diversity of background graphs that are blurred by the mixing strategy. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the sufficient motivation and effectiveness of the proposed method.
