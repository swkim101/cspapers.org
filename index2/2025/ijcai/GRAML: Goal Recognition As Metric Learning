Goal Recognition (GR) is the problem of recognizing an agent's objectives based on observed actions. 

Recent data-driven approaches for GR alleviate the need for costly, manually crafted domain models. 

However, these approaches can only reason about a pre-defined set of goals, and time-consuming training is needed for new emerging goals. 

To keep this model-learning automated while enabling quick adaptation to new goals, this paper introduces GRAML: Goal Recognition As Metric Learning. 

GRAML frames GR as a deep metric learning problem, using a Siamese network composed of recurrent units to learn an embedding space where traces leading to the same goal are close, and those leading to different goals are distant.

This metric is particularly effective for adapting to new goals, even when only a single example trace is available per goal.

Evaluated on a versatile set of environments, GRAML shows speed, flexibility, and runtime improvements over the state-of-the-art GR while maintaining accurate recognition.
