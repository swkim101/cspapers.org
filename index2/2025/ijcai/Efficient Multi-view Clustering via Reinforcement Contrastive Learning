Contrastive multi-view clustering has demonstrated remarkable potential in complex data analysis, yet existing approaches face two critical challenges: difficulty in constructing high-quality positive and negative pairs and high computational overhead due to static optimization strategies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative efficient Multi-View Clustering framework with Reinforcement Contrastive Learning (EMVCRCL). Our key innovation is developing a reinforcement contrastive learning paradigm for dynamic clustering optimization. First, we leverage multi-view contrastive learning to obtain latent features, which are then sent to the reinforcement learning module to refine low-quality features. Specifically, it selects high-confident features to guide the positive/negative pair construction of contrastive learning. For the low-confident features, it utilizes the prior balanced distribution to adjust their assignment. Extensive experimental results showcase the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method on multiple benchmark datasets.
