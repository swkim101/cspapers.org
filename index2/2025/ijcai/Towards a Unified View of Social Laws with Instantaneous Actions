Multiple agents operating in a shared environment can interfere with each other’s ability to reach their goals. One of the approaches to address this issue is enacting a social law – a set of rules that restricts some possible behaviors of the agents. A social law is considered robust if it guarantees that each agent can achieve its goal independently of the actions of other agents. Recent work has shown how to verify that a given social law, encoded in an MA-STRIPS formalism, is robust by compilation to classical planning. Follow-up work presented an extended compilation which can handle numeric multi-agent planning. In this paper, we present a new compilation, which can handle both classical and numeric multi-agent planning formalisms, as well as any other multi-agent planning formalism with instantaneous actions, in which action preconditions can be negated using first-order logic with equality. This opens the door to using social laws in even richer planning formalisms. Our empirical evaluation shows that the added expressivity of the new compilation does not hurt its performance, and it achieves comparable performance to the previous state-of-the-art compilations.
