Next POI recommendation contributes to the prosperity of various intelligent location-based services. Existing studies focus on exploring sequential patterns and POI interactions using sequential and graph-based methods to enhance recommendation performance. However, they don't effectively exploit geographical information. In addition, methods that focus on modeling mobility patterns using individual limited data may suffer from data sparsity and the information cocoons problem. Moreover, most graph structures focus on adjacent nodes, failing to capture potential high-order associations among POIs. To address these challenges, we propose the Region-aware dynamic Hypergraph learning method with Dual-level interaction Modeling (ReHDM), which exploits users' dynamic mobility beyond individual and point. Specifically, ReHDM utilizes regional encoding to mine the potential spatial relationships among POIs with coarse-grained geographical information. By incorporating POI-level and trajectory-level associations within a hypergraph convolutional network, ReHDM comprehensively captures cross-user collaborative information. Furthermore, ReHDM captures not only dependencies among POIs within each trajectory for a single user, but also the high-order collaborative information across individual user trajectories and associated users' trajectories. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ReHDM to the state-of-the-art.
