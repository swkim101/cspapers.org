Few-shot knowledge graph reasoning (FS-KGR) try to infer missing facts in a knowledge graphs using limited data (such as only 3/5 samples).Existing strategies have shown good performance by mining more supervised information for few-shot learning through meta-learning and self-supervised learning. However, the problem of insufficient samples has not been fundamentally solved. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on adversarial learning for Enhancing Negative samples in few-shot scenarios of FS-KGR, termed FS-KEN. Specifically, we are the first to use GAN to conduct data augmentation on FS-KGR scenario. FS-KEN uses policy gradient GANs for negative sample augmentation, solving the gradient back-propagation issue in traditional GANs. The generator aims to produce high-quality negative entities. while the objective of the discriminator is to distinguish between generated entities and real entities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two few-shot knowledge graph completion datasets reveal that FS-KEN surpasses other baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results.
