This paper describes an approach to algorithmic music composition that takes narrative structures as input, allowing composers to create music directly from narrative elements.

Creating narrative development in music remains a challenging task in algorithmic composition.

Our system addresses this by combining leitmotifs to represent characters, generative grammars for harmonic coherence, and evolutionary algorithms to align musical tension with narrative progression.

The system operates at different scales, from overall plot structure to individual motifs, enabling both autonomous composition and co-creation with varying degrees of user control.

Evaluation with compositions based on tales demonstrated the system's ability to compose music that supports narrative listening and aligns with its source narratives, while being perceived as familiar and enjoyable.
