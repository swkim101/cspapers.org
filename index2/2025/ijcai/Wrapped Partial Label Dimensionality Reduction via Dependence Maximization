Partial label learning induces classifier from data with ambiguous supervision, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels but only one of which is valid. As a classic data preprocessing strategy, dimensionality reduction contributes to enhance the generalization capabilities of learning algorithms. Due to the ambiguity of supervision, existing works on partial label dimensionality reduction are confined to two separate stages: dimensionality reduction and partial label disambiguation. However, the decoupling of dimensionality reduction from partial label disambiguation can lead to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we present a novel approach called Wrapped Partial Label Dimensionality Reduction (WPLDR) to address this challenge. Specifically, WPLDR integrates the dimensionality reduction and partial label disambiguation within a unified framework, employing alternating optimization to concurrently perform dimensionality reduction and partial label disambiguation. WPLDR maximizes the interdependence between features in the embedded space and confidence-based label information, while simultaneously ensuring the manifold consistency between the embedded feature space and label space. Extensive experiments over a broad range of synthetic and real-world partial label data sets validate that the performance of well-established partial label learning algorithms can be significantly improved by the proposed WPLDR.
