Considerable attention has been paid to predicting student performance on exercises. The performance of prior studies is determined by the quality of the trait features of students and exercises. Nevertheless, most of the prior study primarily examines simple pairwise interactions in learning trait features, like those between students and exercises or exercises and concepts, while disregarding the complex higher-order interactions that typically exist among these components, which in turn hinders the prediction results. In this paper, we using an innovative Multi-Channel Graph Contrastive Learning (MCGCL) framework that integrates various high-order interactions for predicting student performance. MCGCL characterizes graph structures reflecting various high-order relationships among students, exercises, and concepts through multiple channels, thereby enhancing the trait features of both students and exercises. Moreover, graph contrastive learning is employed to enhance the representation of trait features acquired from high-order graph structures in diverse views. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that MCGCL achieves state-of-the-art results on the task of predicting student performance.
