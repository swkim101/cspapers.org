Answer Set Programming (ASP) planning can be used to refine the rough solutions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle specific restrictions of actions, i.e., reconstruct the rough solutions to be executable, for robotic task planning. However, it is still challenging to efficiently solve ASP programs that have multiple variables with large domains, which prevents the above application of ASP planning from real-world task planning problems. In this paper, we consider how to reduce the domains of variables without losing possible solutions for ASP planning, while given these rough solutions from LLMs. Based on the above reduction, we introduce CLMASP, an approach that couples LLMs with ASP for robotic task planning. We evaluate CLMASP on the VirtualHome platform for common indoor tasks, demonstrating a significant improvement in the executable rate from under 10% to nearly 90% and reducing average ASP planning time from over 2 hours to under 5 seconds.
