Emotion recognition from EEG signals is crucial for understanding complex brain dynamics. Existing methods typically rely on static frequency bands and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model brain connectivity. However, EEG signals are inherently non-stationary and exhibit substantial individual variability, making static-band approaches inadequate for capturing their dynamic properties. Moreover, spatial-temporal dependencies in EEG often lead to feature degradation during node aggregation, ultimately limiting recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Electroencephalograph Collaboration framework (Stella). Our approach introduces an Adaptive Bands Selection module (ABS) that dynamically extracts low- and high-frequency components, generating dual-path features comprising phase brain networks for connectivity modeling and time-series representations for local dynamics. To further mitigate feature degradation, the Fourier Graph Operator (FGO) operates in the spectral domain, while the Spatial-Temporal Encoder (STE) enhances representation stability and density. Extensive experiments on benchmark EEG datasets demonstrate that Stella achieves state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition, offering valuable insights for graph-based modeling of non-stationary neural signals.
