Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has shown significant promise in reducing the burden of labor-intensive data annotation. However, existing methods mainly rely on pixel-level information, neglecting the strong region consistency inherent in remote sensing images (RSIs), which limits their effectiveness in handling the complex and diverse backgrounds of RSIs. To address this, we propose RegionMatch, a novel approach that leverages unlabeled data from a fresh object-level perspective, which is more tailored to the nature of semantic segmentation. We design the Pixel-Region Synergy Pseudo-Labeling strategy, which explicitly injects object-level contextual information into the S4 pipeline and promotes knowledge collaboration between pixel and region perspectives for generating high-quality pseudo-labels. In addition, we propose the Region Structure-Aware Correlation Consistency, which models object-level relationships by establishing inter-region correlations across images and pixel correlations within regions, providing more effective supervision signals for unlabeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that RegionMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple authoritative remote sensing datasets, highlighting its superiority in the RSIs.
