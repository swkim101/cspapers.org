We present NatSTV, a tool for approximate verification of natural strategic ability in multi-agent systems. The tool builds on our model checker STV (STrategic Verifier), and implements heuristic synthesis of natural strategies for asynchronous agents with imperfect information and recall. All of that is available through a web interface, with no need to install or configure the software by the user.
