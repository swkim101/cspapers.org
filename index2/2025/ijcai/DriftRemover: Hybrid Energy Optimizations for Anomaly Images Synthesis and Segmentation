This paper tackles the challenge of anomaly image synthesis and segmentation to generate various anomaly images and their segmentation labels to mitigate the issue of data scarcity. Existing approaches employ the precise mask to guide the generation, relying on additional mask generators, leading to increased computational costs and limited anomaly diversity. Although a few works use coarse masks as the guidance to expand diversity, they lack effective generation of labels for synthetic images, thereby reducing their practicality. Therefore, our proposed method simultaneously generates anomaly images and their corresponding masks by utilizing coarse masks and anomaly categories. The framework utilizes attention maps from synthesis process as mask labels and employs two optimization modules to tackle drift challenges, which are mismatches between synthetic results and real situations. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method improves pixel-level AP by 1.3% and F1-MAX by 1.8% in anomaly detection tasks on the MVTec dataset. Additionally, its successful application in practical scenarios highlights its effectiveness, improving IoU by 37.2% and F-measure by 25.1% with the Floor Dirt dataset.
