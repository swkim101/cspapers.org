The rapid development of large language models has greatly advanced human-computer dialogue research. However, applying these models to specialized fields like maternity and infant care often leads to subpar performance due to a lack of domain-specific datasets. To address this problem, we have created MicDialogue, a Chinese dialogue dataset for maternity and infant care. MicDialogue involves a wide range of specialized topics, including gynecological health, pediatric care, pregnancy preparation, emotional counseling and other related topics. This dataset is curated from two types of Chinese social media: short videos and blog posts. Short videos capture real-time interactions and pragmatic dialogue patterns, while blog posts offer comprehensive coverage of various topics within the domain. We have also included detailed annotations for topics, diseases, symptoms, and causes, enabling in-depth research. Additionally, we developed a knowledge-driven benchmark model using LLM-based prompt learning and multiple knowledge graphs to address diverse dialogue topics. Experiments validate MicDialogue's usability, providing benchmarks for future research and essential data for fine-tuning language models in maternity and infant care.
