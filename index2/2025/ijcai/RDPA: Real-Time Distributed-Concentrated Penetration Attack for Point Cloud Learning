Partial point attack approaches focus on leveraging the fewest points to achieve the best attack efficiency for easy implementation in the physical domain. For the first time, this paper proposes that the partial point attack strategy should pay attention to not only the selection and disturbance of points, but also the penetration of current defense methods. By re-examining characteristics of previous partial point attack approaches leading to performance improvement, we discover two fundamental principles: first, the selection of attacked points should consider not only the favourable visual salience but also the proper position concentration, thus to acquire effective structural destruction on the basis of remaining imperceptible; second, the perturbation of target points should form meaningful structures rather than outliers. To achieve this, we first propose a novel distributed-concentrated point selection (DPS) strategy, which is easier to concentrate salient points containing rich local information in a few tiny regions. Additionally, to enhance the penetration efficacy and real-time performance of attack point clouds against defenses, we further design a perturbation network based on the multi-scale penetration loss (L_msp), which can generate adversarial samples with as few outliers as possible only through a single forward propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that the real-time distributed-concentrated penetration attack (RDPA) framework can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) success rates by perturbing only 3.5% of points, and have the best penetration for mainstream defense methods such as SRS and SOR.
