Electron density (ED), which describes the probability distribution of electrons in space, is crucial for accurately understanding the energy and force distribution in molecular force fields (MFF).

Existing machine learning force fields (MLFF) focus on mining appropriate physical quantities from the atom-level conformation to enhance the molecular geometry representation while ignoring the unique information from microscopic electrons. In this work, we propose an efficient Electronic Density representation framework to enhance molecular Geometric learning (called EDG), which leverages images rendered from ED to boost molecular geometric representations in MLFF. Specifically, we construct a novel image-based ED representation, which consists of 2 million 6-view images with RGB-D channels, and design an ED representation learning model, called ImageED, to learn ED-related knowledge from these images. We further propose an efficient ED-aware teacher and introduce a cross-modal distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from the image-based teacher to the geometry-based students. Extensive experiments on QM9 and rMD17 demonstrate that EDG can be directly integrated into existing geometry-based models and significantly improves the capabilities of these models (e.g., SchNet, EGNN, SphereNet, ViSNet) for geometry representation learning in MLFF with a maximum average performance increase of 33.7%.
