Multimodal news contains a wealth of information and is easily affected by deepfake modeling attacks. To combat the latest image and text generation methods, we present a new Multimodal Fake News Detection dataset (MFND) containing 11 manipulated types, designed to detect and localize highly authentic fake news. Furthermore, we propose a Shallow-Deep Multitask Learning (SDML) model for fake news, which fully uses unimodal and mutual modal features to mine the intrinsic semantics of news. Under shallow inference, we propose the momentum distillation-based light punishment contrastive learning for fine-grained uniform spatial image and text semantic alignment, and an adaptive cross-modal fusion module to enhance mutual modal features. Under deep inference, we design a two-branch framework to augment the image and text unimodal features, respectively merging with mutual modalities features, for four predictions via dedicated detection and localization projections. Experiments on both mainstream and our proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of the model. Codes and dataset are released at https://github.com/yunan-wang33/sdml.
