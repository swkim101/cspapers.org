Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising technology for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, their direct application to scheduling problems remains limited due to the inherent complexity of these problems. This paper proposes an LLMs-based neighborhood search method that leverages LLMs to tackle the job shop scheduling problem (JSP) and its variants.

The main contributions of this work are threefold. First, we introduce a novel LLMs-guided neighborhood evaluation strategy that guides local search by dynamically adjusting operation weights. Second, we develop a verification evolution (VeEvo) framework to mitigate the hallucination effects of LLMs, enabling the generation of high-quality heuristics for weight updates. Third, we integrate this framework with the weighted neighborhood evaluation strategy to effectively guide the search towards promising regions.

Extensive experiments are conducted on 349 benchmark instances across three classical scheduling problems. The results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. For JSP, our algorithm reduces the average optimality gap from 10.46% to 1.35% on Taillard's instances compared to reinforced adaptive staircase curriculum learning. For flexible JSP (FJSP), it reduces the gap from 13.24% to 0.05% on Brandimarte's instances compared to deep reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, for FJSP with sequence dependent setup time, our algorithm updates 9 upper bounds for benchmark instances.
