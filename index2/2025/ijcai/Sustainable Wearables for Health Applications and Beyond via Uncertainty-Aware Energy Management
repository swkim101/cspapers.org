Achieving good health and well-being through lower mortality rates of non-communicable diseases and early warning of health risks are key goals of United Nations (UN). Wearable internet of things (IoT) are one of the most promising technology to achieve these goals through their ubiquitous monitoring of key health indicators and in-situ data processing. However, small form-factor of wearable devices constrains the battery capacity, thus requiring frequent recharging or battery replacements, which lowers their adoption rate and benefits. Augmentation of battery energy by scavenging ambient sources, such as light, is a promising solution to improve operating lifetime of IoT devices. However, ambient energy sources are highly uncertain, making energy management (EM) challenging. To handle these challenges, this paper presents a novel uncertainty-aware EM approach. First, we develop a conformal prediction-based method for future energy harvest (EH) that provides small uncertainty regions with provable coverage guarantees (true output vector is within the region). The EH uncertainty regions are then leveraged in an EM algorithm that uses overhead-aware sampling to evaluate the quality of multiple decisions with varying EH before making a decision using a lightweight machine learning model. Experiments on two diverse real-world datasets with 10 users show that conformal prediction achieves more than 90% coverage with tight prediction intervals; and the EM algorithm produces decisions that are, on average, within 2 Joules of an optimal Oracle.
