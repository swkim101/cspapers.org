One of the main reasons for solving constraint optimization problems in a distributed manner is maintaining agents’ privacy. Several studies in the past decade devised privacy-preserving versions of Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) algorithms. Some of those algorithms were complete, i.e., finding an optimal solution, while others were incomplete. The main advantage of the incomplete approach is in its scalability to large problems. One of the important incomplete paradigms for solving DCOPs is local search. Yet, so far no privacy-preserving algorithm for solving DCOPs by means of local search was devised. We present P-DSA, a privacy-preserving implementation of the classical local-search algorithm DSA that preserves topology, constraint, and assignment/decision privacy. Comparing its performance to that of P-Max-Sum, which is another privacy-preserving implementation of an incomplete DCOP algorithm, shows that P-DSA is significantly more scalable and issues much better solutions than P-Max-Sum. Therefore, P-DSA emerges as a suitable solution for practitioners addressing large-scale DCOPs with privacy considerations.
