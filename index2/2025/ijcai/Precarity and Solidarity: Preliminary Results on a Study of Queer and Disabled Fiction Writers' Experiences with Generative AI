We have undertaken a mixed-methods study of fiction writers' experiences and attitudes with generative AI, primarily focused on the experiences of queer and disabled writers. We find that queer and disabled writers are markedly more pessimistic than non-queer and non-disabled writers about the impact of AI on their industry, although pessimism is the majority attitude for both groups. We explore ways that generative AI exacerbates existing sources of instability and precarity in the publishing industry, reasons why writers are philosophically opposed to its use, and individual and collective strategies used by marginalized fiction writers to safeguard their industry from harms associated with generative AI.
