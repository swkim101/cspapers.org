Ensemble clustering learns a consensus result by integrating a set of base clustering results. Recently, anchor-based methods construct an anchor similarity matrix to represent the affinity relationships among samples, significantly improving computational efficiency. However, these methods struggle with fixed anchors generated by static anchor learning strategies, which lead to low-quality anchor similarity matrix and poor clustering accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named dynamic anchor-based ensemble clustering via hypergraph reconstruction (YACHT). Specifically, YACHT first transforms the base clustering results into a hypergraph and designs a novel hypergraph enhancement strategy to improve the reliability of the initial hypergraph. YACHT reconstructs the hypergraph through matrix factorization and introduces a mapping matrix to filter out redundant information, capturing a high-quality anchor similarity matrix. Then, YACHT attempts to incorporate the hypergraph into the optimization objective to achieve hypergraph updates. To ensure the accuracy of hypergraph updates, we impose a hypergraph regularizer and a local consensus information alignment term. The alignment term is implemented by minimizing the discrepancy between the label partition derived from the hypergraph regularizer and the local consensus information indicator matrix extracted from the base clustering results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed YACHT. The code is available at https://github.com/scu-kdde/YACHT.
