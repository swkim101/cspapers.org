Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) is to recognize unseen attribute-object compositions by learning from seen compositions. The distribution shift between unseen compositions and seen compositions poses challenges to CZSL models, especially when test images are mixed with both seen and unseen compositions. The challenge will be addressed more easily if a model can distinguish unseen/seen compositions and treat them with specific recognition strategies. However, identifying images with unseen compositions is non-trivial, considering that unseen compositions are absent in training and usually contain only subtle differences from seen compositions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional zero-shot learning method called COMO, which composes outliers in training for distinguishing seen and unseen compositions and further applying specific strategies for them. Specifically, we compose attribute-object representations for unseen compositions based on primitive representations of training images as outliers to enable the model to identify unseen compositions in inference. At test time, the method distinguishes images containing seen/unseen compositions and uses different weights for composition classification and primitive classification to recognize seen/unseen compositions. Experimental results on three datasets show the effectiveness of our method in both the closed-world setting and the open-world setting.
