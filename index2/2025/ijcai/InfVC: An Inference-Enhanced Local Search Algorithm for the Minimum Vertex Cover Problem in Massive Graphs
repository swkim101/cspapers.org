The minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with extensive real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient local search algorithm, InfVC, to solve the MVC in massive graphs, which comprises three ideas. First, we introduce an inference-driven optimization strategy that explores better feasible solutions through inference rules. Second, we develop a structural-determined perturbation strategy that is motivated by the structure features of high-quality solutions, prioritizing high-degree vertices into the candidate solution to guide the search process to some potential high-quality search area. Third, we design a self-adaptive local search framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation through a perturbation management mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfVC outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms on almost massive instances.
