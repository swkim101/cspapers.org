With approximately 2 billion chest X-ray examinations conducted globally each year, the demand for radiological interpretation far surpasses the available expertise, particularly in resource-constrained regions. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and computer vision present promising solutions for automated chest X-ray analysis. Nevertheless, integrating AI-driven diagnostics into clinical practice encounters several challenges, including data-centric issues, implementation barriers, deployment complexities, and the need for trustworthy AI. This dissertation focuses on the data-centric aspect, making significant contributions through enhanced data collection, the creation of novel datasets, algorithm development, privacy-preserving collaborative learning, and modelling for low-resolution data. It offers practical methodologies for embedding AI into chest radiology workflows, with a particular emphasis on addressing underserved conditions and healthcare settings with limited data availability. Furthermore, this work illustrates how tailored AI solutions can democratize access to high-quality radiological care while balancing privacy considerations and operational constraints across diverse environments.
