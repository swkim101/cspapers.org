Large language models exhibit remarkable performance in simple code generation tasks. However, they encounter significant challenges when addressing complex problems that require reasoning and question decomposition. To tackle this, we propose a self-driven reasoning augmentation process, SRA-MCTS, which incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for reasoning data generation. 

SRA-MCTS enables LLMs to self-generate intermediate reasoning steps and perform iterative self-evaluation, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, it utilizes MCTS to produce diverse intermediate reasoning steps. During each iteration, MCTS generates a step and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of subsequent branches, ultimately forming a sufficiently diverse reasoning path referred to as “thinking”. This thinking guides the model in generating corresponding code, and both are combined as training data for supervised fine-tuning. 

Experimental results demonstrate that SRA-MCTS achieves consistent performance improvements across three model scales without additional supervisory assistance. Applied to the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, it delivers an 11-point improvement on the MBPP-Complex dataset, underscoring the significant potential for model self-improvement.
