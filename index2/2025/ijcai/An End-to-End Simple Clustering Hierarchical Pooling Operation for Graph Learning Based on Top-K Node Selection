Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph learning, but one of the important challenges is how to effectively extract representations for graph-level tasks. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Simple Clustering Hierarchical Pooling (SCHPool) operation, which is based on Top-K node selection for learning expressive graph representations. Specifically, SCHPool considers each node and its local neighborhood as a cluster, and introduces a novel multi-view scoring function to evaluate node importance. Based on these scores, clusters centered around the Top-K nodes are retained. This design eliminates the need for complex clustering operations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, during the coarsening process, SCHPool employs a lightweight yet comprehensive attention mechanism to adaptively aggregate both the node features within clusters and the edge connectivity strengths between clusters. This facilitates the construction of more informative coarsened graphs, enhancing model performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
