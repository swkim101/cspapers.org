Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR) framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by 1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.
