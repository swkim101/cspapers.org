We study a practical centralized matching problem which assigns children to daycare centers.

The collective preferences of siblings from the same family introduce complementarities, which can lead to the absence of stable matchings, as observed in the hospital-doctor matching problems involving couples. Intriguingly, stable matchings are consistently observed in real-world daycare markets, despite the prevalence of sibling applicants.



We conduct a probabilistic analysis of large random markets to examine the existence of stable matchings in such markets. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where daycare centers have similar priorities over children, a common characteristic in real-world markets. Our analysis reveals that as the market size approaches infinity, the likelihood of stable matchings existing converges to 1.



To facilitate our exploration, we refine an existing heuristic algorithm to address a more rigorous stability concept, as the original one may fail to meet this criterion. Through extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our revised algorithm in identifying stable matchings, particularly when daycare priorities exhibit high similarity.
