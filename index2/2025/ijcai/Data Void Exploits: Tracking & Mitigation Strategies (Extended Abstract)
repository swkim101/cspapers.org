A data void is a gap in online information, providing an opportunity for the spread of disinformation or a data void exploit. We introduce lightweight measures to track the progress of data void exploits and mitigation efforts in two contexts: Web search and Knowledge Graph (KG) querying. We use case studies to demonstrate the viability of these measures as data void trackers in the Web search context. To tackle data voids, we introduce an adversarial game model involving two agents: a disinformer and a mitigator. Both agents insert content into the information ecosystem to have their narrative rank higher than their counterpart in search results. At every turn, each agent chooses which content to deploy within their resource constraints, mimicking real-world situations where different entities have varying levels of influence and access to resources. Using simulations of this game, we compare and evaluate different mitigation strategies to recommend ones that maximize mitigation impact while minimizing costs.
