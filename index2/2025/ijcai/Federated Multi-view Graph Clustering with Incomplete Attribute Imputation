Federated Multi-View Clustering (FedMVC) aims to uncover consistent clustering structures from distributed multi-view data for clustering while preserving data privacy. However, existing FedMVC methods under vertical settings either ignore the ubiquitous incomplete view issue or require uploading data features, which may lead to privacy leakage or induce high communication costs. To mitigate the view incompleteness issue and simultaneously maintain privacy and efffciency, we propose a novel Federated Multiview Graph Clustering with Incomplete Attribute Imputation (FMVC-IAI). This method constructs a consensus graph structure through complementary multi-view data and then utilizes a non-parametric graph neural network (GNN) to impute missing features. Additionally, it utilizes the adjacency graph as the knowledge carrier to share and fuse the multi-view information. To alleviate the high communication cost due to graph sharing, we proposed to share the anchor graph for global adjacency graph construction, which reduces communication cost and also helps to reduce privacy leakage risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in FedMVC tasks with incomplete views.
