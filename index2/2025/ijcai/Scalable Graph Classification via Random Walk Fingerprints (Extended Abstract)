We design a lightweight structural feature extraction technique for graph classification. It leverages node subsets and connection strength reflected by random-walk-based heuristics, presenting a scalable, unsupervised, and easily interpretable alternative. We provide theoretical insights into our technical design and establish a relation between the extracted structural features and the graph spectrum. We show our method achieves high levels of computational efficiency while maintaining robust classification accuracy.
