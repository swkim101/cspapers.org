In recent years, CPU real-time object tracking has gained significant attention due to its broad applications such as UAV-tracking. To maintain computational efficiency, most existing CPU real-time object trackers rely on lightweight backbones and employ a single initial template image without intermediate online templates. Although the appearance variance between the template and the search is larger under this single template setting, the representation ability of lightweight backbones is weaker which poses a challenge when training lightweight object trackers. To address this issue, we propose SSTrack, a new easier-to-harder training schedule for the lightweight object tracker. From the data perspective, our method designed a success-aware sample scheduler that gradually increases difficult training samples with longer template-search time intervals and reduces the amount of the easier samples so the training cost remains unchanged. From the optimization perspective, we utilized a gradient scaling strategy that retains the original training objective of easier samples despite the reduction in their quantities. With the collective effort from both perspectives, our method achieves State-of-the-Art CPU-real-time accuracy on 5 UAV-tracking benchmarks and 5 general object tracking benchmarks.
