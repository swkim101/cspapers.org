DAVE is a framework for assisting the analysis of documents in knowledge-intensive domains, based on an entity-centric approach supported by annotations of named entities in the documents. DAVE supports search & filtering, document exploration, question answering, and knowledge refinement. It is released as an open-source project that the community can further develop. DAVE’s distinguishing features are: the integration of a chatbot interface based on recent RAG solutions into well-established entity-powered faceted search, the fusion of search and filtering features provided by entity-level annotations with the capability to ask questions on annotated documents; human-in-the-loop functions to consolidate knowledge while exploring information, allowing users to improve annotations from NLP algorithms.
