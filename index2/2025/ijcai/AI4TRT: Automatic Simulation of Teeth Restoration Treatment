Visualizing restoration treatments is a crucial task in dentistry. Traditionally, dentists drag the standard template tooth line onto the inner image from the front view to simulate the outcome of the restoration. This process lacks the precision needed for patient presentation. We find that calculating the camera pose and the relative positions of the upper and lower jaws can enhance visualization accuracy and efficiency while assisting dentists in treatment design. In this work, we leverage the optical flow model and a customized point renderer to help dentists show the treatment outcome to the patient. Specifically, we take the 3D scan model and the intraoral image pair as input. Our framework automatically outputs the camera pose and the relative position of the upper and lower jaws. With these parameters, dentists can directly design the restoration treatment on the 3D scan model without caring about the 2D visualization. Then the designed tooth line and other simulation modalities can be rendered on the intraoral image with our customized renderer. Our framework relieves the labor of dentists and shows the case precisely.
