Recently, multi-view data has gradually attracted attention. However, real-world applications often face Partial View-aligned Problem (PVP) and Partially Sample-missing Problem (PSP) due to data loss or corruption. Existing methods addressing PVP typically focus only on learning from the information of aligned data, while ignoring unaligned data where samples exist but lack alignment relationships. This introduces PSP, which does not inherently exist in the data, leading to biased learning of the data's information. For PSP, due to varying degrees of missing data, incomplete spatial structures can cause clustering centers-shifted problem, resulting in the model learning incorrect correspondences and biased spatial structures.To tackle them, we propose a novel method called Dual Robust Unbiased Multi-View Clustering for Incomplete and Unpaired Information (DRUMVC). To our knowledge, this is the first noise-robust and unbiased multi-view clustering method capable of simultaneously addressing both PVP and PSP. Specifically, DRUMVC leverages aligned and complete samples as a bridge to construct high-quality correspondences for samples lacking cross-view relationship information due to PVP or PSP. Additionally, we employ a dual noise-robust contrastive learning loss to mitigate the impact of noise potentially introduced during the pair construction. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
