Remote sensing composed image retrieval

(RSCIR) is a new vision-language task that takes

a composed query of an image and text, aiming to

search for a target remote sensing image satisfying

two conditions from intricate remote sensing

imagery. However, the existing attribute-based

benchmark Patterncom in RSCIR has significant

flaws, including the lack of query text sentences

and paired triplets, thus making it unable to evaluate the latest methods. To address this, we propose

the Zero-Shot Query Text Generator (ZS-QTG)

that can generate full query text sentences based on

attributes, and then, by capitalizing on ZS-QTG,

we develop the PatternCIR benchmark. Pattern CIR rectifies Patterncom’s deficiencies and enables

the evaluation of existing methods. Additionally,

we explore zero-shot composed image retrieval

methods that do not rely on massive pre-collected

triplets for training. Existing methods use only

the text during retrieval, performing poorly in

RSCIR. To improve this, we propose Text-image

Sequential Training of Composed Image Retrieval

(TisCIR). TisCIR undergoes sequential training of

multiple self-masking projection and fine-grained

image attention modules, which endows it with

the capacity to filter out conflicting information

between the image and text, enhancing the retrieval

by utilizing both modalities in harmony. TisCIR

outperforms existing methods by 12.40% to

62.03% on PatternCIR, achieving state-of-the-art

performance in RSCIR. The data and code are

available here.
