Weighted model integration (WMI) is a relatively recent formalism that has received significant interest as a technique for solving probabilistic inference tasks with complicated weight functions. Existing methods and tools are mostly focused on linear and polynomial functions and provide limited support for WMI of rational or radical functions, which naturally arise in several applications. In this work, we present a novel method for approximate WMI, which provides more effective support for the wide class of semi-algebraic functions that includes rational and radical functions, with literals defined over non-linear real arithmetic. Our algorithm leverages Farkas’ lemma and Handelman's theorem from real algebraic geometry to reduce WMI to solving a number of linear programming (LP) instances. The algorithm provides formal guarantees on the error bound of the obtained approximation and can reduce it to any user-defined value epsilon. Furthermore, our approach is perfectly parallelizable. Finally, we present extensive experimental results, demonstrating the superior performance of our method on a range of WMI tasks for rational and radical functions when compared to state-of-the-art tools for WMI, in terms of both applicability and tightness.
