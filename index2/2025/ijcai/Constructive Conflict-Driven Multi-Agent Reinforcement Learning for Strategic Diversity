In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.
