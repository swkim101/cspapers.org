With the emergence of diffusion models and the rapid development of image processing, generating artistic images in style transfer tasks has become effortless. However, these impressive image processing approaches face consistency issues in video processing due to the independent processing of each frame. In this paper, we propose a powerful, model-free approach called FastBlend to address the consistency problem in video stylization. FastBlend functions as a post-processor and can be seamlessly integrated with diffusion models to create a robust video stylization pipeline. Based on a patch-matching algorithm, we remap and blend the aligned content across multiple frames, thus compensating for inconsistent content with neighboring frames. Moreover, we propose a tree-like data structure and a specialized loss function, aiming to optimize computational efficiency and visual quality for different application scenarios. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of FastBlend. Compared with both independent video deflickering algorithms and diffusion-based video processing methods, FastBlend is capable of synthesizing more coherent and realistic videos.
