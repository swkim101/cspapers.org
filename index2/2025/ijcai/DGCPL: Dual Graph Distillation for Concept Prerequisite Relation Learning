Concept prerequisite relations determine the learning order of knowledge concepts in one domain, which has an important impact on teachers' course design and students' personalized learning. Current research usually predicts concept prerequisite relations from the perspective of knowledge, and rarely pays attention to the role of learners' learning behavior. We propose a Dual Graph Distillation Method for Concept Prerequisite Relation Learning (DGCPL). Specifically, DGCPL constructs a dual graph structure from both the knowledge and learning behavior perspectives, and captures the high-order knowledge features and learning behavior features through the concept-resource hypergraph and the learning behavior graph respectively. In addition, we introduce a gated knowledge distillation to fuse the structural information of concept nodes in the two graphs, so as to obtain a more comprehensive concept embedding representation and achieve accurate prediction of prerequisite relations. On three public benchmark datasets, we compare DGCPL with eight graph-based baseline methods and five traditional classification baseline methods. The experimental results show that DGCPL achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning concept prerequisite relations. Our code is available at https://github.com/wisejw/DGCPL.
