As a pivotal architecture in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated substantial application value in scenarios with limited labeled nodes (samples). However, existing GCLs encounter critical issues in the graph augmentation and positive and negative sampling stemming from the lack of explicit supervision, which collectively restrict their efficiency and universality. On the one hand, the reliance on graph augmentations in existing GCLs can lead to increased training times and memory usage, while potentially compromising the semantic integrity. On the other hand, the difficulty in selecting TRUE positive and negative samples for GCLs limits their universality to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. To address these drawbacks, this paper introduces a novel GCL framework called GRAph learning via Self-contraSt (GRASS). The core mechanism is node-attribute self-contrast, which specifically involves increasing the feature similarities between nodes and their included attributes while decreasing the similarities between nodes and their non-included attributes. Theoretically, the self-contrast mechanism implicitly ensures accurate node-node contrast by capturing high-hop co-inclusion relationships, thereby enabling GRASS to be universally applicable to graphs with varying degrees of homophily. Evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the universality and efficiency of GRASS. The dataset and code are available at URL: https://github.com/YukunCai/GRASS.
