While metabolic imaging can facilitate early diagnosis by revealing physiological changes of lesions, it is limited by high cost, high radiation risk, and potential renal impairment. Thus, developing an effective approach for Anatomical-to-Metabolic Image Synthesis (A2MIS) is highly required. However, existing methods are heavily hindered by the gap between distinct domains, and fail to provide a confidence score for the synthesized images, severely restricting their clinical applications. Here, we propose a novel Residual-guided Latent Brownian-bridge Co-Diffusion (RLBCD) model for A2MIS. Specifically, RLBCD starts with a co-diffusion process that leverages a residual diffusion branch to capture inter-domain differences, which are injected into an enhanced diffusion branch to maximally reconstruct modality-specific details. Furthermore, to explore desired residual guidance, we investigate the encoder and decoder features in diffusion models, and accordingly design a Hybrid-Granularity Fusion to integrate consistent semantics and complementary information for fine-grained reconstruction. Additionally, a latent consistency score is developed to enhance the restoration of modality-specific information, which also serves as an indicator of the inherent confidence of the synthesized images. Extensive experiments conducted on five public and in-house datasets demonstrate that RLBCD not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods for A2MIS, but also is valuable for downstream clinic applications.
