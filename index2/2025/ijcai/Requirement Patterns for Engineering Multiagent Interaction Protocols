An interaction protocol specifies how the member agents of a decentralized multiagent system may communicate to satisfy their respective stakeholders' requirements. We focus on information protocols, which are fully declarative specifications of interaction and support asynchronous communication. We offer Mambo, an approach for protocol design. Mambo identifies common patterns of requirements, provides a notation to express them, and a verification procedure. Mambo incorporates heuristics to generate small internal representations for efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate Mambo's effectiveness on practical protocols.
