Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) increasingly collaborate in logistics, surveillance, inspection tasks and etc. 

However, existing simulators often focus on a single domain, limiting cross-domain study. 

This paper presents the SkyRover, a modular simulator for UAV-AGV multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). 

SkyRover supports realistic agent dynamics, configurable 3D environments, and convenient APIs for external solvers and learning methods. 

By unifying ground and aerial operations, it facilitates cross-domain algorithm design, testing, and benchmarking. 

Experiments highlight SkyRover’s capacity for efficient pathfinding and high-fidelity simulations in UAV-AGV coordination.

We believe the SkyRover fills a key gap in MAPF research.
