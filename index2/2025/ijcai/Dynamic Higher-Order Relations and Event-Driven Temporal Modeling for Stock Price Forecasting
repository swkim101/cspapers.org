In stock price forecasting, modeling the probabilistic dependence between stock prices within a time-series framework has remained a persistent and highly challenging area of research. We propose a novel model to explain the extreme co-movement in multivariate data with time-series dependencies. Our model incorporates a Hawkes process layer to capture abrupt co-movements, thereby enhancing the temporal representation of market dynamics. We introduce dynamic hypergraphs into our model adapting to higher-order (groupwise rather than pairwise) relationships within the stock market. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of our approach in predictive performance and portfolio stability.
