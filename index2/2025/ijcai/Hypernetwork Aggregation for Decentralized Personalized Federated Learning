Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) meets each user’s personalized needs while still facing the high communication costs due to the large amount of data transmission and frequent communication. Decentralized PFL (DPFL) as an alternative discards the central server in PFL, which reduces the pressure of communication and the risk of server failure by using peer-to-peer communication.Nevertheless, DPFL still suffers from the significant communication pressure due to the transmission of a large number of model parameters, especially numerous nodes. To address the issues, we propose a novel personalized framework, DFedHP, in which each client utilizes a hypernetwork to generate the shared part of model parameters and train the personalized parameters separately. The number of parameters in a hypernetwork is much smaller than those in a typical local network, so hypernetwork aggregation reduces communication costs and the risk of privacy leakage. Furthermore, DFedHP can seamlessly integrate into existing DPFL algorithms as a plugin to boost their efficacy. At last, extensive experiments on various data heterogeneous environments demonstrate that DFedHP can reduce communication costs, accelerate convergence rate, and improve generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.
