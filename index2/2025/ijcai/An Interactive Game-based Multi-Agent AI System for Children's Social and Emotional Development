The earliest years of life, from birth to elementary school, are the most critical time for children's social and emotional development. Recently, schools and workplaces have become increasingly concerned with cultivating social and emotional skills, especially with the decline of face-to-face interaction and the pervasive influence of modern communications technology. This paper proposes a game in development that navigates this challenge and aims to facilitate skill development in children ages 3-10 by having them identify, understand, feel their emotions, and regulate their actions. Using an established framework for social and emotional learning, it employs multi-agent artificial intelligence-based interactive gaming that generates dynamic scenarios and adjusts learning experiences based on individual child's or group's needs over time. We discuss the various modes of this game and its target frameworks, along with ways to evaluate effectiveness in facilitating social and emotional skill development.
