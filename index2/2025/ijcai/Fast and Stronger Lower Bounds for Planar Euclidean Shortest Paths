We consider the problem of quickly providing strong lower bounds for the planar Euclidean shortest path (ESP) problem. Such lower bounds are crucial for guiding the search in A* type approaches or for proving quality guarantees for algorithms that compute approximate solutions.

Our contributions are two-fold: we show how to simplify ESP instances such that computing and storing a visibility graph becomes feasible while distances within the simplified instance are guaranteed to constitute lower bounds for the original problem instance. Furthermore we show how to precompute a space efficient data structure that allows to perform distance queries on visibility graphs within few microseconds with negligible space overhead.
