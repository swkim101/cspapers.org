Time series analysis has evolved from traditional autoregressive models to deep learning, Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs). While vision models have also been explored along the way, their contributions are less recognized due to the predominance of sequence modeling. However, challenges such as the mismatch between continuous time series and LLMs’ discrete token space, and the difficulty in capturing multivariate correlations, have led to growing interest in Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This survey highlights the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis, offering a comprehensive dual-view taxonomy that answers key research questions like how to encode time series as images and how to model imaged time series. Additionally, we address pre- and post-processing challenges in this framework and outline future directions for advancing the field.
