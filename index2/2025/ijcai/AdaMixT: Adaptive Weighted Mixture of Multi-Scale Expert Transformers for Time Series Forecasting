Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers (AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world scenarios.
