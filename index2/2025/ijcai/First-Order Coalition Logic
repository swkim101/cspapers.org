We introduce First-Order Coalition Logic (FOCL), which combines key intuitions behind Coalition Logic (CL) and Strategy Logic (SL). Specifically, FOCL allows for arbitrary quantification over actions of agents. FOCL is interesting for several reasons. First, we show that FOCL is strictly more expressive than existing coalition logics. Second, we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of FOCL, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first axiomatisation of any variant of SL in the literature. Finally, while discussing the satisfiability problem for FOCL, we reopen the question of the recursive axiomatisability of SL.
