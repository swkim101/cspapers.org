Some people suggest that deliberately watching the camera during video calls can simulate eye contact and help build trust. In this study, we investigated the effects of simulated eye contact in video calls and job interviews through an experimental study and a survey. Study 1 involved participants in a mock interview as an interviewer, where a confederate interviewee simulated eye contact half the time. The gaze patterns of the participants were tracked to understand the effects. In Study 2, we conducted an online survey to confirm the findings of Study 1 on a larger scale by asking those with experience interviewing to evaluate interviewees based on interview videos, half of which simulated eye contact. The results of both studies indicate that simulated eye contact had little impact on their evaluation compared to common belief. We discuss how the results motivate future work and how computational approaches to correcting eye gaze can be deceptive.
