This study aims to investigate the dynamics of young adults’ food practices within the interplay between technology and tradition by employing a Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) approach as an analytical lens. We conducted surveys and interviews with young adults. This is complemented by a workshop involving design and gastronomy experts. Grounded in Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) and encompassing 38 core values and resulting in five value conflicts. Our analysis highlights five prominent themes: “Preservation of Culinary Heritage and Relationships”, “Technological Convenience”, “Uniqueness and Personalisation”, “Globalised Nature of Food”, and “Sustainable Choices and Trustworthiness”. By bridging between Human-Food Interaction (HFI) and VSD realms, this study provides insights for researchers, designers, and practitioners. The value-laden analytical perspective of the findings sheds light on the food practices of the young generation, for future HFI design studies blending traditional and technological elements.
