Wearable augmented reality (AR) systems have significant potential to enhance surgical outcomes through in-situ visualization of patient-specific data. Yet, efforts to develop AR-based systems for open surgery have been limited, lacking comprehensive interdisciplinary research and actual clinical evaluations in real surgical environments. Our research addresses this gap by presenting a user-centered design and development process of ARAS, an AR assistance for open pancreatic surgery. ARAS provides in-situ visualization of critical structures, such as the vascular system and the tumor, while offering a robust dual-layer registration method ensuring accurate registration during relevant phases of the surgery. We evaluated ARAS in clinical trials of 20 patients with pancreatic tumors. Accuracy validation and postoperative surgeon interviews confirmed its successful deployment, supporting surgeons in vascular localization and critical decision-making. Our work showcases ARâ€™s potential to fundamentally transform procedures for complex surgical operations, advocating a research shift toward ecological validation in open surgery.
