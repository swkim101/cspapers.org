In online education, innovative tools are crucial for enhancing learning outcomes. SAM (Study with AI Mentor) is an advanced platform that integrates educational videos with a context-aware chat interface powered by large language models. SAM encourages students to ask questions and explore unclear concepts in real time, offering personalized, context-specific assistance, including explanations of formulas, slides, and images. We evaluated SAM in two studies: one with 25 university students and another with 80 crowdsourced participants, using pre- and post-knowledge tests to compare a group using SAM and a control group. The results demonstrated that SAM users achieved greater knowledge gains specifically for younger learners and individuals in flexible working environments, such as students, supported by a 97.6% accuracy rate in the chatbot's responses. Participants also provided positive feedback on SAM's usability and effectiveness. SAM's proactive approach to learning not only enhances learning outcomes but also empowers students to take full ownership of their educational experience, representing a promising future direction for online learning tools.
