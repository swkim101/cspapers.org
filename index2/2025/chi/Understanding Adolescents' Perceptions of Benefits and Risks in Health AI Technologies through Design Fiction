Despite the growing research on users' perceptions of health AI, adolescents' perspectives remain underexplored. This study explores adolescents' perceived benefits and risks of health AI technologies in clinical and personal health settings. Employing Design Fiction, we conducted interviews with 16 adolescents (aged 13-17) using four fictional design scenarios that represent current and future health AI technologies as probes. Our findings reveal that with a positive yet cautious attitude, adolescents envision unique benefits and risks specific to their age group. While health AI technologies were seen as valuable learning resources, they also raised concerns about confidentiality with their parents. Additionally, we identified several factors, such as severity of health conditions and previous experience with AI, influencing their perceptions of trust and privacy in health AI. We explore how these insights can inform the future of design of health AI technologies to support learning, engagement, and trust as adolescents navigate their healthcare journey.
