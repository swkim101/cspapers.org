Virtual and mixed reality headsets, such as the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, began supporting use in reclined postures in 2024, accommodating users who prefer or require this position. However, the surfaces on which users rest restrict shoulder and head rotation, reducing viewing range and comfort. A formative study (n=16) comparing usage while standing vs. lying down showed that head rotation range decreased from 261ยบ to 130ยบ horizontally and from 172ยบ to 94.9ยบ vertically. To improve viewing range and comfort, we present HeadTurner, a novel approach that assists user-initiated head rotations by actuating the resting surface to yield in pitch and yaw axes. In a user study (n=16), HeadTurner significantly expanded the field of view and improved comfort compared to a fixed surface. Although VR sickness was slightly reduced with HeadTurner, the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, HeadTurner was preferred by 75% of participants. Although our proof-of-concept device was prototyped as a bed, the approach can be extended to more compact and affordable device form factors, such as motorized reclining chairs, offering the potential for comfortable use of VR and MR headsets over extended periods , and was shown to inspire users with interested applications in back-rested scenarios.
