Cyclists need interfaces such as on-vehicle displays or augmented-reality (AR) glasses for effective communication with autonomous vehicles (AVs) when human drivers are no longer present. Interfaces must handle complex situations involving multiple AVs around a cyclist. Holistic AV-Cyclist Interfaces (HACIs) are a novel solution; they group interfaces into a multimodal interconnected system to support the rider. However, the best way to present information is uncertain. We explored this in a scenario with three AVs using CycleARcade, a new multi-user AR platform for designing and evaluating HACIs. Cyclists and HCI researchers collaboratively created and tested HACIs within CycleARcade through a novel iterative participatory design method. We synthesised three HACIs from this process and assessed them with riders in CycleARcade. Participants preferred HACIs with AR displays integrated into the environment to avoid road distractions, paired with spatial audio communicating AV proximity. These findings provide crucial input for the real-world deployment of AVs.
