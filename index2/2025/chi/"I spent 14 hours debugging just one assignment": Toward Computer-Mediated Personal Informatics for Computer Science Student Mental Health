Anxiety and depression rates in Computer Science (CS) students are double those of other undergraduates and 5-10 times higher than the general population. However, factors contributing to the elevated mental health issues in CS students remain unknown. To bridge this gap, we conducted need-finding interviews (N=20), which revealed that the complexity of debugging, along with imposter syndrome, are key contributors to stress and burnout. Participants expressed openness toward and feature preferences in a computer-based Personal Informatics (PI) tool to facilitate self-reflection. In response, we developed EmotionStream, an algorithm-assisted PI tool that provides both contextual and emotional insights based on individual behaviors. We found that participants rated their experience with the tool highly. Post-hoc analysis revealed that emotional states, augmented with contextual cues, show promise of predicting real-time stress. Based on our findings, we provide design implications for future PI tools to support CS student mental well-being.
