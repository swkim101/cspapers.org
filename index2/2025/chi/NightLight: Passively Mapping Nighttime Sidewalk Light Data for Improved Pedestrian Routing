Nighttime sidewalk illumination has a significant and unequal influence on where and whether pedestrians walk at night. Despite the importance of pedestrian lighting, there is currently no approach for measuring and communicating how humans experience night-time sidewalk light levels at scale. We introduce NightLight , a new sensing approach that leverages the ubiquity of smartphones by re-appropriating the built-in light sensor—traditionally used to adapt screen brightness—to sense pedestrian nighttime lighting conditions. We validated our technique through in-lab and street-based evaluations characterizing performance across phone orientation,
