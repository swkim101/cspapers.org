As virtual reality (VR) continues to evolve as a platform for gathering and collaboration, new forms of communication using voice and avatars are being actively studied. However, the objective and dynamic assessment of social experiences in VR remains a significant challenge, while obtrusive self-report methods prevail. This study aims to identify verbal and nonverbal behavioral indices of perceived social experience in the context of virtual conversations. In our experiment, 52 participants engaged in a ten-minute dyadic conversation in VR and rated the level of social experiences, while turn-taking patterns and behavioral (gaze, pose) data were recorded. The results indicated that rapid response time, longer speech duration, longer gaze duration during turn-taking gaps, and higher nodding frequency during turns predicted the dynamic changes in usersâ€™ social experience. By providing objective and unobtrusive measures of social interactions, this study contributes to enhancing the understanding and improvement of social VR experiences.
