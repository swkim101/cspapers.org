Autistic individuals often experience negative self-talk (NST), leading to increased anxiety and depression. While therapy is recommended, it presents challenges for many autistic individuals. Meanwhile, a growing number are turning to large language models (LLMs) for mental health support. To understand how autistic individuals perceive AI's role in coping with NST, we surveyed 200 autistic adults and interviewed practitioners. We also analyzed LLM responses to participants' hypothetical prompts about their NST. Our findings show that participants view LLMs as useful for managing NST by identifying and reframing negative thoughts. Both participants and practitioners recognize AI's potential to support therapy and emotional expression. Participants also expressed concerns about LLMs' understanding of neurodivergent thought patterns, particularly due to the neurotypical bias of LLMs. Practitioners critiqued LLMs' responses as overly wordy, vague, and overwhelming. This study contributes to the growing research on AI-assisted mental health support, with specific insights for supporting the autistic community.
