Globally, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have had to adapt to rapid digital changes, a shift accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Kenya, this transition has involved a significant move towards digital management tools. While many had already experienced marked digitalization over the last few decades, they completed this work differently from their European and North American counterparts. This study explores how Kenyan SMBs continue to navigate these changes and considers the potential of Generative AI in this context. Applying the concept of socio-tecture—which emphasizes social networks, relational business practices, and employees as knowledge producers—we analyze how these elements influence SMB operations in Nairobi. We highlight how socio-tecture affects business performance and growth, and discuss how an Afro-centric strengths-based approach might offer unique opportunities and challenges with the influx of new technologies like Generative AI.
