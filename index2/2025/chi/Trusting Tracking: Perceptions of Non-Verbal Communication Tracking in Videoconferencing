Videoconferencing is integral to modern work and living. Recently, technologists have sought to leverage data captured – e.g. from cameras and microphones – to augment communication. This might mean capturing communication information about verbal (e.g. speech, chat messages), or non-verbal exchanges (e.g. body language, gestures, tone of voice) and using this to mediate – and potentially improve – communication. However, such tracking has implications for user experience and raises wider concerns (e.g. privacy). To design tools which account for user needs and preferences, this study investigates perspectives on communication tracking through a global survey and interviews, exploring how daily behaviours and the impact of specific features influence user perspectives. We examine user preferences on non-verbal communication tracking, preferred methods of how this information is conveyed and to whom this should be communicated. Our findings aim to guide the development of non-verbal communication tools which augment videoconferencing that prioritise user needs.
