Unlike static and rigid user interfaces, generative and malleable user interfaces offer the potential to respond to diverse users' goals and tasks. However, current approaches primarily rely on generating code, making it difficult for end-users to iteratively tailor the generated interface to their evolving needs. We propose employing task-driven data models-representing the essential information entities, relationships, and data within information tasks-as the foundation for UI generation. We leverage AI to interpret users' prompts and generate the data models that describe users' intended tasks, and by mapping the data models with UI specifications, we can create generative user interfaces. End-users can easily modify and extend the interfaces via natural language and direct manipulation, with these interactions translated into changes in the underlying model. The technical evaluation of our approach and user evaluation of the developed system demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed generative and malleable UIs.
