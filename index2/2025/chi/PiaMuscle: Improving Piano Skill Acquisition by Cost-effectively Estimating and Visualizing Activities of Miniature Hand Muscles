Understanding neuromusculoskeletal mechanisms significantly impacts skill specialization and proficiency. While existing methods can infer large muscle activities during gross motor movements, the estimation of dexterous motor control involving miniature muscles remains underexplored. Targeting the coordinated hand muscles in advanced piano performance, we learn spatiotemporal discrete representations of electromyography (EMG) data and hand postures utilizing a multimodal dataset. Subsequently, we train a precise and cost-effective neural network model. Based on this model, PiaMuscle is introduced to investigate if visualizing muscle activities during piano training enhances piano performance. Quantitative and qualitative results of a user study with highly skilled professional pianists demonstrate that PiaMuscle provides reliable muscle activation data to support and optimize force control. Our research underscores the potential of a naturalistic workflow to estimate small musclesâ€™ activities from readily accessible human-centric information and more accurately when combined with tool-centric data, thereby enhancing skill acquisition.
