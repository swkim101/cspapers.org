Sketching is one of the oldest techniques humans use to express themselves. We sketch to visualize concepts, externalize memory, and communicate ideas. However, we barely use sketching to interact with computers. Given how naturally sketching comes to humans, we believe untapped potential exists in being able to simply draw commands onto a user interface. In this paper, we present results of an elicitation study about expressing common operations in spreadsheets through sketching. Spreadsheets are an interesting class of applications because they are widely used, support complex data and operations, and are available on touch-enabled devices. Our results show that despite considerable variation in syntactic details, participants gravitate towards recurring patterns (e.g., enclosures and arrows, examples and cross-references, and temporal sequences of strokes). The sketch patterns we identified can be a first step towards developing interpreters of sketched commands, and thus enable new means of interacting with spreadsheets and other applications.
