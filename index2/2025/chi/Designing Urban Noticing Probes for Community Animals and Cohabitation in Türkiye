Design tools and probing, in particular, have long offered critical perspectives in HCI, broadening the understanding of who benefits from the design. Further, the designerly implementation of critical perspectives and theories using tools such as probes can support HCI designers with theoretically informed dialogical tools. However, these approaches and processes are majorly designed to understand human interactions. In this paper, we introduce urban noticing probes developed to decentre the humans in multispecies interactions by following the arts of noticing theory: noticing into, for, and through within urban relationality, focusing on the case of community animals in TÃ¼rkiye. Our goal is to create a better understanding of the functions of "urban noticing probes" for HCI designers and researchers to (1) gain relational and reflexive awareness, (2) identify intervention spaces for multispecies cohabitation, and (3) explore future design directions for urban noticing probes.
