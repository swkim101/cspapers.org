The advancement of large language models (LLMs) now allows users to actively interact with conversational recommendation systems (CRS) and build their own personalized recommendation services tailored to their unique needs and goals. This experience offers users a significantly higher level of controllability compared to traditional RS, enabling an entirely new dimension of recommendation experiences. Building on this context, this study explored the unique experiences that LLM-powered CRS can provide compared to traditional RS. Through a three-week diary study with 12 participants using custom GPTs for music recommendations, we found that LLM-powered CRS can (1) help users clarify implicit needs, (2) support unique exploration, and (3) facilitate a deeper understanding of musical preferences. Based on these findings, we discuss the new design space enabled by LLM-powered CRS and highlight its potential to support more personalized, user-driven recommendation experiences.
