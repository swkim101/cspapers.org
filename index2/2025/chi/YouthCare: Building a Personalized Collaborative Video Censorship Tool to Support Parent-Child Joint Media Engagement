To mitigate the negative impacts of online videos on teenagers, existing research and platforms have implemented various parental mediation mechanisms, such as Parent-Child Joint Media Engagement (JME). However, JME generally relies heavily on parents' time, knowledge, and experience. To fill this gap, we aim to design an automatic tool to help parents/children censor videos more effectively and efficiently in JME. For this goal, we first conducted a formative study to identify the needs and expectations of teenagers and parents for such a system. Based on the findings, we designed YouthCare, a personalized collaborative video censorship tool that supports parents and children to collaboratively filter out inappropriate content and select appropriate content in JME. An evaluation with 10 parent-child pairs demonstrated YouthCare's several strengths in supporting video censorship, while also highlighting some potential problems. These findings inspire us to propose several insights for the future design of parent-child collaborative JME systems.
