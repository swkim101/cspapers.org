Ridgeline plots are frequently employed to visualize the evolution or distributions of multiple series with a pile of overlapping line, area, or bar charts, highlighting the peak patterns. While traditionally viewed as small multiple visualizations, their ridge-like patterns have increasingly attracted graphic designers to create appealing customized ridgeline plots. However, many tools only support creating basic ridgeline plots and overlook their diverse layouts and styles. This paper introduces a comprehensive design space for ridgeline plots, focusing on their varied layouts and expressive styles. We present RidgeBuilder, an intuitive tool for creating expressive ridgeline plots with customizable layouts and styles. In particular, we summarize three goals for refining the layout of ridgeline plots and propose an optimization method. We assess RidgeBuilderâ€™s usability and usefulness through a reproduction study and evaluate the layout optimization algorithm through anonymized questionnaires. The effectiveness is demonstrated with a gallery of ridgeline plots created by RidgeBuilder.
