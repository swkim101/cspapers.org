The shooting of Nahel Merzouk in June 2023 ignited widespread protests across France, known as the “Justice Pour Nahel” movement, drawing attention to the privacy and security risks faced by protesters. This study explores the discourse on Twitter during the protests, focusing on digital surveillance and censorship concerns. We analyzed 341 tweets using qualitative methods to understand the security and privacy attitudes and advice shared by French-speaking users. Our findings reveal a strong apprehension toward increased long-term government surveillance and censorship, with limited and often low-tech advice on how to counteract these threats. We highlight the discrepancy between the concerns raised and the available guidance and compare our findings with those of prior work. Grounded in our analysis and informed by prior research, we offer targeted recommendations for activists, policymakers, and researchers to mitigate security and privacy concerns arising from social unrest, both in France and globally.
