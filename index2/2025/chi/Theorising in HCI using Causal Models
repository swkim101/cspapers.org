Although the literature on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) catalogues many theories, it offers surprisingly few tools for theorising. This paper critiques dominant approaches to engaging with theory and proposes a working model for theorising in HCI. We then present graphical causal modelling as an effective theorising tool. This includes a step-by-step guide to building causal models and examples of their use in different stages of the research process. We explain how causal models help develop method-agnostic representations of research problems using directed acyclic graphs, identify potential confounders, and construct alternative interpretations of data. Finally, we discuss their limitations and challenges for adoption by the HCI community.
