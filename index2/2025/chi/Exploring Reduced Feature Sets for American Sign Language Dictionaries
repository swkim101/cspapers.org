There is currently no easy way to look up signs in sign language. Feature-based dictionaries help overcome this challenge by enabling users to look up a sign by inputting descriptive visual features, such as handshape and movement. However, feature-based dictionaries are typically cumbersome, including large numbers of complex features that the user must sort through. In this work, we explore simplifying the set of features used in feature-based American Sign Language (ASL) dictionaries. We present two studies: 1) a simulation study focused on lookup accuracy for various reduced feature sets, and 2) a user study focused on understanding human preferences between feature sets. Our results suggest that it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of features needed to search for signs without significantly impacting the accuracy of search results, and that smaller feature sets can improve the user experience in some cases.
