Like humans, todayâ€™s systems, such as robots and voice assistants, can express curiosity to learn and engage with their surroundings. While curiosity is a well-established human trait that enhances social connections and drives learning, no existing scales assess the perceived curiosity of systems. Thus, we introduce the Perceived System Curiosity (PSC) scale to determine how users perceive curious systems. We followed a standardized process of developing and validating scales, resulting in a validated 12-item scale with 3 individual sub-scales measuring explorative, investigative, and social dimensions of system curiosity. In total, we generated 831 items based on literature and recruited 414 participants for item selection and 320 additional participants for scale validation. Our results show that the PSC scale has inter-item reliability and convergent and construct validity. Thus, this scale provides an instrument to explore how perceived curiosity influences interactions with technical systems systematically.
