Research in HCI and autism has become more focused on involving autistic adults in technological design. In this paper, we present the results of a scoping review analysis of 11 projects across 18 papers that focused on including autistic adults in the design of technology that impacts their lives. This paper contributes a deeper understanding of how autistic adults were involved in participatory design processes. Our findings reveal mixed positions on how the lived autistic perspective was harnessed to direct the application of topics and technologies chosen. Most projects employed infrastructures to enhance participation (e.g., providing multiple modes to participate or employing a tailored methodology). We pose future opportunities for autistic involvement, for example, in topics and technologies where autistic research is employed (e.g., autism diagnosis and machine learning), reviewing the importance of formal diagnosis for inclusion, and harnessing the multiple expertise of autistic adults.
