Neurotypical modes of existence and interaction are enforced through traditional social norms, compelling individuals who diverge from these norms, such as those who are neurodivergent, to conform through “masking.” Technology research and design often also ascribe to these conventional norms, creating technology that reinforces neurodivergent people’s need to mask. In this research, we turn to neurodivergent communities online to develop an understanding of masking behaviors. We adopt a two-tiered research approach consisting of a qualitative thematic analysis of TikTok videos and a survey questionnaire. Through this work, we initiate discussion on the complexities of neurodivergent masking as a pervasive social adaptation. We urge HCI researchers to critically reframe intervention design and research practices that may either perpetuate or seek to address masking.
