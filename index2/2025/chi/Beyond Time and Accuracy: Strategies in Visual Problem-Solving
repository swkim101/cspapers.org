In this paper, we explore viewers’ strategies in visual problem-solving tasks. We build on the traditional metrics of accuracy and time to better understand the learning that occurs as individuals interact with visualizations. We conducted an in-lab eye-tracking user study with 53 participants from diverse demographic backgrounds. Using questions from the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT), we examined participants’ problem-solving strategies. We employed a mixed-methods approach capturing quantitative data on performance and gaze patterns, as well as qualitative data through think-alouds and sketches by participants as they reported on their problem-solving approach. Our analysis reveals not only the various cognitive strategies leading to correct answers but also the nature of mistakes and the conceptual misunderstandings that underlie them. This research contributes to the enhancement of visualization design guidelines by incorporating insights into the diverse strategies and cognitive processes employed by users.
