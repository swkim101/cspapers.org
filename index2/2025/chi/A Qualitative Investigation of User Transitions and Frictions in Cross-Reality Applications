Research in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) has mostly viewed them in isolation. Yet, when used together in practical settings, AR and VR each offer unique strengths, necessitating multiple transitions to harness their advantages. This paper investigates potential challenges in Cross-Reality (CR) transitions to inform future application design. We implemented a CR system featuring a 3D modeling task that requires users to switch between PC, AR, and VR. Using a talk-aloud study (n=12) and thematic analysis, we revealed that frictions primarily arose when transitions conflicted with usersâ€™ Spatial Mental Model (SMM). Furthermore, we found five transition archetypes employed to enhance productivity once an SMM was established. Our findings uncover that transitions have to focus on establishing and upholding the SMM of users across realities, by communicating differences between them.
