3D printing is a mainstream technology enabling the affordable production of 3D models that may enhance access and understanding of graphics for students who are blind or have low vision (BLV). However, the potential usefulness of a new technology does not guarantee its adoption. This paper presents a case study in the adoption of 3D printing as an accessible format for BLV education in Australia and New Zealand. Over the last six years, a community-driven research project engaged in awareness raising, created a community of practice and developed guidelines for the use of 3D printing in education. We evaluate the success of the project using an Implementation Science lens with the RE-AIM framework and identify the key factors for successful adoption. We hope this work will guide the adoption of 3D printing for BLV students and serve as an exemplar for the adoption of other assistive technologies.
