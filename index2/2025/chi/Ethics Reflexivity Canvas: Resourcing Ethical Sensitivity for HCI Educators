Integrating ethics education in human-computer interaction (HCI) programs is critical to training responsible industry practitioners. Yet, there is a lack of practical educator-focused resources, which facilitate reflection on personal approaches to ethics education. We conducted a series of nine generative participatory workshops with 15 educators to explore, design and seek feedback on the Ethics Reflexivity Canvas as a pedagogical resource. The canvas makes the educator and learner positionality explicit to develop ethical sensitivity, sensitise and situate a pedagogical plan, and iterate and adapt over time. However, our findings suggest that educators experience tensions, depending on their pedagogical approach. We contribute insight on how resources can align with education work in HCI, help educators reflect on a plurality of approaches to ethics, use accessible language to stimulate curiosity towards ethics, and provide scaffolding to operationalize collaborative and personal exploration.
