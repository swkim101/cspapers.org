Generative AI (GenAI) has been widely applied in UX design, yet its potential in the Journey Map (JM) creation process remains under-explored. We conducted a formative study (N = 24) to identify designers’ needs for GenAI in JM creation, resulting in six design goals (e.g., Acting as Different Stakeholders) implemented in our tool, GeneyMAP. GeneyMAP streamlines the JM creation process, allowing designers to map interview data efficiently with flexibility, uncovering design opportunities through visual inspiration. A subsequent user study (N = 20) demonstrated that GeneyMAP, compared with the common tool, accelerated JM creation and fostered creativity mainly by providing diverse inspirations and facilitating progressive discussions. Our findings proved GeneyMAP’s utility and effectiveness while challenges in maintaining control and trust in GenAI outputs were noted. Our research highlights the promising role of GenAI in refining JM creation practices and suggests implications for incorporating GenAI in JM and design workflows.
