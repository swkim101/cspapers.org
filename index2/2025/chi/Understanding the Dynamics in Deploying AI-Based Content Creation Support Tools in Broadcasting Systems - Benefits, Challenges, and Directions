Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) are profoundly impacting the broadcasting industry. While generative AI shows promise in supporting broadcasting professionals, its practical workflow integration remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a user-focused investigation to understand how AI-based content creation support tools are being adopted and perceived in South Korean broadcasting stations. We used the AI Editing Assistant, an AI-powered post-production support tool, as a research probe. Through in-depth interviews with 37 diverse participants—including directors, editors, producers, developers, and executives—we discovered that generative AI significantly enhances production efficiency and unlocks new creative possibilities. However, we identified challenges such as lack of user-centered approach, demanding nature of broadcasting workflows, and professionals’ low trust in AI technologies hinders widespread adoption. Based on our findings, we propose implications, considerations, and guidelines for integrating generative AI into broadcasting practices, emphasizing improved multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration for effective and sustainable AI adoption.
