Text entry is a fundamental and ubiquitous task, but users often face challenges such as situational impairments or difficulties in sentence formulation. Motivated by this, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) to assist with text entry in real-world contexts. We propose a collaborative smartphone-based text entry system, CATIA, that leverages LLMs to provide text suggestions based on contextual factors, including screen content, time, location, activity, and more. In a 7-day in-the-wild study with 36 participants, the system offered appropriate text suggestions in over 80% of cases. Users exhibited different collaborative behaviors depending on whether they were composing text for interpersonal communication or information services. Additionally, the relevance of contextual factors beyond screen content varied across scenarios. We identified two distinct mental models: AI as a supportive facilitator or as a more equal collaborator. These findings outline the design space for human-AI collaborative text entry on smartphones.
