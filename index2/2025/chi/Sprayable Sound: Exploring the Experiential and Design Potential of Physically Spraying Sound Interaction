Perfume and fragrance have captivated people for centuries across different cultures. Inspired by the ephemeral nature of sprayable olfactory interactions and experiences, we explore the potential of applying a similar interaction principle to the auditory modality. In this paper, we present SoundMist, a sonic interaction method that enables users to generate ephemeral auditory presences by physically dispersing a liquid into the air, much like the fading phenomenon of fragrance. We conducted a study to understand the experiential factors inherent in sprayable sound interaction and held an ideation workshop to identify potential design spaces or opportunities that this interaction could shape. Our findings, derived from thematic analysis, suggest that physically sprayable sound interaction can induce experiences related to four key factors—materiality of sound produced by dispersed liquid particles, different sounds entangled with each liquid, illusive perception of temporally floating sound, and enjoyment derived from blending different sounds—and can be applied to artistic practices, safety indications, multisensory approaches, and emotional interfaces.
