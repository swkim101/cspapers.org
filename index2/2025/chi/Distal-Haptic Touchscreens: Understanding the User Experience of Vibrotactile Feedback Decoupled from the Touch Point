We examine the user experience of distal haptics for touchscreen input through confirmatory vibrations of on-screen touches at various on-body locations. To this end, we introduce the Distal Haptics Continuum, a conceptual framework of haptic feedback delivery across the body, organized along the dimensions of Body Laterality and Proximity to the touch point. Our results, from three experiments involving 45 participants and 16 locations across the hand, arm, and whole body, reveal a strong preference for distal haptics over no haptics at all, despite the spatial decoupling from the touch point, with the index finger yielding the highest user experience. We also identify additional on-body locations—the adjacent fingers, wrist, and abdomen—that unlock distinctive design opportunities. Building on our insights, demonstrating haptics effectiveness even when distant from the touch point, we outline implications for integrating various on-body locations, well beyond the index finger, into the user experience of touchscreen input.
