To interact with Augmented Reality (AR) content while walking, the user interfaces (UIs) need to move along with the user without distracting their field of view. This paper investigates on-hand reference frames for AR interaction while walking. First, we conduct a user study evaluating six on-hand reference frames. Results show that the Pinch Grip With Offset (PGWO), which anchors UIs to the pinch grip while floating at a distance, outperforms other on-hand reference frames regarding speed, accuracy, workload, and user preference. Next, we conduct a follow-up study to compare PGWO’s performance with head and torso reference frames, commonly used in previous studies, to see whether PGWO’s benefits hold up against well-established reference frames. Results revealed better performance and higher user preference for PGWO than both reference frames. Finally, we present design recommendations for developing future AR systems that are more efficient and user-friendly for on-the-go interaction.
