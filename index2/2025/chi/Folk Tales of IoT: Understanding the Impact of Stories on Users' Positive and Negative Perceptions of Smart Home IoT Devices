This study examines how anecdotal stories from friends, peers, and online sources influence non-expertsâ€™ perceptions and behaviors toward smart home IoT devices. We surveyed 263 participants, collecting narratives that either positively or negatively influenced their perception of IoT devices, which they retold in text and comic formats to encourage deeper reflection. Thematic analysis of the narratives, combined with quantitative survey data, reveals that stories significantly impact trust and willingness to use and adopt IoT devices. Negative stories, particularly those concerning security, privacy, and device unreliability, reduced trust and usage, while positive stories about home safety through monitoring and improved quality of life increased interest in IoT devices. Perceptions of different IoT devices varied based on the themes associated with the stories. The findings highlight the powerful role of storytelling in driving consumer acceptance of technology.
