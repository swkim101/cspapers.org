This study explores how Pakistani mothers, as primary caregivers, navigate the use and non-use of screen media-based devices (SMDs) in their parenting practices. Grounded in the uses and gratifications theory, we explore how mothers seek specific gratifications through their childrenâ€™s use of SMDs, and how unmet needs prompt them to adopt strategies for limiting SMD use. Through an analysis of interview and survey data, we present and discuss different patterns of SMD use among mothers, emphasizing their needs for religious education, cultural enrichment, family bonding, and early learning. These findings reveal a trend toward value-driven SMD use. We further compare these strategies with global digital parenting practices and identify opportunities for designing culturally relevant technological solutions to support digital parenting in this space.
