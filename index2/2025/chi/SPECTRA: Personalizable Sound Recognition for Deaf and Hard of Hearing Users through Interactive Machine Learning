We introduce SPECTRA, a novel pipeline for personalizable sound recognition designed to understand DHH usersâ€™ needs when collecting audio data, creating a training dataset, and reasoning about the quality of a model. To evaluate the prototype, we recruited 12 DHH participants who trained personalized models for their homes. We investigated waveforms, spectrograms, interactive clustering, and data annotating to support DHH users throughout this work-flow
