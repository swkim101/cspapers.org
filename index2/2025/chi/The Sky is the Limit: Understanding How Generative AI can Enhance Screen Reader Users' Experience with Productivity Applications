Productivity applications including word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation tools are crucial in work, education, and personal settings. Blind users typically access these tools via screen readers (SRs) and face significant accessibility and usability challenges. Recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) may address these challenges by enabling natural language interactions and contextual task understanding. However, there is limited understanding of SR usersâ€™ needs and attitudes toward GenAI assistance in these applications. We surveyed 99 SR users to gain a holistic understanding of the challenges they face when using productivity applications, the impact of these challenges on their productivity and independence, and their initial perceptions of AI assistance. Driven by their enthusiasm, we conducted interviews with 16 SR users to explore their attitudes toward GenAI and its potential usefulness in productivity applications. Our findings highlight its need to support existing SR workflows and the importance of enabling customization and task verification.
