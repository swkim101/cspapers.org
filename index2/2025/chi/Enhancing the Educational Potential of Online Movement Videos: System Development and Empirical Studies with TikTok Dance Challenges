We hypothesize that online movement videos have untapped potential for teaching physical skills, and we developed a platform that automatically generates practice plans from raw TikTok dance videos. The practice plans teach one segment at a time using fading guidance and part-learning principles and are presented using a web-based interface featuring concurrent visual aids. Two user studies (n=54, n=38) were conducted. The first showed significant improvements in learning outcomes compared to standard tutorials, underscoring the importance of well-structured practice plans and offering nuanced insights into the design and effectiveness of visual aids. The second study found that segmentation and emoji-based dual-coding only benefit learning when integrated into a well-designed lesson structure. We provide a set of practical recommendations for enhancing online movement learning, focusing on the need for substantive part-learning activities and careful use of visual aids to prevent cognitive overload.
