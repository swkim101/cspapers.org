As the global aging population grows and technology advances rapidly, integrating technology into community-based initiatives for older adults has become an increasingly important topic among HCI researchers. This research explores the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools in the co-creation and maintenance of a community gardening program involving researchers, older adult residents, and supporting organizations. A follow-up study, conducted eight months after the programâ€™s initiation assessed its sustainability, revealing how stakeholders navigated diverse ICT preferences and challenges by employing a hybrid communication system that integrated both digital and face-to-face methods to foster collaboration and sustain the initiative. This research contributes to the understanding of community preferences and needs, and the importance of contextualizing technology use within Japanese local community for collaborative community development.
