Video editors often record multiple versions of a performance with minor differences. When they add graphics atop one video, they may wish to transfer those assets to another recording, but differences in performance, wordings, and timings can cause assets to no longer be aligned with the video content. Fixing this is a time-consuming, manual task. We present a technique which preserves the temporal and spatial alignment of the original composition when automatically retargeting speech-driven video compositions.
