In the Wizard-of-Oz study paradigm, human “wizards” perform not-yet-implemented system behavior, simulating, among others, how autonomous robots could interact in public to see how unwitting bystanders respond. This paper analyzes a 60-minute video recording of two wizards in a public plaza who are operating two trash-collecting robots within their line of sight. We take an ethnomethodology and conversation analysis perspective to scrutinize interactions between the wizards and the people in the plaza, focusing on critical instances where one robot gets stuck and requires collaborative intervention by the wizards. Our analysis unpacks how the wizards deal with emergent problems by pushing one robot into the other, how they manage front and backstage interactions, and how they monitor the location of each other’s robots. We discuss how scrutinizing the work of wizards can inform explorative Wizard-of-Oz paradigms, the design of multi-agent robot systems, and the operation of urban robots from a distance.
