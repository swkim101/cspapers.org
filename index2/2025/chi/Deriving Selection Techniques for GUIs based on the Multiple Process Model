Designing efficient selection techniques for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is fundamental in HCI research. We derive selection techniques based on the multiple process model, a theory that details the motor control processes during goal-directed movements. Specifically, we deduce three theoretical assumptions on how control processes of pre-planning, impulse control, and limb-target control could influence selection movements when adjusting GUI elements, including visual feedback, cursor position, and target position. Corresponding to our assumptions, we develop three techniques that hide the cursor when a target is highlighted, snap the cursor when selection begins, and expand clustered objects during selection movements. After that, we pre-register the assumptions and research methodology and evaluate the techniques in three crowdsourcing-based pointing studies. Our results show that all techniques improved the selection efficiency compared to established baselines. We further discuss the design implications and reflect on how we derived techniques from theory.
