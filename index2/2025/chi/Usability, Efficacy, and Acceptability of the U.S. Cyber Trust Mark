The U.S. Cyber Trust Mark is intended to empower consumers and enable security by demand. But is there such a demand? To explore this, we recruited 599 participants and asked them to select their desired smart device using a simulated online marketplace. Participants were informed they would receive their selected light bulbs, and they were divided into five experimental groups based on different versions of the Mark. After the product selections, we surveyed them about their priorities and preferences. We found no significant differences between the groups as a whole. However, the subset of consumers who identified cybersecurity as most important were significantly more likely to select labeled products, spending 16.5% more. We detail these differences and preferences, then argue that an awareness program is needed to assist consumers in better understanding the long-term economic benefits of the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark.
