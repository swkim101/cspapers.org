In this paper we describe how we designed the performance Human-Computer Counter-Choreographies (HCCC) using a methodology that borrows from artistic research, critical design, choreography, and embodied sense-making. HCCC is a live-coding performance in which I (the first author) manipulate JavaScript code and use a modified version of the open-source DuckDuckGo privacy extension to unveil online tracking algorithms on stage. Throughout the performance, the audience is encouraged to participate in a sequence of choreographic prompts where they embody aspects of online tracking such as fingerprinting and profiling. We analysed audience responses to questionnaires after three performances of HCCC and found that it allows audience members to gain awareness and engage their bodies to critically reflect on online tracking. We contribute a new approach to live-coding that bridges choreography with online tracking, and we present empirical findings on the efficacy of this approach to engage audiences in reflecting on data tracking.
