Reliable augmented reality (AR) cues can support the resumption of interrupted tasks. We investigated how sub-optimal AR cue reliability (100%, 86%, 64%, or no cue) affected usersâ€™ resumption performance and strategies. In a between-subjects experiment, 120 participants conducted a physical sorting task including interruptions, and we manipulated AR cue reliability (i.e., the AR cue was present or absent at the end of interruptions). In trials with AR cue, performance with 86% and 64% reliable AR cues was as well as with 100% reliable cues. In trials without AR cue, performance with sub-optimal AR cue reliability declined but was still better than with no cue. Cue reliability affected task resumption strategies of the 86% (slow but no increase in errors) and the 64% (fast but increase in errors) reliability groups differently. Our results extend reliability research to interruptions and the observed efficiency-thoroughness trade-offs in resumption strategies provide insight for design.
