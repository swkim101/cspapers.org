Software development relies on collaboration and alignment between a variety of roles, including software developers and user experience designers. The increasing focus on artificial intelligence in today’s development projects has given rise to new challenges in this collaboration. We extend previous work on the process of designing human-AI systems by analysing collaborative practices between UX designers and AI developers through Mintzberg’s theory on coordination mechanisms. We conducted 15 in-depth interviews with UX designers and AI developers currently working on AI projects. We contribute by identifying how coordination mechanisms impact the UX design process when developing AI systems, inter-team (a)symmetries in power relations, and a growing need for tools and cross-disciplinary knowledge to support these collaborative efforts. In particular, we outline the risks of coordinating AI development work through the standardisation of output and skills in separately organised UX and AI development teams.
