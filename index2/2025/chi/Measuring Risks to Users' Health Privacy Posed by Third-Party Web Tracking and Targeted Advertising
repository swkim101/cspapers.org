Online advertising platforms may be able to infer privacy-sensitive information about people, such as their health conditions. This could lead to harms like exposure to predatory targeted advertising or unwanted disclosure of health conditions to employers or insurers. In this work, we experimentally evaluate whether online advertisers target people with health conditions. We collected the browsing histories of people with and without health conditions. We crawled their histories to simulate their browsing profiles and collected the ads that were served to them. Then, we compared the content of the ads between groups. We observed that the profiles of people who visited more health-related web pages received more health-related ads. 49.5% of health-related ads used deceptive advertising techniques. Our findings suggest that new privacy regulations and enforcement measures are needed to protect peopleâ€™s health privacy from online tracking and advertising platforms.
