Transitioning to manual control following a Take-Over Request (TOR) in Level 3 autonomous cars is challenging, requiring drivers to re-engage with driving after engaging with Non-Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs). Effective TOR design can mitigate this challenge. We present the first study on how culture, age, and NDRT intersect to shape TOR design. In a cross-cultural study across the UK (high traffic-law compliance) and Israel (low compliance), involving older and younger drivers, participants designed TORs for four NDRTs in a real car setting. Results revealed a universal preference for re-purposing NDRT-devices to issue TORs. Older drivers preferred tri-modal TORs that suspend the NDRT; younger drivers favoured bi-modal TORs allowing NDRT interruption management. Due to altered alert sensitivity and low law compliance, Israeli participants included a RiskMeter to assess hazard criticality. We introduce novel TOR designs and taxonomy features to guide culturally and age-sensitive TOR development, key for global Level 3 adoption.
