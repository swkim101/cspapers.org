In Virtual Reality (VR), rendering realistic forces is crucial for immersion, but traditional vibrotactile feedback fails to convey force sensations effectively. Studies of asymmetric vibrations that elicit pseudo forces show promise but are inherently tied to unwanted vibrations, reducing realism. Leveraging sensory attenuation to reduce the perceived intensity of self-generated vibrations during user movement, we present a novel algorithm that couples asymmetric vibrations with user motion, which mimics self-generated sensations. Our psychophysics study with 12 participants shows that motion-coupled asymmetric vibration attenuates the experience of vibration (equivalent to a ~30% reduction in vibration-amplitude) while preserving the experience of force, compared to continuous asymmetric vibrations (state-of-the-art). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in VR through three scenarios: shooting arrows, lifting weights, and simulating haptic magnets. Results revealed that participants preferred forces elicited by motion-coupled asymmetric vibration for tasks like shooting arrows and lifting weights. This research highlights the potential of motion-coupled asymmetric vibrations, offers new insights into sensory attenuation, and advances force rendering in VR.
