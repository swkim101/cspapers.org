People with energy-limiting conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID, need to limit their activity levels and balance exertion with rest and restorative activities. This practice is known as “pacing”. There is an opportunity for technology to help people with this process, but conducting research with this population can be difficult given their limited and unpredictable energy levels. This research explores how we can use crip theory to inform the development of co-design methods suitable for this cohort, and as an analytical lens to explore how these tools should be designed outside of normative and abelist assumptions about fatigue and productivity. This is done through a 5 week Asynchronous Remote Community study utilising various co-design techniques. These findings point to future designs of pacing technologies and contribute insights about developing more accessible approaches to conducting research with people with energy-limiting conditions.
