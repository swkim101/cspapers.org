UI prototyping often involves iterating and blending elements from examples such as screenshots and sketches, but current tools offer limited support for incorporating these examples. Inspired by the cognitive process of conceptual blending, we introduce a novel UI workflow that allows developers to rapidly incorporate diverse aspects from design examples into work-in-progress UIs. We prototyped this workflow as Misty. Through an exploratory first-use study with 14 frontend developers, we assessed Misty's effectiveness and gathered feedback on this workflow. Our findings suggest that Misty's conceptual blending workflow helps developers kickstart creative explorations, flexibly specify intent in different stages of prototyping, and inspires developers through serendipitous UI blends. Misty demonstrates the potential for tools that blur the boundaries between developers and designers.
