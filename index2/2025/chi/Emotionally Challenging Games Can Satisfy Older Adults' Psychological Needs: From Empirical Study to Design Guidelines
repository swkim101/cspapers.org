Older adults often struggle to meet their psychological needs due to retirement and living alone. Recent studies suggest that games featuring emotional challenge (EC) can help fulfill basic psychological needs such as autonomy, competence, and relatedness by facilitating emotional exploration. However, it remains unclear whether older adults can benefit from EC games, whether they find this genre enjoyable, and how these games should be designed to better meet their needs. This work explores older adultsâ€™ experiences and perceptions of playing EC games through two studies. The first study involved playing Detroit: Become Human, revealing that older adults derived multifaceted psychological experiences from playing the game. The second study involved a custom-designed game scenario tailored to older adults, demonstrating that meaningful choices significantly influenced autonomy need satisfaction. Based on these findings, we offer five design guidelines for developing EC games that satisfy psychological needs of older adults.
