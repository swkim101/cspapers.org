Parents of children in speech therapy play a crucial role in delivering consistent, high-quality home practice, which is essential for helping children generalize new speech skills to everyday situations. However, this responsibility is often complicated by uncertainties in implementing therapy techniques and keeping children engaged. In this study, we explore how varying levels of AI oversight can provide informational, emotional, and practical support to parents during home speech therapy practice. Through semi-structured interviews with 20 parents, we identified key challenges they face and their ideas for AI assistance. Using these insights, we developed six design concepts, which were then evaluated by 20 Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) for their potential impact, usability, and alignment with therapy goals. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AIâ€™s role in supporting therapeutic practices, offering design considerations that address the needs and values of both families and professionals.
