Integrating technology with the distinctive characteristics of craftsmanship has become a key issue in the field of digital craftsmanship. This paper introduces Layered Interactions, a design approach that seamlessly merges Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technologies with traditional lacquerware craftsmanship. By leveraging the multi-layer structure and material properties of lacquerware, we embed interactive circuits and integrate programmable hardware within the layers, creating tangible interface that support diverse interactions. This method enhances the adaptability and practicality of traditional crafts in modern digital contexts. Through the development of a lacquerware toolkit, along with user experiments and semi-structured interviews, we demonstrate that this approach not only makes technology more accessible to traditional artisans but also enhances the materiality and emotional qualities of interactive interfaces. Additionally, it fosters mutual learning and collaboration between artisans and technologists. Our research introduces a cross-disciplinary perspective to the HCI community, broadening the material and design possibilities for interactive interfaces.
