Internal game balancing is one of the major components that affect player experience, as it is responsible for a large share of development time, the majority of game update patches and long-term player satisfaction. This makes tools and methodologies of assessing and advancing game balance a valuable endeavor for industry and academia. During the past decades, scientific research produced numerous outputs to inform and enhance game balancing, yet most of them only adhere to a single dimension of balance: fixed (end-game) scenarios. However, games are usually experienced throughout a continuous spectrum of ever-changing constellations, which should be reflected. Using simulation, game-playing AI, visual analytics and informative metrics, we introduce a methodology and implementation of Progression Balancing, incorporating multi-dimensional game aspects. For the sake of exposition and ecological validity, we applied it in one of the most successful recent games (Baldurâ€™s Gate 3), and evaluated its efficacy with help of its player community.
