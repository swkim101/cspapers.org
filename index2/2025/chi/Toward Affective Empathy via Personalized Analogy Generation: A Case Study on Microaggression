The importance of empathy cannot be overstated in modern societies where people of diverse backgrounds increasingly interact together. The HCI community has strived to foster affective empathy through immersive technologies. Many previous techniques are built upon a premise that presenting the same experience as-is may help evoke the same emotion, which however faces limitations in matters where the emotional responses largely differ across individuals. In this paper, we present a novel concept of generating a personalized experience based on a large language model (LLM) to facilitate affective empathy between individuals despite their differences. As a case study to showcase its effectiveness, we developed EmoSync, an LLM-based agent that generates personalized analogical microaggression situations, facilitating users to personally resonate with a specific microaggression situation of another person. EmoSync is designed and evaluated along a 3-phased user study with 100+ participants. We comprehensively discuss implications, limitations, and possible applications.
