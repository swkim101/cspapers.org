Older adults face unique challenges in adopting social technology, particularly through retirement. Whereas existing digital solutions are often disconnected from the motivations of older adults, ambient and tangible technologies (ATTs) are emerging as promising social tools that integrate into users’ routines and leverage familiar physical interactions. This study investigates how older adults envision ATTs to meaningfully support their social connections. Through two phases of co-design with 25 retiring older adults (55+) and 5 social partners (25+), we explore the intersection of social health, life transitions, and technology use. Our thematic analysis reveals how shifting perceptions of time influence engagement, relationship maintenance, and legacy-building. We present opportunities to align ATT design with older adults’ emotional goals, social practices, and community connections by posing design challenges, such as collective legacy building, for supporting the meaningful relationships of retiring adults as they age.
