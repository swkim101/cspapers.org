Good sleep hygiene is essential for quality sleep. This study investigates user preferences for the timing of interactions with features in smartwatch-based sleep hygiene games. Findings reveal that interactions during sleep are generally undesirable, with Sleep Health Points being the only exception. We also identified a misconception that games must involve active play, overlooking the potential of passive and idle game mechanics. Participants preferred engaging with planning and behavior-triggering features before the associated behavior, while reflection and reinforcement features, like reports and rewards, were favored post-behavior. The perceived dual functionality of certain features suggests that preferred interaction timing depends on users’ perceptions of the features’ roles. Users’ schedules and situational context, especially evening availability, also influenced their preferences. This study highlights the importance of aligning feature timing with user routines and perceptions, and advocates for game designs that blend active and passive elements to boost engagement and promote sleep hygiene.
