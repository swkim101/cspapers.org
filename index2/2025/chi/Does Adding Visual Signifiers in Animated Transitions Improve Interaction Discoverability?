types (Container Transform, Panels), and compared them to a base-line. We found that transitions with a standard duration did not impact the discovery of swipe-related widgets (N=33). We ran a follow-up study (N=22) with extremely slow 5000ms transitions to guarantee noticeability, but similarly found no impact on discovery of swipe-revealed widgets, diverging from previous findings for visual signifiers. This raises interesting questions about the perception and understanding of interaction signifiers
