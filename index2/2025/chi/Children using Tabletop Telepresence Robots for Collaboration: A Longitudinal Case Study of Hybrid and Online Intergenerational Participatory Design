Improving telepresence for children expands educational opportunities and connects faraway family. Yet, research about child-centered physical telepresence systems (tangible interfaces for telepresence) remains sparse, despite established benefits of tangible interaction for children. To address this gap, we collaborated with child designers (ages 8-12) over 2-years of online/1-year of hybrid participatory design. Together, we adapted one approach to physical telepresence (tabletop robots) for child users. Using a case study methodology, we explore how our tabletop telepresence robot platform influenced children’s connections with one another over the 3-year study. In our analysis, we compare four vignettes representing cooperation/conflict between children while using the platform; centering theories of ownership, collaboration, and co-design roles. Through this exploration of children’s interpersonal dynamics while using the platform, we uncover four key features of tabletop telepresence robots for children: (1) Anonymous Robot Control (2) Robot/Material Distribution, (3) Robot Form/Size, and (4) Robot Stewardship.
