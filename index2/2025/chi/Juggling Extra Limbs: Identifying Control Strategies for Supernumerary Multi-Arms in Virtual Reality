Using supernumerary multi-limbs for complex tasks is a growing research focus in Virtual Reality (VR) and robotics. Understanding how users integrate extra limbs to achieve shared goals is crucial for developing efficient supernumeraries. This paper presents an exploratory study (N=14) investigating strategies for controlling virtual supernumerary limbs with varying autonomy in VR object manipulation tasks. Using a Wizard-of-Oz approach to simulate semi-autonomous limbs, we collected qualitative and quantitative data. Results show participants adapted control strategies based on task complexity and autonomy, affecting task delegation, coordination, and body ownership. Based on these findings, we propose guidelines—commands, demonstration, delegation, and labeling—to improve multi-limb interaction design by adapting autonomy to user needs and fostering context-aware experiences.
