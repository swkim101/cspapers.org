People have different levels of affinity for technology, which impacts their attitudes and behavior when using novel technologies. Capturing this difference requires a validated multi-language instrument. Hence, we translated and validated English, Japanese, and Spanish versions of the Affinity for Technology questionnaire (TAEG), which has so far only been available in German. The TAEG consists of four scales assessing enthusiasm, perceived competence, and positive and negative consequences of technology. After systematic translation, we collected and analyzed age and gender-stratified samples from Germany, Mexico, Japan, and the US, with a total sample N=1206. All TAEG versions showed an excellent fit with the four-factor model and good criterion validity. We also introduced a short-scale (TAEG-S) that captures the global construct. We found significant cross-country variations, with Mexico reporting the highest TAEG scores on all scales. The validated versions of TAEG provide a robust tool to assess individualsâ€™ affinity for technology internationally.
