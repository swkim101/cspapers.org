Ubiquitous computing devices like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses allow countless spontaneous interactions – all serving different goals. AR devices rely on data transfer to personalize recommendations and adapt to the user. Today’s consent mechanisms, such as privacy policies, are suitable for long-lasting interactions; however, how users can consent to fast, spontaneous interactions is unclear. We first conducted two focus groups (N=17) to identify privacy-relevant scenarios in AR. We then conducted expert interviews (N=11) with co-design activities to establish effective consent mechanisms. Based on that, we contribute (1) a validated scenario taxonomy to define privacy-relevant AR interaction scenarios, (2) a flowchart to decide on the type of mechanisms considering contextual factors, (3) a design continuum and design aspects chart to create the mechanisms, and (4) a trade-off and prediction chart to evaluate the mechanism. Thus, we contribute a conceptual framework fostering a privacy-preserving future with AR.
