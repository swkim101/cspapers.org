Data Humanism has gained prominence in personal visualization and Personal Informatics, advocating for a subjective and slow approach to engage with personal data. Collaborative sensemaking has great potential for aiding the understanding of personal data, yet little is known about addressing requirements of structure and coordination when integrating Data Humanism into collaborative visualization. In this paper, we propose design principles for creating both subjective and effective collaborative visualizations, while coordinating the slow sensemaking process and promoting data awareness and communication. We operationalize these principles into a personal visualization toolkit, which we evaluate with an observational study involving 16 university students (8 pairs) analyzing each otherâ€™s screen-time data. Our findings reveal that implementing the proposed design principles: (1) facilitated data comparison from shared subjective perspectives, (2) helped coordinate sensemaking while allowing time for understanding personal data, and (3) helped the contextualization of data patterns, in turn aiding self-reflection.
