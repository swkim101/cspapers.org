Data profiling plays a critical role in understanding the structure of complex datasets and supporting numerous downstream tasks, such as social media analytics and financial fraud detection. While existing research predominantly focuses on structured data formats, a substantial portion of semi-structured textual data still requires ad-hoc and arduous manual profiling to extract and comprehend its internal structures. In this work, we propose StructVizor, an interactive profiling system that facilitates sensemaking and transformation of semi-structured textual data. Our tool mainly addresses two challenges: a) extracting and visualizing the diverse structural patterns within data, such as how information is organized or related, and b) enabling users to efficiently perform various wrangling operations on textual data. Through automatic data parsing and structure mining, StructVizor enables visual analytics of structural patterns, while incorporating novel interactions to enable profile-based data wrangling. A comparative user study involving 12 participants demonstrates the system's usability and its effectiveness in supporting exploratory data analysis and transformation tasks.
