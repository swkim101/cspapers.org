Despite the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities (DD) worldwide, children with ASD and DD face tremendous difficulties receiving support due to physical, financial, and psychological barriers to onsite health and education clinics. As a result, researchers and practitioners have designed software solutions aimed at providing accessible support to meet users’ needs. However, we have limited knowledge of whether these solutions indeed work in real-world settings. To address this gap, we conducted a case study on a cognitive training program called Dubupang, designed by Dubu Inc. From in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders and field observations of children with ASD and DD, we identify Dubu Inc.’s internal development processes, the critical design issues that emerged through a series of field trials (e.g., instructional design and feedback), and the key implications (e.g., importance of caregivers’ strategic human interventions) for design that better supports both children with ASD and DD and their caregivers.
