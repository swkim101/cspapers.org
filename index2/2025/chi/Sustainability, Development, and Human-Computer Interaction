Researchers in Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI) have studied the design and use of technologies for sustainability and development, contributing to the subfields of Sustainable HCI and HCI for Development. Increasingly, there have been calls within and outside HCI for a more integrated approach to sustainable development. To identify the potential of such an approach, we present a comprehensive review of HCI scholarship on sustainability and development, combined with an analysis of interviews with researchers working in and across both subfields. Using the lens of political economy, we uncover understandings, critiques, tensions, and considerations toward advancing scholarship at the intersections of sustainability, development, and HCI. We conclude by inviting the larger Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) community to join us in collectively devising pathways for technology-mediated sustainable development.
