Continuous, everyday ECG monitoring is essential for detecting transient heart conditions and enabling early intervention in cardiovascular diseases. However, current technologies, such as ECG Holter monitors and smartwatches, face challenges in balancing continuous monitoring with long-term wearability due to trade-offs in electrode placement. To address this, we present a novel ECG necklace that leverages its natural placement on the chest to provide continuous, clinically valuable ECG monitoring. Our design positions two electrodes on the left and right sides of the chest, approximating standard Lead I placement for accurate cardiac diagnostics. The necklace features an innovative skin moisture-enhanced electrode design for sustained comfort and integrates a compact 22-mm processing unit as the pendant, offering a 4-day battery life. In our studies, the ECG necklace demonstrated performance comparable to FDA-approved Holter monitors, with key features falling within a timing error range of 3.2–15.7 ms—well within acceptable limits. In our in-the-wild study, participants rated the necklace as highly comfortable and preferred it over traditional ECG monitors. As a widely accepted everyday accessory, the ECG necklace has the potential to seamlessly combine advanced functionality with daily wearability.
