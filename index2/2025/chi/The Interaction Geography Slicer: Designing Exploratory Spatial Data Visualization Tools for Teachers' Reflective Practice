Researchers in HCI and teacher education have long recognized the potential of visualization to support teachers’ reflective practice. Despite much progress however, teacher educators continue to highlight the need for more dynamic classroom data visualizations to better support teachers’ reflective practice, particularly about spatial dimensions of their pedagogy. In response, this article makes three contributions. First, we build on prior work to present the Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS), an open-source tool to dynamically visualize movement, conversation, and video data over space and time in settings such as classrooms. Second, we share findings from a participatory design-based research project involving 11 experienced high school mathematics teachers who used the IGS over one year to support their reflective practice. Finally, we propose new directions for exploratory spatial classroom data visualization.
