3D-printed models are increasingly used to provide people who are blind or have low vision (BLV) with access to maps, educational materials, and museum exhibits. Recent research has explored interactive 3D-printed models (I3Ms) that integrate touch gestures, conversational dialogue, and haptic vibratory feedback to create more engaging interfaces. Prior research with sighted people has found that imbuing machines with human-like behaviours, i.e., embodying them, can make them appear more lifelike, increasing social perception and presence. Such embodiment can increase engagement and trust. This work presents the first exploration into the design of embodied I3Ms and their impact on BLV engagement and trust. In a controlled study with 12 BLV participants, we found that I3Ms using specific embodiment design factors, such as haptic vibratory and embodied personified voices, led to an increased sense of liveliness and embodiment, as well as engagement, but had mixed impact on trust.
