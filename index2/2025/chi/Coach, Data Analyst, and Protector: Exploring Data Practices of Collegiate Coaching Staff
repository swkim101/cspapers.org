A rapidly emerging research community at the intersection of sport and human-computer interaction (SportsHCI) explores how technology can support physically active humans, such as athletes. At highly competitive levels, coaching staff play a central role in the athlete experience by using data to enhance performance, reduce injuries, and foster team success. However, little is known about the practices and needs of these coaching staff. We conducted five focus groups with 17 collegiate coaching staff across three women’s teams and two men’s teams at an elite U.S. university. Our findings show that coaching staff selectively use data with the goal of balancing performance goals, athlete emotional well-being, and privacy. This paper contributes design recommendations to support coaching staff in operating across the data life cycle through gathering, sharing, deciding, acting, and assessing data as they aim to support team success and foster the well-being of student-athletes.
