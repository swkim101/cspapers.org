With efforts to investigate the role of interactivity on user psychology in video games, scholars have demonstrated that interactivity may induce cognitive, emotional, physical (controller and exertional), and social demands of global gamers. However, existing studies are missing Latin American gamers as critical yet understudied gaming communities. Drawing on the interactivity-as-demand model, we conducted a mixed-method online survey to test measurement validity on localized versions of the video game demand scale (VGDS) for Spanish-speaking gamers (N = 195). Results showed that the Spanish-translated scale replicated the a priori five-factor structure of VGDS. Emergent themes from gamers’ comments mirrored VGDS factors, with additional insights into the cognitive demand of creative thinking, emotional demand of feeling nostalgia, physical demand of being precise, and social demand of interacting with non-player characters. These findings provide a pancultural perspective of Spanish-speaking gamers’ perceptions of their gaming while offering nuanced insights into their experiences for future research.
