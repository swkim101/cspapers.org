We present a methodology for designing an AI feedback system aimed at assisting basketball beginners in refining their shooting techniques during independent practice sessions. Mastering shooting mechanics requires consistent, precise repetition, which traditionally depends on coaching feedback and the breakdown of movements into steps during the early stages. However, due to limited coaching resources, this guidance is often unavailable, leading to ineffective and even detrimental motor learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) framework grounded in expert human knowledge, or knowledge-based SOP, which allows our AI-driven system to verify and guide playersâ€™ movements in real-time. Through a formative study involving interviews with 13 coaches and players, we identified key challenges faced by beginners, such as uncertainty in movement correctness and lack of guidance during unsupervised practice. Our AI system addresses these issues by providing immediate, actionable feedback using SOP tailored to individual players. In a study with 28 participants, we confirmed that our system improves shooting form, increases confidence in adjustments, and enhances self-awareness during practice. This work highlights the potential of integrating coaching expertise with AI to empower athletes with more effective tools for self-directed practice.
