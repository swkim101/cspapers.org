Ultrasound assessments are key in assessing traumatic injuries to the human body during urgent medical emergencies. Obtaining proficiency in conducting ultrasound assessments is challenging, and relies on hands-on, individually instructed training provided by a scarce number of ultrasound experts. We investigate how to support medical studentsâ€™ learning of ultrasound assessment through visual augmentations. By enhancing the learning process, we seek to support medical students in reaching higher proficiency in ultrasound assessments. We followed an ultrasound assessment course to identify the primary challenges faced by medical students learning to conduct ultrasound assessments. Based on our findings, we designed four distinct visual augmentations in collaboration with a course educator that guide students in achieving better ultrasound image quality. We evaluated these visual augmentations in a mixed-method study with 15 medical students. Our findings provide insights on the use of digital technology in supporting clinical training, and the possibilities of bridging existing training practices.
