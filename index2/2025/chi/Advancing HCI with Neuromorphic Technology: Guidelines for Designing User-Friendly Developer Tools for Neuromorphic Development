Neuromorphic technology offers advantages such as low-power processing, low latency, adaptive learning, and noise tolerance, making it ideal for edge computing applications. However, developers face significant hurdles due to the nascent nature of the field, including limited access to hardware and software, lack of benchmarks, and the need for deep interdisciplinary knowledge. Through interviews with 12 practitioners from both industry and academia, we conducted a thematic analysis to understand the current landscape of neuromorphic programming and identified key challenges, workflows, and potential solutions for enhancing accessibility and adoption. Our findings led to a set of guidelines for creating more accessible software development tools and platforms for those looking to create neuromorphic applications. Through this work, we aim to bridge the gap between neuromorphic computing and the HCI community, promoting the design of more intuitive and effective interfaces for neuromorphic development, and ultimately facilitating the creation of edge intelligent systems.
