Public administrations provide critical services and manage sensitive data for a countryâ€™s citizens. Recent phishing campaigns targeting public sector employees highlight their attractiveness as targets. Deploying state-of-the-art authentication technologies, such as FIDO2, can improve overall security. We conducted a mixed-methods study in Germany to understand better the practices and challenges of deploying passwordless authentication in the public sector. First, we conducted an online survey (N=108) among German public sector employees to gain insights into their experiences and challenges. Next, we partnered with an e-government vendor and performed an in-situ experiment. We let 11 employees from the public sector experience FIDO2 under real-world conditions. Our results show that only a minority of our participants were aware of current passwordless authentication procedures. In our experiment, FIDO2-based methods left an overall positive impression. Hierarchical and heterogeneous public sector structures and the need for more technical expertise and equipment were barriers to adoption.
