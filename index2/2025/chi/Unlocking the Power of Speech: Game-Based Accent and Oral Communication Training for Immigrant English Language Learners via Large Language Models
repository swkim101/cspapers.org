With the growing number of immigrants globally, language barriers have become a significant challenge, particularly for those entering English-speaking countries. Traditional language learning methods often fail to provide sufficient practical opportunities, especially for diverse accents. To address this, we introduce Language Urban Odyssey (LUO), a serious game that leverages large language models (LLMs) and game-based learning to offer a low-cost, accessible virtual environment for English learners. Built on the Minecraft platform, LUO offers real-time speech interaction with NPCs of various accents, supported by multi-modal feedback. A controlled study (N=30) showed improvements in speaking abilities, accent comprehension, and emotional confidence. Our findings suggest that LUO provides a scalable, immersive platform that bridges gaps in language learning for immigrants facing cultural and social challenges.
