Urban environments can inhibit the formation of publics due to their distracting nature and distant social ties. Yet, forming publics is critical for bringing and mobilizing citizens around issues. In this paper, we introduce a methodology that combines oral history collection and qualitative analysis to foster connections among youth in a North American public school. During our project, the youth interviewed classmates, guardians, and strangers from their community about the meaning of home, then collectively analyzed the oral histories using qualitative analysis techniques. Our findings highlight that this process generated unexpected connections around shared experiences despite the different backgrounds of project participants, thus fostering a sense of attachment to home as a cause for public formation. Our paper demonstrates the effectiveness of such approach in building attachments as a pre-cursor to public formation in community-centered work, while reflecting on the associated practical challenges like skill development, sustained engagement, and emotional labor.
