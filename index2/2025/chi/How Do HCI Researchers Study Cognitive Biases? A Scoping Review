Computing systems are increasingly designed to adapt to users’ cognitive states and mental models. Yet, cognitive biases affect how humans form such models and, therefore, they can impact their interactions with computers. To better understand this interplay, we conducted a scoping review to chart how Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers study cognitive biases. Our findings show that computing systems not only have the potential to induce and amplify cognitive biases but also can be designed to steer users’ behaviour and decision-making by capitalising on biases. We describe how HCI researchers develop algorithms and sensing methods to detect and quantify the effects of cognitive biases and discuss how we can use their understanding to inform system design. In this paper, we outline a research agenda for more theory-grounded research and highlight ethical issues when researching and designing computing systems with cognitive biases in mind as they affect real-world behaviour.
