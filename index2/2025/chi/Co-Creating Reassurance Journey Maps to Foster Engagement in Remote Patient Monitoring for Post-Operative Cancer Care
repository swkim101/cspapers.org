Remote patient monitoring can significantly enhance post-operative home recovery for cancer patients, yet its effectiveness is often hindered by low patient engagement. Reassurance has been identified as a key factor in improving engagement. Our study explored how cancer patients seek reassurance through a Patient Public Involvement workshop with former patients. This involved developing personas for participants to navigate reassurance scenarios and share their post-operative experiences. Based on this, we co-created a reassurance journey map to illustrate when reassurance is needed, the behaviours patients use to seek it, and how it can be effectively provided. Our findings highlight three key design principles: the limitations of digital technology in offering reassurance, the personalised nature of reassurance, and the need for holistic integration. These are intended to inform the design of reassurance-focused RPM systems that better support cancer patients during home recovery. Practical design recommendations are also provided for developers and clinicians.
