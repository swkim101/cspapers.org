Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in using robots to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people in various tasks and contexts. However, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community still lacks a shared understanding of what, where, and how robots can benefit BLV users in their daily lives. In light of this, we conducted a systematic literature review to help researchers navigate the current landscape of this field through an HCI lens. We followed a systematic multi-stage approach and carefully selected a corpus of 76 papers from premier HCI venues. Our review provides a comprehensive overview of application areas, embodiments, and interaction techniques of the developed robotic systems. Further, we identified opportunities, challenges, and key considerations in this emerging field. Through this systematic review, we aim to inspire researchers, developers, designers, and HCI practitioners, to create a more inclusive environment for the BLV community.
