Telepresence robots have the potential to change our experiences in galleries and museums, allowing for a range of hybrid interactions for visitors and museum professionals, improving accessibility, offering activities or information, and providing a range of practical use cases (e.g. the robots augmenting museum exhibits). We present the results of 3 qualitative studies conducted in the UK exploring the acceptability (1 - interviews with museum professionals with no previous exposure to telepresence), acceptance (2 – focus groups for initial exposure to telepresence robots), and adoption (3 – interviews with museum professionals with long-term exposure to robots) of telepresence robots in museums. Our results identified opportunities and barriers focusing on the unique perspective of museum professionals and showed how priorities of museums shift and change according to their exposure to different technologies. We proposed a set of practical guidelines for future telepresence robots in museums, including design implications, potential applications, and integration strategies.
