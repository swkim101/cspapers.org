Virtual reality head-mounted displays (HMDs) offer unique and immersive opportunities for higher education. However, current research focuses on small-scale and infrequent use cases, raising questions about large-scale HMD integration into classrooms. We explored logistical and pedagogical challenges and opportunities when using 30 VR HMDs in a design class of 55 undergraduate students throughout a 12-week term. Each student shared an HMD with a partner, using it weekly in class and at home. We administered questionnaires and conducted observations and interviews. Our results reveal highly positive student engagement, but instructors and students must adapt to unique HMD characteristics and challenges, including in-VR lecturing practices, developing safety measures, and mitigating cybersickness. Although instructor-led VR tutorials were helpful, most learning occurred in individual, paired, and group activities, where screencasting and HMD sharing fostered collaborative learning. Free time during classes provided an opportunity for targeted instructor support while allowing students to explore emerging practices.
