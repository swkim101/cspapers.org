As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform the modern workplace, generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a prominent tool capable of augmenting work processes. Defined by its ability to create or modify content, GenAI differs significantly from traditional machine learning models that classify, recognize, or predict patterns from existing data. This study explores the role of GenAI in shaping perceptions of AI's contribution and how these perceptions influence both creators’ internal assessments of their work and their anticipation of external evaluators’ assessments. Our research develops and empirically tests a structural model through a between-subjects experiment, revealing that the role GenAI plays in the work process significantly impacts perceived enhancements in work quality and effort relative to human input. Additionally, we identify a critical trade-off between fostering worker assessments of creativity and managing perceived external assessments of the work's value.
