Short-form video platforms like YouTube Shorts captivate users with engaging content, but their potential for promoting incidental learning remains underexplored. We present Curious Shorts, a conceptual framework that extends the Hook Model, designed to enhance curiosity-driven exploration and incidental learning on these platforms. In Study 1, we empirically tested two designs that incorporate "curiosity nudges" — interactive prompts that spark curiosity and encourage further exploration — with follow-up videos to satisfy that curiosity. Results show that specific, question-driven prompts proved most effective, significantly boosting curiosity and encouraging more focused and intentional viewing compared to the baseline. Study 2 examined whether this design enhances incidental learning without compromising engagement. Findings confirmed improved learning outcomes. However, when applied to a realistic viewing environment interspersed with entertainment videos, engagement remained high while learning benefits diminished. We conclude with implications for balancing learning and engagement on short-form video platforms and propose directions for future research.
