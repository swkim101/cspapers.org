We introduce FlexEar-Tips, a dynamic ear tip system designed for the next-generation hearables. The ear tips are controlled by an air pump and solenoid valves, enabling size adjustments for comfort and functionality. FlexEar-Tips includes an air pressure sensor to monitor ear tip size, allowing it to adapt to environmental conditions and user needs. In the evaluation, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the size control accuracy and the minimum amount of variability of haptic perception in the user’s ear. We then evaluated the user’s ability to identify patterns in the haptic notification system, the impact on the music listening experience, the relationship between the size of the ear tips and the sound localization ability, and the impact on the reduction of humidity in the ear using a model. We proposed new interaction modalities for adaptive hearables and discussed health monitoring, immersive auditory experiences, haptics notifications, biofeedback, and sensing.
