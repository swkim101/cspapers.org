Competition is typically centered on balance, fairness, and symmetric play. However, in mixed-ability competition, symmetric play is often not possible or desirable. Currently, it is not clear what can or should be done in the pursuit of the design of inclusive competitive experiences (in sports and games). In this paper, we interview 15 people with motor or visual disabilities who actively engage in competitive activities (e.g., Paralympics, competitive gaming). We focus on understanding engagement and fairness perspectives within mixed-ability competitive scenarios, highlighting the obstacles and opportunities these interactions present. We relied on thematic analysis to examine the motivations to compete, team structures and roles, perspectives on ability disclosure and rankings, and a reflection on the role of technology in mediating competition. We contribute with an understanding of (1) how competition is experienced, (2) key factors influencing inclusive and fair competition, and (3) reflections for the design of inclusive competitive experiences.
