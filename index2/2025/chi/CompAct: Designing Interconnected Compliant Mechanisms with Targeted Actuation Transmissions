Compliant mechanisms enable the creation of compact and easy-to-fabricate devices for tangible interaction. This work explores interconnected compliant mechanisms consisting of multiple joints and rigid bodies to transmit and process displacements as signals that result from physical interactions. As these devices are difficult to design due to their vast and complex design space, we developed a graph-based design algorithm and computational tool to help users program and customize such computational functions and procedurally model physical designs. When combined with active materials with actuation and sensing capabilities, these devices can also render and detect haptic interaction. Our design examples demonstrate the tool's capability to respond to relevant HCI concepts, including building modular physical interface toolkits, encrypting tangible interactions, and customizing user augmentation for accessibility. We believe the tool will facilitate the generation of new interfaces with enriched affordance.
