Trans and non-binary individuals undergoing hormone therapy face unique and evolving needs for sexual wellness products that current solutions often overlook. The transition process involves significant anatomical and psychological changes, highlighting the necessity for more inclusive approaches to Human-Computer Interaction and overall well-being. Within this framework, this study presents the development of a pleasure object designed to be fluid, adaptive, and responsive to the evolving anatomical and psychological changes experienced during hormone therapy. To this end, authors conducted comprehensive research, including an online survey on the autoerotic habits of trans and non-binary individuals, followed by three sensitive interviews and clinical integration. They observed significant themes that highlight the unique requirements and experiences of this community. By leveraging advanced technologies and selected materials, authors provide design considerations and discuss the potential of these methods to create sexual wellness products that offer meaningful and inclusive experiences for the trans and non-binary community.
