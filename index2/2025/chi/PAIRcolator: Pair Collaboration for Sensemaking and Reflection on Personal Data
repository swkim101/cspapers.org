This paper explores pair collaboration as a novel approach for making sense of personal data. Pair collaboration—characterized by dyadic comparison and structured roles for questioning and reasoning—has proven effective for co-constructing knowledge. However, current collaborative visualization tools primarily focus on group comparisons, overlooking the challenges of accommodating pair collaboration in the context of personal data. To address this gap, we propose a set of design rationales supporting subjective data analysis through dyadic comparison and mixed-focus collaboration styles for co-constructing personal narratives. We operationalize these principles in a tangible visualization toolkit, PAIRcolator. Our user study demonstrates that pairwise collaboration facilitated by the toolkit: 1) reveals detailed data insights that are effective for recalling personal experiences, and 2) fosters a structured, reciprocal sensemaking process for interpreting and reconstructing personal experiences beyond data insights. Our results shed light on the design rationales for, and the processes of pair sensemaking of personal data, and their effects to foster deep levels of reflection.
