Waiting for system loading is a common scenario that often diminishes user experience, leading to dissatisfaction. Well-established visual indicators like progress bars can not directly apply to the interactions with voice assistants (VAs) like Siri. As VAs continue to rise in popularity, this research aims to explore the design of auditory indicators, particularly human speech, for optimizing waiting experiences in Voice User Interfaces (VUIs). We first organized focus groups (N=35) to identify design considerations for speech indicators, uncovering design opportunities in integrating explanations and humor. Subsequently, we conducted an empirical study (N=30) to evaluate the effects of speech indicators with two levels of explanation and humor on the waiting experience, measured by attention, perceived time, pleasure, and overall satisfaction, during both short and long loading durations. Our findings suggest significant potential for incorporating explanations and humor into VUIs, offering actionable insights for designing effective speech indicators that improve waiting experiences.
