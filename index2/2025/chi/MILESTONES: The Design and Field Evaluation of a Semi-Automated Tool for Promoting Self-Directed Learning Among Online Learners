Self-directed learning of computational skills online poses significant challenges, particularly the lack of effective tools for tracking progress and fostering reflection. To address this, we designed and implemented MILESTONES, a semi-automated self-monitoring tool that tracks online learning sessions and organizes web resources through three visual overviews: Time Pulse, Cue-Connect, and Sor-tify. In a week-long field deployment study (N=17), learners found MILESTONES intuitive and effective, even without prior experience with self-monitoring. The on-demand visual overviews encouraged learners to pause, reflect, and adjust their learning habits to better align with their goals. These overviews further fostered micro-reflections - brief, spontaneous reflections during learning. We also explored the role of a companion journal, which, although used inconsistently, helped learners form and reflect on their goals after learning sessions. Our findings contribute insights for designing learner-centered semi-automatic self-monitoring tools that can cater to diverse learning needs.
