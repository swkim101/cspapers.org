Data-rich documents are ubiquitous in various applications, yet they often rely solely on textual descriptions to convey data insights. Prior research primarily focused on providing visualization-centric augmentation to data-rich documents. However, few have explored using automatically generated word-scale visualizations to enhance the document-centric reading process. As an exploratory step, we propose GistVis, an automatic pipeline that extracts and visualizes data insight from text descriptions. GistVis decomposes the generation process into four modules: Discoverer, Annotator, Extractor, and Visualizer, with the first three modules utilizing the capabilities of large language models and the fourth using visualization design knowledge. Technical evaluation including a comparative study on Discoverer and an ablation study on Annotator reveals decent performance of GistVis. Meanwhile, the user study (N=12) showed that GistVis could generate satisfactory word-scale visualizations, indicating its effectiveness in facilitating users' understanding of data-rich documents (+5.6% accuracy) while significantly reducing their mental demand (p=0.016) and perceived effort (p=0.033).
