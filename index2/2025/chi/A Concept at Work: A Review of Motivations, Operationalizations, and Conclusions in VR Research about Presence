Presence appears an important concept for virtual reality (VR): It is frequently measured with questionnaires, and theory and methods about it have been discussed in numerous works. Yet, it is unclear how to actually work with this concept: Why is presence important to measure, how to choose an appropriate questionnaire, and what to conclude about it based on findings? To answer these questions, we review how the concept is put to work in 288 VR papers from 2023 measuring presence with questionnaires. Our findings include that measuring presence is often motivated by another construct, such as user experience; the reasons for choosing a specific questionnaire are often weak or not reported at all; and high presence values are frequently used simply to validate an interaction technique. We propose recommendations for working with presence and formulate questions to direct future research.
