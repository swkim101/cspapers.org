We introduce Datamancer, a wearable device enabling bimanual gesture interaction across multi-display ubiquitous analytics environments. Datamancer addresses the gap in gesture-based interaction within data visualization settings, where current methods are often constrained by limited interaction spaces or the need for installing bulky tracking setups. Datamancer integrates a finger-mounted pinhole camera and a chest-mounted gesture sensor, allowing seamless selection and manipulation of visualizations on distributed displays. By pointing to a display, users can acquire the display and engage in various interactions, such as panning, zooming
