The rising threat of mobile malware has prompted security vendors to recommend antivirus software for smartphones, yet user misconceptions, regulatory requirements, and improper use undermine its effectiveness. Our mixed-method study, consisting of in-depth interviews with 23 participants and a survey of 250 participants, examines smartphone antivirus software adoption in South Korea, where mandatory installation for banking and other financial apps is common. Many users confuse antivirus software with general security tools and remain unaware of its limited scope. Adoption is significantly influenced by perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy, social norms, and awareness, while concerns about system performance and skepticism about necessity lead to discontinuation or non-use. Mandatory installations for financial apps in South Korea contribute to user misconceptions, negative perceptions, and a false sense of security. These findings highlight the need for targeted user education, clearer communication about mobile-specific threats, and efforts to promote informed and effective engagement with antivirus software.
