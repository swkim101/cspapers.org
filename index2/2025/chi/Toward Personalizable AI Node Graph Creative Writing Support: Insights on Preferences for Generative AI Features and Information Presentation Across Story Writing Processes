As story writing requires diverse resources, a single system combining these resources could improve personalization. We leverage the broad capabilities of generative AI to support both more general story writing needs and an understudied but essential aspect: reflection on the moral (lesson) conveyed. Through a formative study (N=12), a user study (N=14), and external evaluation (N=19), we designed, implemented, then studied a prototype plugin for FigJam supporting visualization of the story structure through customizable node graph editing, LLM audience impersonation (chatbot and non-chatbot interfaces), and image and audio generative AI features. Our findings support writersâ€™ preference for leveraging unique interplays of our breadth of features to satisfy shifting needs across writing processes, from conveying a moral across audience groups to story writing in general. We discuss how our tool design and findings can inform model bias, personalized writing support, and visualization research.
