This paper presents Pointer Assistant, a novel human-AI interaction technique for on-screen tasks. The design features a chatbot displayed as an extra mouse pointer, alongside the user’s, which proactively gives feedback on user actions while directing them to relevant areas on the screen and responding to the user’s direct chat messages. The effectiveness of the design’s key characteristics, pointer form and proactivity, was investigated in a study involving 220 participants in a financial budget planning task. Results demonstrated that the pointer design and interaction reduced task load while improving satisfaction with the experience, and increased the number of budget categories ideated during the task compared to the traditional passive chat log design. Participants viewed Pointer Assistant as a fun, innovative, and helpful visual guide while noting that its assertiveness can be improved. Future developments could offer even further enhancements to the user experience of human-AI collaboration and task outcomes.
