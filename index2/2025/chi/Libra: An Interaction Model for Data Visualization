While existing visualization libraries enable the reuse, extension, and combination of static visualizations, achieving the same for interactions remains nearly impossible. Therefore, we contribute an interaction model and its implementation to achieve this goal. Our model enables the creation of interactions that support direct manipulation, enforce software modularity by clearly separating visualizations from interactions, and ensure compatibility with existing
