Pass-through technologies are promising for mixed reality (MR) systems. Therefore, various MR applications operating in pass-through devices emerged in diverse domains, such as education and healthcare. However, research on the everyday use of pass-through devices remains limited, despite it blending real and virtual environments. This study explores the user experience of pass-through devices in peopleâ€™s daily tasks. We conducted a field study with 16 participants and analyzed data from eight daily tasks. For in-depth analysis, we employed three measures in terms of quantitative, qualitative, and bio-signal. As a result, we found that participants felt differently in terms of immersion, collision anxiety, and workload. Findings suggest that pass-through devices are not yet fully ready for integration into daily life. However, the potential for widespread adoption exists as the technology continues to advance. Finally, we offer guidelines and considerations to improve the usability of pass-through devices for everyday use.
