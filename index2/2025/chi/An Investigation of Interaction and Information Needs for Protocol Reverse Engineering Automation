Protocol reverse engineering (ProtocolREing) consists of taking streams of network data and inferring the communication protocol. ProtocolREing is critical task in malware and system security analysis. Several ProtocolREing automation tools have been developed, however, in practice, they are not used because they offer limited interaction. Instead, reverse engineers (ProtocolREs) perform this task manually or use less complex visualization tools. To give ProtocolREs the power of more complex automation, we must first understand ProtocolREs processes and information and interaction needs to design better interfaces. We interviewed 16 ProtocolREs, presenting a paper prototype ProtocolREing automation interface, and ask them to discuss their approach to ProtocolREing while using the tool and suggest missing information and interactions. We designed our prototype based on existing ProtocolREing tool features and prior reverse engineering research’s usability guidelines. We found ProtocolREs follow a flexible, hypothesis-driven process and identified multiple information and interaction needs when validating the automation’s inferences. We provide suggestions for future interaction design.
