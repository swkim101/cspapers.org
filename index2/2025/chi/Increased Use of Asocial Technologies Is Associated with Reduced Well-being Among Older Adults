In this paper, we introduce the concept of asocial technologies (e.g., online purchases), which digitize activities that traditionally would have been carried out in person (e.g., in-person shopping). We argue that using asocial technologies limits users’ opportunities for face-to-face interactions, which can be particularly detrimental to older adults (65+) who are more prone to social isolation and loneliness. Analyzing longitudinal survey data from the U.S. National Health and Aging Trends Study (N = 1925), we identified the adverse effects of asocial technologies on older adults’ well-being. Using a within-between-level analytical framework, we found that an increased use of asocial technologies in a given year is associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and lower levels of overall health experienced by older adults in the following year. This work highlights the negative consequences of asocial technology use, emphasizing the need for more systematic designs in digital innovations that target seniors.
