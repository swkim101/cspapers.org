This paper investigates multi-selection in XR interfaces based on eye and hand interaction. We propose enabling multi-selection using different variations of techniques that combine gaze with a semi-pinch gesture, allowing users to select multiple objects, while on the way to a full-pinch. While our exploration is based on the semi-pinch mode for activating a quasi-mode, we explore four methods for confirming subselections in multi-selection mode, varying in effort and complexity: dwell-time (SemiDwell), swipe (SemiSwipe), tilt (SemiTilt), and non-dominant hand input (SemiNDH), and compare them to a baseline technique. In the user study, we evaluate their effectiveness in reducing task completion time, errors, and effort. The results indicate the strengths and weaknesses of each technique, with SemiSwipe and SemiDwell as the most preferred methods by participants. We also demonstrate their utility in file managing and RTS gaming application scenarios. This study provides valuable insights to advance 3D input systems in XR.
