Due to the remarkable content generation capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in supporting early-stage conceptual design. However, current interaction paradigms often struggle to effectively facilitate multi-round idea exploration and selection, leading to random outputs, unclear iterations, and cognitive overload. To address these challenges, we propose a human-AI co-ideation framework aimed at tracking the evolution of design ideas. This framework leverages a structured idea representation, an analogy-based reasoning mechanism and interactive visualization techniques. It guides both designers and AI to systematically explore design spaces. We also develop a prototype system, IdeationWeb, which integrates an intuitive, mind map-like visual interface and interactive methods to support co-ideation. Our user study validates the frameworkâ€™s feasibility, demonstrating enhanced collaboration and creativity between humans and AI. Furthermore, we identified collaborative design patterns from user behaviors, providing valuable insights for future human-AI interaction design.
