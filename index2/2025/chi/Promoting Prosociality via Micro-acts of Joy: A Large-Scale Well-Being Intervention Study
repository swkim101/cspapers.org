Prosociality has been well-documented to positively impact mental, social, and physical well-being. However, existing studies of interventions for promoting prosociality have limitations such as small sample sizes or unclear benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted a global-scale well-being intervention deployment study, BIG JOY , with more than 18,000 participants from 172 countries and regions. The week-long BIG JOY intervention consists of seven daily micro-acts (i.e., brief actions that require minimal effort), each adapted from validated positive psychology interventions. The analyses of large-scale intervention data reveal unique insights into the impact of well-being micro-acts across diverse populations, patterns of responses, effectiveness of specific micro-acts and their nuanced impacts across different populations, linkages between improvements in prosociality and in well-being, as well as the potential for machine learning to predict changes in prosociality. This study offers valuable insights into a set of design guidelines for future well-being and prosociality interventions. We envision our work as a stepping stone towards future large-scale prosociality interventions that foster a more unified and compassionate world.
