Creating custom artifacts with computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines typically requires mastery of complex computer-aided design (CAD) software. To eliminate this user barrier, we introduced Draw2Cut, a novel system that allows users to design and fabricate artifacts by sketching directly on physical materials. Draw2Cut employs a custom-drawing language to convert user-drawn lines, symbols, and colors into toolpaths, thereby enabling users to express their creative intent intuitively. The key features include real-time alignment between material and virtual toolpaths, a preview interface for validation, and an open-source platform for customization. Through technical evaluations and user studies, we demonstrate that Draw2Cut lowers the entry barrier for personal fabrication, enabling novices to create customized artifacts with precision and ease. Our findings highlight the potential of the system to enhance creativity, engagement, and accessibility in CNC-based woodworking.
