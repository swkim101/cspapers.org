End-users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) have diverse speech, cognitive, and motor abilities. AAC’s heterogeneous user groups and persistent usability issues create a challenging and rich design space. Our work takes a value-sensitive design (VSD) approach to develop a stakeholder value framework that describes stakeholders’ multi-dimensional roles and values. Our framework is based on (1) an empirical investigation—a survey and interviews—of AAC users and AAC conversation partners and (2) a conceptual investigation—a systematic literature review—of AAC HCI research. Emergent value themes were ease, fulfillment, acceptance, adaptation, safety, performance, autonomy, justice, de-sign fulfillment, and business fulfillment. These themes inform how AAC end-users engage with AAC and how indirect stakeholders, such as AAC technologists, make choices that ultimately impact AAC users. Our stakeholder value framework and rich descriptions of AAC socio-technical barriers can inform AAC designers in making ethically sound decisions that support, not hinder, stakeholder values.
