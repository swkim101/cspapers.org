Adaptive sports are crucial for the psychological well-being of individuals with tetraplegia—limited motor function in both arms and legs. TetraSki provides these individuals access to extreme adaptive sports through a power-assisted ski instrument, which an athlete can control independently. While athletes in other sporting contexts commonly use technology to improve their performance, no studies have explored how technology might benefit athletes with tetraplegia when training for adaptive competitive sports like TetraSki. We conducted semi-structured interviews with six TetraSki athletes and four tethers who participated in TetraSki Express 2022, the world’s first and only adaptive alpine ski competition for athletes with tetraplegia. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of athletes’ and tethers’ current practices and challenges while working to improve their performance in this competitive environment, and points to opportunities for self-tracking technologies to support their athletic endeavors better.
