With the transition to fully autonomous vehicles, non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) become increasingly important, allowing passengers to use their driving time more efficiently. In-car Augmented Reality (AR) gives the possibility to engage in NDRTs while also allowing passengers to engage with their surroundings, for example, by displaying world-fixed points of interest (POIs). This can lead to new discoveries, provide information about the environment, and improve locational awareness. To explore the optimal visualization of POIs using in-car AR, we conducted a field study (N = 38) examining six parameters: positioning, scaling, rotation, render distance, information density, and appearance. We also asked for intention of use, preferred seat positions and preferred automation level for the AR function in a post-study questionnaire. Our findings reveal user preferences and general acceptance of the AR functionality. Based on these results, we derived UX-guidelines for the visual appearance and behavior of location-based POIs in in-car AR.
