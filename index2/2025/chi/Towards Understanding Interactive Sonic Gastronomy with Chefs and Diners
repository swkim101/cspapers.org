With advancements in interactive technologies, research in human-food interaction (HFI) has begun to employ interactive sound to enrich the dining experience. However, chefs’ creative use of this sonic interactivity as a new “ingredient” in their culinary practices remains underexplored. In response, we conducted an empirical study with six pairs of chefs and diners utilizing SoniCream, an ice cream cone that plays digital sounds while consuming. Through exploration, creation, collaboration, and reflection, we identified four themes concerning culinary creativity, dining experience, interactive sonic gastronomy deployment, and chef-diner interplay. Building on the discussions at the intersection of these themes, we derived four design implications for creating interactive systems that could support chefs’ culinary creativity, thereby enriching dining experiences. Ultimately, our work aims to help interaction designers fully incorporate chefs’ perspectives into HFI research.
