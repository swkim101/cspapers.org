We present Persona-L, a novel approach for creating personas using Large Language Models (LLMs) and an ability-based framework, specifically designed to improve the representation of users with complex needs. Traditional methods of persona creation often fall short of accurately depicting the dynamic and diverse nature of complex needs, resulting in oversimplified or stereotypical profiles. Persona-L enables users to create and interact with personas through a chat interface. Persona-L was evaluated through interviews with UX designers (N=6), where we examined its effectiveness in reflecting the complexities of lived experiences of people with complex needs. We report our findings that indicate the potential of Persona-L to increase empathy and understanding of complex needs while also revealing the need for transparency of data used in persona creation, the role of the language and tone, and the need to provide a more balanced presentation of abilities with constraints.
