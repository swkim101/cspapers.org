Leveraging the integration of visual and proprioceptive cues, research has uncovered various perception thresholds in VR that can be exploited to support haptic feedback for grasping. While previous studies have explored individual dimensions, such as size, the combined effect of multiple geometric properties on perceptual illusions remains poorly understood. We present a two-alternative forced choice study investigating the perceptual interplay between object size and taper angle. We introduce an illusion space model, providing detailed insights into how physical and virtual object configurations affect human perception. Our insights reveal how, for example, as virtual sizes increase, users perceive that taper angles increase, and as virtual angles decrease, users overestimate sizes. We provide a mathematical model of the illusion space, and an associated tool, which can be used as a guide for the design of future VR haptic devices and for proxy object selections.
