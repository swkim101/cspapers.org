Professional caregivers want to provide feelings of security and comfort to people with dementia in advanced care, but limited resources frequently restrict professional caregivers from doing so. One potential solution to make social, non-verbal connections with people in advanced dementia care is the use of artifacts that offer comfort and stimulating tactile experiences. In this study, we explored the role of two design artifacts, the Mano Quilt, a weighted blanket, and the Mano Fold, a foldable pillow, in supporting caregivers to increase feelings of comfort and security in people with advanced dementia through warmth. In a field study, we collected data through observations of 26 residents with dementia who interacted with the two artifacts and 17 interviews with their formal caregivers in three care organizations. We reveal which aesthetic and material qualities evoke haptic and bodily experiences such as presence, comfort, and activity and how the artifacts support existing caregiving practices. We encourage future researchers to design to enrich the senses as an aesthetic experience and provide emotional support and companionship to increase well-being for people with advanced dementia.
