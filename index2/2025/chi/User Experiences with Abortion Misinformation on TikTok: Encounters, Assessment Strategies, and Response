Studying health-related misinformation, so far, has mostly focused on general “fearmongering” content spread on social media. The Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade highlighted the need to study abortion misinformation as health-related content that could have criminal implications for users. In response to this need, we conducted a study with 60 TikTok users about the way they conceptualize, assess, and respond to misleading abortion videos. Half of our participants saw political intent behind the spread of health-related misinformation driven towards a “fear of criminalization.” Prior to Roe v. Wade, our participants encountered videos discussing the legal ramifications of abortion, but post-Roe v. Wade, they saw videos suggesting herbal alternative treatments for pregnancy termination. Roughly 30% of our participants believed in the safety and efficacy of these otherwise scientifically debunked “alternative abortion treatments,” even in the presence of a debunking label attached to a self-administering abortion video.
