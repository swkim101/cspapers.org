Dyslexia is a common neurobiological learning disorder significantly impacting reading, writing, and spelling worldwide. Early identification and intervention are essential, but most pre-screening tools focus on Latin languages, leaving Chinese-speaking students underserved. To address this gap, we conduct semi-structured interviews with special education (special-ed) teachers to gather their needs for dyslexia pre-screening tailored to Chinese contexts. Using their insights, we have developed DysVis, a user-centered data visualization system that combines handwriting analysis, body movement keypoint conversion, and a comprehensive visualization interface. DysVis provides teachers with multi-level visualizations, such as performance overviews, task analyses, handwriting observations, and behavioural insights, enabling them to identify the root causes of learning difficulties. Our evaluations, including case studies, a user study, and expert interviews, demonstrate that DysVis is user-friendly and effective in quickly identifying at-risk students, ultimately enhancing learning outcomes for Chinese-speaking students with dyslexia.
