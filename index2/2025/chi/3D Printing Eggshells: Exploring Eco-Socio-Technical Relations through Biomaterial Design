In response to ongoing environmental crises, the digital fabrication community within HCI has recently begun to design with biomaterials. Biomaterials and their corresponding practices carry eco-socio-technical relations that shape the creation of more sustainable futures. From this perspective, we present three entangled contributions: (1) a new, easy-to-make, 3D printable eggshell biomaterial, (2) a circular, material-centered practice for designing with the eggshell biomaterial, and (3) a reflection on the eco-socio-technical relations that the eggshell biomaterial and corresponding biomaterial practice reveal. We outline our design process for sourcing ingredients, developing a recipe, 3D printing artifacts, characterizing properties, and testing disposal methods. Through five provocative applications, we critically reflect on how our eggshell biomaterial practice surfaces unique eco-socio-technical relations. We envision this eggshell biomaterial extending the current material library for 3D printing and promoting circular digital fabrication practices, while also highlighting the importance of ecological awareness and community engagement in designing for sustainability.
