We explore the feasibility of active user-applied locomotion in virtual reality (VR) within in-car environments, diverging from previous in-car VR research that synchronized virtual motion with the car’s movement. Through a two-step study, we examined the effects of locomotion methods on user experience in dynamic vehicle environments and evaluated contextual cues designed to mitigate sensory mismatch caused by vehicle motion. The first study evaluated five locomotion methods, identifying joystick-based navigation as the most suitable for in-car use due to its low physical demand and stability. The second study focused on designing and testing contextual cues that translate physical sensations of vehicle motion into virtual effects without limiting the user’s freedom of movement, with results demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing motion sickness and enhancing presence. We conclude with initial insights and design considerations for expanding upon our findings in regards to enabling active locomotion in in-car VR.
