Many narratives around AI systems promise a utopian vision of empowerment, inclusivity, and democratization, yet there remains a gap in how to concretely pursue such a promise. In this paper, we review and analyze a curated set of AI-driven healthcare products, leveraging sociologist Ruth Levitas’ three distinct but interrelated forms of utopian thinking—archaeology, ontology, and architecture. We contribute to HCI’s Human-AI Interaction agenda by applying this theory to critically examine how AI technologies embed societal ideals, shape user identities, and project alternative futures. This allows us to consider the values and users these systems illustrate as images of the “good society.” In doing so, we also make visible the normativity and repetitive nature of technology hype cycles and raise important questions about the future these technologies are shaping.
