Previous research on interactive technology design has often focused on individual aspects of marginalized identities and their impact on technology use. However, there is a growing need to adopt a more holistic approach that considers how multiple, intersecting aspects of marginalized identities shape technology engagement across various contexts. In this qualitative case study, we investigate the communication experiences of LGBTQIA+ individuals with disabilities within romantic relationships, focusing on the role of technology in facilitating connection, intimacy, and joy. Our findings emphasize the dynamic experiences of early disability disclosure, the transformation of vulnerability into opportunities for authentic connection, and the co-creation of communication practices tailored to the relationshipâ€™s needs. We advocate for inclusive technologies that adapt to evolving intersectional experiences, advocating for assistive technology (AT) that supports communication while nurturing emotional and relational well-being. Moreover, drawing on the concept of interdependence, we show how access is co-created in LGBTQIA+ romantic relationships, challenging the traditional views of AT as specialized tools.
