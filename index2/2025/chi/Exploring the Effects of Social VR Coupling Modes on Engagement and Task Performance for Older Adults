Social Virtual Reality (VR) presents a promising avenue for older adults to connect with others and engage in collaborative activities remotely. However, many social VR experiences focus on individual tasks, reducing opportunities for meaningful social interaction. To investigate the potential of VR to enhance engagement with other participants, this paper explores two modes of coupling: (i) loosely coupled, where participants focus on their individual tasks within a collaborative setting, and (ii) tightly coupled, where participants need to rely on each otherâ€™s assistance to complete their tasks. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults to evaluate how these modes affect task performance and engagement. Results show that the tightly coupled mode, focused on collaboration, increases engagement, while the loosely coupled mode, centers on individual tasks, improves performance in time and attempts. We provide guidelines for collaborative VR applications to enhance social engagement and interaction among older adults.
