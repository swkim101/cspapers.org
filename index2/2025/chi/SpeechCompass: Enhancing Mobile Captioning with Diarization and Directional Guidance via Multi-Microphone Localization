Speech-to-text capabilities on mobile devices have proven helpful for hearing and speech accessibility, language translation, note-taking, and meeting transcripts. However, our foundational large-scale survey (n=263) shows that the inability to distinguish and indicate speaker direction makes them challenging in group conversations. SpeechCompass addresses this limitation through real-time, multi-microphone speech localization, where the direction of speech allows visual separation and guidance (e.g., arrows) in the user interface. We introduce efficient real-time audio localization algorithms and custom sound perception hardware running on a low-power microcontroller and four integrated microphones, which we characterize in technical evaluations. Informed by a large-scale survey (n=494), we conducted an in-person study of group conversations with eight frequent users of mobile speech-to-text, who provided feedback on five visualization styles. The value of diarization and visualizing localization was consistent across participants, with everyone agreeing on the value and potential of directional guidance for group conversations.
