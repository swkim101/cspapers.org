Violence is a significant public health issue. Interventions to reduce violence rely on data about where incidents occur. Cities have historically used incomplete law enforcement crime data, but many are shifting toward data collected from hospital patients via the Cardiff Model to form a more complete understanding of violence. Still, location data is wrought with issues related to completeness, quality, and privacy. For example, if a patient feels that sharing a detailed location may present them with additional risks, such as undesired police involvement or retaliatory violence, they may be unwilling or unable to share. Consequently, survivors of violence who are the most vulnerable may remain the most at risk. We have designed a user interface and mapping algorithm to confront these challenges and conducted an experiment with emergency department patients. The results indicate a significant improvement in location data obtained using the interface compared to the existing screening interview.
