While AI's potential in education and professional sports is widely recognized, its application in K-12 physical education (PE) remains underexplored with significant opportunities for innovation. This study aims to address this gap by engaging 17 in-service secondary school PE teachers in group ideation workshops to explore potential AI applications and challenges in PE classes. Participants envisioned AI playing multidimensional roles, such as an operational assistant, personal trainer, group coach, and evaluator, as solutions to address unique instructional and operational challenges in K-12 PE classes. These roles reflected participants' perspectives on how AI could enhance class management, deliver personalized feedback, promote balanced team activities, and streamline performance assessments. Participants also highlighted critical considerations for AI integration, including the need to ensure robust student data security and privacy measures, minimize the risk of over-reliance on AI for instructional decisions, and accommodate the varying levels of technological proficiency among PE teachers. Our findings provide valuable insights and practical guidance for AI developers, educators, and policymakers, offering a foundation for the effective integration of AI into K-12 PE curricula to enhance teaching practices and student outcomes.
