The integration of emotion-aware systems in vehicles is accelerated by new technologies, including advancements in AI and ubiquitous sensing technologies. As the automotive industry shifts from technology-centred, feature-driven approaches to human-centred design, this research focuses on how to effectively incorporate emotion features into user-centred design to enhance effective human-vehicle interaction in practices. By conducting an interview study with 31 industrial design practitioners, supplemented by insights from engineers and AI experts involved in the early-stage design and development of novel in-vehicle user interfaces and systems, we examined current practices, and sampled their challenges, attitudes and expectations related to emotion-aware systems. Our findings provide critical insights to the design space of emotion-aware systems from both user and AI perspectives, inform efforts to support design practices in this evolving area, and identify opportunities for future innovation in emotion-aware in-vehicle design. Based on our findings, we propose adaptations to design practices and recommendations for further research.
