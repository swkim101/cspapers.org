As computer-mediated communication tools have evolved from beepers to 2G cell phones, and now to today’s smartphones, people have consistently embraced these technologies to maintain relationships and enhance the convenience of their daily lives. While contemporary communication technologies have transformed communication practices, their impact on communication quality and relationships remains underexamined. To explore what may have been lost in this transformation, our study revisits retro communication technologies—specifically, the beeper. Using BeeperRedux, a mobile application designed to replicate the beeper experience, we conducted a two-week deployment study with ten groups. Our findings highlight three valuable aspects of retro communication technologies: fostering sincerity, restoring recipients’ autonomy over their communication, and prioritizing offline engagement. In the discussion, we present design guidelines for improving technology-mediated communication and offer methodological reflections on recreating obsolete technology to empirically explore past experiences.
