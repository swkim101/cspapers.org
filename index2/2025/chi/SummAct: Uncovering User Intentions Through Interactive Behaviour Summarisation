Recent work has highlighted the potential of modelling interactive behaviour analogously to natural language. We propose interactive behaviour summarisation as a novel computational task and demonstrate its usefulness for automatically uncovering latent user intentions while interacting with graphical user interfaces. To tackle this task, we introduce SummAct, a novel hierarchical method to summarise low-level input actions into high-level intentions. SummAct first identifies sub-goals from user actions using a large language model and in-context learning. High-level intentions are then obtained by fine-tuning the model using a novel UI element attention to preserve detailed context information embedded within UI elements during summarisation. Through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate that SummAct significantly outperforms baselines across desktop and mobile interfaces as well as interactive tasks by up to 21.9%. We further show three exciting interactive applications benefited from SummAct: interactive behaviour forecasting, automatic behaviour synonym identification, and language-based behaviour retrieval.
