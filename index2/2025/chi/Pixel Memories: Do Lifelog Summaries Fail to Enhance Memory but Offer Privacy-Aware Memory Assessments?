We explore the metaphorical "daily memory pill" concept – a brief pictorial lifelog recap aimed at reviving and preserving memories. Leveraging psychological strategies, we explore the potential of such summaries to boost autobiographical memory. We developed an automated lifelogging memory prosthesis and a research protocol (Automated Memory Validation “AMV”) for conducting privacy-aware, in-situ evaluations. We conducted a real-world lifelogging experiment for a month (n=11). We also designed a browser “Pixel Memories’’ for browsing one-week worth of lifelogs. The results suggest that daily timelapse summaries, while not yielding significant memory augmentation effects, also do not lead to memory degradation. Participants’ confidence in recalled content remains unaltered, but the study highlights the challenge of users’ overestimation of memory accuracy. Our core contributions, the AMV protocol and "Pixel Memories" browser, advance our understanding of memory augmentations and offer a privacy-preserving method for evaluating future ubicomp systems.
