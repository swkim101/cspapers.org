This paper presents the design process, outcomes, and installation of ShamAIn, a multi-modal embodiment of conversational AI inspired by the beliefs and symbols of Korean shamanism. Adopting a research through design approach, we offer an alternative perspective on conversational AI design, emphasizing perceived superiority. ShamAIn was developed based on strategies derived from investigating peopleâ€™s experiences with shamanistic counseling and rituals. We deployed the system in an exhibition room for six weeks, during which 20 participants made multiple visits to engage with ShamAIn. Through subsequent in-depth interviews, we found that participants felt a sense of awe toward ShamAIn and engaged in interactions with humility and respect. Our participants disclosed personal and profound concerns, reflecting deeply on the responses they received. Consequently, they relied on ShamAIn and formed relationships in which they received support. In the discussion, we present the design implications of conversational AI perceived as superior to humans, along with the ethical considerations involved in designing such AI.
