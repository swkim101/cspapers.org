With the growing integration of AI into daily life, various technologies have been developed to teach children about AI. However, differences in their designs highlight the need for a thorough understanding of these tools to make the most of current technological resources and guide the effective development of future learning tools. Through a systematic search, we identified 64 different AI learning tools for children and analyzed their design features, including both static design features (i.e., presentation formats and learning content) and interactive design features (i.e., learning activity types and design features that potentially enhance the effectiveness of the activities). Our findings reveal the current trends and gaps in the design of childrenâ€™s AI learning technologies. Based on these insights, we reflect on future design opportunities and provide recommendations for creating new, effective learning technologies to advance AI education for the next generations.
