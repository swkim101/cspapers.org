The recent surge in artificial intelligence, particularly in multimodal processing technology, has advanced human-computer interaction, by altering how intelligent systems perceive, understand, and respond to contextual information (i.e., context awareness). Despite such advancements, there is a significant gap in comprehensive reviews examining these advances, especially from a multimodal data perspective, which is crucial for refining system design. This paper addresses a key aspect of this gap by conducting a systematic survey of data modality-driven Vision-based Multimodal Interfaces (VMIs). VMIs are essential for integrating multimodal data, enabling more precise interpretation of user intentions and complex interactions across physical and digital environments. Unlike previous task- or scenario-driven surveys, this study highlights the critical role of the visual modality in processing contextual information and facilitating multimodal interaction. Adopting a design framework moving from the whole to the details and back, it classifies VMIs across dimensions, providing insights for developing effective, context-aware systems.
