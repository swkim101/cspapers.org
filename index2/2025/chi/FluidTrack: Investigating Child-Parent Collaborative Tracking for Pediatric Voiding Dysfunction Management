Daytime urinary frequency syndrome (DUFS) is a prevalent pediatric voiding dysfunction. Managing DUFS involves sufficient water intake and monitoring voiding and defecation behaviors, which can be challenging for preschool-aged patients to perform throughout the day for prolonged periods. To address this problem, we created FluidTrack, a semi-automated tracking system enabling child and parents to collaboratively track child’s fluid intake, voiding, and defecation, while encouraging adequate water consumption. To examine preschoolers’ engagement in behavior tracking with their parents, we conducted a 4-week deployment study with 14 DUFS patients (4–6 years) and their parents as part of DUFS management. The majority of patient participants enthusiastically engaged in semi-automated data capture, driven by their initial interest in FluidTrack. Sustaining the children’s enthusiasm and behind-the-scenes parental assistance were critical for continuing semi-automated tracking. Our findings demonstrated the feasibility of children’s semi-automated self-tracking in collaboration with their parents, and identified design suggestions for future work.
