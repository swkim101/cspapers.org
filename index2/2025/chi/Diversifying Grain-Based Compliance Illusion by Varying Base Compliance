Grain-based compliance illusion mimics the mechanical vibrations that occur when a compliant object deforms with grain-like, short (∼ 15 ms) impulse-response vibrations. Previous work has demonstrated its robust effect on various types of devices. However, the impact of the device’s inherent compliance (i.e., base compliance) on perceived compliance remains unclear. This paper investigates the influence of base compliance on the perception of illusory compliance through three psychophysical experiments. The results show that (1) the compliance illusion remained effective with base compliance, (2) the description of compliance was affected by both illusory and base compliance, and (3) it is possible to render the compliance with the same magnitude but multiple different feelings.
