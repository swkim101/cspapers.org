Tendon vibration can create movement illusions: vibrating the biceps tendon induces an illusion of extending the arm, while vibrating the triceps tendon induces an illusion of flexing the arm. However, it is unclear how to create and integrate such illusions shown in neuroscience to interaction techniques in virtual reality (VR). We first design a motor setup for tendon vibration. Study 1 validates that the setup induces movement illusions which on average create a 5.26 cm offset in active arm movements. Study 2 shows that tendon vibration improves the detection thresholds of visual motion gains often used in VR interaction techniques by 0.22. A model we developed in Study 2 predicts the effects of tendon vibration and is used in a biomechanical simulation to demonstrate the detection thresholds across typical reaching tasks in VR.
