Navigation is a crucial part of the VR game experience. However, discrete and continuous optic flow from locomotion techniques (DL and CL) and wayfinding assistance in VR games may impact players’ navigation differently. Limited research has explored how DL and CL’s influence on navigation changes across different wayfinding assistance conditions. This study employed a 2×3 factorial between-subjects experiment with 78 participants to investigate their joint effects. The study explores explanations for observed differences among conditions from the mixed-method analysis of quantitative data (game performance, spatial learning performance, pressure level, usability, and sickness) and thematic analysis of post-hoc interviews. Therefore, the study identifies three key factors—exploration strategy, attention, and spatial knowledge as explanations. Designers can leverage these insights to improve navigation support in VR games, with broader potential applications in fields such as healthcare and training.
