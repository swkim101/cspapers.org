Recent research within the HCI community has illuminated the challenges faced by marginalized groups on algorithm-driven livestreaming platforms. However, there is a notable gap in understanding how elderly livestreamers interact with the platform content moderation and algorithmic (in)visibility. This study investigates the perceptions of the algorithm-moderated (in)visibility and the coping strategies of 16 elderly streamers on Douyin. We find that, contrary to stereotypes of elderly users as digitally uninformed, these streamers actively engage with the platform to facilitate their understanding about platform algorithm. This engagement involves official guidance, peer learning, and personal experimentation. The streamers adopt various strategies to align with the perceived algorithmic preferences. Despite their rich knowledge about the platformâ€™s visibility moderation, many elderly streamers face significant challenges, such as physical and psychological strain and low viewer traffic. We conclude with design implications for livestreaming platforms to foster fairness and promote engagement among elderly streamers.
