Social isolation is a common experience for LGBT+ older adults (OAs) that is often compounded by prejudices of age, sexuality, or gender identity. Little research has explored the specific social needs and barriers that LGBT+ OAs face, particularly in online spaces. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with 10 LGBT+ OAs and an inclusive housing service provider. Our research highlights the importance of LGBT+ community engagement and digitally-supported social networksâ€™ role for LGBT+ OAs. We identify challenges such as managing online identity, navigating LGBT+ social media apps and websites, as well as digital disconnectedness challenges among those with lower digital literacy. Recommendations include improving social platforms allowing LGBT+ OAs to manage selective identity characteristics, promoting genuineness and trust in LGBT+ platforms by employing tiered blocking and interest-driven connections, and non-digital outreach strategies for collaborations between LGBT+ organizations and senior centers to engage hidden and isolated LGBT+ OAs.
