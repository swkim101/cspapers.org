Social care systems are increasingly adopting personalisation schemes that empower individuals with disabilities and their families to directly purchase services,from assistive technologies to daily living support. Central to this shift are institutions like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, where annual negotiations shape care delivery and social benefits. Drawing on interviews with parents of children with intellectual disabilities, individuals with intellectual disabilities, service managers – alongside the use of a technology probe – this paper examines the communication dynamics within these planning processes, identifying critical design opportunities. We explore the issues of communication control, obscured agency, and tokenistic engagement that arise in bureaucratic support planning. As a contribution, we highlight the barriers and facilitators reshaping these interactions, offering key implications for future design interventions.
