Suicide is a complex phenomenon wherein, in addition to the individual impacted, its effects seep into many lives including those of their caregivers. Caregivers seek help everywhere but face unique challenges including limited access to timely resources and personal mental health struggles. Mobile health apps offer a promising solution, but addressing caregiversâ€™ specific needs remains a concern. We present LifeLink, a persuasive mobile app to support caregivers of individuals experiencing suicidal thoughts. The app was developed in three stages. First, we reviewed 80 existing suicide prevention apps. Second, we designed a low-fidelity prototype of LifeLink using the Persuasive System Design model and refined it through a study conducted with 45 caregivers. Finally, incorporating evidence-based strategies and caregiver feedback, we developed and evaluated LifeLink in another study with 50 caregivers. Results show that LifeLink is user-friendly, engaging, elicits positive user experience and effectively empowers caregivers. LifeLink usage was associated with improved mental wellbeing, increased mental health literacy, and a more supportive environment. Our findings highlight the importance of involving caregivers in the design process. We offer recommendations for designers and researchers developing impactful persuasive technology for suicide prevention and for those working in related areas.
