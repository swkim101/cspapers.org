The proliferation of"Internet of Things (IoT)"provides older adults with critical support for"health monitoring"and independent living, yet significant concerns about security and privacy persist. In this paper, we report on these issues through a two-phase user study, including a survey (N = 22) and semi-structured interviews (n = 9) with adults aged 65+. We found that while 81.82% of our participants are aware of security features like"two-factor authentication (2FA)"and encryption, 63.64% express serious concerns about unauthorized access to sensitive health data. Only 13.64% feel confident in existing protections, citing confusion over"data sharing policies"and frustration with"complex security settings"which lead to distrust and anxiety. To cope, our participants adopt various strategies, such as relying on family or professional support and limiting feature usage leading to disengagement. Thus, we recommend"adaptive security mechanisms,"simplified interfaces, and real-time transparency notifications to foster trust and ensure"privacy and security by design"in IoT health systems for older adults.
