Phishing attacks become increasingly sophisticated in targeting humans and exploiting cognitive biases, e.g., through inducing authority or urgency. Previous approaches to user training focused on URL warnings, textual, or click-based training, yielding mixed results. For more interactive training, uncoupled from usersâ€™ screens, we explore the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to enhance phishing detection. Through visual representations of biases that attackers typically exploit and gesture-based interactions with them, the training aims to enable users to counteract cognitive biases by increasing awareness and suspicion. In a laboratory study with N = 117 users, we evaluated phishing detection rates, user interaction with, and feedback on the AR-based training in comparison with a click-based variant and a control condition. Our results show that interactive phishing training addressing cognitive biases increased detection rates by 33% and that interactive elements were well perceived. AR technologies further enhance the training.
