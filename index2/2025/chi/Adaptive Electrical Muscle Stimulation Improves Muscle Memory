Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) has been leveraged to assist in learning motor skills by actuating the user's muscles. However, existing systems provide static demonstrationâ€”actuating the correct movements, regardless of the user's learning progress. Instead, we contrast two versions of a piano-tutoring system: a conventional EMS setup that moves the participant's fingers to play the sequence of movements correctly, and a novel adaptive-EMS system that changes its guidance strategy based on the participant's performance. The adaptive-EMS dynamically adjusts its guidance: (1) demonstrate by playing the entire sequence when errors are frequent; (2) correct by lifting incorrect fingers and actuating the correct one when errors are moderate; and (3) warn by lifting incorrect fingers when errors are low. We found that adaptive-EMS improved learning outcomes (recall) and was preferred by participants. We believe this approach could inspire new types of physical tutoring systems that promote adaptive over static guidance.
