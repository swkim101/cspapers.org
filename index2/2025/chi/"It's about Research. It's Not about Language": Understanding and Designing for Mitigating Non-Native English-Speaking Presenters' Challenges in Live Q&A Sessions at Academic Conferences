Live Q&A sessions at English-based, international academic conferences usually pose significant challenges for non-native English-speaking presenters, as they demand real-time comprehension and response in oneâ€™s non-native language under stress. While language-supportive tools (e.g., real-time translation, transcription) can help alleviate such challenges, their adoption remains limited, even at HCI academic conferences that focus on how technology can better serve human needs. Through in-depth interviews with 15 non-native English-speaking academics, we identify their concerns and expectations regarding technological language support for HCI live Q&As. Our research provides critical design implications for future language support tools by highlighting the importance of culturally-aware solutions that offer accurate and seamless language experiences while fostering personal growth and building confidence. We also call for community-wide efforts in HCI to embrace more inclusive practices that actively support non-native English speakers, which can empower all scholars to equally engage in the HCI academic discourse regardless of their native languages.
