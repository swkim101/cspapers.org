North Korean defectors (NKDs) face significant challenges when transitioning to South Korean society. Leaving their homes permanently and adapting to a new, digitally connected environment for the first time presents difficulties, compounded by the pervasive stigma associated with their identities. Although technology alone cannot solve these issues, it can play a role in easing their transition. In this study, we conducted eight speculative co-creation sessions with 22 NKDs to identify their main challenges and envision potential technological interventions. We propose conceptualization of thirteen technologies aimed at addressing key issues NKDs face related to identity stigma, disconnection from their past, and challenges of adapting to a highly digital society. Through this empirical research on underrepresented populations undergoing significant life transitions, we provide insights into how future technologies can support other marginalized individuals as they navigate pervasive stigma and establish new lives in a digital society.
