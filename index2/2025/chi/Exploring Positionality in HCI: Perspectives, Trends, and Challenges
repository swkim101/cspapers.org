Positionality acknowledges that researchersâ€™ subjectivities, values and experiences influence approaches to and outcomes of research. It underlines and promotes self-awareness and explicit demonstration of reflexivity. To understand how positionality is conceptualised and used in HCI, we conducted two studies: (i) a scoping review of positionality and reflexivity statements in CHI papers from the last 11 years and (ii) a survey of HCI researchers (n=75). Our findings show that positionality statements are often viewed as a box-ticking exercise and their influence on the research is seldom discussed. They are also often restricted to more sensitive areas of research and may impact marginalised identities. We argue that positionality statements may be valuable but not as markers of methodological rigour; their content should be at the discretion of authors and methodologically consistent. Our contributions include a current snapshot of positionality in HCI and reflections on its current role and future directions in HCI.
