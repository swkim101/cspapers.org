Encounters with virtual agents currently lack the haptic viscerality of human contact. While digital biosignal communication can mediate such virtual social interactions, how artificial haptic biosignals influence users’ personal space during Virtual Reality (VR) experiences is unknown. Designing vibrotactile heartbeats and thermally-actuated body temperature, we ran a within-subjects study (N=31) to investigate feedback (Thermal, Vibration, Thermal+Vibration, None) and agent stories (Negative, Neutral, Positive) on objective and subjective interpersonal distance (IPD), perceived arousal and comfort, presence, and post-experience responses. Findings showed that thermal feedback decreased objective but not subjective IPD, whereas vibrotactile heartbeats (signaling agent’s closeness) increased both while heightening arousal and discomfort. Agents’ stories did not affect IPD, arousal, or comfort. Our qualitative findings shed light on signal ambiguity and presence constructs within VR-based haptic stimulation. We contribute insights into artificial biosignals and their influence on VR proxemics, with cautionary considerations should the boundaries blur between physical and virtual touch.
