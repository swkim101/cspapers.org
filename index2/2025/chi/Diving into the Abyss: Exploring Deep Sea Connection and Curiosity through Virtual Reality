This paper presents an investigation of the potential of virtual reality (VR) to bridge the gap between humans and the largely unexplored deep sea, using the immersive, playful experience of "Echo of the Abyss" (EotA). Built around the structure of a deep-sea dive experience, EotA aims to enhance users' sense of interconnectedness with underwater environments and stimulate curiosity about marine life. The qualitative analysis reveals a heightened empathy, respect for aquatic life, and a newfound interest in real-world diving experiences. Quantitative results indicate a marginal increase in positive perceptions towards the sea. From these findings, we discuss VR as an effective transformational tool to foster a deeper ecological consciousness. Our contributions can benefit HCI researchers and game designers interested in designing ocean sustainability-driven experiences and games.
