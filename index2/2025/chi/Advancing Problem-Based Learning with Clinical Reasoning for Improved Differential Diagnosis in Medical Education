Medical education increasingly emphasizes students' ability to apply knowledge in real-world clinical settings, focusing on evidence-based clinical reasoning and differential diagnoses. Problem-based learning (PBL) addresses traditional teaching limitations by embedding learning into meaningful contexts and promoting active participation. However, current PBL practices are often confined to medical instructional settings, limiting students' ability to self-direct and refine their approaches based on targeted improvements. Additionally, the unstructured nature of information organization during analysis poses challenges for record-keeping and subsequent review. Existing research enhances PBL realism and immersion but overlooks the construction of logic chains and evidence-based reasoning. To address these gaps, we designed e-MedLearn, a learner-centered PBL system that supports more efficient application and practice of evidence-based clinical reasoning. Through controlled study (N=19) and testing interviews (N=13), we gathered data to assess the system's impact. The findings demonstrate that e-MedLearn improves PBL experiences and provides valuable insights for advancing clinical reasoning-based learning.
