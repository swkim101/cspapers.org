Auditory sense is the primary channel for people with blind and low vision (BLV) to access information. This paper aims to understand the productization of individual voices of BLV voice actors in the audiobook industry. We conducted online semi-interviews with the BLV voice actors in China (N = 13) and gained insights into the workflow through offline observations. Interviews indicate that the ability to match job requirements, social benefits, and accessible support are key factors that draw BLV people into this field. They acquire vocal techniques, actively showcase their voices, and adapt their career paths as needed. Social support is crucial for their continued employment, as well as disclosing their BLV identities as appropriate. Observations reveal that BLV people utilize text processing tools, Screen Reader(SR) speed control, and keyboard shortcuts to transform an invisible script into a coherent and emotionally nuanced voice recording. We investigate how BLV people harness their potential through intensive voice acting while listening to SR, and proficient keyboard skills for software access.
