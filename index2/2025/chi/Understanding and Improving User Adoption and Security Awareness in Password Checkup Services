Password checkup services (PCS) identify compromised, reused, or weak passwords, helping users secure at-risk accounts. However, adoption rates are low. We investigated factors influencing PCS use and password change challenges via an online survey (n=238). Key adoption factors were “perceived usefulness,” “ease of use,” and “self efficacy.” We also identified barriers to changing compromised passwords, including alert fatigue, low perceived urgency, and reliance on other security measures. We then designed interfaces mitigating these issues through clearer messaging and automation (e.g., simultaneous password changes and direct links to change pages). A user study (N=50) showed our designs significantly improved password change success rates, reaching 40% and 74% in runtime alert and PCS checkup reporting scenarios, respectively (compared to 16% and 60% with a baseline).
