Developing and simulating 3D prototypes is crucial in product conceptual design for ideation and presentation. Traditional methods often keep physical and virtual prototypes separate, leading to a disjointed prototype workflow. In addition, acquiring high-fidelity prototypes is time-consuming and resource-intensive, distracting designers from creative exploration. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and extended reality (XR) provided new solutions for rapid prototype transition and mixed simulation. We conducted a formative study to understand current challenges in the traditional prototype process and explore how to effectively utilize GAI and XR ability in prototype. Then we introduced FusionProtor, a mixed-prototype tool for component-level 3D prototype transition and simulation. We proposed a step-by-step generation pipeline in FusionProtor, effectively transiting 3D prototypes from physical to virtual and low- to high-fidelity for rapid ideation and iteration. We also innovated a component-level 3D creation method and applied it in XR environment for the mixed-prototype presentation and interaction. We conducted technical and user experiments to verify FusionProtorâ€™s usability in supporting diverse designs. Our results verified that it achieved a seamless workflow between physical and virtual domains, enhancing efficiency and promoting ideation. We also explored the effect of mixed interaction on design and critically discussed its best practices for HCI community.
