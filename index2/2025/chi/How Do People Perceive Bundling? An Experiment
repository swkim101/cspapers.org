We present an exploratory study on how people perceive visualizations of spatial social networks generated by edge bundling algorithms. Although these algorithms successfully minimize clutter in node-link diagrams, they do so through various methods that can sometimes create false connections between nodes. We conducted a qualitative experiment involving participants with technical expertise but no prior knowledge of edge bundling algorithms. Participants described their perceptions of both bundled and straight-line visualizations in open-ended tasks. Analysis of their annotations and transcripts revealed a general preference for bundled visualizations. However, when it came to false connections, participants tended to follow them in tightly bundled diagrams while also vocalizing that these drawings were more ambiguous. The routing of bundles influenced the perception of clusters and participants assigned more or fewer nodes to the clusters, depending on the routing of bundles. Participantsâ€™ unfamiliarity with the dataset led them to use analogies to describe the bundled drawings, potentially adding perceived semantic meaning to the data.
