Users’ perceptions of fitness tracking privacy is a subject of active study, but how do various aspects of social identity inform these perceptions? We conducted an online survey (N=322) that explores the influence of identity on fitness tracking privacy perceptions and practices, considering participants’ gender, race, age, and whether or not they identify as LGTBQ*. Participants reported how comfortable they felt sharing fitness data, commented on whether they believed their identity impacted this comfort, and brainstormed several data sharing risks and a possible mitigation for each risk. For each surveyed dimension of social identity, we find one or more reliable effects on participants’ level of comfort sharing fitness data, specifically when considering institutional groups like employers, insurers, and advertisers. Further, 64% of participants indicate at least one of their identity characteristics informs their comfort. We also find evidence that the perceived risks of sharing fitness data vary by identity, but do not find evidence of difference in the strategies used to manage these risks. This work highlights a path towards reasoning about the privacy challenges of fitness tracking with respect for the lived experiences of all users.
