Human visual attention is susceptible to social influences. In education, peer effects impact student learning, but their precise role in modulating attention remains unclear. To this end, we have developed an online education system that provides visual feedback to students based on the area of interest sharing of peer students’ gaze patterns. Our experiment (N=311) suggested that although peer attention manipulated students’ gaze, individuals adapted their viewing strategies rather than always mirroring peer focus. Furthermore, intentionally guiding students’ gaze along the lecture pace did not always improve learning outcomes. Instead, students able to adaptively adjust their focus based on personal needs showed enhanced performance. These findings elucidate how peer visual attention shapes students’ gaze patterns, deepening understanding of peer influence on learning. They also offer insights into designing adaptive online learning interventions leveraging peer attention modelling to optimize student attentiveness and learning success.
