Choreographers face increasing pressure to create content rapidly, driven by growing demand in social media, entertainment, and commercial sectors, often compromising creativity. This study introduces ChoreoCraft, a novel in-situ virtual reality (VR) choreographic system designed to enhance the creation process of choreography. Through contextual inquiries with professional choreographers, we identified key challenges such as memory dependency, creative plateaus, and abstract feedback to formulate design implications. Then, we propose a VR choreography creation system embedded with a context-aware choreography suggestion system and a choreography analysis system, all grounded in choreographers’ creative processes and mental models. Our study results demonstrated that ChoreoCraft fosters creativity, reduces memory dependency, and improves efficiency in choreography creation. Participants reported high satisfaction with the system’s ability to overcome creative plateaus and provide objective feedback. Our work advances creativity support tools by providing digital assistance in dance composition that values artistic autonomy while fostering innovation and efficiency.
