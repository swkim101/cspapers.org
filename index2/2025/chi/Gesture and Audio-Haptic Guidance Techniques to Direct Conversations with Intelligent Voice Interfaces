Advances in large language models (LLMs) empower new interactive capabilities for wearable voice interfaces, yet traditional voice-and-audio I/O techniques limit users’ ability to flexibly navigate information and manage timing for complex conversational tasks. We developed a suite of gesture and audio-haptic guidance techniques that enable users to control conversation flows and maintain awareness of possible future actions, while simultaneously contributing and receiving conversation content through voice and audio. A 14-participant exploratory study compared our parallelized I/O techniques to a baseline of voice-only interaction. The results demonstrate the efficiency of gestures and haptics for information access, while allowing system speech to be redirected and interrupted in a socially acceptable manner. The techniques also raised user awareness of how to leverage intelligent capabilities. Our findings inform design recommendations to facilitate role-based collaboration between multimodal I/O techniques and reduce users’ perception of time pressure when interleaving interactions with system speech.
