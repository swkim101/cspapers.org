Collaborative Mixed Reality (MR) enables embodied meetings for distributed collaborators working across a variety of locations. However, providing a coherent experience for all users regardless of the spatial configurations of their respective physical environments is a central challenge. We present the Spatial Heterogeneity Framework, which breaks the problem into four core components: the activity zones, heterogeneity ladder, blended proxemics, and MR solutions matrix. We explain the interplay between these components, demonstrating their interconnectivity via a case study. Our framework enables researchers to navigate differences and trade-offs between solutions for distributed MR collaboration. It also supports designers to think about the role of space, technology, and social behaviours in MR collaboration. Ultimately, our contributions advance the field by conceptualising the challenges of spatial heterogeneity and strategies to overcome them.
