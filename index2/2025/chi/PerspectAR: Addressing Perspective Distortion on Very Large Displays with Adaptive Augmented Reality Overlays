We present PerspectAR, a novel system addressing perspective distortion on displays caused by large size and wide viewing angles. PerspectAR has three components: a virtual AR screen that curves dynamically according to a userâ€™s position relative to the display, a sliding transparent window giving unobstructed access to the physical display in front of the user, and gaze indicators to assist collaborators when they are looking at different renderings. In a within-subjects study in a semi-controlled public environment with 12 pairs, we compared physical display-only and PerspectAR configurations for data analysis tasks. Participants reported less physical workload with PerspectAR and spent more time near the physical display without compromising task performance. Feedback indicates that PerspectAR addressed perspective distortion and provided a contextual view that was useful as a memory aid. Due to the virtual screen curvature, PerspectAR was seen as less effective for tasks involving distance estimates between objects.
