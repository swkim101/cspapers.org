Recently, there has been increased interest in design tools for creating textures using toolpath manipulation for extrusion-based 3D printers. Most tools are limited in their ability to edit existing 3D models and the variety of possible textures. Here, we present ConTextural, a design tool for adding texture to existing 3D models using toolpath manipulation. Using a coloring-based user interface, ConTextural allows users to draw textures on 3D models. Inspired by knitting structures, we introduce the concept of texture primitives, constructing texture structures that enable abundant possibilities for texture patterns. We include a curated texture library, enabling users to easily craft intricate and personalized designs. We assess the tool’s impact on users’ expressiveness, engagement, and satisfaction using a user study and demonstrate how it helps to produce uniquely distinct designs from a single 3D model. Additionally, we provide design examples highlighting functional applications for adding textures to existing 3D models.
