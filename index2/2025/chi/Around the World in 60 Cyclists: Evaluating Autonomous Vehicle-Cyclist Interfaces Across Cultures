Cultural differences influence how cyclists and drivers interact, affecting global autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption. AV-cyclist interfaces are needed to clarify AV intentions and resolve ambiguities when no human driver is present. These must adapt across cultures and road infrastructure. We conducted the first cross-cultural AV-cyclist user study across Stockholm (high segregation of cyclists from drivers), Glasgow (some segregation), and Muscat (no segregation). Cyclists used an AR simulator to cycle in physical space and experienced three holistic AV-cyclist interfaces. These integrated multiple interfaces into a larger ecosystem, e.g., a smartwatch synchronised with on-vehicle eHMI. Interfaces communicated AV location, intentions, or both. Riders from all cities preferred combined AV location and intention information but used it differently. Stockholm cyclists focused on location, validating intentions with driving behaviour. Glasgow riders valued both cues equally. Muscat cyclists trusted interfaces, prioritising intentions without relying on driving behaviour. These insights are key for global AV adoption.
