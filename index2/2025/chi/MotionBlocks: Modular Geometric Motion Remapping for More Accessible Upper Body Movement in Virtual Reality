Movement-based spatial interaction in VR can present significant challenges for people with limited mobility, particularly due to the mismatch between the upper body motion a VR app requires and the userâ€™s capabilities. We describe MotionBlocks , an approach which enables 3D spatial input with smaller motions or simpler input devices using modular geometric motion remapping. A formative study identifies common accessibility issues within VR motion de-sign, and informs a design language of VR motions that fall within simple geometric primitives. These 3D primitives enable collapsing spatial or non-spatial input into a normalized input vector, which is then expanded into a second 3D primitive representing larger, more
