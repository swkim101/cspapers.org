Social play is crucial for children’s well-being and development. However, many social play technologies fail to address the specific characteristics and needs of neurodiverse1 play and often overlook divergent play styles. To address this, we first conducted a co-design study with a neurodiverse group of 7 children (Age 7-8) and, based on insights from these sessions, then developed a prototype, ChromaConnect, that allowed children to express their play style to one another during play. To evaluate ChromaConnect’s ability to support neurodiverse social play in different contexts, we observed children using it in both structured and unstructured play settings. Our findings show that ChromaConnect enabled children to create a common language of play, made divergent play modes more visible, and facilitated explicit expression of social play initiation. We discuss how these findings could be used to design ‘accompanying social play things’ that are more inclusive of neurodiverse play characteristics and divergent play styles.
