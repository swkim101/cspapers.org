Tactile charts are essential for conveying data to blind and low vision (BLV) readers but are difficult for designers to construct. Non-expert designers face barriers to entry due to complex guidelines, while experts struggle with fragmented and time-consuming workflows that involve extensive customization. Inspired by formative interviews with expert tactile graphics designers, we created Tactile Vega-Lite (TVL): an extension of Vega-Lite that offers tactile-specific abstractions and synthesizes existing guidelines into a series of smart defaults. Predefined stylistic choices enable non-experts to produce guideline-compliant tactile charts quickly. Expert users can override defaults to tailor customizations for their intended audience. In a user study with 12 tactile graphics creators, we show that Tactile Vega-Lite enhances flexibility and consistency by automating tasks like adjusting spacing and translating braille while accelerating iterations through pre-defined textures and line styles. Through expert critique, we also learn more about tactile chart design best practices and design decisions.
