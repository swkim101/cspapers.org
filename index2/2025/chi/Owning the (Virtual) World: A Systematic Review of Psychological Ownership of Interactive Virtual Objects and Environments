In this systematic review, we analyze the literature on psychological ownership of virtual objects and environments according to the PRISMA statement. Psychological ownership describes the feelings of possession towards an object which are independent of legal possession. The construct stems from organizational management literature, but is gaining in importance in Human-Computer-Interaction as users invest billions to own virtual objects. The analysis of 21 research papers reveals how and why ownership emerges and presents the dimensions and consequences of such feelings. In addition, we relate these variables to the classic psychological ownership motives of self-efficacy, self-identity, and belonging, as well as the routes of control, identity transfer, and intimate knowledge. We outline why designers should pay attention to the phenomenon and how it can be utilized in different contexts. Finally, the paper concludes by outlining why and what research will be needed in the future.
