Non-English-based programming language enable young children to learn programming without needing to understand English. However, the current development of non-English-based programming language for children is primarily based on translations of English programming language. It remains unclear whether children can comprehend non-English keywords and how these keywords impact their programming learning process. To address this, we used the Chinese version of Scratch for a case study. We conducted experiments with 22 children to test their understanding of Chinese Scratch keywords and interviewed 12 teachers to analyze the translation issues from English keywords to non-English keywords that led to comprehension challenges and proposed a series of strategies. Based on this, we further discussed the impact of learning programming in non-English environments and the challenges faced in designing such cross-linguistic programming languages.
