In addition to trained work skills, employed individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) possess unique competencies that are often insufficiently supported or overlooked by both themselves and their work environments. This study proposes using reflective practices to help employees with IDs and employers rediscover competencies beyond job-related skills. To facilitate participation, we employed personalized crafting with iron beads, supported by a custom-developed application integrated with text-to-image generative AI. We conducted two workshops involving 5â€“7 employees with IDs to explore and enhance our approach to competency discovery. In the first workshop, facilitators manually created templates for participants, while in the second, we leveraged an AI-assisted application for self-creation of personalized templates. Findings from group discussions reveal (1) the development of a framework that positions AI-enhanced crafting activities as an effective way for uncovering and fostering competencies, and (2) insights into reflection on self-concept as a foundation for competency development.
