Learning drumming is challenging because multiple rhythms must be performed independently and simultaneously using both hands and feet. We conducted two formative studies to understand: 1) professional drumming instructors’ teaching methods, and 2) drummers’ current self-learning practices and pain points. All instructors deconstructed complex rhythms and limb movements and then used structured progression to teach drumming, which has not been explored by HCI research to date. Based on these findings, we developed a novel micro-progression learning framework for novice drummers that divides and structures comprehension progression (drum sequence and rhythm) and limb coordination progression into 16 stages. We also designed MR-Drum, a mixed-reality system that provides a first-person view of virtual limbs to demonstrate rhythm, limb, and drum surface dynamics, with adjustable tempo and automatic error detection. A summative user study vs. instructional videos showed that MR-Drum significantly improved error rate and timing accuracy, was significantly preferred for comprehension, skill development, and user experience, and was preferred overall by all participants.
