The recent surge of research on software developer mental health challenges highlights the importance and urgency of studying solutions to support developer wellbeing. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) offers a valuable framework for exploring wellbeing at work, emphasizing the need to satisfy three psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This paper presents an interview study with 31 software developers in the United States that uses SDT as a guide, exploring how these three needs are perceived and influenced in the work of software developers. We identify specific factors and processes at work and work tools and designs that impact developers’ psychological needs and satisfaction. Results from our study can help design targeted solutions to satisfy developers’ psychological needs, which indirectly support developer wellbeing. This paper highlights the necessity of healthy work cultures in software development and presents design considerations for creating tools for developers.
