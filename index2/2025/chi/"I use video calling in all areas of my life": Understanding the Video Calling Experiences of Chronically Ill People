Since the Covid-19 pandemic, video calling (VC) has become a staple means of daily communication. Beyond socializing, VC in the United States (U.S.) now supports remote work, healthcare and education. The sudden ubiquity of VC could have presented both advantages and challenges for chronically ill people. However, our understanding of chronically ill people’s experiences with VC remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted the largest online survey study (N=55) on chronically ill people’s VC experiences in the U.S.—investigating their routines, facilitators and barriers. Our quantitative and qualitative findings established that chronically ill people heavily depend on VC to cope with everyday life. At the same time, VC can also detrimentally exacerbate cognitive (e.g., brain fog), emotional (e.g., self-consciousness) and physical challenges (e.g., migraines) for chronically ill people. In response, we offer actionable design opportunities to improve the accessibility and experience of VC for chronically ill people.
