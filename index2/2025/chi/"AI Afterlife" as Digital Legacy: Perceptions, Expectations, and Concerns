The rise of generative AI technology has sparked interest in using digital information to create AI-generated agents as digital legacy. These agents, often referred to as"AI Afterlives", present unique challenges compared to traditional digital legacy. Yet, there is limited human-centered research on"AI Afterlife"as digital legacy, especially from the perspectives of the individuals being represented by these agents. This paper presents a qualitative study examining users' perceptions, expectations, and concerns regarding AI-generated agents as digital legacy. We identify factors shaping people's attitudes, their perceived differences compared with the traditional digital legacy, and concerns they might have in real practices. We also examine the design aspects throughout the life cycle and interaction process. Based on these findings, we situate"AI Afterlife"in digital legacy, and delve into design implications for maintaining identity consistency and balancing intrusiveness and support in"AI Afterlife"as digital legacy.
