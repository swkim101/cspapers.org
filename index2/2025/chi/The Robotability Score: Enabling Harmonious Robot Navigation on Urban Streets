This paper introduces the Robotability Score ($R$), a novel metric that quantifies the suitability of urban environments for autonomous robot navigation. Through expert interviews and surveys, we identify and weigh key features contributing to R for wheeled robots on urban streets. Our findings reveal that pedestrian density, crowd dynamics and pedestrian flow are the most critical factors, collectively accounting for 28% of the total score. Computing robotability across New York City yields significant variation; the area of highest R is 3.0 times more"robotable"than the area of lowest R. Deployments of a physical robot on high and low robotability areas show the adequacy of the score in anticipating the ease of robot navigation. This new framework for evaluating urban landscapes aims to reduce uncertainty in robot deployment while respecting established mobility patterns and urban planning principles, contributing to the discourse on harmonious human-robot environments.
