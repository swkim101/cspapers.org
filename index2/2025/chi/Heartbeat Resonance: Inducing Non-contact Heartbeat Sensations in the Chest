Perceiving and altering the sensation of internal physiological states, such as heartbeats, is key for biofeedback and interoception. Yet, wearable devices used for this purpose can feel intrusive and typically fail to deliver stimuli aligned with the heart’s location in the chest. To address this, we introduce Heartbeat Resonance, which uses low-frequency sound waves to create non-contact haptic sensations in the chest cavity, mimicking heartbeats. We conduct two experiments to evaluate the system’s effectiveness. The first experiment shows that the system created realistic heartbeat sensations in the chest, with 78.05 Hz being the most effective frequency. In the second experiment, we evaluate the effects of entrainment by simulating faster and slower heart rates. Participants perceived the intended changes and reported high confidence in their perceptions for +15% and -30% heart rates. This system offers a non-intrusive solution for biofeedback while creating new possibilities for immersive VR environments.
