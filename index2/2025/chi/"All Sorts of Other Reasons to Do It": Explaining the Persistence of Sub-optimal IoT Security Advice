The proliferation of consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices has raised security concerns. In response, governments have been advising consumers on security measures, but these recommendations are not guaranteed to be implementable owing to the diverse and rapidly evolving IoT landscape, risking wasted efforts and uncertainty caused by unsuccessful attempts to secure devices. Through interviews and a workshop with 14 stakeholders involved in a Dutch national public awareness campaign, we found that while stakeholders recognized the validity of these concerns, they opted to continue the campaign with minor modifications while expecting regulatory changes to resolve the observed problem. Their justifications reveal an institutional incentive structure that overlooks well-documented user realities in security and privacy HCI research. This raises important considerations for the design and delivery of such support strategies. By fostering a collaborative dialogue, we aim to contribute to the development of user-centered security practices.
