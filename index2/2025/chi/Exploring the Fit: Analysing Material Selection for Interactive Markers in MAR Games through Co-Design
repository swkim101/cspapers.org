Understanding how different user groups interact and perceive material selection for interactive markers in mobile augmented reality (MAR) games is essential for effective design. This study uses a qualitative approach, incorporating interviews and workshops to examine the preferences and behaviours of designers (N=6) and children (N=8). Designers highlighted the importance of using versatile and environmentally sustainable materials that can be customised for various games. Meanwhile, childrenâ€™s interactions with these materials revealed challenges such as decision-making pressure and reliance on peer collaboration to navigate unfamiliar materials. The study identified five critical considerations for selecting materials: simplification, customisation, sustainability, balanced creativity, and collaboration. Our results show that while designers prioritise creative potential, user engagement is influenced by material ease and collaboration. This study provides key insights into the design considerations for MAR games, suggesting aligning designer expectations with actual user behaviour for creating successful and immersive MAR experiences.
