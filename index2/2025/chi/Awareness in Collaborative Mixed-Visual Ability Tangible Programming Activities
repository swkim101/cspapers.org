In the context of computational thinking tasks, which often require problem-solving and critical thinking skills, awareness of a partnerâ€™s actions can play a significant role in fostering a balanced collaboration. Understanding how awareness influences mixed-visual ability group collaboration in a tangible environment can provide insights into inclusive design for learning environments. To address this issue, we ran a user study where 6 mixed-visual ability pairs engaged in a tangible programming activity. The study had three experimental conditions, representing 3 different levels of awareness. Our findings reveal that while pre-existing power dynamics heavily influenced collaboration, workspace awareness feedback was essential in fostering engagement and improving communication for both children. This paper highlights the need for designing inclusive collaborative programming systems that account for workspace awareness and individual abilities, offering insights into more effective and balanced collaborative environments.
