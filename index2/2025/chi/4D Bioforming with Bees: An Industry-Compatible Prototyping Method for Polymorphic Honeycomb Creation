4D bioforming is a captivating yet often overlooked natural aesthetic phenomenon, involving the polymorphic transformations that occur during the construction of honeycomb by bees, which presents a significant opportunity for the innovative transformation of traditional apiculture. This paper proposes an industry-compatible prototyping method for polymorphic honeycomb creation following the phenomenon of 4D bioforming, aiming to introduce innovation to honeycomb forms through 4D bioforming while preserving the central role of beekeepers. The method is designed to align with the practical habits of beekeepers and can be outlined in four key steps: scaffold creation, quadrilateral shape division, bee path compilation with outer mold, and 4D bioforming. The dynamic temporal changes in the honeycomb were successfully demonstrated, enhancing the artistic aspect of honeycomb creation. Evaluation results suggest that the method is compatible with traditional practices, easily adoptable by beekeepers and that the polymorphic honeycomb meets essential aesthetic standards.
