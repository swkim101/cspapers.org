Volumetric displays render true 3D graphics without forcing users to wear headsets or glasses. However, the optical diffusers that volumetric displays employ are rigid and thus do not allow for direct interaction. FlexiVol employs elastic diffusers to allow users to reach inside the display volume to have direct interaction with true 3D content. We explored various diffuser materials in terms of visual and mechanical properties. We correct the distortions of the volumetric graphics projected on elastic oscillating diffusers and propose a design space for FlexiVol, enabling various gestures and actions through direct interaction techniques. A user study suggests that selection, docking and tracing tasks can be performed faster and more precisely using direct interaction when compared to indirect interaction with a 3D mouse. Finally, applications such as a virtual pet or landscape edition highlight the advantages of a volumetric display that supports direct interaction.
