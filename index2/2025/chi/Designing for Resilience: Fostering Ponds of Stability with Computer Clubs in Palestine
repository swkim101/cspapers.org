Addressing the complexities of conflict-affected regions remains a critical challenge for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This paper examines the establishment of computer clubs in Palestinian refugee camps, where efforts to create sustainable interventions weighed against the instability of prolonged conflict. To capture this dynamic, we introduce the notion of ‘adaptive ponds of stability,’ which extends the ‘tech public of erosion’ framework [12]. While the latter emphasizes systemic depletion of socio-technical infrastructures, adaptive ponds of stability highlight efforts to foster temporary spaces of resilience. The clubs became hubs of learning, respite, and collaboration—offering moments of routine and empowerment amidst disruption. Reflecting on this, we advocate for a paradigm shift from sustainability to resilience as the primary design goal in unstable contexts. Our findings emphasize adaptability, local agency, and cultural sensitivity that respond dynamically to context-specific challenges, offering a nuanced approach to advancing HCI interventions in conflict-affected settings.
