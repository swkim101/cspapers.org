While several digital tools exist for children's creative storytelling, few have explored how generative AI can enhance storytelling quality. Our formative research identified five design requirements for AI-powered storytelling tools for elementary students. We developed a system named StoryPrompt that enables children to co-create stories and comics with AI, boosting literacy and creativity. Pilot tests with children and HCI experts demonstrated good usability and positive learning experiences. In a mixed-methods evaluation with 40 children from Grades 2-6, we found that StoryPrompt significantly improved storytelling creativity and richness, compared to the storyboard method. Observations indicated more purposeful planning and strategic use of AI-generated words and images, facilitating efficient exploration of storytelling alternatives. While children preferred AI images, they recognized the limitations in representing storytelling details. Teacher interviews highlighted the system's motivational potential and classroom flexibility. We discuss the benefits and considerations of using generative AI to enhance creative storytelling for children.
