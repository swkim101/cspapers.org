A highlight is a short edit of the original video that includes the most engaging moments. Given the rigid timing of TV commercial slots and length limits of social media uploads, generating highlights of specific lengths is crucial. Previous research on automatic highlight generation often overlooked the control over the duration of the final video, producing highlights of arbitrary lengths. We propose a novel system that automatically generates highlights of any user-specified length. Our system leverages Most Replayed Data (MRD), which identifies how frequently a video has been watched over time, to gauge the most engaging parts. It then optimizes the final editing path by adjusting internal segment durations. We evaluated the quality of our systemâ€™s outputs through two user studies, including a comparison with highlights created by human editors. Results show that our system can automatically produce highlights that are indistinguishable from those created by humans in viewing experience.
