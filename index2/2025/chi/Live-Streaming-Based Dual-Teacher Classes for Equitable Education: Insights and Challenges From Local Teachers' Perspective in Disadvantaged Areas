Educational inequalities in disadvantaged areas have long been a global concern. While Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have shown great potential in addressing this issue, the unique challenges in disadvantaged areas often hinder the practical effectiveness of such technologies. This paper examines live-streaming-based dual-teacher classes (LSDC) through a qualitative study in disadvantaged regions of China. Our findings indicate that, although LSDC offers students in these regions access to high-quality educational resources, its practical implementation is fraught with challenges. Specifically, we foreground the pivotal role of local teachers in mitigating these challenges. Through a series of situated efforts, local teachers contextualize high-quality lectures to the local classroom environment, ensuring the expected educational outcomes. Based on our findings, we argue that greater recognition and support for the situational practices of local teachers is essential for fostering a more equitable, sustainable, and scalable technology-driven educational model in disadvantaged areas.
