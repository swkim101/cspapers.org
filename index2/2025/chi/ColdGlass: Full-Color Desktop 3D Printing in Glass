ColdGlass is a new material and workflow for accessible, affordable, and full-color glass 3D printing. We present: 1) a recipe for a 3D printable glass paste, 2) software and hardware that enable 3D printing, and 3) a firing schedule for sintering printed parts into solid glass. We evaluate our recipe and firing schedule by comparing the look, feel, shrinkage, porosity, and density of a collection of printed objects. We then present a range of functional and decorative glass artifacts that we 3D printed from ColdGlass including earrings, tiled glass sheets, sculptures, and functional vessels. We also describe methods for reusing and recycling glass in our workflow. We conclude by discussing the unique affordances of ColdGlass and the creative opportunities it provides for digital fabrication, design, and HCI.
