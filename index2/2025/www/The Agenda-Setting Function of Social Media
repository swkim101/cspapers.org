As people increasingly use social media as a primary news source, it becomes critical to understand how online platforms affect peoplesâ€™ experience of the news. Through the media effects of agenda-setting and framing, different news sources can vary in their influence on public opinion regarding which issues people consider important and how particular aspects of these issues should be interpreted. However, little is known about how issues and frames shift and segregate across partisan lines as traditional news on social media gets filtered by the selective exposure effects of social media. In this study, we investigate the issues and frames invoked in news article shares across Reddit over 16 years and measure their traditional media and social media partisanship. We measure the change between production (news articles posted on Reddit) and consumption (news articles posted on Reddit, weighted by their score). We find that issues are shared in a co-partisan manner across traditional media and social media lines. Issues are also more polarized in social media than traditional media and more polarized in consumption than production. We find that frames across several issues are also subject to co-partisan sharing behavior. In contrast to the significant polarization of news outlets on Reddit in 2016, issues and frames do not polarize more over time. Finally, looking at case studies of frames within specific issues, we disaggregate the shift from production to consumption by distinguishing between issues where the frames polarize and issues that simply receive less exposure on one side of the political spectrum. Our results give insight into broader phenomena like political polarization by highlighting the dimensions of precisely what polarizes and how polarization occurs. Overall, our study showcases the importance of understanding how social media distorts the perception of the news via its agenda-setting and framing functions.
