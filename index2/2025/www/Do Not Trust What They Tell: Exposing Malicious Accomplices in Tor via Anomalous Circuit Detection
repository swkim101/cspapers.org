The Tor network, while offering anonymity through traffic routing across volunteer-operated nodes, remains vulnerable to attacks that aim to deanonymize users by correlating traffic patterns between colluded entry and exit nodes in circuits. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting anomalous circuits in the Tor network, and for the first time provides a more comprehensive identification of potential malicious accomplice nodes in Tor by taking roles of nodes in anomalous circuits into consideration. Our method strategically utilizes modified middle nodes to capture traffic data, followed by a novel circuit classification based on traffic patterns to pinpoint concerned circuits. Two kinds of anomalies are identified: routing anomalies and usage anomalies, that respectively represent the anomalies with explicit or implicit violation of Tor’s circuit construction guidelines. This leads to a successful revealing of totally 1,960 anomalous nodes in Tor. Furthermore, we apply clustering analysis with considering corresponding anomalous circuits and other key characteristics to the detected anomalous nodes, revealing potential hidden organizations behind these nodes that can threaten the network’s security. Our findings highlight the necessity for the Tor project to adopt targeted mitigation strategies to enhance overall network security and privacy.
