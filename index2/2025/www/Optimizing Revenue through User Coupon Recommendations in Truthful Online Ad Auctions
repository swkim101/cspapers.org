Online advertising serves as the primary revenue source for numerous Internet companies, which typically sell advertising slots through auctions. Conventional online ad auctions assume constant click-through rates (CTRs) and conversion rates (CVRs) for ads during the auction process. However, this paper studies a new scenario where advertisers can offer coupons to users, thereby influencing both CTRs and CVRs and consequently, the platform’s revenue. We study how to recommend user coupons to advertisers in truthful auction systems. We model the interaction between the platform and the advertisers as an extensive-form game, where ad-vertisers first report coupon bids to the platform to receive coupon recommendations, and then participate in auctions by reporting their auction bids. Our research identifies a sufficient condition under which the advertisers’ optimal strategy is to report their valuations truthfully in both the recommendation and auction stages. We construct two mechanisms based on these findings. The first mechanism is a distribution-free mechanism, which is easily implementable in industrial systems; and the second is a revenue-optimal mechanism that offers simpler implementation compared to existing work [10]. Both synthetic and industrial experiments show that our mechanisms improve the platform’s revenue. No-tably, our revenue-optimal mechanism achieves the same outcome compared to existing work by Liu et al. [10], while offering a simpler implementation
