Review personalization aims at presenting the most relevant reviews of a product according to the preferences of the individual user. Existing studies of review personalization use the reviews authored by the user as a proxy for their preferences, and henceforth as a means for learning and evaluating personalization quality. In this work, we suggest using review votes rather than authorship for personalization. We propose MAGLLM, an approach that leverages heterogeneous graphs for modeling the relationships among reviews, products, and users, with large language model (LLM) to enrich user representation on the graph. Our evaluation over a unique public dataset that includes user voting information indicates that the vote signal yields substantially higher personalization performance across a variety of recommendation methods and e-commerce domains. It also indicates that our graph-LLM approach outperforms comparative baselines and algorithmic alternatives. We conclude with concrete recommendations for e-commerce platforms seeking to enhance their review personalization experience.
