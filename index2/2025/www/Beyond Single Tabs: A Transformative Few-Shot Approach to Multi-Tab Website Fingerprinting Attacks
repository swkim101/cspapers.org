Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks allow passive eavesdroppers to deduce the websites a user visits by analyzing encrypted traffic, threatening user privacy. While current WF attacks achieve high accuracy, they typically assume single-tab browsing, which is unrealistic as users often open multiple tabs, creating mixed traffic. Existing multi-tab WF approaches require large datasets and frequent retraining due to evolving website content, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we introduce Few-shot Multi-tab Website Fingerprinting (FMWF), a novel approach designed to address the limitations of existing multi-tab WF attacks. FMWF directly tackles the challenges of mixed, overlapping traffic traces generated from multi-tab browsing, leveraging two key innovations: (1) an advanced data augmentation technique that synthesizes realistic multi-tab traffic sequences from easily collected single-tab traces, thereby dramatically reducing the need for large-scale real-world traffic data; and (2) a powerful fine-tuning algorithm based on transfer learning that adapts pre-trained models to new, multi-tab environments with minimal additional data. This two-stage framework enables FMWF to capture the complex effectively, overlapping traffic patterns inherent in multi-tab browsing while maintaining a high level of flexibility and significantly lowering computational and data collection burdens. Our experiments, conducted using real traffic traces collected from three widely-used browsers-Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Tor Browser-highlight the superior performance of FMWF in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Notably, FMWF achieves a minimum 12.3% improvement in accuracy compared to ARES (SP'23) [7], TMWF (CCS'23) [13], and BAPM (ACSAC'21) [10] in the open-world scenario.
