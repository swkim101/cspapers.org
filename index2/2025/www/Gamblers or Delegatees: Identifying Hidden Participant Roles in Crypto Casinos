With the development of blockchain technology, crypto gambling has gained popularity due to its high level of anonymity. However, similar to traditional casinos, crypto casinos are controlled by a few internal Delegatees, making it impossible for them to achieve complete transparency and fairness. These delegatees are hidden among gamblers and are difficult to identify and distinguish in anonymous and large-scale blockchain transaction networks. This paper proposes an unsupervised dual-stage role identification method to adaptively identify key roles and hidden delegatees in label-sparse crypto casinos. Specifically, inspired by voting-style transaction patterns, we propose a novel voting influence metric for key node identification. This metric is based on one-dimensional structural entropy to capture global dissemination capability. Subsequently, we develop a multi-view graph neural network framework enhanced with two-dimensional global structural entropy minimization and self-supervised contrastive learning to improve the robustness and interpretability of hidden role partitioning. Experiments on real-world cases of the most mainstream blockchains-Ethereum, TRON, and Arbitrum-demonstrate that our proposed method effectively reveals distinct role compositions and collusion patterns, distinguishing between gamblers and delegatees. Our results achieve a higher match with identities confirmed by judicial authorities than existing methods, indicating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing security and regulation oversight.
