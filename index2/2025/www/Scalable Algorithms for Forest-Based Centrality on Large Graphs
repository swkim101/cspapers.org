Centrality measures are essential for identifying important nodes and edges in networks. In this paper, we focus on two forest-based centrality measures on undirected graphs: forest node centrality (FNC) and forest edge centrality (FEC), which capture the influence of nodes and edges through their participation in spanning forests. Both centrality measures can be represented using entries of the forest matrix. To address the challenge of computing the two measures on large networks, we propose two scalable algorithms from different perspectives. The first algorithm IFGN combines two variance reduction techniques to approximate the entries of the forest matrix, applicable to both FNC and FEC.The second algorithm FECE incorporates a new physical interpretation of FEC, allowing for a better overall estimation. We provide error guarantees for both algorithms and demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness through extensive experiments on various real-world networks.
