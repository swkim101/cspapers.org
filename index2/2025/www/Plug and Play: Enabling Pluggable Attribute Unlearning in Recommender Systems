With the escalating privacy concerns in recommender systems, attribute unlearning has drawn widespread attention as an effective approach against attribute inference attacks. This approach focuses on unlearning users' privacy attributes to reduce the performance of attackers while preserving the overall effectiveness of recommendation. Current research attempts to achieve attribute unlearning through adversarial training and distribution alignment in the statistic setting. However, these methods often struggle in dynamic real-world environments, particularly when considering scenarios where unlearning requests are frequently updated. In this paper, we first identify three main challenges of current methods in dynamic environments, i.e., irreversible operation, low efficiency, and unsatisfied recommendation preservation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Pluggable Attribute Unlearning framework, PAU. Upon receiving an unlearning request, PAU plugs an additional erasure module into the original model to achieve unlearning. This module can perform a reverse operation if the request is later withdrawn. To enhance the efficiency of unlearning, we introduce rate distortion theory and reduce the attack performance by maximizing the encoded bits required for users' embedding within the same class of the unlearned attribute and minimizing those for different classes, which eliminates the need to calculate the centroid distribution for alignment. We further preserve recommendation performance by constraining the compactness of the user embedding space around a reasonable flood level. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets and three mainstream recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
