An efficient last-mile delivery scheme in logistics benefits customers, couriers, and the platform. In practice, the delivery scope of a delivery station is divided into multiple areas, each of which is covered by a courier. The long distances between the delivery station and areas limit the couriers' delivery efficiency given that they need to travel back and forth multiple times a day. To solve this problem, we explore an inter-trip cooperation scheme for last-mile delivery, in which couriers traveling to the delivery station and back to corresponding areas earlier can help to take others' orders back. Coordinating the courier cooperation is challenging because we need to consider the courier's status, e.g., locations, and vehicle capacity constraint simultaneously. In this work, we design an inter-trip cooperation-based last-mile delivery system, InCo, aiming to minimize the average order delivery time. InCo includes two components: i) a time-aware spanning tree algorithm to generate the cooperation result for a group of couriers; and ii) a capacity-constrained courier grouping algorithm to optimize the courier grouping result iteratively. Extensive evaluation results with real-world order data collected from one of the largest logistics companies show that InCo improves the average saved delivery time and reduces average travel time by up to 80.2% and 28.4%, respectively, compared to baseline methods. The deployment results show InCo improves the average courier working efficiency by 21.6% to the state-of-the-practice.
