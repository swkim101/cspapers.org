Memes serve as a powerful medium of expression in the digital age, shaping cultural discourse and conveying ideas succinctly and engagingly. However, their potential for social abuse highlights the importance of developing effective methods to detect harmful content within memes. Recent studies on memes have focused on transforming images into textual captions using large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches often result in non-informative captions. Furthermore, previous methods have only been tested on limited datasets, providing insufficient evidence of their robustness. To address these limitations, we present a multimodal, agent-based framework designed to generate informative visual descriptions of memes by asking insightful questions to improve visual descriptions in zero-shot visual question-answering settings. Specifically, we leverage an LLM as agents with distinct roles and a large multimodal model (LMM) as a vision expert. These agents first analyze the images and then ask informative questions related to potential social abuse in memes to obtain high-quality answers about the images. Through continuous discussion guided by instructional prompts, the agents gather high-quality information while repeatedly acquiring image data from the LMM, which helps detect social abuse in memes. Results on a dataset of 6,626 memes across 5 tasks show our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection of social abuse in memes.
