Recently, multilingual Vision-Language Pre-training (mVLP) has shown remarkable progress in learning joint representations across different modalities and languages. However, most existing methods learn semantic alignment at a coarse-grained level and fail to capture fine-grained correlations between different languages and modalities. To address this, we propose a Multi-grained Multilingual Vision-Language Pre-training (M2-VLP) model, which aims to learn cross-lingual cross-modal alignment at different semantic granular levels. In cross-lingual interaction, the model learns the global alignment of parallel sentence pairs and the word-level correlations. In cross-modal interaction, the model aligns images with captions and image regions with corresponding words. To integrate the cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment above, we propose a unified multi-grained contrastive learning paradigm. Under zero-shot cross-lingual and fine-tuned multilingual settings, extensive experiments on vision-language downstream tasks across twenty languages demonstrate the effectiveness of M2-VLP over competitive contrastive models.
