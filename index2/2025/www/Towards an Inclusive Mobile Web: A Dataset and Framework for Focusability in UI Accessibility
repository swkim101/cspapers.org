The rapid growth of mobile web technologies has revolutionized how people manage daily activities, emphasizing the critical need for accessible mobile user interfaces (UIs) that accommodate users with disabilities and situational impairments. Current AI-driven UI understanding methods show promise but primarily target general UI modeling, neglecting nuanced, user-centric accessibility requirements. To bridge this gap, we first conducted a formative study with 12 visually impaired participants. Our study uncovers selective-accessible issues, a new class of accessibility challenges requiring finer granularity and selective focus on UI components, which existing methods largely overlook. Our findings also reveal that the severity of issues varies across interaction stages, with earlier stages posing a more significant impact. Building on these
