Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to consistently express it and generate false statements. This gap between"knowing"and"telling"poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. Inspired by recent work on the practice of encoding human-interpretable concepts linearly within large language models, we treat truthfulness as a specially linearly encoded concept within LLMs, and introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shifts LLM's activations in the"truthful"direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse truthfulness-related steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28%), LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19%), and LLaMA3($\uparrow$ 34%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.
