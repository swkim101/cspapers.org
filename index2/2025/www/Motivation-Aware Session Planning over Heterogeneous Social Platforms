With the explosive growth of online service platforms, an increasing number of people and enterprises are undertaking personal and professional tasks online. In real applications such as trip planning and online marketing, planning sessions for a sequence of activities or services will enable social users to receive the optimal services, improving their experience and reducing the cost of their activities. These online platforms are heterogeneous, including different types of services with different attributes. However, the problem of session planning over heterogeneous platforms has not been studied so far. In this paper, we propose a Motivation-Aware Session Planning (MASP) framework for session planning over heterogeneous social platforms. Specifically, we first propose a novel HeterBERT model to handle the heterogeneity of items at both type and attribute levels. Then, we propose to predict user preference using the motivations behind user activities. Finally, we propose an algorithm together with its optimisations for efficient session generation. The extensive tests prove the high effectiveness and efficiency of MASP.
