Thematic analysis (TA) is a widely used qualitative method for identifying underlying meanings within unstructured text. However, TA requires manual processes, which become increasingly labour-intensive and time-consuming as datasets grow. While large language models (LLMs) have been introduced to assist with TA on small-scale datasets, three key limitations hinder their effectiveness. First, current approaches often depend on interactions between an LLM agent and a human coder, a process that becomes challenging with larger datasets. Second, with feedback from the human coder, the LLM tends to mirror the human coder, which provides a narrower viewpoint of the data. Third, existing methods follow a sequential process, where codes are generated for individual samples without recalling previous codes and associated data, reducing the ability to analyse data holistically. To address these limitations, we propose Thematic-LM, an LLM-based multi-agent system for large-scale computational thematic analysis. Thematic-LM assigns specialised tasks to each agent, such as coding, aggregating codes, and maintaining and updating the codebook. We assign coder agents different identity perspectives to simulate the subjective nature of TA, fostering a more diverse interpretation of the data. We applied Thematic-LM to the Dreaddit dataset and the Reddit climate change dataset to analyse themes related to social media stress and online opinions on climate change. We evaluate the resulting themes based on trustworthiness principles in qualitative research. Our study reveals insights such as assigning different identities to coder agents promotes divergence in codes and themes.
