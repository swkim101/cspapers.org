Federated learning (FL) has gained widespread attention for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning capabilities. Due to significant statistical heterogeneity, traditional FL struggles to generalize a shared model across diverse data domains. Personalized federated learning addresses this issue by dividing the model into a globally shared part and a locally private part, with the local model correcting representation biases introduced by the global model. Nevertheless, locally converged parameters more accurately capture domain-specific knowledge, and current methods overlook the potential benefits of these parameters. To address these limitations, we propose PM-MoE architecture. This architecture integrates a mixture of personalized modules and an energy-based personalized modules denoising, enabling each client to select beneficial personalized parameters from other clients. We applied the PM-MoE architecture to nine recent model-split-based personalized federated learning algorithms, achieving performance improvements with minimal additional training. Extensive experiments on six widely adopted datasets and two heterogeneity settings validate the effectiveness of our approach.
