Privacy-preserving Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been extensively studied to address the cold-start problem using auxiliary source domains while simultaneously protecting sensitive information. However, existing privacy-preserving CDR methods rely heavily on transferring sensitive user embeddings or behaviour logs, which leads to adopt privacy methods to distort the data patterns before transferring it to the target domain. The distorted information can compromise overall performance during the knowledge transfer process. To overcome these challenges, our approach differs from existing privacy-preserving methods that focus on safeguarding user-sensitive information. Instead, we concentrate on distilling transferable knowledge from insensitive item embeddings, which we refer to as prototypes. Specifically, we propose a conditional model inversion mechanism to accurately distill prototypes for individual users. We have designed a new data format and corresponding learning paradigm for distilling transferable prototypes from traditional recommendation models using model inversion. These prototypes facilitate bridging the domain shift between distinct source and target domains in a privacy-friendly manner. Additionally, they enable the identification of top-k users in the target domain to substitute for cold-start users prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across large real-world datasets, and the results substantiate the effectiveness of PFCDR https://github.com/walcheng/PFCDR..
