Accurate measurement of mobile network performance is crucial for optimizing user experience and ensuring regulatory compliance. Traditional methods like crowdsourcing approaches, though effective, depend heavily on user participation and extensive infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce adNPM , a novel technique for measuring download speed by embedded measurement code in ads displayed across web browsers and mobile apps, without requiring user participation. Through controlled lab tests and real-world de-ployments in 15 countries, we demonstrate that adNPM achieves accuracy comparable to well-established tools like Speedtest by Ookla and Opensignal while significantly reducing data consumption.
