Medication recommendation aims to suggest personalized drug combinations to patients based on their longitudinal medical histories stored in electronic health record (EHR) datasets. Patients' Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) determine how patients' drug combinations change along with the evolution of disease treatment. DTRs are effective for comprehending disease-treatment dynamics and for recommending a timely and personalized combination of medications for patients. However, existing medication recommender systems (MRSs) overlook the multiple treatment pathways generated by the intervention of DTRs and can only recommend a single treatment paradigm, ignoring the fact that patients may be at different treatment stages and thus require different treatment regime. Such disregard leads to a significant limitation in recommending personalized medication combinations tailored to different treatment stages, yielding greatly compromised accuracy and applicability of MRSs. Moreover, existing methods often overlook the time interval information over patients' successive visits, which is critical to indicate patients' treatment evolution. To address these significant gaps, we propose a Time-aware Medication Recommendation Framework via Intervention of Dynamic Treatment Regimes, called MR-DTR. To explicitly illustrate the intervention processes of DTRs on similar patients, we employ a co-guided graph to connect various patient sequences. In addition, to fully utilize the time interval information, we design a time-aware guidance mechanism dedicated to the co-guided graph to efficiently learn medication representation using the patient's guidance information. We also introduce relative time intervals in the encoder to act as positional information. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that MR-DTR surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation performance.
