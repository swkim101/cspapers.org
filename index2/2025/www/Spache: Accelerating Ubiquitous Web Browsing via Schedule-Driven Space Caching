In this paper, we perform a systematic study to explore a pivotal problem facing the web community: is current distributed web cache ready for future satellite Internet? First, through a worldwide performance measurement based on the RIPE Atlas platform and Starlink, the largest low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite network (LSN) today, we identify that the uneven deployment of current distributed cache servers, inter-ISP meandering routes and the last-mile congestion on LEO links jointly prevent existing terrestrial web cache from providing low-latency web access for users in emerging LSNs. Second, we propose Spache, a novel web caching system which addresses the limitations of existing ground-only cache by exploiting a bold idea: integrating web cache into LEO satellites to achieve ubiquitous and low-latency web services. Specifically, Spache leverages a key feature of LSNs called communication schedule to efficiently prefetch web contents on satellites, and adopts a schedule-driven partitioning strategy to avoid cache pollution involved by LEO mobility. Finally, we implement a prototype of Spache, and evaluate it based on real-world HTTP traces and data-driven LSN simulation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that as compared to existing distributed caching solutions, Spache can improve cache hit ratio by 19.8% on average, reduce latency by up to 17.7%, and maintains consistently low web browsing latency for global LSN users.
