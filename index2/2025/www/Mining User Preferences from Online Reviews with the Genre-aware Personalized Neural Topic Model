Customer-generated reviews on e-commerce websites often contain valuable insights into users' interests in product genres and provide a rich source for mining user preferences. However, most existing neural topic models tend to generate meaningless topics that share low correlations with product genres. Furthermore, they often fail to mine user preferences and discover personalized topic profiles due to the absence of explicit user modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Genre-aware Personalized neural Topic Model (GPTM), which incorporates product genre information into the topic modeling process to ensure the relevance between mined topics and product genres. Moreover, it could produce a personalized topic profile for each user by performing user preference modeling. Extensive experimental results on three publicly available Amazon review corpora validate the effectiveness of the proposed GPTM in genre-aware topic modeling. Furthermore, GPTM surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in user preference mining and generates high-quality personalized topic profiles.
