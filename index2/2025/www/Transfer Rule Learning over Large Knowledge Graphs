Logical rules have been widely used for expressing schema knowledge in various practical applications. It is infeasible to handcraft rules from large knowledge graphs (KGs) and thus many methods have been proposed for learning rules automatically from KGs. However, it is largely ignored how to extract rules in a (target) KG from rules that already exist in some other (source) KGs. In this paper, we propose a framework for KG rule learning based on transfer learning. A major challenge for establishing such a framework is that a suitable alignment mechanism is required for mapping certain subgraph structures between predicates in the source KG and the target KG. Hence, our framework provides a new method for predicate mapping based on graph-structural similarity. The proposed framework can be used as a standalone rule learner but more importantly, it paves a new way for enhancing the state-of-the-art rule learners for large KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the new approach to rule learning, which shows that rules in smaller KGs can be effectively transferred to a large KG.
