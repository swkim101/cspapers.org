Projecting knowledge graph queries into an embedding space using geometric models (points, boxes and spheres) can help to answer queries for large incomplete knowledge graphs. In this work, we propose a symbolic learning-free approach using fuzzy logic to address the shape-closure problem that restricted geometric-based embedding models to only a few shapes (e.g. ConE) for answering complex logical queries. The use of symbolic approach facilitates non-closure geometric models (e.g. point, box) to handle logical operators (including negation). This enabled our newly proposed spherical embeddings (SpherE) in this work to use a polar coordinate system to effectively represent hierarchical relation. Results show that the SpherE model can answer existential positive first-order logic and negation queries. We show that SpherE significantly outperforms the point and box embeddings approaches while generating semantically meaningful hierarchy-aware embeddings.
