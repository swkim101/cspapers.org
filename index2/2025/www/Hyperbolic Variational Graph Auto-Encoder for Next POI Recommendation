Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become a crucial task in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), which provide personalized recommendations by predicting the user's next check-in locations. Commonly used models including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely explored. However, these models face significant challenges, including the difficulty of capturing the hierarchical and tree-like structure of POIs in Euclidean space and the sparsity problem inherent in POI recommendations. To address these challenges, we propose a Hyperbolic Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (HVGAE) for next POI recommendation. Specifically, we utilize a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network (Hyperbolic GCN) to model hierarchical structures and tree-like relationships by converting node embeddings from euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Then we use Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) to convert node embeddings to probabilistic distributions, enhancing the capture of deeper latent features and providing a more robust model structure. Furthermore, we combine the Mamba4Rec recommender and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and propose Rotary Position Mamba (RPMamba) to effectively utilize POI embeddings rich in sequential information, which improves the accuracy of the next POI recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the HVGAE model.
