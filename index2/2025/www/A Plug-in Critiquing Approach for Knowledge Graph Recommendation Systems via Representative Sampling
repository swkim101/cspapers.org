Incorporating a critiquing component into recommender applications facilitates the enhancement of user perception. Typically, critique-able recommender systems adapt the model parameters and update the recommendation list in real-time through the analysis of user critiquing keyphrases in the inference phase. The current critiquing methods necessitate the designation of a dedicated recommendation model to estimate user relevance to the critiquing keyphrase during the training phase preceding the recommendations update. This paradigm restricts the applicable scenarios and reduces the potential for keyphrase exploitation. Furthermore, these approaches ignore the issue of catastrophic forgetting caused by continuous modification of model parameters in multi-step critiquing. Thus, we present a general Representative Items Sampling Framework for Critiquing on Knowledge Graph Recommendation (RISC) implemented as a plug-in, which offers a new paradigm for critiquing in mainstream recommendation scenarios. RISC leverages the knowledge graph to sample important representative items as a hinge to expand and convey information from user critiquing, indirectly estimating the relevance of the user to the critiquing keyphrase. Consequently, the necessity for specialized user-keyphrase correlation modules is eliminated with respect to a variety of knowledge graph recommendation models. Moreover, we propose a Weight Experience Replay (WER) approach based on KG to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by reinforcing the user's prior preferences during the inference phase. Our extensive experimental findings on three real-world datasets and three knowledge graph recommendation methods illustrate that RISC with WER can be effectively integrated into knowledge graph recommendation models to efficiently utilize user critiquing for refining recommendations and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
