Tags play a critical role in enhancing product discoverability, optimizing search results, and enriching recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms. Despite the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), which have shown proficiency in processing and understanding textual information, their application in tag generation remains an under-explored yet complex challenge. To this end, we introduce a novel method for automatic product tagging using LLMs to create behavior-enhanced tags (BETags). Specifically, our approach begins by generating base tags using an LLM. These base tags are then refined into BETags by incorporating user behavior data. This method aligns the tags with users' actual browsing and purchasing behavior, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of tags to user preferences. By personalizing the base tags with user behavior data, BETags are able to capture deeper behavioral insights, which is essential for understanding nuanced user interests and preferences in e-commerce environments. Moreover, since BETags are generated offline, they do not impose real-time computational overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into downstream tasks commonly associated with recommendation systems and search optimization. Our evaluation of BETag across three datasets--- Amazon (Scientific), MovieLens-1M, and FreshFood---shows that our approach significantly outperforms both human-annotated tags and other automated methods. These results highlight BETag as a scalable and efficient solution for personalized automated tagging, advancing e-commerce platforms by creating more tailored and engaging user experiences.
