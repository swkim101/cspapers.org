Graph anomaly detection plays a crucial role in identifying nodes that deviate significantly from normal patterns within a graph, with applications spanning various domains such as detection of authorship fraud and rumor propagation. Traditional methods primarily focus on aggregating information from neighboring nodes and reconstructing the central node based on these aggregated features. The anomaly degree is then calculated by comparing the reconstructed features with the original ones. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face limitations due to the constraints of device performance and the need to protect user privacy. In reality, graph data is often partitioned and distributed across different local clients, which leads to isolated client subgraphs. This partitioning results in incomplete feature aggregation, as the connections between subgraphs are missing, ultimately reducing the performance of anomaly detection models. To overcome these challenges, a federated graph anomaly detection approach based on disentangled representation learning is proposed. This method separates node features into two distinct components: intrinsic features and subgraph style features. By identifying outliers within the subgraph style features, a set of pseudo-nodes is generated and shared across the entire graph. These pseudo-nodes simulate connections between otherwise isolated subgraphs, which enables more comprehensive aggregation of intrinsic features from neighboring nodes. In addition, conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) are employed alongside contrastive learning strategies to alleviate class imbalance and achieve effective feature disentanglement. These techniques help ensure that anomalous nodes are detected more accurately despite the inherent challenges of federated graph systems. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse datasets provide compelling evidence of the proposed method's superior performance in federated graph anomaly detection, highlighting its ability to effectively handle incomplete graph structures while maintaining data privacy.
