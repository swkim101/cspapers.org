Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged as foundational backbones in the development of advanced recommender systems, offering enhanced capabilities through their extensive knowledge and reasoning. Existing llm-based recommender systems (RSs) often face challenges due to the significant differences between the linguistic semantics of pre-trained LLMs and the collaborative semantics essential for RSs. These systems use pre-trained linguistic semantics but learn collaborative semantics from scratch via the llm-Backbone. However, LLMs are not designed for recommendations, leading to inefficient collaborative learning, weak result correlations, and poor integration of traditional RS features. To address these challenges, we propose EAGER-LLM, a decoder-only llm-based generative recommendation framework that integrates endogenous and exogenous behavioral and semantic information in a non-intrusive manner. Specifically, we propose 1)dual-source knowledge-rich item indices that integrates indexing sequences for exogenous signals, enabling efficient link-wide processing; 2)non-invasive multiscale alignment reconstruction tasks guide the model toward a deeper understanding of both collaborative and semantic signals; 3)an annealing adapter designed to finely balance the model's recommendation performance with its comprehension capabilities. We demonstrate EAGER-LLM's effectiveness through rigorous testing on three public benchmarks.
