Road trajectory generation creates synthetic yet realistic trajectories to tackle data collection costs and privacy concerns. Existing methods generate a trajectory either segment-by-segment using sequence models or holistically in one step using diffusion models. Sequence-based models have good regularity and consistency (i.e., resemble the input trajectories) but lack diversity, while diffusion-based models enhance diversity but sacrifice regularity and consistency. To combine the merits of existing methods, we propose Seed, by bridging sequence and diffusion models for trajectory generation. In particular, Seed adopts a conditional diffusion structure, where a Transformer models the movement of each trajectory along the road segments, and conditioned on the Transformer's output, a diffusion model recovers the next road segment from random noise. The rationale is that the Transformer captures sequential patterns for regularity and consistency, while the diffusion model introduces diversity by recovering from noise. We use a trajectory reconstruction task to train Seed, and design a curriculum learning strategy to accelerate convergence. We compare Seed with 8 state-of-the-art trajectory generation methods on 3 datasets, and the results show that Seed improves the best-performing baseline by over 50%.
