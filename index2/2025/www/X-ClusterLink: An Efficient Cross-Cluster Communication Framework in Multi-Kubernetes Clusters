Kubernetes is widely adopted by enterprises to enhance service availability for applications such as web services and large-scale model training, due to its advantages in managing containerized applications. As service demands increase, a single Kubernetes cluster often becomes insufficient, leading to the trend of using multiple clusters to improve service scalability. However, achieving efficient cross-cluster communication poses significant challenges due to the need for low latency, high throughput, and strong robustness. Existing methods for cross-cluster communication either employ a centralized control plane, which becomes a communication bottleneck, or use numerous service-bound proxies, leading to increased management complexity and possibly compromised robustness in cross-cluster communication. To address the above challenges, we introduce X-ClusterLink, a framework designed for efficient cross-cluster communication in multi-Kubernetes clusters. X-ClusterLink first employs broker clusters to ensure low-latency cross-cluster synchronization. Then, it aggregates multiple containerized gateways to enhance throughput and leverages eXpress Data Path (XDP) for advanced packet processing, thereby accelerating traffic forwarding. Finally, it incorporates Bucket-Based Consistent ECMP to facilitate seamless failover and enhance robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that X-ClusterLink significantly improves cross-cluster communication efficiency, increasing cross-cluster forwarding bandwidth by 3.1 Ã— compared to existing solutions.
