With the rapid development of the Internet and the widespread use of social media, the proliferation of multimodal misinformation combining images and text poses serious risks to societal trust, individual well-being, and the integrity of AI models trained on such data. Recently, the automatic detection multimodal misinformation has become an essential area of research. However, traditional methods often rely on hierarchical neural networks that compress and fuse modalities, potentially overlooking deeper interactions between modalities and reducing model interpretability. In this paper, we present a novel Multimodal Taylor Series (MTS) network for detecting multimodal misinformation. The MTS network leverages Taylor series expansion to explicitly capture both low-order and high-order interactions between modalities, which also enhances interpretability by decomposing the model's processing into distinct terms. Additionally, the proposed MTS network avoids exponential parameter growth and maintains linear scalability, allowing the model to effectively capture complex cross-modal correlations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MTS network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.
