Instant Messaging is a popular means for daily communication, allowing users to send text and stickers. As the saying goes,"a picture is worth a thousand words", so developing an effective sticker retrieval technique is crucial for enhancing user experience. However, existing sticker retrieval methods rely on labeled data to interpret stickers, and general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to capture the unique semantics of stickers. Additionally, relevant-based sticker retrieval methods lack personalization, creating a gap between diverse user expectations and retrieval results. To address these, we propose the Personalized Sticker Retrieval with Vision-Language Model framework, namely PerSRV, structured into offline calculations and online processing modules. The online retrieval part follows the paradigm of relevant recall and personalized ranking, supported by the offline pre-calculation parts, which are sticker semantic understanding, utility evaluation and personalization modules. Firstly, for sticker-level semantic understanding, we supervised fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5-7B to generate human-like sticker semantics, complemented by textual content extracted from figures and historical interaction queries. Secondly, we investigate three crowd-sourcing metrics for sticker utility evaluation. Thirdly, we cluster style centroids based on users' historical interactions to achieve personal preference modeling. Finally, we evaluate our proposed PerSRV method on a public sticker retrieval dataset from WeChat, containing 543,098 candidates and 12,568 interactions. Experimental results show that PerSRV significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-modal sticker retrieval. Additionally, our fine-tuned VLM delivers notable improvements in sticker semantic understandings.
