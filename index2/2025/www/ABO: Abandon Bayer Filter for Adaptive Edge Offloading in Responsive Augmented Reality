Bayer-patterned color filter array (CFA) has been the go-to solution for color image sensors. In augmented reality (AR), although color interpolation (i.e., demosaicing) of pre-demosaic RAW images facilitates a user-friendly rendering, it creates no benefits in offloaded DNN analytics but increases the image channels by 3 times inducing higher transmission overheads. The potential optimization in frame preprocessing of DNN offloading is yet to be investigated. To that end, we propose ABO, an adaptive RAW frame offloading framework that parallelizes demosaicing with DNN computation. Its contributions are three-fold: First, we design a configurable tile-wise RAW image neural codec to compress frame sizes while sustaining downstream DNN accuracy under bandwidth constraints. Second, based on content-aware tiles-in-frame selection and runtime bandwidth estimation, a dynamic transmission controller adaptively calibrates codec configurations to maximize the DNN accuracy. Third, we further optimize the system pipelining to achieve lower end-to-end frame processing latency and higher throughput. Through extensive evaluations on a prototype platform, ABO consistently achieves 40% more frame processing throughput and 30% less end-to-end latency while improving the DNN accuracy by up to 15% than SOTA baselines. It also exhibits improved robustness against dim lighting and motion blur situations.
