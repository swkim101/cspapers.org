Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been widely investigated for solving long-standing data sparsity problem via knowledge sharing across domains. In this paper, we focus on the Multi-Modal Cross-Domain Recommendation (MMCDR) problem where different items have multi-modal information while few users are overlapped across domains. MMCDR is particularly challenging in two aspects: fully exploiting diverse multi-modal information within each domain and leveraging useful knowledge transfer across domains. However, previous methods fail to cluster items with similar characteristics while filtering out inherit noises within different modalities, hurdling the model performance. What is worse, conventional CDR models primarily rely on overlapped users for domain adaptation, making them ill-equipped to handle scenarios where the majority of users are non-overlapped. To fill this gap, we propose Joint Similarity Item Exploration and Overlapped User Guidance (SIEOUG) for solving the MMCDR problem. SIEOUG first proposes similarity item exploration module, which not only obtains pair-wise and group-wise item-item graph knowledge, but also reduces irrelevant noise for multi-modal modeling. Then SIEOUG proposes user-item collaborative filtering module to aggregate user/item embeddings with the attention mechanism for collaborative filtering. Finally SIEOUG proposes overlapped user guidance module with optimal user matching for knowledge sharing across domains. Our empirical study on Amazon dataset with several different tasks demonstrates that SIEOUG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models under the MMCDR setting.
