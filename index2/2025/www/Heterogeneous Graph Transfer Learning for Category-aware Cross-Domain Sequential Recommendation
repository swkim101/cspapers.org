Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) is proposed to alleviate the data sparsity issue while capturing users' sequential preferences. However, most existing methods do not explore the item transition patterns across different domains and can also not be applied to a multi-domain scenario.Moreover, previous methods rely on overlapping users as bridges to transfer knowledge, which struggles to capture the complex associations across domains without sufficient overlapping users. In this paper, we introduce item attributes into CDSR, and propose a heterogeneous graph transfer learning method to address these issues.Specifically, we construct a cross-domain heterogeneous graph to allow the association of user, item, and category nodes from different domains,and enhance the flexibility of the model by enabling message propagation between more nodes through edge expansion based on the semantic similarity and co-occurrence probability.In addition, we devise meta-paths from different perspectives for nodes at item, user and category levels to guide information aggregation, which can transfer knowledge across domains and reduce the reliance on the number of overlapping users.We further design attention modules to capture users' dynamic preferences from the item sequences they have interacted with in each domain, and explore the transition patterns within category sequences which reflect users' coarse-grained preferences.Finally, we perform knowledge transfer across different domains, and predict the most likely items that users will interact with in each domain. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets indicate that our HGTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in all cases.
