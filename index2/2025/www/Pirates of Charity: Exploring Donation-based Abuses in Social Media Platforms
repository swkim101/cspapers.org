With the widespread use of social media, organizations, and individuals use these platforms to raise funds and support causes. Unfortunately, this has led to the rise of scammers in soliciting fraudulent donations. In this study, we conduct a large-scale analysis of donation-based scams on social media platforms. More specifically, we studied profile creation and scam operation fraudulent donation solicitation on X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Telegram. By collecting data from 151,966 accounts and their 3,053,333 posts related to donations between March 2024 and May 2024, we identified 832 scammers using various techniques to deceive users into making fraudulent donations. Analyzing the fraud communication channels such as phone number, email, and external URL linked, we show that these scamming accounts perform various fraudulent donation schemes, including classic abuse such as fake fundraising website setup, crowdsourcing fundraising, and asking users to communicate via email, phone, and pay via various payment methods. Through collaboration with industry partners PayPal and cryptocurrency abuse database Chainabuse, we further validated the scams and measured the financial losses on these platforms. Our study highlights significant weaknesses in social media platforms' ability to protect users from fraudulent donations. Additionally, we recommended social media platforms, and financial services for taking proactive steps to block these fraudulent activities. Our study provides a foundation for the security community and researchers to automate detecting and mitigating fraudulent donation solicitation on social media platforms.
