The 21st century has already witnessed so many outbreaks with pandemic potential, including SARS (2002), H1N1 (2009), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014), Zika virus (2015), and the COVID-19 pandemic (2019). Using 60 million geotagged Sina Weibo tweets covering over 20 million active accounts, we investigate the collective emotional dynamics on social media in the most recent global pandemic, i.e., COVID-19. This research features two highlights: (1) It focuses on the Chinese population located in the initial epicenter of the pandemic. (2) It examines the initial year after the pandemic outbreak, a critical period where emotions were most intense due to the uncertainty and rapid developments related to the crisis. Using cross-disciplinary methods, we reveal a positive connection between online emotional resonance and geographic proximity, demonstrating a direct mapping between virtual network distances and physical spatial embedding. We propose a percolation-based index to measure the nationwide emotional resonance level with which we illustrate the significant economic impact of the global health issue. Finally, we identify a leader-follower pattern in emotional resonance fluctuations based on time-lag emotion correlations, revealing that less active regions play a crucial role in leading and responding to emotional changes. In the face of long COVID and emerging global health crises, our analysis elucidates how collective emotional resonance evolves, providing potential directions for online opinion interventions during global shocks.
