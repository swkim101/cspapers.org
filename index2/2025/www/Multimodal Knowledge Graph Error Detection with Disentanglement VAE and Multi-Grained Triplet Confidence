Multimodal knowledge graphs inevitably contain numerous errors due to the lack of human supervision in their automated construction and updating processes. These errors can significantly degrade the performance of downstream applications that rely on them. Existing researches on knowledge graph error detection primarily focus on leveraging graph structural and textual information to identify triplet errors in unimodal knowledge graphs. However, unlike unimodal knowledge graphs, multimodal knowledge graphs also suffer from mismatches between images and their corresponding entities, referred to as modality errors. These modality errors not only hinder the performance of downstream applications but also impede our effective utilization of the abundant complementary information provided by the visual modality for detecting triplet errors. To this end, we introduce a novel task of multimodal knowledge graph error detection (MKGED) in this paper, aiming at simultaneously identifying both modality errors and triplet errors. Given the lack of datasets for evaluating this task, we first establish two comprehensive MKGED datasets. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework, KGDMC, to address the MKGED task. Within KGDMC, we devise a disentanglement modality reconstruction (DMR) module for modality error detection. This module disentangles each original modality representation into two disjoint components: modality-specific representations and modality-invariant representations, leveraging the cross-modality reconstruction process to detect mismatched visual modalities. Additionally, for the triplet error detection, we propose a multi-grained triplet confidence (MTC) module, incorporating local triplet confidence, global structure confidence, and global path confidence, to collaboratively detect mismatched triplets. Extensive experiments on our constructed two datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.
