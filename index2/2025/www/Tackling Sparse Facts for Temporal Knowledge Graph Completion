Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) seeks to develop more comprehensive knowledge representations by addressing missing relationships and entities within temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), thereby enhancing reasoning and predictive capabilities in downstream tasks. Nonetheless, real-world knowl-edge—such as the progression of social network interactions and the unfolding of news events—is inherently dynamic, resulting in substantial sparsity issues in TKGs that profoundly impair the performance of TKGC models. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the A daptive N eighborhood E nhancement L ayer (ANEL), a novel module that can be effortlessly integrated into existing TKGC models to substantially elevate the representation quality of sparse entities. ANEL first derives initial entity embeddings through a base model and then uncovers concealed semantic relationships between entities via a latent relation module, enriching the explicit relationships within the knowledge graph. Furthermore, ANEL incorporates an adaptive latent information adjustment component, which dynamically calibrates the influence of latent information based on the entity’s relational structure: entities with fewer connections derive greater benefit from latent information, while entities with denser connections become less dependent on latent augmentation, ensuring precise and resilient representations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on four prominent benchmark datasets, and the results underscore the effectiveness and superiority of ANEL in TKGC tasks.
