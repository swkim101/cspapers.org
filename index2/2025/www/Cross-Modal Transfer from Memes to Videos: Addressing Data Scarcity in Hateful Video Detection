Detecting hate speech in online content is essential to ensuring safer digital spaces. While significant progress has been made in text and meme modalities, video-based hate speech detection remains under-explored, hindered by a lack of annotated datasets and the high cost of video annotation. This gap is particularly problematic given the growing reliance on large models, which demand substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, we leverage meme datasets as both a substitution and an augmentation strategy for training hateful video detection models. Our approach introduces a human-assisted reannotation pipeline to align meme dataset labels with video datasets, ensuring consistency with minimal labeling effort. Using two state-of-the-art vision-language models, we demonstrate that meme data can substitute for video data in resource-scarce scenarios and augment video datasets to achieve further performance gains. Our results consistently outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks, showcasing the potential of cross-modal transfer learning for advancing hateful video detection.
