The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol automates the issuance and renewal of secure socket layer certificates, simplifying the management of large-scale certificate deployments. To reduce the load on Certificate Authority (CA) servers, ACME employs a caching mechanism that stores domain validation (DV) results for 30 days. However, this mechanism allows attackers to reuse previously authorized results, potentially bypassing the DV process. In this paper, we introduce the ACME Authz Cache Attack, whereby an attacker can obtain fraudulent certificates without domain control. We demonstrate that even the prominent CA, Let's Encrypt, is vulnerable to this attack. To mitigate this, we propose ACME++, an enhanced protocol that binds the client's IP address and a unique identifier to the ACME account, ensuring secure authorization for each new client and effectively preventing the ACME Authz Cache Attack. Our implementation of ACME++ shows that it introduces little overhead to the CA server.
