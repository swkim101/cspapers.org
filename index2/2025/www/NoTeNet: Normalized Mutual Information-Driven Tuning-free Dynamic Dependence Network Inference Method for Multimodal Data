Dynamic Dependence Network (DDN) inference is crucial for understanding evolving relationships in multimodal time series web data, with broad applications in fields like medical and financial network analysis. The inherent dynamic nature, temporal continuity, and heterogeneous data sources in multimodal time series data pose three fundamental challenges: computational efficiency, prediction stability and robustness, and modality quality disparity. Previous methods, generally lacking utilization of multiple modalities, either struggle with computational efficiency due to the time-intensive manual hyperparameter tuning, or compromise prediction stability and robustness by neglecting temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a Normalized mutual information-driven Tuning-free Dynamic Dependence Network inference method for multimodal data, namely NoTeNet. NoTeNet provides a promising paradigm that can integrate two different data modalities to enhance prediction accuracy. It uses normalized mutual information transforms noisy auxiliary data into relationship matrices and employs a kernel function for smooth temporal estimation. Additionally, NoTeNet significantly reduces the need for manual hyperparameter adjustments, offering a tuning-free approach with theoretical guarantees. On various synthetic datasets and real-world data, NoTeNet demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and efficiency without the need for hyperparameter tuning, making it potential for a wide range of web data applications.
