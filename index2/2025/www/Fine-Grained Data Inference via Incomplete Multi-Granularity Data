Urban fine-grained data map inference, leveraging information from coarse-grained maps, has emerged as a significant area of research due to the growing complexity and data heterogeneity in urban environments. Existing methods have a priori assumption that a coarse-grained data map, one fixed-size granularity, transforms into a fine-grained data map, also one fixed-size granularity. However, in the actual scenarios, the collected coarse-grained data maps are often incomplete and have significantly distinct granularities in various urban areas, which results in incomplete heterogeneous data, i.e., multi-granularity data maps in terms of spatial information. Meanwhile, different granularity data maps are needed for various urban downstream tasks, which is a multi-task problem. To that end, this paper proposes a novel framework, a multi-granularity super-resolution data map inference framework (MGSR), designed to harness spatio-temporal information to transform incomplete coarse-grained multi-granularity data maps into fine-grained multi-granularity data maps. Specifically, we design a granularity alignment network to align multi-granularity information and address missing data on each granularity map by leveraging the other granularity maps with a well-designed self-supervised task. Then, we introduce a feature extraction network to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and extract features. Finally, we devise a recurrent super-resolution network with shared parameters to infer multi-granularity data maps. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets and demonstrate that MGSR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for multi-granularity urban data map inference, and reduces RMSE andMAE byupto40.1% and50.3%,respectively.
