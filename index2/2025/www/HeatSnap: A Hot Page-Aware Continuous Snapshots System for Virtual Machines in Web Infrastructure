Snapshot technology is crucial for data protection and system recovery in virtualized environments, particularly with the growing need for continuous snapshots to maintain the integrity of long-running web-based and distributed applications. However, traditional snapshot methods often suffer from performance bottlenecks, and inefficient storage usage. These challenges are closely tied to the way memory pages are accessed during VM execution, where memory access patterns show significant disparities between frequently accessed "hot" pages and less-used "cold" pages. In this paper, we introduce HeatSnap, a continuous snapshot system designed to address these issues by leveraging the uneven access frequencies of memory pages. HeatSnap distinguishes between intensive hot pages and dirty pages, applying specialized snapshotting and storage strategies to optimize the handling of both hot and cold memory regions. This approach aims to optimize snapshot efficiency, minimize performance impact on the VM, and decrease storage costs. Our implementation of HeatSnap on QEMU/KVM demonstrates significant improvements in VM performance loss, snapshot duration, and storage efficiency compared to existing methods, as evidenced by evaluations on common web and cloud-based workloads.
