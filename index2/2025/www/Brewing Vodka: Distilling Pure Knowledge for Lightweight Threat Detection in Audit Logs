Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are continuously evolving, leveraging their stealthiness and persistence to put increasing pressure on current provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This evolution exposes several critical issues: (1) The dense interaction between malicious and benign nodes within provenance graphs introduces neighbor noise, hindering effective detection; (2) The complex prediction mechanisms of existing APTs detection models lead to the insufficient utilization of prior knowledge embedded in the data; (3) The high computational cost makes detection impractical. Toaddress these challenges
