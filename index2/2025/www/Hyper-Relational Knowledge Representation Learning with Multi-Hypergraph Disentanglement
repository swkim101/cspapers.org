Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) extend the traditional triplet-based knowledge graph by adding qualifiers to the relationships, making HKGs particularly useful for tasks that require more profound understanding and inference from relationships between entities. However, existing hyper-relational knowledge representation learning methods (HKRL) focus on direct neighbourhood information of entities only by neglecting the relational similarity of the main triple in hyper-relational facts and the attribute details in the qualifiers. In addition, few works extract common and private information across multiple views to minimize noise and interference. This paper proposes a multi-hypergraph disentanglement method for HKRL to address the above issues. Specifically, we first construct four hypergraphs to mine and utilise the inherent structure information of HKGs, and then propose to extract common representations among hypergraphs and private representations within individual hypergraphs to mine the semantic information and the task-relevant information, respectively. Experiment results on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to SOTA methods in link prediction tasks on HKGs.
