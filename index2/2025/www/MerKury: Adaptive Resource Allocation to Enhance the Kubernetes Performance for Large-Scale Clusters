The advent of cloud computing has led to a dramatic increase in the deployment of hyper-scale, diverse workloads in containerized form on cloud infrastructures. This expansion necessitates the management of numerous large-scale clusters. However, Kubernetes (k8s), the industry standard for container orchestration, faces challenges with low scheduling throughput and high request latency in such environments. We identify resource contention among components co-located on the same master node as a primary bottle-neck. To address this, we introduce a lightweight framework designed to enhance the performance and scalability of Kubernetes clusters. Our approach adaptively allocates resources among co-located components, improving their overall performance. Implemented as a non-intrusive so-lution, our evaluations across various cluster scales show significant improvements, with a 7.3 Ã— increase in cluster scheduling throughput and a 37.3% reduction in request latency, surpassing the performance of vanilla Kubernetes and baseline resource allocation strategies.
