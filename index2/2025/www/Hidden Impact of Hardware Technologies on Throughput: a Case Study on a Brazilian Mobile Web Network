The Web has shifted towards a mobile-first ecosystem with tools, frameworks, and forums explicitly discussing and catering for the mobile users, both mobile apps and mobile web-pages. Unfortunately, much of the studies and designs are often based on analysis and findings from developed regions (e.g., N. America and Europe) or based on user-generated data (introducing bias). In this paper, we present one of the first studies to understand the interplay between hardware characteristics (e.g., cellular and mobile) on expected network and application level performance in Brazil (the largest developing region in S. America). We analyze more than 170 million measurement sessions collected from within the network of one of the largest Mobile Network Operators in Brazil. Our findings (1) illustrate limitations of existing crowdsourced measurements and inaccuracies in assumptions about adoption patterns and performance in the global south, (2) highlight the differences between recommendations made by standardization bodies and real world performance, (3) disclose a significant change pre- and post-pandemic, and (4) quantify the benefits of using both client side and network data for analysis.
