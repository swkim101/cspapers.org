Owing to the unprecedented capability in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have shown fantastic potential in developing next-generation sequential recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based sequential RSs mostly separate index generation from sequential recommendation, leading to insufficient integration between semantic information and collaborative information. On the other hand, the neglect of user-related information hinders LLM-based sequential RSs from exploiting high-order user-item interaction patterns. In this paper, we propose the End-to-End Dual Dynamic (ED2) recommender, the first LLM-based sequential RS which adopts dual dynamic index mechanism, targeting resolving the above limitations simultaneously. The dual dynamic index mechanism can not only assembly index generation and sequential recommendation into a unified LLM-backbone pipeline, but also make it practical for LLM-based sequential recommender to take advantage of user-related information. Specifically, to facilitate the LLM comprehension ability to dual dynamic index, we propose a multigrained token regulator which constructs alignment supervision based on LLMs semantic knowledge across multiple representation granularities. Moreover, the associated user collection data and a series of novel instruction tuning tasks are specially customized to capture the high-order user-item interaction patterns. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ED2, achieving an average improvement of 19.62% in Hit-Rate and 21.11% in NDCG.
