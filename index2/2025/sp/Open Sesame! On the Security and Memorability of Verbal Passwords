Despite extensive research on text passwords, the security and memorability of verbal passwords-spoken rather than typed-remain underexplored. Verbal passwords hold significant potential for scenarios where keyboard input is impractical (e.g., smart speakers, wearables, vehicles) or users have motor impairments that make typing difficult. Through two large-scale user studies, we assessed the viability of verbal passwords. In our first study (N = 2,085), freely chosen verbal passwords were found to have a limited guessing space, with 39.76% cracked within 109 guesses. However, in our second study (n = 600), applying word count and blocklist policies for verbal password creation significantly enhanced verbal password performance, achieving better memorability and security than traditional text passwords. Specifically, 65.6% of verbal password users (under the password creation policy using minimum word counts and a blocklist) successfully recalled their passwords in long-term tests, compared to 54.11% for text passwords. Additionally, verbal passwords with enforced policies exhibited a lower crack rate (6.5%) than text passwords (10.3%). These findings highlight verbal passwords as a practical and secure alternative for contexts where text passwords are infeasible, offering strong memorability with robust resistance to guessing attacks.
