The increasing integration of diverse co-processors and peripherals within mobile Arm System-on-Chips (SoCs) presents significant challenges for secure and efficient device I/O. Existing approaches relying on memory encryption introduce substantial performance and power overheads, which are exacerbated by the need for real-time data processing and strict power efficiency requirements in mobile platforms. These issues hinder the wider adoption of Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), which aims to provide robust security guarantees. To address these challenges, we present Portal, a secure and efficient device I/O interface for Arm CCA on mobile Arm SoCs. Portal achieves secure I/O through strict memory isolation without the need for memory encryption. By leveraging the memory isolation mechanism in Arm CCA, Portal enforces hardware-level access control, ensuring that only designated Realm virtual machines and peripherals can access the Portal-protected plaintext memory regions. This design eliminates the overhead associated with encryption, supports dynamic peripheral integration, and maintains robust security guarantees. The evaluation results demonstrate that Portal incurs a minimal one-time overhead of 9.8%, while enhancing scalability and power efficiency, making it a pivotal solution for fostering the adoption of the upcoming Arm CCA in mobile and resource-constrained environments.
