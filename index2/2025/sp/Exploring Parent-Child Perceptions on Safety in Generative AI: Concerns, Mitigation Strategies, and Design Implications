The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) among teenagers has led to significant misuse and safety concerns. To identify risks and understand parental controls challenges, we conducted a content analysis on Reddit and interviewed 20 participants (seven teenagers and 13 parents). Our study reveals a significant gap in parental awareness of the extensive ways children use GAI, such as interacting with character-based chatbots for emotional support or engaging in virtual relationships. Parents and children report differing perceptions of risks associated with GAI. Parents primarily express concerns about data collection, misinformation, and exposure to inappropriate content. In contrast, teenagers are more concerned about becoming addicted to virtual relationships with GAI, the potential misuse of GAI to spread harmful content in social groups, and the invasion of privacy due to unauthorized use of their personal data in GAI applications. The absence of parental control features on GAI platforms forces parents to rely on system-built controls, manually check histories, share accounts, and engage in active mediation. Despite these efforts, parents struggle to grasp the full spectrum of GAI-related risks and to perform effective real-time monitoring, mediation, and education. We provide design recommendations to improve parent-child communication and enhance the safety of GAI use.
