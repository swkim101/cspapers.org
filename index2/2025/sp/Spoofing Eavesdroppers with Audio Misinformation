Wireless eavesdropping on phone conversations has become a major security and safety concern, especially with advancements toward 5G and beyond featuring higher frequencies and higher sensing resolution. As demonstrated recently, attackers can remotely detect even micron-scale acoustic vibrations emanating from a smartphone's earpiece via off-the-shelf millimeter-wave radar for audio information eavesdropping, all without the victim ever noticing. Here, we present a new architecture, MiSINFO, that not only thwarts such attacks but also enables the victim to counter-attack by spoofing of eavesdroppers with audio misinformation. With emerging attacks targeting the physical medium, i.e., acoustic signals, which cannot be protected by digital encryption and are the weakest segment of the communication chain, MiSINFO aims to systematically modify the eavesdroppers' fundamental sensing observations, concealing native signals while encoding alternate synthetic data. MiSINFO incorporates a low-profile, reconfigurable metasurface and double-inference principles to dynamically generate artificial audio-vibration signatures, injecting deceptive misinformation. We design, implement, and experimentally evaluate MiSINFO. Our results reveal that eavesdroppers detect none of the original words emitted by the speaker, while the injected misinformation is reconstructed with a low average word error rate of 2.29%. Our work represents the first such eavesdropping countermeasure which not only prevents attackers from accurately decoding the true signal but also uses a false signal to fool them into believing that they have succeeded. This approach transforms defensive measures from merely reactive to proactively deceptive, giving the defender an advantage and the capability to delude attackers into trusting false information.
