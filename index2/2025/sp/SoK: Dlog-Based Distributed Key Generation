Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocols are fundamental components of threshold cryptography, enabling key generation in a trustless manner for a range of crypto-graphic operations such as threshold encryption and signing. Of particular widespread use are DKG protocols for discrete-logarithm based cryptosystems. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present a comprehensive analysis of existing DKG protocols in the discrete-logarithm setting, with the goal of identifying cryptographic techniques and design principles that facilitate the development of secure and resilient protocols. To offer a structured overview of the literature, we adopt a modular approach and classify DKG protocols based on their underlying network assumption and cryptographic tools. These two factors determine how DKG protocols manage secret sharing and reach consensus as their essential building blocks. We also highlight various insights and suggest future research directions that could drive further advancements in this area.
