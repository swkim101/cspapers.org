Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a robust framework for privacy-preserving data releases and has been successfully applied in high-profile cases, such as the 2020 US Census. However, in organizational settings, the use of DP remains largely confined to isolated data releases. This approach restricts the potential of DP to serve as a framework for comprehensive privacy risk management at an organizational level. Although one might expect that the cumulative privacy risk of isolated releases could be assessed using DP's compositional property, in practice, individual DP guarantees are frequently tailored to specific releases, making it difficult to reason about their interaction or combined impact. At the same time, less tailored DP guarantees, which compose more easily, also offer only limited insight because they lead to excessively large privacy budgets that convey limited meaning. To address these limitations, we present DPolicy, a system designed to manage cumulative privacy risks across multiple data releases using DP. Unlike traditional approaches that treat each release in isolation or rely on a single (global) DP guarantee, our system employs a flexible framework that considers multiple DP guarantees simultaneously, reflecting the diverse contexts and scopes typical of real-world DP deployments. DPolicy introduces a high-level policy language to formalize privacy guarantees, making traditionally implicit assumptions on scopes and contexts explicit. By deriving the DP guarantees required to enforce complex privacy semantics from these high-level policies, DPolicy enables fine-grained privacy risk management on an organizational scale. We implement and evaluate DPolicy, demonstrating how it mitigates privacy risks that can emerge without comprehensive, organization-wide privacy risk management.
