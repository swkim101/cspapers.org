This paper provides a systematic exploration of Control Flow Integrity (CFI) and Control Flow Attestation (CFA) mechanisms, examining their differences and relationships. It addresses crucial questions about the goals, assumptions, features, and design spaces of CFI and CFA, including their potential coexistence on the same platform. Through a comprehensive review of existing defenses, this paper positions CFI and CFA within the broader landscape of runtime defenses, critically evaluating their strengths, limitations, and trade-offs. The findings emphasize the importance of further research to bridge the gaps in CFI and CFA and thus advance the field of runtime defenses.
