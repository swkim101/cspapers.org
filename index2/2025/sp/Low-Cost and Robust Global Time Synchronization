Numerous vital applications depend on accurately synchronized time, and disruptions can yield severe consequences in terms of safety and security. Yet, establishing cost-efficient and robust synchronization across geographically distributed devices is challenging. Many solutions for global time synchronization require placing trust in a single entity or system, for example in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (G NSSes) or leased infrastructure providers, constituting a single point of failure and often incurring high costs. An alternative, cost-effective solution is to run time synchronization over the Internet. However, this approach faces challenges in achieving (i) precise time synchronization, (ii) robustness to failing, misconfigured, or compromised nodes, and (iii) robustness to congestion-related issues such as volumetric DDoS attacks. Existing proposals mostly attempt to solve challenges (i) and (ii), but none provide robustness against congestion and volumetric DDoS. We address the challenges identified in previous work with Everdeen. Everdeen minimizes costs by running on existing Internet infrastructure and avoids relying on any single en-tity by enabling nodes to mutually synchronize time. The core innovation of Everdeen is its weighted neighbor-based (WNB) synchronization mode, where participants synchronize exclusively with their direct neighbors. Our evaluation shows that Everdeen provides better time synchronization quality at lower communication overhead compared to prior work. It is also considerably more robust against failing, misconfigured, or compromised hosts. Most importantly, we experimentally demonstrate that time synchronization traffic protected with Everdeen is unaffected by network congestion, including vol-umetric DDoS attacks.
