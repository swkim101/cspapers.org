Mobile apps are known to distribute different versions across geographic regions to accommodate local regulations and market preferences. While prior research has examined metadata-level differences such as permissions and privacy policies, there lacks systematic investigation into code-level geographic variations that may impact security. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of geo-feature differences (GFDs) in Android apps at the code implementation level. We develop Freelens, a novel framework that overcomes key technical challenges including code obfuscation and analysis scalability to identify and characterize security-relevant variations across regions. Using Freelens, we conducted a large-scale study of 21,120 Android apps distributed across ten countries with diverse levels of Internet freedom. Our findings reveal that GFDs are widespread, with significant variations in advertising, data handling, and authentication mechanisms. These differences frequently compromise security baselines and introduce disparities in privacy protections across regions. The study highlights a rising trend in GFD prevalence, emphasizing the urgency for harmonized privacy and security standards. Based on our empirical findings, we also provide actionable insights for developers, platform providers, and regulators to ensure equitable user protections.
