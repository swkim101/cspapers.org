We put forth a new paradigm for secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the preprocessing model, where a feasible one-time setup can enable a lifetime of efficient online secure computations. Our protocols match the security guarantees and low costs of the cheapest category of MPC solutions, namely 3-party protocols (3PC) secure against a single malicious party, with the qualitative advantages that one party communicates data sublinear in the circuit size, and can go offline after its initial messages. This “2+ 1“-party structure can alternatively be instantiated between 2 parties with the aid of an (untrusted) dealer. Within such existing protocols, we provide comparable online performance while improving the storage and offline dealer-to-party communication requirements by more than 3 orders of magnitude. At the technical level, we build on the Fully Linear Interactive Oracle Proof (FLIOP)-based protocol design of Boyle et al. (CRYPTO 2021). We provide an extensive assortment of algorithmic and implementation-level optimizations, design efficient distributed proofs of well-formedness of complex FLIOP correlations, and make them circuit-independent. We implement and benchmark our end-to-end system against the state of the art in the 2+1 regime, a dealer-aided variant of SPDZ for Boolean circuits. We additionally extend our techniques to the $(n+1)$ party setting, where a dealer aids general dishonest-majority MPC, and provide a variant of the protocol which further achieves security with “identifiable abort.”
