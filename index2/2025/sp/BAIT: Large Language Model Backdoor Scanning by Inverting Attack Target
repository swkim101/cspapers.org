Recent literature has shown that LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious attackers inject a secret token sequence (i.e., trigger) into training prompts and enforce their responses to include a specific target sequence. Unlike discriminative NLP models, which have a finite output space (e.g., those in sentiment analysis), LLMs are generative models, and their output space grows exponentially with the length of response, thereby posing significant challenges to existing backdoor detection techniques, such as trigger inversion. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the LLM backdoor learning process under specific assumptions, revealing that the autoregressive training paradigm in causal language models inherently induces strong causal relationships among tokens in backdoor targets. We hence develop a novel LLM backdoor scanning technique, BAIT (Large Language Model Backdoor ScAnning by Inverting Attack Target). Instead of inverting back-door triggers like in existing scanning techniques for non-LLMs, BAIT determines if a model is backdoored by inverting back-door targets, leveraging the exceptionally strong causal relations among target tokens. BAIT substantially reduces the search space and effectively identifies backdoors without requiring any prior knowledge about triggers or targets. The search-based nature also enables BAIT to scan LLMs with only the black-box access. Evaluations on 153 LLMs with 8 architectures across 6 distinct attack types demonstrate that our method outperforms 5 baselines. Its superior performance allows us to rank at the top of the leaderboard in the LLM round of the TrojAI competition (a multi-year, multi-round backdoor scanning competition).
