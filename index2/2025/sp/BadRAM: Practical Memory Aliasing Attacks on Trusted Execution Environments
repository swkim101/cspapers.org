The growing adoption of cloud computing raises pressing concerns about trust and data privacy. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been proposed as promising solutions that implement strong access control and transparent memory encryption within the CPU. While initial TEEs, like Intel SGX, were constrained to small isolated memory regions, the trend is now to protect full virtual machines, e.g., with AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, and Arm CCA. In this paper, we challenge the trust assumptions underlying scaled-up memory encryption and show that an attacker with brief physical access to the embedded SPD chip can cause aliasing in the physical address space, circumventing CPU access control mechanisms. We devise a practical, low-cost setup to create aliases in DDR4 and DDR5 memory modules, breaking the newly introduced integrity guarantees of AMD SEV-SNP. This includes the ability to manipulate memory mappings and corrupt or replay ciphertext, culminating in a devastating end-to-end attack that compromises SEV-SNP's attestation feature. Furthermore, we investigate the issue for other TEEs, demonstrating fine-grained, noiseless write-pattern leakage for classic Intel SGX, while finding that Scalable SGX and TDX employ dedicated alias detection, preventing our attacks at present. In conclusion, our findings dismantle security guarantees in the SEV-SNP ecosystem, necessitating AMD firmware patches, and nuance DRAM trust assumptions for scalable TEE designs.
