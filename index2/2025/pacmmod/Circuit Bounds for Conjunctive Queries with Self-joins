In this paper, we study circuit size bounds for Conjunctive Queries (CQs) under different semiring semantics. Recent work established tight bounds for self-join-free CQs over the tropical semiring, among other results [16]. Here, we extend these results in two main directions. First, we prove a lower bound for any self-join-free CQ over the Boolean semiring by extending Razborov and Alon-Boppana's classic lower bound result for the k-clique problem [1, 38]. Second, we characterize the circuit complexity of CQs with self-joins by relating them to appropriate self-join free CQs. Interestingly, such correspondence crucially depends on the underlying semiring. To achieve this result, we present a novel technique of investigating the circuit complexity of a CQ with self-joins through the lens of endomorphisms.
