Stream processing enables real-time data analysis. Recent stream processing engines (SPEs) execute stream processing in a distributed manner for real-time analysis of massive amounts of data produced by IoT devices and sensors. It has been widely adopted in various applications that support critical decision making. To explain the results of stream processing, ensuring provenance is indispensable. Provenance clarifies the relationship between input data and output data in the processing. With provenance, we can understand what input data contributed to the output. Existing frameworks for providing provenance for stream processing generate provenance or additional information to construct provenance at runtime. However, these approaches impose substantial overhead in ordinary stream processing. In this paper, we propose a new framework, named LPStream, for fine-grained lazy provenance. LPStream is the first framework to support lazy provenance for stream processing. In the ordinary execution mode, LPStream executes stream processing with checkpointing but without provenance generation. If provenance is necessary for some target output tuples, it replays the processing from an appropriate checkpoint and generates the provenance for the target tuple. We explain the design and implementation of LPStream and evaluate its performance by comparing LPStream with stream processing without provenance and with eager provenance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.
