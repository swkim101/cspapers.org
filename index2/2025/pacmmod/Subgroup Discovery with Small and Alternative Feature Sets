Subgroup-discovery methods find interesting regions in a dataset. In this article, we analyze two constraint types to enhance the interpretability of subgroups: First, we make subgroup descriptions small by limiting the number of features used. Second, we propose the novel problem of finding alternative subgroup descriptions, which cover a similar set of data objects as a given subgroup but use different features. We describe how to integrate both constraint types into heuristic subgroup-discovery methods as well as a novel Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulation, which enables a solver-based search for subgroups. Further, we prove NP-hardness of optimization with either constraint type. Finally, we evaluate unconstrained and constrained subgroup discovery with 27 binary-classification datasets. We observe that heuristic search methods often yield high-quality subgroups fast, even with constraints.
