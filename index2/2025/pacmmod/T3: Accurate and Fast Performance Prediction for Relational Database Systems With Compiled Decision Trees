Query performance prediction is used for scheduling, resource scaling, tenant placement, and various other use-cases. Here, the main goal is to estimate the execution time of a query without running it. To be effective, predictors need to be both accurate and fast. In contrast, neural networks that were used in recent work deliver very accurate predictions but suffer from high latency. In this work, we propose the Tuple Time Tree (T3), a new model that is both accurate and fast. It is orders of magnitude faster than comparable methods and has competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, T3 works for new database instances without re-training because it generalizes across database instances. We achieve T3's speed by relying on a low-latency decision tree model that is compiled to native machine code. We maintain high accuracy with two novel techniques: pipeline-based query plan representation and tuple-centric prediction targets. In our pipeline-based query plan representation, T3 decomposes query plans into pipelines. Then, T3 predicts the execution time of each pipeline individually, instead of the whole query in one step. With tuple-centric prediction targets, T3 predicts the expected time it takes to push a single tuple through a pipeline. It then multiplies this predicted value by the input cardinality of the pipeline to estimate its execution time. As a result, T3 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a low-latency decision tree model.
