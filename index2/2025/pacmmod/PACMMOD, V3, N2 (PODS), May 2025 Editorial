We are excited to announce the third issue dedicated to the Principles of Database Systems (PODS) research track of the Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD) journal. In its current form, the journal hosts both a SIGMOD and a PODS research track. The PODS research track aims to provide a solid scientific foundation for methods, techniques, and solutions to the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. More specifically, articles in the PODS track of PACMMOD present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management. Such articles may be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that merit further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or conducting a rigorous analysis of widely used and/or recently developed industry artifacts.
