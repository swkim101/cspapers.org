 There is a proliferation of applications requiring the management of large-scale, evolving graphs under workloads with intensive graph updates and lookups. Driven by this challenge, we introduce
 Poly-LSM
 , a high-performance key-value storage engine for graphs with the following novel techniques: (1)
 Poly-LSM
 is embedded with a new design of graph-oriented LSM-tree structure that features a hybrid storage model for concisely and effectively storing graph data. (2)
 Poly-LSM
 utilizes an adaptive mechanism to handle edge insertions and deletions on graphs with optimized I/O efficiency. (3)
 Poly-LSM
 exploits the skewness of graph data to encode the key-value entries. Building upon this foundation, we further implement
 Aster
 , a robust and versatile graph database that supports Gremlin query language facilitating various graph applications. In our experiments, we compared
 Aster
 against several mainstream real-world graph databases. The results demonstrate that
 Aster
 outperforms all baseline graph databases, especially on large-scale graphs. Notably, on the billion-scale Twitter graph dataset,
 Aster
 achieves up to 17x throughput improvement compared to the best-performing baseline graph system.
