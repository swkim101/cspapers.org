Multiple-query optimization (MQO) seeks to reduce redundant work across query batches. While MQO offers opportunities for dramatic performance improvements, the problem is NP-hard, limiting the sizes of problems that can be solved on generic hardware. We propose to leverage specialized hardware solvers for optimization, such as Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA), to scale up MQO to problem sizes formerly out of reach. We present a novel incremental processing approach that combines classical computation with DA acceleration. By efficiently partitioning MQO problems into sets of partial problems, and by applying a dynamic search steering strategy that reapplies initially discarded information to incrementally process individual problems, our method overcomes capacity limitations, and scales to extremely large MQO instances (up to νm1000 queries). A thorough and comprehensive empirical evaluation finds our method substantially outperforms existing approaches. Our generalisable framework lays the ground for other database use-cases on quantum-inspired hardware, and bridges towards future quantum accelerators.
