Recent studies have made it possible to integrate learning techniques into database systems for practical utilization. In particular, the state-of-the-art studies hook the conventional query optimizer to explore multiple execution plan candidates, then choose the optimal one with a learned model. This framework simplifies the integration of learning techniques into the database system. However, these methods still have room for improvement due to their limited plan exploration space and ineffective learning from execution plans. In this work, we propose Athena, an effective learning-based framework of query optimizer enhancer. It consists of three key components: (i) an order-centric plan explorer, (ii) a Tree-Mamba plan comparator and (iii) a time-weighted loss function. We implement Athena on top of the open-source database PostgreSQL and demonstrate its superiority via extensive experiments. Specifically, We achieve 1.75x, 1.95x, 5.69x, and 2.74x speedups over the vanilla PostgreSQL on the JOB, STATS-CEB, TPC-DS, and DSB benchmarks, respectively. Athena is 1.74x, 1.87x, 1.66x, and 2.28x faster than the state-of-the-art competitor Lero on these benchmarks. Additionally, Athena is open-sourced and it can be easily adapted to other relational database systems as all these proposed techniques in Athena are generic.
