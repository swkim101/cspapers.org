We propose Partition Dimensions Across (PDX), a data layout for vectors (e.g., embeddings) that, similar to PAX [6], stores multiple vectors in one block, using a vertical layout for the dimensions (Figure 1). PDX accelerates exact and approximate similarity search thanks to its dimension-by-dimension search strategy that operates on multiple-vectors-at-a-time in tight loops. It beats SIMD-optimized distance kernels on standard horizontal vector storage (avg 40% faster), only relying on scalar code that gets auto-vectorized. We combined the PDX layout with recent dimension-pruning algorithms ADSampling [19] and BSA [52] that accelerate approximate vector search. We found that these algorithms on the horizontal vector layout can lose to SIMD-optimized linear scans, even if they are SIMD-optimized. However, when used on PDX, their benefit is restored to 2-7x. We find that search on PDX is especially fast if a limited number of dimensions has to be scanned fully, which is what the dimension-pruning approaches do. We finally introduce PDX-BOND, an even more flexible dimension-pruning strategy, with good performance on exact search and reasonable performance on approximate search. Unlike previous pruning algorithms, it can work on vector data ''as-is'' without preprocessing; making it attractive for vector databases with frequent updates.
