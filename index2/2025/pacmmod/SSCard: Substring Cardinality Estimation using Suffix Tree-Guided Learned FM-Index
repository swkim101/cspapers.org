Accurate cardinality estimation of substring queries, which are commonly expressed using the SQL LIKE predicate, is crucial for query optimization in database systems. While both rule-based methods and machine learning-based methods have been developed to optimize various aspects of cardinality estimation, their absence of error bounds may result in substantial estimation errors, leading to suboptimal execution plans. In this paper, we propose SSCard, a novel SubString Cardinality estimator that leverages a space-efficient FM-Index into flexible database applications. SSCard first extends the FM-Index to support multiple strings naturally, and then organizes the FM-index using a pruned suffix tree. The suffix tree structure enables precise cardinality estimation for short patterns and achieves high compression via a pushup operation, especially on a large alphabet with skewed character distributions. Furthermore, SSCard incorporates a spline interpolation method with an error bound to balance space usage and estimation accuracy. Additional innovations include a bidirectional estimation algorithm and incremental update strategies. Extensive experimental results in five real-life datasets show that SSCard outperforms both traditional methods and recent learning-based methods, which achieves an average reduction of 20% in the average q-error, 80% in the maximum q-error, and 50% in the construction time, compared with second-best approaches.
