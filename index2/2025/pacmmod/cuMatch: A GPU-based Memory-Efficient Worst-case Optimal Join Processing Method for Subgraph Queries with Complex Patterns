Subgraph queries are widely used but face significant challenges due to complex patterns such as negative and optional edges. While worst-case optimal joins have proven effective for subgraph queries with regular patterns, no method has been proposed that can process queries involving complex patterns in a single multi-way join. Existing CPU-based and GPU-based methods experience intermediate data explosion when processing complex patterns following regular patterns. In addition, GPU-based methods struggle with issues of wasted GPU memory and redundant computation. In this paper, we propose cuMatch, a GPU-based unified worst-case optimal join processing method for subgraph queries. It avoids intermediate data explosions by processing even complex pattern queries in a single multi-way join. It is also memory-efficient and fast, due to a new partitioning format, scheduling method, and task fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that cuMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by orders of magnitude, without out-of-memory errors.
