We propose the concept of Intra-Query Runtime Elasticity (IQRE) for cloud-native data analysis. IQRE enables a cloud-native OLAP engine to dynamically adjust a query's Degree of Parallelism (DOP) during execution. This capability allows users to utilize cloud computing resources more cost-effectively. We present Accordion, the first IQRE query engine. Accordion can adjust the parallelism of a query at any point during query execution without pausing data processing. It features a user-friendly interface and an auto-tuner backed by a "what-if" service to allow users to adjust the DOP according to their query latency constraints. The design of Accordion follows the execution model in Presto, an open-source distributed SQL query engine developed at Meta. We present the implementation of Accordion and demonstrate its ease of use, showcasing how it enables users to minimize compute resource consumption while meeting their query time constraints.
