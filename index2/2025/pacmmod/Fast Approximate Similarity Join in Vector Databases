Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly in embedding models, have enabled the effective representation of various data types such as text, images, and audio as vectors, thereby facilitating semantic analysis. A large number of massive vector datasets are maintained in vector databases. Approximate similarity join is a core operation in vector database systems that joins two datasets, and outputs all pairs of vectors from the two datasets, if the distance between such a pair of two vectors is no more than a specified value. Existing approaches for similarity join are selection-based such that they treat each data point in a dataset as an individual query point to search data points by an approximate range query in another dataset. Such methods do not fully capitalize on the inherent properties of the join operation itself. In this paper, we propose a new join algorithm, SimJoin. Our join algorithm aims at boosting join processing efficiency by leveraging relationships between partial join results (e.g., join windows). In brief, our join algorithm accelerates the join processing to process a join window by utilizing the join windows from the processed data points. Then, we discuss optimizing join window order to minimize join costs. In addition, we discuss how to support k-similarity join, and how to maintain proximity graph index based on k-similarity join. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the significant performance superiority of our proposed algorithms over existing state-of-the-art methods.
