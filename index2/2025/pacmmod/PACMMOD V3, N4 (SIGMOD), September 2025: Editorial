The Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD) is concerned with the principles, algorithms, techniques, systems, and applications of database management systems, data management technology, and science and engineering of data. It includes articles reporting cutting-edge data management, data engineering, and data science research. The 2026 SIGMOD conference cycle begins with this issue of PACMMOD - the fourth issue of Volume 3 of PACMMOD. We thank our predecessors, Azza Abouzied and Joe Hellerstein, for their work on the previous issues, and their guidance as we began the process for SIGMOD 2026.
