Given a vector x ∈ ℝn induced by a turnstile stream S, a non-negative function G: ℝ → ℝ, a perfect G-sampler outputs an index i with probability G(xi)/Σj∈[n] + 1/poly(n). Jayaram and Woodruff (FOCS 2018) introduced a perfect Lp-sampler, where G(z)=|z|p, for p∈(0,2]. In this paper, we solve this problem for p>2 by a sampling-and-rejection method. Our algorithm runs in n1-2/p • polylog (n) bits of space, which is tight up to polylogarithmic factors in n. Our algorithm also provides a (1+ε)-approximation to the sampled item xi with high probability using an additional ε-2 n1-2/p • polylog (n) bits of space. Interestingly, we show our techniques can be generalized to perfect polynomial samplers on turnstile streams, which is a class of functions that is not scale-invariant, in contrast to the existing perfect Lp samplers. We also achieve perfect samplers for the logarithmic function G(z)=log(1+|z|) and the cap function G(z)=min(T,|z|p). Finally, we give an application of our results to the problem of norm/moment estimation for a subset Q of coordinates of a vector, revealed only after the data stream is processed, e.g., when the set Q represents a range query, or the set n\Q represents a collection of entities who wish for their information to be expunged from the dataset.
