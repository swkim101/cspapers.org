Efficient graph processing is critical in various modern applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and large-scale data mining. Traditional single-FPGA systems struggle to handle the increasing size and complexity of real-world graphs due to limitations in memory and computational resources. Existing multi-FPGA solutions face significant challenges, including high communication overhead caused by irregular data transfer patterns and workload imbalances stemming from skewed graph distributions. These inefficiencies hinder scalability and performance, highlighting a critical research gap. To address these issues, we introduce Clementi, an efficient multi-FPGA graph processing framework that features customized fine-grained pipelines for computation and cross-FPGA communication. Clementi uniquely integrates an accurate performance model for execution time prediction, enabling a novel scheduling method that balances workload distribution and minimizes communication overhead by overlapping communication and computation stages. Experimental results demonstrate that Clementi achieves speedups of up to 8.75Ã— compared to state-of-the-art multi-FPGA designs, indicating significant improvements in processing efficiency as the number of FPGAs increases. This near-linear scalability underscores the framework' s potential to enhance graph processing capabilities in practical applications.
