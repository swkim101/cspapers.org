 In this paper, we study a problem of index maintenance on evolving graphs for effective resistance computation. Unlike an existing matrices-based index, we show that the index can be efficiently maintained by directly preserving samples of random walks and loop-erased walks. This approach not only enables efficient storage and rapid query response but also supports effective maintenance. We propose a novel approach to convert edge updates into

 node updates. Building upon this, we present two new update algorithms for random walk and loop-erased walk samples respectively. Both algorithms update samples without requiring complete resampling, ensuring accuracy and high efficiency. A particularly challenging and innovative technique involves updating loop-erased walks. Here we develop a novel and powerful cycle decomposition technique for loop-erased walks, enabling us to update samples at the cycle level rather than the node level, significantly enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, we show that both of our methods achieve an Ã• (1) time complexity per edge update in real-world graphs under a mild assumption. We conduct extensive experiments using 10 large real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our approaches. The results show that our best algorithm can be up to two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline methods.
