Community detection in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) poses significant challenges due to the diversity of entity types and the complexity of their interrelations. While traditional algorithms may perform adequately in some scenarios, many struggle with the high memory usage and computational demands of large-scale HINs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, SCAR, which efficiently uncovers community structures in HINs without requiring network materialization. SCAR leverages insights from meta-paths to interpret multi-relational data through compact vertex-based sketches, significantly reducing computational overhead and materialization overhead. We propose a sketch-based technique for estimating changes in modularity, improving both the precision and speed in community detection. Our extensive evaluations on diverse real-world datasets provide detailed comparative metrics, demonstrating that SCAR outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, including Gdy, Louvain, Leiden, Infomap, Walktrap, and Networkit, in execution time and memory consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy. Overall, SCAR offers a robust and scalable solution for revealing community structures in large HINs, with applications across various domains, including social networks, academic collaboration networks, and e-commerce platforms.
