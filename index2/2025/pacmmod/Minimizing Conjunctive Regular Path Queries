We study the minimization problem for Conjunctive Regular Path Queries (CRPQs) and unions of CRPQs (UCRPQs). This is the problem of checking, given a query and a number k, whether the query is equivalent to one of size at most k. For CRPQs we consider the size to be the number of atoms, and for UCRPQs the maximum number of atoms in a CRPQ therein, motivated by the fact that the number of atoms has a leading influence on the cost of query evaluation. We show that the minimization problem is decidable, both for CRPQs and UCRPQs. We provide a 2ExpSpace upper-bound for CRPQ minimization, based on a brute-force enumeration algorithm, and an ExpSpace lower-bound. For UCRPQs, we show that the problem is ExpSpace-complete, having thus the same complexity as the classical containment problem. The upper bound is obtained by defining and computing a notion of maximal under-approximation. Moreover, we show that for UCRPQs using the so-called simple regular expressions consisting of concatenations of expressions of the form a+ or a1 + ⋅⋅⋅ + ak, the minimization problem becomes "PiP2"-complete, again matching the complexity of containment.
