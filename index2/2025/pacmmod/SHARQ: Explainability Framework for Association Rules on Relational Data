Association rules are an important technique for gaining insights over large relational datasets consisting of tuples of elements (i.e. attribute-value pairs). However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data elements with respect to the rules in which they appear. This paper develops a measure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on Shapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification). As is the case with many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the score is exponential in the number of elements. To that end, we present an efficient framework for computing the exact SHARQ value of a single element whose running time is practically linear in the number of rules. Going one step further, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes the cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements. Based on the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use-cases for association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance. Extensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 67 instances of mined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach.
