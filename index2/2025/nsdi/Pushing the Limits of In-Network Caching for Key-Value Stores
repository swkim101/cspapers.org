We present OrbitCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, OrbitCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement an OrbitCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that OrbitCache can balance highly skewed workloads and is robust to various system conditions.
