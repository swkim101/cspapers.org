Motivated by the challenges in last-mile delivery operations, we consider a natural dynamic staffing problem in which a decision-maker sequentially hires staff over a finite time horizon to meet an unknown target demand at the end. The decision-maker also receives a sequence of predictions about the demand that become increasingly more accurate over time. Consequently, the decision-maker prefers to delay hiring decisions to avoid overstaffing. However, workers' availability decreases over time, resulting in a fundamental trade-off between securing staff early (thus risking overstaffing) versus hiring later based on more accurate predictions (but risking understaffing). We study the above problem when predictions take the form of uncertainty intervals that encompass the true demand. The goal of the decision-maker is to minimize the staffing imbalance cost at the end of the horizon against any sequence of prediction intervals being chosen by an adversary. Our main result is the characterization of a simple and computationally efficient online algorithm that obtains the optimal worst-case imbalance cost; said differently, it is minimax optimal. At a high level, our algorithm relies on identifying a restricted adversary against which we can characterize the minimax optimal cost by solving a certain offline LP. We then show how to emulate the LP solution in a general instance to obtain a cost bounded above by the LP's objective. Besides the base model of staffing for one target demand, We show how to extend our LP-based emulator minimax optimal policy to various generalizations with (i) multiple target demands, (ii) costly hiring and releasing with budgets, and (iii) jointly minimizing the cost of hiring and over-/under-staffing.
