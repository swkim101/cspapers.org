We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets with stochastic payoffs. Our main focus is on comparing Bayesian learners and no-regret learners who compete in markets and identifying the conditions under which each approach is more effective. Surprisingly, we find that low regret is not sufficient for survival: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\log T)$ but still vanish when competing against a Bayesian with a finite prior and any positive prior probability on the correct model. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust. Motivated by the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a balanced strategy for utilizing Bayesian updates that improves robustness and adaptability to distribution shifts, providing a step toward a best-of-both-worlds learning approach. The method is general, efficient, and easy to implement. Finally, we formally establish the relationship between the notions of survival and market dominance studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories. More broadly, our work contributes to the understanding of dynamics with heterogeneous types of learning agents and their impact on markets.
