Stackelberg equilibria, as functions of the players' payoffs, can inversely reveal information about the players' incentives. In this paper, we study to what extent one can learn about the leader's incentives by actively querying the leader's optimal commitments against strategically designed followers. We show that, by using polynomially many queries and operations, one can learn a payoff function that is strategically equivalent to the leader's, in the sense that: 1) it preserves the leader's preference over almost all strategy profiles; and 2) it preserves the set of all possible (strong) Stackelberg equilibria the leader may engage in, considering all possible follower types. As an application, we show that the information acquired by our algorithm is sufficient for a follower to induce the best possible Stackelberg equilibrium by imitating a different follower type. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that this is possible without knowing the leader's payoffs beforehand.
