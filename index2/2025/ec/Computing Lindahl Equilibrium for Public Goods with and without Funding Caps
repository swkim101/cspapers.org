Lindahl equilibrium is a solution concept for allocating a fixed budget across several divisible public goods. It always lies in the core, meaning that the equilibrium allocation satisfies desirable stability and proportional fairness properties. We consider a model where agents have separable linear utility functions over the public goods, and the output assigns to each good an amount of spending, summing to at most the available budget. In the uncapped setting, each of the public goods can absorb any amount of funding. In this case, it is known that Lindahl equilibrium is equivalent to maximizing Nash social welfare, and this allocation can be computed by a public-goods variant of the proportional response dynamics. We introduce a new convex programming formulation for computing this solution and show that it is related to Nash welfare maximization through duality and reformulation. We then show that the proportional response dynamics is equivalent to running mirror descent on our new formulation, thereby providing a new and immediate proof of the convergence guarantee for the dynamics. Our new formulation has similarities to Shmyrev's convex program for Fisher market equilibrium. In the capped setting, each public good has an upper bound on the amount of funding it can receive. In this setting, existence of Lindahl equilibrium was only known via fixed-point arguments. The existence of an efficient algorithm computing one has been a long-standing open question. We prove that our new convex program continues to work when the cap constraints are added, and its optimal solutions are Lindahl equilibria. Thus, we establish that Lindahl equilibrium can be efficiently computed in the capped setting. Our result also implies that approximately core-stable allocations can be efficiently computed for the class of separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC) utilities.
