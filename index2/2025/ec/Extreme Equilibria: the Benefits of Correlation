. We study whether a given Nash equilibrium can be improved within the set of correlated equilibria for arbitrary objectives. Our main contribution is a sharp characterization: in a generic game, a Nash equilibrium is an extreme point of the set of correlated equilibria if and only if at most two agents randomize. Consequently, any su ffi ciently mixed Nash equilibrium involving at least three randomizing agents can always be improved by correlating actions or switching to a less random equilibrium, regardless of the underlying objective. We show that even if one focuses on objectives that depend on payo ff s, excess randomness in equilibrium implies improvability. We extend our analysis to symmetric games, incomplete information games, and coarse correlated equilibria, revealing a fundamental tension between the randomness in Nash equilibria and their optimality.
