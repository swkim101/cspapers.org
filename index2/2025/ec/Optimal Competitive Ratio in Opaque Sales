Opaque sales are a selling mechanism in which a seller offers multiple products but the buyer does not know which specific product they will receive until after the purchase. This mechanism is widely used in the tourism industry, such as staycation packages with undisclosed hotel options or tours to different destinations, and in e-commerce through mystery boxes. In many such settings, buyers operate under a unit demand constraint, meaning they derive benefit from only one item despite multiple options being available. In this paper, we formulate and solve a multi-item mechanism design problem for opaque sales. Our goal is to identify a distribution-free mechanism that maximizes the competitive ratio, defined as the ratio between the revenue generated by the mechanism and the maximum revenue attainable with full knowledge of the buyer's valuations. Despite the problem's infinite dimensionality, we show that the optimal mechanism admits a semi-analytical form, characterized by the solution of an auxiliary convex optimization problem whose size scales linearly with the number of items. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism can be equivalently implemented through a menu of infinite level-access lotteries, where the buyer pays an amount to access a randomly assigned subset of items, with higher payments granting access to a larger selection. We then analyze the impact of menu size limitations on the competitive ratio and conclude with a prototypical example illustrating our approach.
