We generalize the problem of online submodular welfare maximization to incorporate various stochastic elements that have gained significant attention in recent years. We show that a non-adaptive Greedy algorithm, which is oblivious to the realization of these stochastic elements, achieves the best possible competitive ratio among all polynomial-time algorithms, including adaptive ones, unless NP=RP. This result holds even when the objective function is not submodular but instead satisfies the weaker submodular order property. Our results unify and strengthen existing competitive ratio bounds across well-studied settings and diverse arrival models, showing that, in general, adaptivity to stochastic elements offers no advantage in terms of competitive ratio. To establish these results, we introduce a technique that lifts known results from the deterministic setting to the generalized stochastic setting. The technique has broad applicability, enabling us to show that, in certain special cases, non-adaptive Greedy-like algorithms outperform the Greedy algorithm and achieve the optimal competitive ratio. We also apply the technique in reverse to derive new upper bounds on the performance of Greedy-like algorithms in deterministic settings by leveraging upper bounds on the performance of non-adaptive algorithms in stochastic settings.
