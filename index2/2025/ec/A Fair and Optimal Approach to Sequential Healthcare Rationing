The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the urgent need for fair and effective allocation of scarce resources, from hospital beds to vaccine distribution. In this paper, we study a healthcare rationing problem where identical units of a resource are divided into different categories, and agents are assigned based on priority rankings. % We first introduce a simple and efficient algorithm that satisfies four fundamental axioms critical to practical applications: eligible compliance, non-wastefulness, respect for priorities, and maximum cardinality. This new algorithm is not only conceptually simpler but also computationally faster than the Reverse Rejecting rules proposed in recent work. % We then extend our analysis to a more general sequential setting, where categories can be processed both sequentially and simultaneously. For this broader framework, we introduce a novel algorithm that preserves the four fundamental axioms while achieving additional desirable properties that existing rules fail to satisfy. Furthermore, we prove that when a strict precedence order over categories is imposed, this rule is the unique mechanism that satisfies these properties.
