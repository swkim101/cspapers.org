In the well-studied metric distortion problem in social choice, we have voters and candidates located in a shared metric space, and the objective is to design a voting rule that selects a candidate with minimal total distance to the voters. However, the voting rule has limited information about the distances in the metric, such as each voter's ordinal rankings of the candidates in order of distances. The central question is whether we can design rules that, for any election and underlying metric space, select a candidate whose total cost deviates from the optimal by only a small factor, referred to as the distortion. A long line of work resolved the optimal distortion of deterministic rules, and recent work resolved the optimal distortion of randomized (weighted) tournament rules, which only use the aggregate preferences between pairs of candidates. In both cases, simple rules achieve the optimal distortion of $3$. Can we achieve the best of both worlds: a deterministic tournament rule matching the lower bound of $3$? Prior to our work, the best rules have distortion $2 + \sqrt{5} \approx 4.2361$. In this work, we establish a lower bound of $3.1128$ on the distortion of any deterministic tournament rule, even when there are only 5 candidates, and improve the upper bound with a novel rule guaranteeing distortion $3.9312$. We then generalize tournament rules to the class of $k$-tournament rules which obtain the aggregate preferences between $k$-tuples of candidates. We show that there is a family of deterministic $k$-tournament rules that achieves distortion approaching $3$ as $k$ grows. Finally, we show that even with $k = 3$, a randomized $k$-tournament rule can achieve distortion less than $3$, which had been a longstanding barrier even for the larger class of ranked voting rules.
