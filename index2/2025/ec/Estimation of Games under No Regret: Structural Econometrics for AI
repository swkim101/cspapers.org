We develop a method to recover primitives from data generated by artificial intelligence (AI) agents in strategic environments such as online marketplaces and auctions. Building on the design of leading online learning AIs, we assume that agents minimize their regret. Under asymptotic no regret, we show that the time average of play converges to the set of Bayes coarse correlated equilibrium (BCCE) predictions. Our econometric procedure is based on BCCE restrictions and convergence rates of regret-minimizing AIs. We apply the method to pricing data in a digital marketplace for used smartphones. We estimate sellers' cost distributions and find lower markups than in centralized platforms. Full paper available at: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4269273
