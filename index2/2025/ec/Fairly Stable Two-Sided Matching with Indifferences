Stability has been a foundational criterion for two-sided matching. When agents on one side have weak preferences involving indifferences, the seminal work of Kesten and Ünver [26] proposes the Fractional Deferred Acceptance (FDA) algorithm for computing a fractional matching that satisfies (ex ante) stability along with a fairness criterion that ensures no discrimination among (equally-preferred) agents on one side. We show that their algorithm can actually fail to terminate, refuting their claim of (polynomial-time) termination. Using substantially new algorithmic ideas, we develop an algorithm, Doubly-Fractional Deferred Acceptance Via Strongly Connected Components (DFDA-SCC), which can handle agents on both sides exhibiting indifferences and, in polynomial time, compute a fractional matching satisfying ex ante stability and no ex ante discrimination among agents on both sides
