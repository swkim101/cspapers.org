We present an algorithm for obtaining ϵ-minimax solutions of statistical decision problems. We are interested in problems where i) the statistician is allowed to choose randomly among I decision rules, and ii) the statistical model may have an infinite dimensional parameter space. The minimax solution of these problems admits a convex programming representation over the (I - 1)-simplex, and the algorithm suggested herein to obtain an ϵ-approximation of the minimax solution is a version of mirror subgradient descent, initialized with uniform weights and stopped after a finite number of iterations. The resulting iterative procedure is known in the computer science literature as the hedge algorithm (a particular case of the multiplicative weights update method) and it is used in algorithmic game theory as a practical tool to find approximate solutions of two-person zero-sum games. We apply the suggested algorithm to different minimax problems in the econometrics literature. An empirical application to the problem of optimally selecting sites to maximize the external validity of an experimental policy evaluation illustrates the usefulness of the suggested procedure.
