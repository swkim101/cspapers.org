In the ever-evolving blockchain ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have seen significant growth, which, however, has also brought challenges of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). DEXs offer a decentralized platform for cryptocurrency trading. Such trading mechanisms primarily include Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) and batch auctions. We first examine MEV in batch auctions. By treating assets and transactions as goods and traders within a pure exchange market, batch auctions can be formulated as a linear market, allowing exchange rates and trading outcomes in a batch to be derived from the prices and allocation in its market equilibrium. This design ensures fairness and efficiency from the perspective of economics. Despite the general belief that batch auctions are less vulnerable to MEV due to uniform pricing and order independence of transactions, we highlight that the block builder's current ability to rearrange the batch content is sufficient to extract MEV in batch auctions, where the strategic behavior is a novel market equilibrium manipulation. We further explore the computation and show that: When the transactions in a batch form a Fisher market, an optimal attack can be computed in polynomial time. When the transactions form a general Arrow-Debreu market, under the Unique Games Conjecture, obtaining a 50.01%-approximation is NP-hard. In addition, we show it is NP-hard to compute a strategy that obtains even 0.01% of optimal MEV in CFMMs when the fraction of swap fee is any constant larger than zero (e.g., 0.3%).
