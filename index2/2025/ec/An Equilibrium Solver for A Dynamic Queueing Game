Consider the dispatch of ridesharing trips to drivers lining up at airports, or the allocation of deceased donor organs to patients in transplant wait lists. In such dynamic queueing games, heterogeneity in short-lived items combined with agents' discretion to decline induce substantial cherrypicking, resulting in high rates of unfulfilled trips and discarded organs. Existing research typically focuses on easy-to-analyze dispatch policies, sometimes making fluid assumptions for tractability. In this work, we introduce a best-response-based solver for general dispatch policies with closed-form updates, which computes agents' equilibrium acceptance, entry, and reneging strategies as functions of queue length and queue position. For a family of dispatch policies where dispatch probabilities are queue-length independent and items are offered monotonically down the queue, we prove that our solver converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium in a finite number of iterations and that such an equilibrium always exists. For more general dispatch policies, we characterize their equilibria, and the solver converges in simulation despite the lack of theoretical guarantees. Via extensive numerical results, we show that the solver recovers known equilibria for policies that can be analyzed theoretically, and provides insights (beyond what can be gleaned from previous analysis) into more complex policies better suited for practice.
