Credit ratings are essential in capital markets, serving as a bridge to reduce information asymmetry between firms and investors. However, the prevalent issuer-pay model creates a potential conflict of interest: since CRAs are paid by the issuers, they may have incentives to inflate ratings to retain clients, compromising the credibility of ratings and threatening market stability. This concern is often linked to the observed discrepancies between solicited ratings (for paying firms) and unsolicited ratings (for non-paying firms), as documented in empirical studies. This paper develops a theoretical model that captures the strategic interactions among CRAs, firms, and investors, and derives the following results. First, we characterize the CRA's optimal policy and the resulting market response. The CRA carefully designs the rating policy so that, despite investors being aware of the incentive to inflate solicited ratings, they continue to rely on the CRA's assessments. While CRAs penalize unsolicited firms with lower ratings, only high-quality firms choose to solicit ratings, leading to a separating equilibrium. As a result, average ratings increase with firm quality along the equilibrium path, consistent with empirical evidence and suggesting that the observed rating gap primarily reflects underlying quality differences. Second, our comparative statics explore how equilibrium outcomes respond to changes in investor willingness, rating fees, and firms' investment needs. When investors are more willing to invest or when rating fees rise, CRAs loosen rating standards to boost profits. In contrast, when firms are more eager for funding, CRA revenues rise but standards remain strict. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to incorporate endogenous rating fees and heterogeneous firm values, confirming the robustness of our results. Finally, empirical analysis using Standard & Poor's credit rating data provides support for the model's predictions. Our analysis offers several managerial implications. Even when CRAs act strategically to maximize profit, the gap between solicited and unsolicited ratings mainly reflects firm quality differences due to adverse selection. While solicited ratings may be inflated, they still convey meaningful quality signals, preserving the informativeness of ratings and preventing market collapse. However, such manipulation is difficult to detect empirically, underscoring the need for stronger regulatory oversight, especially during periods of market optimism, when investors are more willing to invest or firms rely less on external financing.
