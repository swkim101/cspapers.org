Background and motivation. Online platforms frequently deploy nudges—short prompts or design elements intended to influence user behavior—in a wide range of contexts, from increasing engagement with digital products to encouraging healthier choices. Despite their widespread use, key challenges remain in optimizing nudges over time, particularly when users' responsiveness is unknown and repeated exposure to the same nudge leads to diminishing returns. This work introduces a novel framework to address these challenges, focusing on the interplay between unknown user responses, the cost of generating or refreshing nudges, and fatigue effects from repeated exposure to the same prompt.
