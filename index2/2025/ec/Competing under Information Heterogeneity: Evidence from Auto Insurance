This paper studies competition under information heterogeneity in selection markets and examines the impact of public information regulations aimed at reducing information asymmetries between competing firms. We develop a novel model and introduce new empirical strategies to analyze imperfect competition in markets where firms have heterogeneous information about consumers, vary in cost structures, and offer differentiated products. Using data from the Italian auto insurance market, we find substantial differences in the precision of risk ratings across insurers, and those with less accurate risk-rating algorithms tend to have more efficient cost structures. We evaluate the equilibrium effects of a public information policy where insurers' risk estimates are aggregated and made public through a centralized bureau. This policy significantly reduces prices by increasing competition, which in turn boosts consumer surplus by 15.7%, nearly matching the gains observed under the efficiency benchmark, where firms have full knowledge of consumers' true risk levels. We also observe interesting distributional effects. The centralized risk bureau primarily benefits low-risk consumers, in contrast to the scenario motivated by privacy regulations, where all firms adopt the least-advanced information technology. Lastly, the centralized bureau policy improves the matching efficiency between insurers and insurees, reducing average costs by 12 euros per contract.
