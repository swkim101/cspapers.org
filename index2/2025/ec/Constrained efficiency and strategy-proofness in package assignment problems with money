We consider a package assignment problem with money, in which a finite set M of objects is allocated to agents. Each agent receives a package of objects and makes a payment, and has preferences over pairs consisting of a package and a payment. These preferences are not necessarily quasi-linear. The admissible set of object allocations is chosen by the planner to pursue specific objectives in conjunction with the rule. A rule satisfies constrained efficiency if no allocation—whose object allocation is admissible under the rule—Pareto dominates the allocation selected by the rule. We study the compatibility between constraints on admissible object allocations and desirable properties of rules, and characterize the rules that satisfy both. Our first main result shows that: If a rule satisfies constrained efficiency, no wastage, equal treatment of equals, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy, then the set of admissible object allocations under the rule must be bundling unit-demand for some partition of M, and must satisfy no wastage and anonymity. Second, building on the results of [Demange and Gale, 1985], [Morimoto and Serizawa, 2015], and [Wakabayashi et al., 2025], we show that: A rule satisfies constrained efficiency, no wastage, equal treatment of equals, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy if and only if its admissible set of object allocations is bundling unit-demand for some partition of M, satisfies no wastage and anonymity, and the rule is a bundling minimum price Walrasian rule.
