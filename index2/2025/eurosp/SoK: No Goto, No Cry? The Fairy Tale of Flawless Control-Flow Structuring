Decompilers play a crucial role in the detailed analysis of malware or firmware, particularly because control-flow structuring allows the recovery of high-level code that is more readable to human analysts. Despite the ongoing debate over their usage of gotos to work around constraints during control-flow structuring, pattern-matching approaches remain prevalent among both commercial and open-source decompilers. With the emergence of pattern-independent restructuring techniques, various attempts have been made to overcome readability limitations, especially concerning the use of gotos. However, despite these advances, recent approaches often fail to thoroughly address several inherent challenges of control-flow structuring, thereby affecting output quality or practicality.In this paper, we systematize the intrinsic challenges of control-flow structuring that every approach must address. In addition, we review existing methods, comparing them, while highlighting both their advantages and limitations with respect to these challenges. Specifically, we emphasize the practicability issues of current pattern-independent restructuring techniques and discuss whether and how future methods might overcome them. Finally, we explore the theoretical potential to mitigate some of these challenges by suggesting methodology ideas for various aspects of control-flow structuring. Overall, this paper enables other researchers to make informed decisions when developing or enhancing control-flow structuring methods, thereby preventing negative side-effects arising from the interdependence of challenges.
