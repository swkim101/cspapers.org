Cybersquatting refers to the practice where attackers register a domain name similar to a legitimate one to confuse users for illegal gains. With the growth of the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystem, there are indications that cybersquatting tactics have evolved from targeting domain names to NFTs. This paper presents the first in-depth measurement study of NFT cybersquatting. By analyzing over 220K NFT collections with over 150M NFT tokens, we have identified 8,019 cybersquatting NFT collections targeting 654 popular NFT projects. Through systematic analysis, we discover and characterize seven distinct squatting tactics employed by scammers. We further conduct a comprehensive measurement study of these cybersquatting NFT collections, examining their metadata, associated digital asset content, and social media status. Our analysis reveals that these NFT cybersquatting activities have resulted in a significant financial impact, with over 670K victims affected by these scams, leading to a total financial exploitation of $59.26 million. Our findings demonstrate the urgency to identify and prevent NFT squatting abuses.
