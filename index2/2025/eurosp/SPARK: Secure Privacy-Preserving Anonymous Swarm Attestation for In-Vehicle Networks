In recent years, vehicles have evolved into cyberphysical autonomous systems that rely on sensor data from various sources within the vehicle. With the emergence of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, the scope of the collaborative functionality in vehicles is now expanding to the inter-vehicular level. To support these modern capabilities, the complexity of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the In-Vehicle Network (IVN) architecture is rapidly increasing. As a result, IVNs are now swarms of devices that communicate safety-critical data. Unfortunately, current vehicular networks lack security, opening the path to numerous cyberattacks. A typical solution for verifying the integrity of multiple devices is swarm attestation. However, in a typical IVN setting, only the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has access to the legitimate configuration of the ECUs and does not want to disclose this information due to intellectual property and security concerns. Therefore, state- of-the-art swarm attestation schemes, which do not provide privacy guarantees, are unsuitable for IVNs.This paper proposes Secure Privacy Preserving Anonymous Swarm Attestation for In-Vehicle Networks (SPARK), which builds upon a novel group signature scheme to enable privacy-preserving, anonymous, and traceable swarm attestation of IVNs. We validate SPARK through a proof-of-concept implementation using a standardized hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) and representative hardware platforms. The results demonstrate the real-world applicability of SPARK.
