The emergence of softwarized network devices, like programmable switches and smart NICs, has brought about new and advanced network functionalities. Intelligent decision-making becomes possible at line rate by offloading network functionality from the network control-plane to the programmable data-plane. In this paper, we offload fine-grained Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection to the data-plane. The state-of-the-art in this regard, mainly aims to embed Machine Learning (ML) models into the data-plane without compromising on inference accuracy. Besides accuracy, we must consider multiple other factors, like traffic feature availability and false positive rates. To that end, we propose O’MINE: ONE MODEL IS NOT ENOUGH, a novel collaborative detection mechanism comprising lightweight ML models. This maximises the detection accuracy while keeping the false positive rate (FPR) low. We use three state-of-the-art datasets to evaluate the O’MINE algorithm and its ML models. Our results show that O’MINE can detect DDoS attacks with high accuracy (≈98% and ≈96% with full and scarce training data, respectively) and low FPR (≈0.22% and ≈0.72% with full and scarce training data, respectively), outperforming the state-of-the-art. Lastly, O’MINE only consumes a few device resources (≈6% of LUT and ≈4% of FF) on the Xlinx Alevo U250 FPGA we have used for inference at line rate.
