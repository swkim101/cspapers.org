Lattices are the basis of most NIST-recommended post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes, required to thwart the threat posed by the eventual construction of large-scale quantum computers. At the same time, lattices enable more advanced cryptographic constructions, such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which is increasingly used for privacy-preserving applications like machine learning. This work delves into the efficiency and trade-off assessment of polynomial multiplication algorithms and their applications to PQC, FHE, and other schemes. Such algorithms are at the core of lattice-based cryptography and may become a critical bottleneck when deploying PQC-and FHE-based solutions on resource-constrained devices. We propose a formal analysis of so-called incompleteness in the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). Although this concept is not new, our systematization shows how to optimize polynomial multiplication in quotient rings, considering factors such as the degree of incompleteness, the associated prime moduli, constraints of the target platform, and target security level. Besides efficiency, we formally show that the systematized family of incomplete NTT variants supports a larger set of prime moduli. This property enables new trade-offs for algorithms like the FIPS-approved module-lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (ML-KEM) and faster amortized bootstrapping in FHE schemes. Our results include shorter ciphertexts in ML-KEM with only a modest hit in performance and a 6 – 42% performance boost in the NTT computation of a state-of-the-art FHE solution.
