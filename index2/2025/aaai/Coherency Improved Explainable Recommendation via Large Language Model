Explainable recommender systems are designed to elucidate the explanation behind each recommendation, enabling users to comprehend the underlying logic. Previous works perform rating prediction and explanation generation in a multi-task manner. However, these works suffer from incoherence between predicted ratings and explanations. To address the issue, we propose a novel framework that employs a large language model (LLM) to generate a rating, transforms it into a rating vector, and finally generates an explanation based on the rating vector and user-item information. Moreover, we propose utilizing publicly available LLMs and pre-trained sentiment analysis models to automatically evaluate the coherence without human annotations. Extensive experimental results on three datasets of explainable recommendation show that the proposed framework is effective, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with improvements of 7.3% in explainability and 4.4% in text quality.
