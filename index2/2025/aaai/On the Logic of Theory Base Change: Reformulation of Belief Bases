In the logic of theory change, the AGM model has acquired the status of a standard model. However, the AGM model does not seem adequate for some contexts and application domains. This inspired many researchers to propose extensions and generalizations to AGM. Among these extensions, one of the most important are belief bases. Belief bases have more expressivity than belief sets, as explicit and implicit beliefs have different statuses. In this paper, we present reformulation, a belief change operation that allows us to reformulate a belief base making some particular sentences explicit without modifying the consequences of the belief base. We provide a constructive method and its axiomatic characterization.
