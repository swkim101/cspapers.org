As virtual experiences grow in popularity, the demand for realistic, personalized, and animatable human avatars increases. Traditional methods, relying on fixed templates, often produce costly avatars that lack expressiveness and realism. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Controllable Avatars generation via disentangled invertible
networks (CtrlAvatar), a real-time framework for generating lifelike and customizable avatars.
CtrlAvatar uses disentangled invertible networks to separate the deformation process into implicit body geometry and explicit texture components. This approach eliminates the need for repeated occupancy reconstruction, enabling detailed and coherent animations. The body geometry component ensures anatomical accuracy, while the texture component allows for complex, artifact-free clothing customization. This architecture ensures smooth integration between body movements and surface details.
By optimizing transformations with position-varying offsets from the avatarâ€™s initial Linear Blend Skinning vertices, CtrlAvatar achieves flexible, natural deformations that adapt to various scenarios. Extensive experiments show that CtrlAvatar outperforms other methods in quality, diversity, controllability, and cost-efficiency, marking a significant advancement in avatar generation.
