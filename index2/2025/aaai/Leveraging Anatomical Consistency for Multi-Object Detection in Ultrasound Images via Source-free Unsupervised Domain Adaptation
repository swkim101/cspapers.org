Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation aims to eliminate domain shifts when data from the source domain and annotation from the target domain are not available.
The multi-object detection tasks in medical image analysis are constrained by patient privacy and extremely huge annotation consumption. Hence, Source-free UDA is considered a more practical approach for eliminating the domain gap. However, relevant research that explores this topic is a dearth.
In this paper, we design an Anatomy-aware Alignment Teacher-Student learning method using topological consistency based on a mean-teacher framework for Source-free UDA in multiple medical object detection named AATS, including Unsupervised Structure Refinement (USR) and Graph-aware Morphology Alignment (GMA).
To match the student and teacher at the low-level and visual features, we propose the USR via an unsupervised clustering algorithm to group organs in ultrasound images.
Based on USR, we obtain a graph with organ relations on the teacher branch.
While in the student branch, we acquire visual features to construct graphical space and optimize the model with graph propagation. 
Finally, to match the student and teacher, GMA is designed to align the teacher and student based on both topology and morphology information that is derived from prior medical knowledge.
Four groups of adaptation experiments were conducted on available medical datasets, and the outcomes demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also provides substantial advantages over existing methods.
