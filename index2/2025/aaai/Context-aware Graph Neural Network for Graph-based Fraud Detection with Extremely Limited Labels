Graph-based fraud detection is crucial in identifying illegal activities in social networks, finance, and other sectors. Despite recent progress in this area, most of current researches typically require a large amount of annotated data to demonstrate its benefits. In practice, obtaining sufficient high-quality annotated data is challenging, limiting the effectiveness of model training. Therefore, leveraging extremely limited label information is crucial to enhance model performance. We propose a context-aware graph neural network (CGNN) to address this. CGNN performs category semantic decomposition on the contextual neighbor features of the center node to enrich the category semantics. In the neighbor message aggregation stage, the denoising attention mechanism enables the center node to adaptively aggregate heterophilic and homophilic information from neighbors. Particularly for unlabeled data, feature augmentation within the category subspace and consistency regularization driven by entropy minimization ensure that such data can further enhance model performance under explicit semantic guidance. We demonstrate on four real-world datasets that CGNN significantly outperforms other baseline methods with extremely limited labels.
