We build the first machine-learning-based algorithm selection tool for hardware verification described in the Btor2 format. In addition to hardware verifiers, our tool also selects from a set of software verifiers to solve a given Btor2 instance, enabled by a Btor2-to-C translator. We propose two embeddings for a Btor2 instance, Bag of Keywords and Bit-Width Aggregation. Pairwise classifiers are applied for algorithm selection. Upon evaluation, our tool Btor2-Select solves 30.0% more instances and reduces PAR-2 by 50.2%, compared to the PDR implementation in the HWMCC'20 winner model checker AVR. Measured by the Shapley values, the software verifiers collectively contributed 27.2% to Btor2-Select's performance.
