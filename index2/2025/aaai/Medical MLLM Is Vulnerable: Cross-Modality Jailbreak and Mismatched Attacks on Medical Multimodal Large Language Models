Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored; however, the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain inadequately addressed. This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, focusing on their deployment in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are crucial for addressing complex medical challenges. We introduce and redefine two attack types: mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack), by integrating existing clinical data with atypical natural phenomena. Using the comprehensive 3MAD dataset that we developed, which spans a diverse range of medical imaging modalities and adverse medical scenarios, we performed an in-depth analysis and proposed the MCM optimization method. This approach significantly improves the attack success rate against MedMLLMs. Our evaluations, which include white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer (black-box) attacks on four other SOTA models, reveal that even MedMLLMs designed with advanced security mechanisms remain vulnerable to breaches. This study highlights the critical need for robust security measures to enhance the safety and reliability of open-source MedMLLMs, especially in light of the potential impact of jailbreak attacks and other malicious exploits in clinical applications.
