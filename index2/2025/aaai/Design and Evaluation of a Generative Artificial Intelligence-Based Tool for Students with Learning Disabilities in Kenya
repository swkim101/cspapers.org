Students with learning disabilities (LDs) face significant challenges in key academic areas such as reading comprehension, cognitive organization, self-expression, mathematics, and handwriting. These difficulties increase their susceptibility to discrimination and mental health related issues. Although existing studies have primarily focused on AIâ€™s diagnostic capabilities, there is limited research examining how Generative AI (GenAI) can be utilized to produce measurable learning outcomes and enhance learning experiences for students with LDs. Moreover, GenAI is increasingly gaining prominence in educational settings. Therefore, the relationship between GenAI tools, LDs, and instructional methods needs to be further examined. This research aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for helping design and implement tools specifically tailored to the unique needs of students with LDs. A prototype based on this framework will be implemented in selected educational settings to assess its effectiveness in improving learning outcomes and providing targeted support to students with LDs. The prototype will provide mobile phone integration to ensure scalability and enhance educational accessibility. The expected findings will contribute to the promotion of more inclusive learning environments for students with LDs.
