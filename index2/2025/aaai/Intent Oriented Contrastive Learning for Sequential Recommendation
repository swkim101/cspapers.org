Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item a user is likely to interact with based on their historical interaction sequence. Capturing user intent is crucial in this process, as each interaction is typically driven by specific intentions (e.g., buying skincare products for skin maintenance, buying makeup for cosmetic purposes, etc.). However, users often have multiple, dynamically changing intents, making it challenging for models to accurately learn these intents when relying on the entire historical sequence as input. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Intent Oriented Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (IOCLRec). This framework begins by segmenting usersâ€™ sequential behaviors into multiple subsequences, which represent the coarse-grained intents of users at different points in their interaction history. These subsequences form the basis for the three contrastive learning modules within IOCLRec. The fine-grained intent contrastive learning module uncovers detailed intent representations, while the single-intent and multi-intent contrastive learning modules utilize intent-oriented data augmentation operators to capture the diverse intents of users. These three modules work synergistically, driving comprehensive performance optimization in intricate sequential recommendation scenarios. Our method has been extensively evaluated on four public datasets, demonstrating superior effectiveness.
