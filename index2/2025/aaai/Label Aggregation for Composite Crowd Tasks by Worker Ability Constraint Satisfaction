Quality control is a crucial issue of label data collection by crowdsourcing. Typically, aggregation methods to redundant crowd labels are proposed for estimating high-quality labels from noisy crowd labels. Most of the existing works concentrate on the label aggregation for Single Crowd Tasks (SCTs) which have a single object set with homogeneous question types. However, it is useful for a requester to combine multiple relevant but different crowd tasks into a Composite Crowd Task (CCT) which have heterogeneous question types and (or) multiple object sets for diverse purposes. Instead of the label aggregation on each crowd task respectively, label aggregation methods by bridging multiple SCTs in CCTs can potentially improve the label quality of all tasks. In this paper, we propose a general label aggregation approach for such CCTs by worker ability constraint satisfaction and relaxed optimization. We collected real crowd datasets of CCTs with diverse task settings based on heterogeneous question types, including categorization, pairwise preference comparisons, and pairwise similarity comparisons. The results demonstrate that our approach can effectively bridge the worker information of CCTs to improve the quality of aggregated labels and outperforms the baselines proposed for SCTs.
