Model adaptation tackles the distribution shift problem with a pre-trained model instead of raw data, which has become a popular paradigm due to its great privacy protection. Existing methods always assume adapting to a clean target domain, overlooking the security risks of unlabeled samples. This paper for the first time explores the potential trojan attacks on model adaptation launched by well-designed poisoning target data. Concretely, we provide two trigger patterns with two poisoning strategies for different prior knowledge owned by attackers. These attacks achieve a high success rate while maintaining the normal performance on clean samples in the test stage. To defend against such backdoor injection, we propose a plug-and-play method named DiffAdapt, which can be seamlessly integrated with existing adaptation algorithms. Experiments across commonly used benchmarks and adaptation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffAdapt. We hope this work will shed light on the safety of transfer learning with unlabeled data.
