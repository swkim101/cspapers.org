Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to reconstruct a 3D voxel representation occupied by semantic classes based on ordinary inputs such as 2D RGB images, depth maps, or point clouds. Given the cost-effective and promising applications in autonomous driving, camera-based SSC has attracted considerable attention to developing various approaches. However, current methods mainly focus on precise 2D-to-3D projection while overlooking the challenge of completing invisible regions, leading to numerous false negatives and suboptimal SSC performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, Memory-augmented Re-completion (MARE), designed to enhance completion capability. Our MARE model encapsulates regional relationships by incorporating a memory bank that stores vital region-tokens while two protocols concerning diversity and age are adopted to optimize the bank adversarially. Additionally, we introduce a Re-completion pipeline incorporated with an Information Spreading module to progressively complete the invisible regions while bridging the scale gap between region-level and voxel-level information. Extensive experiments conducted on the SSCBench-KITTI-360 and SemanticKITTI datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.
