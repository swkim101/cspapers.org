Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has been widely used in computer vision and graphics, achieving impressive results in novel view synthesis and multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, despite its excellent performance under ideal conditions, NeRF struggles in challenging environments such as hazy, foggy, and underwater scenes, primarily due to the difficulty in decoupling objects from the scattering medium. 
To mitigate this limitation, we proposed a novel approach for NeRF in scenes with scattering media. Specifically, we leverage pseudo-labels during the early stage of training to guide NeRF in decoupling the densities of objects and the scattering medium, guiding the model toward a more appropriate search space. Furthermore, we introduce a Cyclical Progressive Dimensional Optimization Strategy (CPDOS) that focuses on optimizing a single or a few variables during specific periods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively simulate hazy and underwater scenes, accurately decouple the scattering medium from objects, estimate atmospheric parameters, and outperform existing methods in novel view synthesis and image restoration tasks.
