Querying temporal data has recently gained traction in several artificial intelligence applications. As operational domains of intelligent agents are constantly being expanded, there is a strong need for representing domain knowledge. This comes in the form of ontologies, which are predominantly expressed in description logics and enrich time-stamped data to temporal knowledge bases. For modeling highly complex system environments, expressive description logics are often the formalism of choice. Querying such temporal knowledge bases is a challenging task, but recently a first practical solution has been put forward. We propose a novel approach to the query answering problem based on two well-known rewriting rules from temporal logic. After a careful theoretical analysis of our algorithm, we show in a practical evaluation on several benchmarks that it outperforms state of the art, sometimes by orders of magnitude. Based on our findings, we also propose a fragment of temporal conjunctive queries which guides users towards well-performing queries.
