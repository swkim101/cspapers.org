Scene text spotting has attracted the enthusiasm of relative researchers in recent years. Most existing scene text spotters follow the detection-then-recognition paradigm, where the vanilla detection module hardly determines the reading order and leads to failure recognition. After rethinking the auto-regressive scene text recognition method, we find that a well-trained recognizer can implicitly perceive the local semantics of all characters in a complete word or a sentence without a character-level detection module. Local semantic knowledge not only includes text content but also spatial information in the right reading order. Motivated by the above analysis, we propose the Local Semantics Guided scene text Spotter (LSGSpotter), which auto-regressively decodes the position and content of characters guided by the local semantics. Specifically, two effective modules are proposed in LSGSpotter. On the one hand, we design a Start Point Localization Module (SPLM) for locating text start points to determine the right reading order. On the other hand, a Multi-scale Adaptive Attention Module (MAAM) is proposed to adaptively aggregate text features in a local area. In conclusion, LSGSpotter achieves the arbitrary reading order spotting task without the limitation of sophisticated detection, while alleviating the cost of computational resources with the grid sampling strategy. Extensive experiment results show LSGSpotter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the InverseText benchmark. Moreover, our spotter demonstrates superior performance on English benchmarks for arbitrary-shaped text, achieving improvements of 0.7% and 2.5% on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, respectively. These results validate our text spotter is effective for scene texts in arbitrary reading order and shape.
