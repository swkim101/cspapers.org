Most existing just noticeable difference (JND) methods primarily integrate specific masking effects in a single domain. However, these single-domain JND methods struggle with the structural discrepancies in multi-source content images, limiting their effectiveness in visual redundancy estimation. To address this issue, we propose a dual domain encoder that combines spatial and frequency features to comprehensively capture visual patterns. Our design includes spatial pattern balance and frequency detail correction modules to balance global and local patterns and correct low- and high-frequency distributions. Additionally, we develop a dual domain decoder to effectively extract multi-scale pattern redundancies and integrate them with detail redundancies in the frequency domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method in handling structural discrepancies in multi-source content images.
