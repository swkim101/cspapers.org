The end-to-end automated design of machine learning (ML) pipelines significantly reduces the workload for data scientists and democratizes ML for non-experts. Evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based automated ML (AutoML) systems, a prominent category of AutoML, often face inefficiencies due to the costly fitness evaluation of candidate ML pipelines. Although surrogate models have been employed to approximate the true performance of pipelines more quickly, a key challenge remains in effectively bridging the semantic gap between the heterogeneous features of datasets and pipelines. To address this issue, we propose ADELA, a novel accompanying surrogate-based optimization strategy that accelerates EA-based AutoML while retaining the performance of the resulting pipelines. ADELA operates in two phases: Offline, leveraging a high-quality curated pipeline corpus to meta-learn an accompanying surrogate model; and Online, selecting the accompanying pipeline and using the learned model to predict the performance of evaluation pipelines instead of executing them. The accompanying mechanism effectively mitigates the semantic gap between datasets and pipelines, enabling ADELA to reduce computation times by an average of 73.66% while retaining 98.78% of the final pipeline performance, as demonstrated in extensive experimental evaluations.
