Existing causal learning algorithms focus on micro-level causal discovery, confronting significant challenges in identifying the influence of macro systems, composed of micro-level variables, on other variables. This difficulty arises because the causal relationships in macro systems are often mediated through micro-level causal interactions, which can lead to erroneous causal discovery or omission when dispersed. To address this issue, we propose the Emergence-inspired Multi-granularity Causal learning (EMCausal) method. Inspired by the emerging phenomena of aggregating micro level variables into macro level representations, EMCausal introduces a progressive mapping encoder to simulate the process, thus capturing the causal relationships driven by these macro entities. Next, it introduces a causal consistency constraint to collaboratively reconstruct micro variables using macro-level representations, enabling the learning of a multi-granular causal structure. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that EMCausal can identify causal graphs under the influence of causal emergence, outperforming competitive baselines in term of accuracy and robustness.
