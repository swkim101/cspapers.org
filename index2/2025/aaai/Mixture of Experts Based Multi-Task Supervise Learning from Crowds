Existing learning-from-crowds methods aim to design proper aggregation strategies to infer the unknown true labels from noisy labels provided by crowdsourcing.
They treat the ground truth as hidden variables and use statistical or deep learning based worker behavior models to infer the ground truth. However, worker behavior models that rely on ground truth hidden variables overlook workers' behavior at the item feature level, leading to imprecise characterizations and negatively impacting the quality of learning-from-crowds.
This paper proposes a new paradigm of multi-task supervised learning-from-crowds, which eliminates the need for modeling of items's ground truth in worker behavior models. Within this paradigm, we propose a worker behavior model at the item feature level called Mixture of Experts based Multi-task Supervised Learning-from-Crowds (MMLC), then, two aggregation strategies
are proposed within MMLC. The first strategy, named MMLC-owf, utilizes clustering methods in the worker spectral space to identify the projection vector of the oracle worker. Subsequently, the labels generated based on this vector are regarded as the items's ground truth
The second strategy, called MMLC-df, employs the MMLC model to fill the crowdsourced data, which can enhance the effectiveness of existing aggregation strategies
. Experimental results demonstrate that MMLC-owf outperforms state-of-the-art methods and MMLC-df enhances the quality of existing learning-from-crowds methods.
