The rapid development of social platforms exacerbates the dissemination of misinformation, which stimulates the research in fact verification. Recent studies tend to leverage semantic features to solve this problem as a single-hop task. However, the process of verifying a claim requires several pieces of evidence with complicated inner logic and relations to verify the given claim in real-world situations. Recent studies attempt to improve both understanding and reasoning abilities to enhance the performance, but they overlook the crucial relations between entities that benefit models to understand better and facilitate the prediction. To emphasize the significance of relations, we resort to Large Language Models (LLMs) considering their excellent understanding ability. Instead of other methods using LLMs as the predictor, we take them as relation extractors, for they do better in understanding rather than reasoning according to the experimental results. Thus, to solve the challenges above, we propose a novel Structured Knowledge-Augmented LLM-based Network (LLM-SKAN) for multi-hop fact verification. Specifically, we utilize an LLM-driven Knowledge Extractor to capture fine-grained information, including entities and their complicated relations. Besides, we leverage a Knowledge-Augmented Relation Graph Fusion module to interact with each node and learn better claim-evidence representations comprehensively. The experimental results on four common-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.
