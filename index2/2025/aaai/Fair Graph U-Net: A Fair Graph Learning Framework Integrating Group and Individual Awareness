Learning high-level representations for graphs is crucial for tasks like node classification, where graph pooling aggregates node features to provide a holistic view that enhances predictive performance. Despite numerous methods that have been proposed in this promising and rapidly developing research field, most efforts to generalize the pooling operation to graphs are primarily performance-driven, with fairness issues largely overlooked: i) the process of graph pooling could exacerbate disparities in distribution among various subgroups; ii) the resultant graph structure augmentation may inadvertently strengthen intra-group connectivity, leading to unintended inter-group isolation. To this end, this paper extends the initial effort on fair graph pooling to the development of fair graph neural networks, while also providing a unified framework to collectively address group and individual graph fairness. Our experimental evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fairness but also achieves comparable predictive performance.
