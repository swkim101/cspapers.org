With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in society, our children have routine interactions with these technologies. It has become increasingly important for them to understand how these technologies are trained, what their limitations are and how they work. To introduce children to AI and Machine Learning (ML) concepts, recent efforts introduce tools that integrate ML concepts with physical computing and robotics. However, some of these tools cannot be easily integrated into building projects and the high price of robotics kits can be a limiting factor to many schools. We address these limitations by offering a low-cost hardware and software toolkit that we call the Smart Motor to introduce supervised machine learning to elementary school students. Our Smart Motor uses the nearest neighbor algorithm and utilizes visualizations to highlight the underlying decision-making of the model. We conducted a one week long study using Smart Motors with 9- to 12- year old students and measured their learning through observation, questioning and examining what they built. We found that students were able to integrate the Smart Motors into their building projects but some students struggled with understanding how the underlying model functioned. In this paper we discuss these findings and insights for future directions for the Smart Motor.
