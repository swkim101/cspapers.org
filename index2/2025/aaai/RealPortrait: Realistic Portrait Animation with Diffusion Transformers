We introduce RealPortrait, a framework based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT), designed to generate highly expressive and visually appealing portrait animations. Given a static portrait image, our method can transfer complex facial expressions and head pose movements extracted from a driving video onto the portrait, transforming it into a lifelike video.
Specifically, we exploit the robust spatial-temporal modeling capabilities of DiT, enabling the generation of portrait videos that maintain high-fidelity visual details and ensure temporal coherence. In contrast to conventional image-to-video generation frameworks that necessitate a separate reference network, we incorporate an efficient reference attention within the DiT backbone, thereby obviating the computational overhead and achieving superior reference appearance preservation.
Concurrently, we integrate a parallel ControlNet to precisely regulate intricate facial expressions and head poses. Diverging from prior methods that utilize explicit sparse motion representations, such as facial landmarks or 3DMM coefficients, we adopt a dense implicit motion representation as the control guidance. This implicit motion representation excels in capturing nuanced emotional facial expressions and subtle non-rigid dynamics of the lips.
To further enhance the generalization capability of the model, we augment the training dataset by incorporating a substantial volume of facial image data through random crop augmentation. This strategy ensures the model's robustness across a wide variety of facial appearances and expressions.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RealPortrait excels in generating portrait animations with highly-realistic quality and exceptional temporal coherence in appearance retention.
