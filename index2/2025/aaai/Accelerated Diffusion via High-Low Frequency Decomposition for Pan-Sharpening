Pan-sharpening aims to preserve the spectral information of the multi-spectral (MS) image while leveraging the high-frequency details from the guided high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to enhance its spatial resolution. The key challenge is how to preserve the spectral information from the MS image and the spatial details from the PAN image as much as possible. Diffusion models have achieved favorable results in image restoration and synthesis tasks but suffer from excessive computational resource and time consumption. In this paper, we design a novel and computationally efficient diffusion-based pan-sharpening network that achieves accelerated diffusion while reducing task complexity by decoupling the high and low-frequency components of the fused image. Specifically, leveraging the information-preserving characteristic of the wavelet transformation, we introduce a Wavelet-based Low-frequency Diffusion Model (WLDM). WLDM generates the low-frequency coefficient of high-resolution MS (HRMS) image from the low-resolution MS (LRMS) image. This approach significantly reduces computational resources and complexity compared to the direct restoration of the HRMS image. Furthermore, we have devised a High-frequency Information Restoration Module (HIRM) to restore the high-frequency information in the HRMS image through the interaction of high-frequency coefficients from the PAN image in three directions. Extensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative metrics, qualitative metrics, and inference efficiency.
