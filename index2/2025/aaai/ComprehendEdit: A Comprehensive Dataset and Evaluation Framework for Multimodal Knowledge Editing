Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and visual understanding, but often contain outdated or inaccurate information. Current multimodal knowledge editing evaluations are limited in scope and potentially biased, focusing on narrow tasks and failing to assess the impact on in-domain samples. To address these issues, we introduce ComprehendEdit, a comprehensive benchmark comprising eight diverse tasks from multiple datasets. We propose two novel metrics: Knowledge Generalization Index (KGI) and Knowledge Preservation Index (KPI), which evaluate editing effects on in-domain samples without relying on AI-synthetic samples. Based on insights from our framework, we establish Hierarchical In-Context Editing (HICE), a baseline method employing a two-stage approach that balances performance across all metrics. This study provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multimodal knowledge editing, reveals unique challenges in this field, and offers a baseline method demonstrating improved performance. Our work opens new perspectives for future research and provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective editing techniques for MLLMs.
