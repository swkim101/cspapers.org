We introduce a wearable driving status recognition device and our open-source dataset, along with a new real-time method robust to changes in lighting conditions for identifying driving status from eye observations of drivers. The core of our method is generating event frames from conventional intensity frames, and the other is a newly designed Attention Driving State Network (ADSN). Compared to event cameras, conventional cameras offer complete information and lower hardware costs, enabling captured frames to encode rich spatial information. However, these textures lack temporal information, posing challenges in effectively identifying driving status. DriveGazen addresses this issue from three perspectives. First, we utilize video frames to generate realistic synthetic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events.Second, we adopt a spiking neural network to decode pertinent temporal information. Lastly, ADSN extracts crucial spatial cues from corresponding intensity frames and conveys spatial attention to convolutional spiking layers during both training and inference through a novel guide attention module to guide the feature learning and feature enhancement of the event frame. We specifically collected the Driving Status (DriveGaze) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we validate the superiority of the DriveGazen on the Single-eye Event-based Emotion (SEE) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to utilize guide attention spiking neural networks and eye-based event frames generated from conventional cameras for driving status recognition.Please refer to our project page and supplementary materials for more details.
