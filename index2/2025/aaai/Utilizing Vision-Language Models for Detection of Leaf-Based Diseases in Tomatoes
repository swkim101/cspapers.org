Leaf based diseases in tomatoes such as early blight, late blight, and septoria leaf spot, pose a significant threat to global food security and have substantial economic impacts. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for improving crop yields. This paper explores the use of vision-language models (VLMs) for detecting tomato leaf diseases by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a large dataset of tomato leaf images with corresponding disease annotations. This approach enhances disease detection accuracy and enables multi-modal learning, real-time monitoring, and automated diagnosis, offering promising applications in precision farming and food production.
