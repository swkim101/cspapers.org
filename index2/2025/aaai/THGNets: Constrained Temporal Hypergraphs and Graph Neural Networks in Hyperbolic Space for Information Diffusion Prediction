Information diffusion prediction aims to predict the next infected user in the information diffusion, which is a critical task to understand how information spreads on social platforms. Existing methods mainly focus on the sequences or topology structure in euclidean space. However, they fail to sufficiently consider the hierarchical structure or power-law structure of the underlying topology of information cascade graphs and social networks, resulting in distortion of user features. To tackle above issue, we propose an innovative Constrained Temporal Hypergraphs and Graph Neural Networks (THGNets) framework that is tailored for information diffusion prediction. Specifically, we introduce hyperbolic temporal hypergraphs neural network to alleviate the distortion of user features by hyperbolic hierarchical learning in information cascades. Additionally, it also captures high-order dynamic interaction patterns between users and further integrates the time-consistency constraint mechanism to mitigate the instability and non-smoothness of user features in latent space. In parallel, we apply the hyperbolic graph neural network to investigate the hierarchical structure and user homogeneity on social networks, enhancing our understanding of social relationships. Moreover, hyperbolic gated recurrent units are employed to capture the potential dependency relationships between contextual users. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed THGNets significantly outperform the existing methods, thereby validating the superiority and rationality of our approach.
