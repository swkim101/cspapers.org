In the burgeoning domain of machine learning, the reliance on third-party services for model training and the adoption of pre-trained models have surged. However, this reliance introduces vulnerabilities to model hijacking attacks, where adversaries manipulate models to perform unintended tasks, leading to significant security and ethical concerns, like turning an ordinary image classifier into a tool for detecting faces in pornographic content, all without the model owner’s knowledge. This paper introduces Category-Agnostic Model Hijacking (CAMH), a novel model hijacking attack method capable of addressing the challenges of class number mismatch, data distribution divergence, and performance balance between the original and hijacking tasks. CAMH incorporates synchronized training layers, random noise optimization, and a dual-loop optimization approach to ensure minimal impact on the original task’s performance while effectively executing the hijacking task. We evaluate CAMH across multiple benchmark datasets and network architectures, demonstrating its potent attack effectiveness while ensuring minimal degradation in the performance of the original task.
