Geologists seek to understand the relationship between volcanic unrest and eruptions by identifying subtle Volcanic Thermal Features (VTFs) in high-resolution satellite imagery. This analysis requires the careful curation of large databases of relevant volcanic thermal information. However, volcanic unrest is characterized by highly subtle thermal anomalies. Manual identification on a global scale is highly labor- and time-intensive. We propose Hotspotter: an end-to-end system to automatically detect subtle volcanic thermal anomalies in satellite images and derive relevant thermal statistics. Previous solutions for automated VTF detection have limited data size and geographic diversity. To accommodate an unprecedentedly large and diverse volcanic dataset, we propose an automated pipeline combining unsupervised anomaly detection with supervised classification to filter anomalous regions. Hotspotter gives 90% anomaly detection accuracy and robust generalization to new volcanoes. Our automated approach can accelerate scientists' search for VTFs to help identify relevant thermal precursors and enable more precise forecasts of global volcanic eruptions.
