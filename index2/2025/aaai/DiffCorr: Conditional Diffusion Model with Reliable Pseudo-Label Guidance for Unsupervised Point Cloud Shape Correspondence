Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to establish dense correspondences between source and target point clouds. Existing methods universally follow a one-step paradigm to obtain shape correspondence directly, but it often fails in large-scale motions of humans and animals. To address this challenge, we propose a conditional Diffusion model with reliable pseudo-label guidance for unsupervised point cloud shape Correspondence (DiffCorr), including a transformer-based conditional diffusion model and a reliable pseudo-label generator. The proposed DiffCorr enjoys several merits. Firstly, the transformer-based conditional diffusion model implements a coarse-to-fine optimization for coarse correspondences. Secondly, we design a reliable pseudo-label generator to provide high-quality pseudo-labels for training. Extensive experiments on four human and animal datasets demonstrate that DiffCorr surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits favorable generalization capabilities.
