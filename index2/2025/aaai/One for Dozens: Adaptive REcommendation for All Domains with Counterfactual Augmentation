Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to enhance recommendation performance across various domains. However, real-world recommender systems in online platforms often need to handle dozens or even hundreds of domains, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional MDR algorithms, which typically focus on fewer than five domains. Key challenges include a substantial increase in parameter count, high maintenance costs, and intricate knowledge transfer patterns across domains. Furthermore, minor domains often suffer from data sparsity, leading to inadequate training in classical methods. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive REcommendation for All Domains with counterfactual augmentation (AREAD). AREAD employs a hierarchical structure with a limited number of expert networks at several layers, to effectively capture domain knowledge at different granularities. To adaptively capture the knowledge transfer pattern across domains, we generate and iteratively prune a hierarchical expert network selection mask for each domain during training. Additionally, counterfactual assumptions are used to augment data in minor domains, supporting their iterative mask pruning. Our experiments on two public datasets, each encompassing over twenty domains, demonstrate AREAD's effectiveness, especially in data-sparse domains.
