Solutions to time-varying problems are crucial for research areas such as predicting changes in human body shape over time. While recurrent neural networks have made significant advancements in this field, their reliance on centralized processing has led to challenges such as model silos and data isolation. In response, distributed AI systems like federated learning have emerged to facilitate dynamic collaboration among models; however, they still depend on central coordinators, which pose risks to system security and efficiency. Moreover, traditional federated learning primarily supports homogeneous models and lacks effective strategies for the interaction of heterogeneous models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Collaboration of Heterogeneous Models (DCHM), based on Isomerism Learning, which leverages a consortium blockchain network to enhance model credibility and facilitate coordination among heterogeneous models. Additionally, we introduce a Distributed Hierarchical Aggregation (DHA) algorithm that enables permissioned nodes within each group to aggregate local model results and share them for standardized processing. After several iterative cycles, these nodes perform secondary integration of local results to produce global outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that DCHM effectively analyzes the temporal variability of body shape changes with high efficiency.
