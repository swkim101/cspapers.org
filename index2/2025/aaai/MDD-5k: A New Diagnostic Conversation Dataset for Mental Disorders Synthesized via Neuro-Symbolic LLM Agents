The clinical diagnosis of most mental disorders primarily relies on the conversations between psychiatrist and patient. The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymized patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and generates conversations under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k. This dataset is built upon 1000 real, anonymized patient cases by cooperating with Shanghai Mental Health Center and comprises 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results and treatment opinions as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labeled dataset for Chinese mental disorders diagnosis. Human evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic process of mental disorders.
