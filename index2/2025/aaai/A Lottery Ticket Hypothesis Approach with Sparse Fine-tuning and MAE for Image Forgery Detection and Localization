The rise in sophisticated image forgery techniques, driven by advancements in image editing and generation, has posed new security challenges. Traditional methods, designed for specific tampering artifacts, struggle with out-of-distribution image forgery detection. In this paper, we propose a shift in paradigm, placing greater emphasis on the universal characteristics of authentic images, as opposed to solely focusing on specific forgery signals. We introduce an enhancement to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE), aptly termed the Forgery MAE (FMAE). This modification retains the inherent characteristics of natural images while integrating multi-source forgery information. Our implementation involves applying the lottery ticket hypothesis during pre-training to identify forgery-sensitive parameters, followed by their sparse fine-tuning to target the forgery detection and localization task. Concurrently, we develop a ``mixture of experts'' noise extractor to compile multi-source forgery data. Our FMAE effectively extracts forgery features and shows strong resilience against unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm our method's superior accuracy and generalization capability over existing techniques.
