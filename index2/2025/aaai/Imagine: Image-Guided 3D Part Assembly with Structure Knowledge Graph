3D part assembly is a promising task in 3D computer vision and robotics, focusing on assembling 3D parts together by predicting their 6-DoF poses. Like most 3D shape understanding tasks, existing methods primarily address this task by memorizing the poses of parts during the training process, leading to inaccuracies in complex assemblies and poor generalization to novel categories. In order to essentially improve the performance, structure knowledge of the target assembly is indispensable before assembling, which abstracts the potential part composition and their structural relationships. An image of the target assembly can serve as a common source for constructing this structure knowledge. Nevertheless, the image is far from enough, as its knowledge can be incomplete and ambiguous due to part occlusion and varying views. To tackle these issues, we propose Imagine, a novel Image-guided 3D part assembly framework with structure knowledge graph. As a novel assembly prior, the structure knowledge graph originates from the image and is refined as understanding the 3D parts. It encodes robust part-aware structural and semantic information of the assembly, guides the 3D parts from a coarse super-structure to a fine assembly, and co-evolves progressively throughout the assembly process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework, along with strong generalization to novel images and categories.
