In multi-dimensional classification (MDC), the classifier chain approach is based on a chain structure to model dependencies between class spaces. However, current research on constructing a chain order is usually based on a greedy criterion or random generation, which is highly likely to lead to an incorrect chain order and fit incorrect class dependencies. Moreover, existing classifier chain-based approaches do not consider the misleading effects of irrelevant input features on the classifiers. To fill the above gap, a classifier chain-based approach incorporating evolutionary chain order optimization and feature selection (ECCO) is proposed. Specifically, this approach designs a meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the chain order of multiple classifiers. Simultaneously, the approach selects dimension-specific feature combinations that are more conducive to class prediction of each dimension. These strategies enhance the class prediction capability of the constructed MDC model. Comparative experiments on 14 real datasets validate that ECCO outperforms 7 state-of-the-art MDC approaches.
