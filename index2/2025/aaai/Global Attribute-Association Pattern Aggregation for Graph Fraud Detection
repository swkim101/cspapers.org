Fraud is increasingly prevalent, and its patterns are frequently changing, posing challenges for fraud detection methods such as random forests and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which rely on bin-based and mixture features separately. The former may lose crucial graph-associated features, while the latter face incorrect feature fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose an approach based on attribute-association pattern that leverages the distinct attribute and association patterns differentiating fraudulent from benign behaviors, to enhance fraud detection capabilities. 
Attribute features are adaptively split into separate bins to eliminate incorrect attribute fusion and combine association patterns through graph neighbor message passing, thereby deriving attribute-association pattern features. Using the learned attribute-association patterns, the fraud patterns between a single pattern and the patterns across the entire graph are globally aggregated. Extensive experiments comparing our approach with 24 methods on 7 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves SOTA performance.
