Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer a pre-trained source model to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data, thereby effectively solving labeled data dependency and domain shift problems. However, the SFDA setting faces a bottleneck due to the absence of supervisory information. To mitigate this problem, Active Learning (AL) is introduced to combine with SFDA, endeavoring to actively label a small set of the most high-quality target points so that models with satisfactory performance can be obtained at an acceptable cost. Nevertheless, several issues remain unresolved, namely when to query new labels during training, what kind of samples deserve labeling to ensure rich information, and where the labels should be distributed to guarantee diversity. Thus we elaborate OmniQuery to omnibearing address the “When, What, and Where” problems about active points querying in source-free domain adaptation for cross-modal 3D semantic segmentation. The method consists of three main components: Query Decider, Point Ranker, and Budget Slicer. The Query Decider determines the optimal timing to query new points by fitting the validation curves during training. The Point Ranker nominates points for annotation by calculating the ambiguity of neighboring points in the feature space. The Budget Slicer allocates the annotation quota, i.e., labeling percentage of the point cloud, to different semantic regions by utilizing the advanced 2D semantic segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 99.64% of fully supervised performance with only 3% of labels, and consistently outperforming comparison methods across various scenarios.
