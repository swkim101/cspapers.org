The task of 3D object detection is crucial for various applications that rely on identifying objects in three-dimensional space using inputs like LiDAR point clouds and images. However, LiDAR-based detection faces challenges due to the sparsity of point clouds, especially at greater distances. To address this, depth completion models have been used to generate virtual points from RGB images, but they struggle with real-time applications due to high computational costs. Our work eliminates the depth completion process, significantly improving processing speed while minimizing performance degradation. Consequently, our method has achieved an optimal balance between speed and accuracy on the KITTI leaderboard.
