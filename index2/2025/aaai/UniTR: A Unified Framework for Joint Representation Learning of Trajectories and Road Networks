Representation learning of urban spatial-temporal data is fundamental and critical, serving a wide range of intelligent applications. Given that road networks and trajectories are inherently interrelated, their joint representation learning can significantly enhance the accuracy and utility of these applications. However, effectively learning joint representations for these two types of data remains challenging, particularly due to the complexities of interaction modeling and cross-scale optimization. To this end, we propose a unified framework, named UniTR, for joint representation learning of road networks and trajectories. Specifically, we first design a hierarchical propagation mechanism to model the complex many-to-many interactions between road networks and trajectories, thereby generating informative embeddings. Then, a triple-level contrastive optimization module is incorporated to systematically select valid positive and negative samples, further refining the embeddings. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets from two cities clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of UniTR.
