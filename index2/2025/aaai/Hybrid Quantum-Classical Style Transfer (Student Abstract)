This paper proposes a novel quantum style transfer (QST) in hybrid quantum-classical computing. QST leverages quantum computing's ability to process high-dimensional data efficiently. Our approach aims to decrease both inference time and complexity while maintaining performance, presenting a viable solution that enhances the scalability and efficiency of image generation technologies.
