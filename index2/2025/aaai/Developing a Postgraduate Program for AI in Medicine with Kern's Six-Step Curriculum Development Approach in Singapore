Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed the medical field, necessitating significant changes in medical education to prepare healthcare professionals for future work requirements. However, the integration of AI into medical curricula has been slow and lacks standardization. In this paper, we present our work in developing a year-long postgraduate-level AI in Medicine program offered by a medical school at a public university in Singapore. Our curriculum design follows Kern's six-step approach to medical curriculum development, organized into a four-session framework. These sessions involved collaboration with hospital and university administrators, educators, industry experts, and healthcare professionals. The program is structured around three core courses: Foundational Healthcare AI, Clinical Applications of Healthcare AI, and Governance and Ethics for Healthcare AI. Each course comprises multiple modules with associated projects, emphasizing hands-on learning. The program adopts a problem-based learning approach, supported by a blended learning environment to accommodate the schedules of working healthcare professionals. Evaluations by industry experts highlight the program's potential to address critical gaps in the healthcare sector. This study contributes to the integration of AI into medical training by providing a standardized approach that can be adapted globally.
