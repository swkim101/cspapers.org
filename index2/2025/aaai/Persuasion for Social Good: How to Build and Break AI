Persuasion is important in numerous situations like healthy habit promotion, and emotional support. As AI gets more involved in our daily life, it becomes critical to study how they can persuade humans and how persuasive they are. In this talk, I will cover (1) how to build such persuasive AI systems that can persuade, negotiate, and cooperate with other humans in the game of Diplomacy. (2) I will also discuss how humans perceive such specialized AI systems. This study validates the necessity of California's Autobot Law and proposes guidance to regulate such systems. (3) As these systems become more powerful, AI safety problems become more important. So I will describe how to persuade AI models to jailbreak them and study AI safety problems. Finally, I will conclude with my long-term vision to further study persuasion from a multi-angle approach that combines Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, and social sciences.
