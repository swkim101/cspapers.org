Although multiview fusion has demonstrated potential in LiDAR segmentation, its dependence on computationally intensive point-based interactions, arising from the lack of fixed correspondences between views such as range view and Bird's-Eye View (BEV), hinders its practical deployment. This paper challenges the prevailing notion that multiview fusion is essential for achieving high performance. We demonstrate that significant gains can be realized by directly fusing Polar and Cartesian partitioning strategies within the BEV space. Our proposed BEV-only segmentation model leverages the inherent fixed grid correspondences between these partitioning schemes, enabling a fusion process that is orders of magnitude faster (170x speedup) than conventional point-based methods. Furthermore, our approach facilitates dense feature fusion, preserving richer contextual information compared to sparse point-based alternatives. To enhance scene understanding while maintaining inference efficiency, we also introduce a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture. Extensive evaluation on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets provides compelling evidence that our method outperforms previous multiview fusion approaches in terms of both performance and inference speed, highlighting the potential of BEV-based fusion for LiDAR segmentation.
