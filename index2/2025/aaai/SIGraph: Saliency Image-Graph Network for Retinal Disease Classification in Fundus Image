An efficient and precise diagnosis of retinal diseases is a fundamental goal for auxiliary diagnostic systems in ophthalmology. Inspired by the importance of scattered subtle lesions in manual retinal disease diagnosis, recent research has achieved state-of-the-art performance by mining information related to subtle lesions, including their texture and shape. However, the spatial distribution patterns of subtle lesion areas, which are also crucial in manual diagnosis, have been overlooked in existing research. Neglecting these spatial distribution patterns (e.g., the ring distribution of microaneurysms in diabetic macular edema) may negatively impact the diagnostic process. In this paper, we introduce the Saliency-Image-Graph (SIGraph) network to capture the spatial distribution patterns of lesion areas. We first employ saliency-based perception to identify latent lesion pixels. Subsequently, we propose a novel image-graph block to efficiently capture the global distribution of abundant lesion pixels with minimal information loss. By leveraging additional distribution patterns, SIGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance with at least a 1.5% performance gain across three datasets. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate that our image-graph block can be integrated into other visual backbones and effectively boost performance.
