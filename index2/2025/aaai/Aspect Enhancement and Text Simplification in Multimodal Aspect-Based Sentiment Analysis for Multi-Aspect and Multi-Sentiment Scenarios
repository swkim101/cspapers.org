Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) plays a pivotal role in the advancement of sentiment analysis technology. Although current methods strive to integrate multimodal information to enhance the performance of sentiment analysis, they still face two critical challenges when dealing with multi-aspect and multi-sentiment data: i) the importance of aspect terms within multimodal data is often overlooked, and ii) models fail to accurately associate specific aspect terms with corresponding sentiment words in multi-aspect and multi-sentiment sentences. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis method that combines Aspect Enhancement and Text Simplification (AETS). Specifically, we develop an aspect enhancement module that boosts the ability of model to discern relevant aspect terms. Concurrently, we employ text simplification module to simplify and restructure multi-aspect and multi-sentiment texts, accurately capturing aspects and their corresponding sentiments while reducing irrelevant information. Leveraging this method, we perform three tasks including multimodal aspect term extraction, multimodal aspect sentiment classification, and joint multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis. Experimental results indicate that our proposed AETS model achieved state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.
