Recommender systems used in online platforms can drive users to consume content continuously in an attempt to maximize satisfaction. Such engagement is invariably broken due to more pressing work, alternate pursuits, distractions or fatigue. Recommender systems need to ensure the continuity of experience when the user joins back. Session-based recommender systems typically create different sessions based on a fixed time interval (θ), often resulting in creation of a separate session when the user gets off the platform temporarily. When the user joins back, session-based recommender systems are likely to recommend content different than what they would have in case the earlier session had continued. This may cause dissatisfaction given that there is a difference in the predicted world model of the user, i.e. the expectation from the last session, and the observed one, i.e. the recommendations. To handle this problem, we propose the creation of content-driven sessions instead of time-driven sessions. In our setting, a session continues while a single item category dominates in the user-item interactions. A new session is created when a different item category begins to dominate. The proposed content-driven method also solves the long-standing problem of deciding the optimal value of time threshold (θ) for defining the time-based session. We report that the proposed method outperforms existing SOTA methodologies set by time-based sessions by a large margin in terms of recommendation performance on multiple datasets.
