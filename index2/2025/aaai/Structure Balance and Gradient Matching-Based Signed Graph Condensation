Training graph neural networks (GNNs) for graph representation has received increasing concerns due to its outstanding performance in the link prediction and node classification tasks, but it incurs much time and storage for tackling large-scale graphs. To alleviate this issue, graph condensation has been emerged to condense the large graph into a small but highly-informative graph, while achieving comparable performance of GNNs trained on the small graph and large graph. However, existing works mainly focus on the gradient or distribution matching under GNN training trajectories to condense simple link structures, while overlooking the structure matching for condensing signed graph that exists conflict links and structural balance among nodes. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Structure Balance and Gradient Matching-Based Signed Graph Condensation (SGSGC) method for condensing signed graph with node attributes, conflict links and structural balance into informative smaller ones. Specifically, we first propose a structure-balanced matching to match the structural balance between the original and condensed signed graph, and then combine it with the gradient matching to condense signed graph for the link sign prediction task, while preserving both conflicting link structures and node attributes. Moreover, we use the feature smoothing and the graph sparsification technique to improve the robustness for the GNN training, respectively. Finally, a bi-level optimization technique is proposed to simultaneously find the optimal node attributes and conflict structure of the condensed graph. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SGSGC achieves excellent performance. On Epinions, 94% test accuracy of training on the original signed graph, while reducing their graph size by 99.95% - 99.99%, and there exist 2.24% â€“ 6.26% accuracy improvements for link sign prediction compared to the state-of-the-arts.
