Masked autoencoders employ random masking to effectively reconstruct input images using self-supervised techniques, which allows for efficient training on large datasets. However, the random masking strategy does not adequately tap into information encapsulated within high-dimensional hyperspectral satellite imagery that is used in several domains. We propose a novel masking strategy, HOGMAE, based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients that incorporates rich information inherent within satellite images during the mask creation step. Our experiments, over a hyperspectral satellite dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology.
