Graph similarity computation (GSC) is to calculate the similarity between one pair of graphs, which is a fundamental problem with fruitful applications in the graph community. In GSC, graph edit distance (GED) and maximum common subgraph (MCS) are the two most adopted similarity metrics, both of which are NP-hard to compute. Instead of calculating the exact values, state-of-the-art solutions resort to leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn data-driven models for the estimation of GED and MCS. Most of them are built on components involving node-level interactions crossing graphs, which engender vast computation overhead but are of little avail in effectiveness. Motivated by this, in the paper, we present GraSP, a simple yet effective GSC approach for GED and MCS prediction. More concretely, GraSP achieves high result efficacy through several key instruments: enhanced node features via positional encoding and a GNN model augmented by a gating mechanism, residual connections, as well as multi-scale pooling. Theoretically, GraSP can surpass the 1-WL test, indicating its high expressiveness. Empirically, extensive experiments comparing GraSP against 10 competitors on multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets showcase the superiority of GraSP over prior arts in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
