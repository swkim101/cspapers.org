Agentic systems interleave large language model (LLM) reasoning, tool usage, and tool observations over multiple iterations to tackle complex tasks. The raw data from an agent's problem-solving process (the agents' trajectory) is not an ideal format for human analysis and oversight. There is a need for tooling that converts this primary data into an easily navigable and understandable visual format for better human feedback. To address this opportunity, we developed the Agent Trajectory Explorer, a tool designed to help AI developers and researchers visualize, annotate, and demonstrate agent behavior.
