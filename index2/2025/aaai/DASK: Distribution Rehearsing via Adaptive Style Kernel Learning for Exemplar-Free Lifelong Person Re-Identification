Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) is an important but challenging task that suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to significant domain gaps between training steps. Existing LReID approaches typically rely on data replay and knowledge distillation to mitigate this issue. However, data replay methods compromise data privacy by storing historical exemplars, while knowledge distillation methods suffer from limited performance due to the cumulative forgetting of undistilled knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm that models and rehearses the distribution of the old domains to enhance knowledge consolidation during the new data learning, possessing a strong anti-forgetting capacity without storing any exemplars. Specifically, we introduce an exemplar-free LReID method called Distribution Rehearsing via Adaptive Style Kernel Learning (DASK). DASK includes a Distribution Rehearser Learning mechanism that learns to transform arbitrary distribution data into the current data style at each learning step. To enhance the style transfer capacity, an Adaptive Kernel Prediction network is explored to achieve an instance-specific distribution adjustment. Additionally, we design a Distribution Rehearsing-driven LReID Training module, which rehearses old distribution based on the new data via the old AKPNet model, achieving effective knowledge accumulation. Experimental results show our DASK outperforms the existing methods by 3.6%-6.8% and 4.5%-6.5% on seen and unseen domains, respectively.
