Credit risk assessment has increasingly become a prominent research field due to the dramatically increased incidents of financial default. Traditional graph-based methods have been developed to detect defaulters within user-merchant commercial payment networks. However, these methods face challenges in detecting complex risks, primarily due to their neglect of user-to-user fund transfer interactions and the under-utilization of temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Static Relations (DGNN-SR) for credit risk assessment, which can encode the dynamic transaction graph and the static fund transfer graph simultaneously. To fully harness the temporal information, DGNN-SR employs a multi-view time encoder to explore the semantics of both relative and absolute time. To enhance the dynamic representations with static relations, we devise an adaptive re-weighting strategy to incorporate the static relations into the dynamic representations of time encoder, which extracts more discriminative features for risk assessment. Extensive experiments on two real-world business datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a 0.85% - 2.5% improvement over existing SOTA methods.
