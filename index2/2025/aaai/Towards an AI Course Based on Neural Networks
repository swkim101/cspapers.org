In a prior paper, we argued that Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be placed on a different foundation, one based on pattern recognition and feature learning rather than symbol manipulation and feature engineering. In this paper, we provide a proof of concept of an AI course that follows that proposed approach. Students study how these systems become so incredibly powerful through machine learning of features and through pattern matching. Students learn how those systems represent knowledge and they study their currently limited reasoning abilities. Students spend time discussing the accomplishments of current systems, positive as well as negative and they study the projected impact of anticipated systems. In this paper, we give a brief argument of why one would want to offer such a course. We present a detailed outline of the contents of such a course, together with learning materials and their proposed use. We summarize relevant anonymous student feedback and offer a subjective evaluation of the pilot course.
