Existing hands datasets are largely short-range and the interaction is weak due to the self-occlusion and self-similarity of hands, which can not yet fit the need for interacting hands motion generation. To rescue the data scarcity, we propose HandDiffuse12.5M, a novel and real dataset that consists of temporal sequences with strong two-hand interactions. HandDiffuse12.5M has the largest scale and richest interactions among the existing two-hand datasets. We further present a strong baseline method HandDiffuse for the controllable motion generation of interacting hands using various controllers. Specifically, we apply the diffusion model as the backbone and design two motion representations for different controllers. To reduce artifacts, we also propose Interaction Loss which explicitly quantifies the dynamic interaction process. Our HandDiffuse enables various applications, i.e., motion in-betweening and trajectory controled generation. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in motion generation.
The vivid two-hand motions generated by our method can also construct synthetic datasets and enhances the accuracy of existing hand motion capture algorithms.
