Accurate detection of dust storms is challenging due to complex meteorological interactions. With the development of deep learning, deep neural networks have been increasingly applied to dust storm detection, offering better learning and generalization capabilities compared to traditional physical modeling. However, existing methods face some limitations, leading to performance bottlenecks in dust storm detection. From the task perspective, existing research focuses on occurrence detection while neglecting intensity detection. From the data perspective, existing research fails to explore the utilization of multi-source data. From the model perspective, most models are built on convolutional neural networks, which have an inherent limitation in capturing long-range dependencies. To address the challenges mentioned, this study proposes Dust-Mamba. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to accomplish both the occurrence and intensity detection of dust storms with advanced deep learning technology. In Dust-Mamba, multi-source data is introduced to provide a comprehensive perspective, Mamba and attention are applied to boost feature selection while maintaining long-range modeling capability. Additionally, this study proposes Structure Sharing Transfer Learning Strategies for intensity detection, which further enhances the performance of Dust-Mamba with minimal time cost. As shown by experiments, Dust-Mamba achieves Dice scores of 0.963 for occurrence detection and 0.560 for intensity detection, surpassing several baseline models. In conclusion, this study offers valuable baselines for dust storm detection, with significant reference value and promising application potential.
