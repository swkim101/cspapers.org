Unauthorised face recognition (FR) systems have posed significant threats to digital identity and privacy protection. To alleviate the risk of compromised identities, recent makeup transfer-based attack methods embed adversarial signals in order to confuse unauthorised FR systems. However, their major weakness is that they set up a fixed image unrelated to both the protected and the makeup reference images as the confusion identity, which in turn has a negative impact on both attack success rate and visual quality of transferred photos. In addition, the generated images cannot be recognised by authorised FR systems once attacks are triggered. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Recoverable Makeup Transferred Generative Adversarial Network (RMT-GAN) which has the distinctive feature of improving its image-transfer quality by selecting a suitable transfer reference photo as the target identity. Moreover, our method offers a solution to recover the protected photos to their original counterparts that can be recognised by authorised systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides significantly improved attack success rates while maintaining higher visual quality compared to state-of-the-art makeup transfer-based adversarial attack methods.
