Multi-label few-shot image classification is a crucial and challenging task due to limited annotated data and elusive category specificity. However, research on this topic is still in the rudimentary stage and few methods are available. Existing methods either leverage data augmentation to alleviate data scarcity or utilize label features as auxiliary knowledge to eliminate the negative effect caused by irrelevant categories, but they ignore the utilization of image region features for data augmentation, and overlook to learn appropriate text feature to better match the image features of specific categories. Moreover, these methods only focus on one side and do not effectively tackle the above two issues simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel prototype-based multi-label few-shot learning framework that seamlessly integrates pairwise feature augmentation and flexible prompt learning. Specifically, by pairwise feature augmentation, we leverage the region features of images in the support set to generate more image features and construct image prototypes, thus alleviating the issue of data scarcity. By flexible prompt learning, we adaptively acquire class-specific prompts to build text prototypes that highly match the image features of specific classes, thereby mitigating the impact of irrelevant classes. Finally, with adaptive learnable parameters, we merge image and text prototypes to obtain the final prototypes, achieving a more powerful classifier for multi-label few-shot image classification. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can push the performance to a higher level.
