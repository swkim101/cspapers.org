We propose a novel system, MathMistake Checker, designed to automate step-by-step mistake finding in mathematical problems with lengthy answers through a two-stage process. The system aims to simplify grading, increase efficiency, and enhance learning experiences from a pedagogical perspective. It integrates advanced technologies, including computer vision and the chain-of-thought capabilities of the latest large language models (LLMs). Our system supports open-ended grading without reference answers and promotes personalized learning by providing targeted feedback. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various types of math problems, such as calculation and word problems.
