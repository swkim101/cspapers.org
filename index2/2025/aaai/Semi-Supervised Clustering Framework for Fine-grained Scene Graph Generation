Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to detect all objects and identify their pairwise relationships existing in the scene. Considering the substantial human labor costs, existing scene graph annotations are often sparse and biased, which result in confusion training with low-frequency predicates. In this work, we design a Semi-Supervised Clustering framework for Scene Graph Generation (SSC-SGG) that uses the sparse labeled data to guide the generation of effective pseudo-labels from unlabeled object pairs, thus enriching the labeled sample space, especially for low-frequency interaction samples. We approach from the perspective of clustering, reducing the problem of confirmation bias in a self-training manner. Specifically, we first enhance the model's robustness to feature extraction via prototype-based clustering, aggregating different relationship augmented features onto the same prototype. Secondly, we design a dynamic pseudo-label assignment algorithm based on a mini-batch, which adjusts the detection sensitivity to different frequency samples from the historical assignment. Finally, we conduct joint training on the pseudo-labels and the labeled data. We conduct experiments on various SGG models and achieve substantial overall performance improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of SSC-SGG.
