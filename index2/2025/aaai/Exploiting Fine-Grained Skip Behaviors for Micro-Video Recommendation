The growing trend of sharing short videos on social media platforms, where users capture and share moments from their daily lives, has led to an increase in research efforts focused on micro-video recommendations. However, conventional methods oversimplify the modeling of skip behavior, categorizing interactions solely as positive or negative based on whether skipping occurs. This study was motivated by the importance of the first few seconds of micro-videos, leading to a refinement of signals into three distinct categories: highly positive, less positive, and negative. Specifically, we classify skip interactions occurring within a short time as negatives, while those occurring after a delay are categorized as less positive. The proposed dual-level graph and hierarchical ranking loss are designed to effectively learn these fine-grained interactions. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed three conventional methods across eight evaluation measures on two public datasets.
