Outlier detection (OD) is the task of identifying unusual observations (or outliers) from a given or upcoming data by learning unique patterns of normal observations (or inliers). Recently, a study introduced a powerful unsupervised OD (UOD) solver based on a new observation of deep generative models, called inlier-memorization (IM) effect, which suggests that generative models memorize inliers before outliers in early learning stages. In this study, we aim to develop a theoretically principled method to address UOD tasks by maximally utilizing the IM effect. We begin by observing that the IM effect is observed more clearly when the given training data contain fewer outliers. This finding indicates a potential for enhancing the IM effect in UOD regimes if we can effectively exclude outliers from mini-batches when designing the loss function. To this end, we introduce two main techniques: 1) increasing the mini-batch size as the model training proceeds and 2) using an adaptive threshold to calculate the truncated loss function. We theoretically show that these two techniques effectively filter out outliers from the truncated loss function, allowing us to utilize the IM effect to the fullest. Coupled with an additional ensemble technique, we propose our method and term it Adaptive Loss Truncation with Batch Increment (ALTBI). We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate that ALTBI achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying outliers compared to other recent methods, even with lower computation costs. Additionally, we show that our method yields robust performances when combined with privacy-preserving algorithms.
