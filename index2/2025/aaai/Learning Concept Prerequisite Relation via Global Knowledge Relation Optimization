Learning concept prerequisite relations helps better master and build a logically coherent knowledge structure. Many studies use graph neural networks to create heterogeneous knowledge networks that enhance concept representations. However, different types of relations in these networks can influence each other. Existing research often focuses solely on concept relations, neglecting other types of knowledge connections. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel concept prerequisite relation learning model, named the Global Knowledge Relation Optimization Model(GKROM). Specifically, we capture the impact of different knowledge relation types on document and concept semantic representations separately, integrating the document and concept semantic representations. Then, we introduce multi-objective learning to optimize the knowledge relation network from a global perspective. Through the above optimization, GKROM learns richer semantic representations for concepts and documents, improving the accuracy of concept prerequisite relation learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our GKROM, achieving state-of-the-art performance in concept prerequisite relation learning.
