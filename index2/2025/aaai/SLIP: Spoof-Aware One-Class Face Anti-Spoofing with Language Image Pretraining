Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security and reliability of face recognition systems. With advancements in vision-language pretrained (VLP) models, recent two-class FAS techniques have leveraged the advantages of using VLP guidance, while this potential remains unexplored in one-class FAS methods. The one-class FAS focuses on learning intrinsic liveness features solely from live training images to differentiate between live and spoof faces. However, the lack of spoof training data can lead one-class FAS models to inadvertently incorporate domain information irrelevant to the live/spoof distinction (\eg, facial content), causing performance degradation when tested with a new application domain. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Spoof-aware one-class face anti-spoofing with Language Image Pretraining (SLIP). Given that live faces should ideally not be obscured by any spoof-attack-related objects (\eg, paper, or masks) and are assumed to yield zero spoof cue maps, we first propose an effective language-guided spoof cue map estimation to enhance one-class FAS models by simulating whether the underlying faces are covered by attack-related objects and generating corresponding nonzero spoof cue maps. Next, we introduce a novel prompt-driven liveness feature disentanglement to alleviate live/spoof-irrelative domain variations by disentangling live/spoof-relevant and domain-dependent information. Finally, we design an effective augmentation strategy by fusing latent features from live images and spoof prompts to generate spoof-like image features and thus diversify latent spoof features to facilitate the learning of one-class FAS. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies support that SLIP consistently outperforms previous one-class FAS methods.
