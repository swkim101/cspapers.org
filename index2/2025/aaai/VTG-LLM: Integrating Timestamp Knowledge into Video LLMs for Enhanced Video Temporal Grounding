Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) strives to accurately pinpoint event timestamps in a specific video using linguistic queries, significantly impacting downstream tasks like video browsing and editing. Unlike traditional task-specific models, Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) can handle multiple tasks concurrently in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, exploring the application of video LLMs for VTG tasks has become a burgeoning research area.
However, despite considerable advancements in video content understanding, video LLMs often struggle to accurately pinpoint timestamps within videos, limiting their effectiveness in VTG tasks. To address this, we introduce VTG-LLM, a model designed to enhance video LLMs' timestamp localization abilities. Our approach includes: (1) effectively integrating timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporating absolute-time tokens to manage timestamp knowledge without concept shifts; and (3) introducing a lightweight, high-performance, slot-based token compression technique designed to accommodate the demands of a large number of frames to be sampled for VTG tasks.
Additionally, we present VTG-IT-120K, a collection of publicly available VTG datasets that we have re-annotated to improve upon low-quality annotations.
Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across a variety of VTG tasks.
