In this paper, we propose SDAS, a new motion data assessment and storage system designed to acquire new motion data with reduced redundancy and maximizing diversity. SDAS collects data in the field, retrieves the most similar data from the database in real-time, and provides visualization tools that allow for the comparison of differences between the capture data and the stored data. Through this system, researchers can efficiently build and manage a database. The demonstration video is available at https://youtu.be/vqW0uMDnZTw.
