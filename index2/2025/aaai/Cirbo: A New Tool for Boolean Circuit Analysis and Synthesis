We present an open-source tool for manipulating Boolean circuits. It implements efficient algorithms, both existing and novel, for a rich variety of frequently used circuit tasks such as satisfiability, synthesis, and minimization. We tested the tool on a wide range of practically relevant circuits (computing, in particular, symmetric and arithmetic functions) that have been optimized intensively by the community for the last three years. The tool helped us to win the IWLS 2024 Programming Contest. In 2023, it was Google DeepMind who took the first place in the competition. We were able to reduce the size of the best circuits from 2023 by 12% on average, whereas for some individual circuits, our size reduction was as large as 83%.
