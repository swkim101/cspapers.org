High-accuracy image segmentation models require abundant training annotated data which is costly for pixel-level annotations. Our work addresses a high-cost manual annotating process or the lack of detailed annotations via a generative approach. In particular, our approach (1) proposes the conditional instance-level synthesis to enrich the limited data to enhance the segmentation performance, and (2) employs the generative architectures to complete the segmentation task under few-shot learning concepts. The initial results on the Cityscapes benchmark emphasize our potential generative solution on the instance segmentation task given limited data.
