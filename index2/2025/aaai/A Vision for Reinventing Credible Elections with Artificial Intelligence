In this blue sky paper, we seek to stimulate the research community to pursue important new as well as existing (unsolved) AI problems in the context of a challenging, often ignored, socio-sensitive application domain. We outline the key challenges in conducting elections credibly in leading democracies around the world today and identify our vision of a path forward with an overarching goal to increase voter participation with a two-pronged approach of AI-lead technological innovations and interdisciplinary community building. On the technology front, we envisage the need to transform Collation and Distribution of election information, and promote its Comprehensibility for users understanding and trust (CDC). On the community front, we need to invigorate the multi-disciplinary community consisting of, but not limited to, researchers in AI, security, journalism, political science, sociology, and business, to PROMote AI's Safe usage for Elections (PROMISE) with best-practices. This work is informed by our interdisciplinary research as well as experience in conducting three workshops at leading AI conferences and the AI Magazine special issue on AI and Elections.
