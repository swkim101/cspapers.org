Transfer learning for bio-signals has recently become an important technique to improve prediction performance on downstream tasks with small bio-signal datasets. Recent works have shown that pre-training a neural network model on a large dataset (e.g. EEG) with a self-supervised task, replacing the self-supervised head with a linear classification head, and fine-tuning the model on different downstream bio-signal datasets (e.g., EMG or ECG) can dramatically improve the performance on those datasets. In this paper, we propose a new convolution-transformer hybrid model architecture with masked auto-encoding for low-data bio-signal transfer learning, introduce a frequency-based masked auto-encoding task, employ a more comprehensive evaluation framework, and evaluate how much and when (multimodal) pre-training improves fine-tuning performance. We also introduce a dramatically more performant method of aligning a downstream dataset with a different temporal length and sampling rate to the original pre-training dataset. Our findings indicate that the convolution-only part of our hybrid model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on some low-data downstream tasks. The performance is often improved even further with our full model. In the case of transformer-based models we find that pre-training especially improves performance on downstream datasets, multimodal pre-training often increases those gains further, and our frequency-based pre-training performs the best on average for the lowest and highest data regimes.
