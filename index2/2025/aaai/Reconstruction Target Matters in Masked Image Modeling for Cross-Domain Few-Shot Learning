Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) requires the model to transfer knowledge from the data-abundant source domain to data-scarce target domains for fast adaptation, where the large domain gap makes CDFSL a challenging problem. Masked Autoencoder (MAE) excels in effectively using unlabeled data and learning image’s global structures, enhancing model generalization and robustness. However, in the CDFSL task with significant domain shifts, we find MAE even shows lower performance than the baseline supervised models. In this paper, we first delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that MAE tends to focus on low-level domain information during reconstructing pixels while changing the reconstruction target to token features could mitigate this problem. However, not all features are beneficial, as we then find reconstructing high-level features can hardly improve the model’s transferability, indicating a trade-off between filtering domain information and preserving the image’s global structure. In all, the reconstruction target matters for the CDFSL task. Based on the above findings and interpretations, we further propose Domain-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling (DAMIM) for the CDFSL task. DAMIM includes an Aggregated Feature Reconstruction module to automatically aggregate features for reconstruction, with balanced learning of domain-agnostic information and images’ global structure, and a Lightweight Decoder module to further benefit the encoder’s generalizability. Experiments on four CDFSL datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
