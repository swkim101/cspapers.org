Rainy images suffer from quality degradation due to the synergistic effect of rain streaks and accumulation. The rain streaks are anisotropic and show a specific directional arrangement, while the rain accumulation is isotropic and shows a consistent concentration distribution in local regions. This distribution difference makes unified representation learning for rain streaks and accumulation challenging, which may lead to structure distortion and contrast degradation in the deraining results. To address this problem, a central-surrounding mechanism inspired Synergistic Convolution (SC) is proposed to extract rain streaks and accumulation features simultaneously. Specifically, the SC consists of two parallel novel convolutions: Central-Surrounding Difference Convolution (CSD) and Central-Surrounding Addition Convolution (CSA). In CSD, the difference operation between central and surrounding pixels is injected into the feature extraction process of convolution to perceive the direction distribution of rain streaks. In CSA, the addition operation between central and surrounding pixels is injected into the feature extraction process of convolution to facilitate the modeling of rain accumulation properties. The SC can be used as a general unit to substitute Vanilla Convolution (VC) in current de-raining networks to boost performance. To reduce computational costs, CSA and CSD in SC are merged into a single VC kernel by our parameter equivalent transformation before inferencing. Evaluations of twelve de-raining methods on nine public datasets demonstrate that our proposed SC can comprehensively improve the performance of twelve de-raining networks under various rainy conditions without changing the original network structure or introducing extra computational costs. Even for the current SOTA methods, SC can further achieve SOTA++ performance. The source codes will be publicly available.
