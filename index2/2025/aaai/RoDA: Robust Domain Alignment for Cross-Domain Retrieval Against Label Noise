This paper studies the complex challenge of cross-domain image retrieval under the condition of noisy labels (NCIR), a scenario that not only includes the inherent obstacles of traditional cross-domain image retrieval (CIR) but also requires alleviating the adverse effects of label noise. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel Robust Domain Alignment framework (RoDA), specifically designed for the NCIR task. At the heart of RoDA is the Selective Division and Adaptive Learning mechanism (SDAL), a key component crafted to shield the model from overfitting the noisy labels. SDAL effectively learns discriminative knowledge by dividing the dataset into clean and noisy parts, subsequently rectifying the labels for the latter based on information drawn from the clean one. This process involves adaptively weighting the relabeled samples and leveraging both the clean and relabeled data to bootstrap model training. Moreover, to bridge the domain gap further, we introduce the Accumulative Class Center Alignment (ACCA), a novel approach that fosters domain alignment through an accumulative domain loss mechanism.Thanks to SDAL and ACCA, our RoDA demonstrates its superiority in overcoming label noise and domain discrepancies within the NCIR paradigm. The effectiveness and robustness of our RoDA framework are comprehensively validated through extensive experiments across three multi-domain benchmarks.
