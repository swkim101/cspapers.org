The imperative for compression of material textures emerges from the critical demand for high-quality rendering, which necessitates sophisticated textures that, in turn, require substantial storage and memory resources. Thus, low-bitrate compression is crucial, especially in modern games demanding higher texture resolutions. Concurrent methodologies in texture compression predominantly employ a block-based paradigm based on color space, which inevitably leads to representational redundancies and a limited compression scope, particularly at lower bitrates. In the context of mobile devices, bandwidth during texture loading and runtime memory are major bottlenecks, making existing compression algorithms inadequate for high-resolution textures. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel multi-resolution texture compression scheme, Neural Block Compression (NBC), developed within the neural feature domain. Our encoding scheme is constructed on a hierarchy of multi-resolution neural feature blocks, and the key ingredient is the variable bitrates quantization scheme. It allocates higher bitrates to higher feature mip-levels and lower bitrates to lower feature mip-levels, thereby extending the concept of block compression from color domain into neural feature domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior texture compression quality achieved by the proposed scheme, especially at low bitrates.
