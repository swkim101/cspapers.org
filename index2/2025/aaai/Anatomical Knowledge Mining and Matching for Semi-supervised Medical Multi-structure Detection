In medical image analysis, detecting multiple structures is crucial for evaluations and diagnosis but is often limited by the lack of high-quality annotations. Semi-supervised object detection emerges as a potent methodology to enhance model performance and generalization by leveraging a vast pool of unlabeled data alongside a minimal set of labeled data. A striking observation is that both unlabelled and labeled medical images contain a priori anatomical knowledge from human screening. In this work, we introduce a novel semi-supervised approach named Semi-akmm for mining and matching anatomical knowledge in ultrasound images. We develop an Adaptive Prior Knowledge Transfer (APKT) module to mine and explore the distribution and knowledge of potential proposal boxes by proposal proportion constraint. Furthermore, within a teacher-student learning framework, we put forward an Anatomical Structure Matching (ASM) module to facilitate co-learning consistent topological prior knowledge between the student and teacher models. To our knowledge, this marks the inception of an efficient semi-supervised medical multi-structure detection model. Our experiments across five publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that Semi-akmm sets a new benchmark in performance with solid results that outperform existing methods.
