Spatiotemporal forecasting (STF) is pivotal in urban computing, yet data scarcity in developing cities hampers robust model training. Addressing this, recent studies leverage transfer learning to migrate knowledge from data-rich (source) to data-poor (target) cities. This strategy, while effective, faces challenges as pre-trained models risk absorbing noise and harmful information due to data distribution disparities, potentially undermining the accuracy of forecasts for target cities. To address this issue, we propose a one-stage STF framework named Target-Skewed Joint Training (TSJT). Central to TSJT is a novel Target-Skewed Backward training strategy that selectively refines gradients from source city data, preserving only the elements that positively impact the target city. To further enhance the quality of these gradients, we have designed a Node Prompting Module (NPM). TSJT is crafted for seamless integration with existing STF models, endowing them with the capability to efficiently tackle challenges stemming from data scarcity. Experimental results on several real-world datasets from multiple cities substantiate the efficacy of TSJT in the realm of cross-city transfer learning.
