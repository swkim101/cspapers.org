Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a childhood cancer prevalent worldwide, which can prove fatal within weeks or months. However, current diagnosis models based on machine learning and deep learning methods fail to consider device noise (pixel-level perturbations) and rotation/translation (spatial-transformed perturbations), which can undermine the model's robustness. Adversarial training is a potential solution to this issue. This paper presents a hybrid perturbation adversarial training (HPAT) strategy that leverages two types of adversarial samples: pixel-level adversarial samples and spatial adversarial samples. This work generates these hybrid adversarial samples through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) in couple with spatial transformation based on the Bayesian optimization (STBO) algorithm, respectively. This work introduced the Mixed Batch Normalization (MixBN) module to handle both adversarial samples and clean samples, alleviating the problem of clean accuracy degradation due to adversarial training. The proposed hybrid adversarial training strategy is tested on the public acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset and found that it outperformed existing acute lymphoblastic cell classification models.
