The co-design of neural network architectures, quantization precisions, and hardware accelerators offers a promising approach to achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, particularly for model deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we propose the JAQ Framework, which jointly optimizes the three critical dimensions. However, effectively automating the design process across the vast search space of those three dimensions poses significant challenges, especially when pursuing extremely low-bit quantization. Specifical, the primary challenges include: (1) Memory overhead in software-side: Low-precision quantization-aware training can lead to significant memory usage due to storing large intermediate features and latent weights for backpropagation, potentially causing memory exhaustion. (2) Search time-consuming in hardware-side: The discrete nature of hardware parameters and the complex interplay between compiler optimizations and individual operators make the accelerator search time-consuming. To address these issues, JAQ mitigates the memory overhead through a channel-wise sparse quantization (CSQ) scheme, selectively applying quantization to the most sensitive components of the model during optimization. Additionally, JAQ designs BatchTile, which employs a hardware generation network to encode all possible tiling modes, thereby speeding up the search for the optimal compiler mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JAQ, achieving approximately 7% higher Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to previous methods and reducing the hardware search time per iteration to 0.15 seconds.
