Defining a reward function is usually a challenging but critical task for the system designer in reinforcement learning, especially when specifying complex behaviors. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising approach to circumvent this. In RLHF, the agent typically learns a reward function by querying a human teacher using pairwise comparisons of trajectory segments. A key question in this domain is how to reduce the number of queries necessary to learn an informative reward function since asking a human teacher too many queries is impractical and costly. To tackle this question, we propose DUO, a novel method for diverse, uncertain, on-policy query generation and selection in RLHF. Our method produces queries that are (1) more relevant for policy training (via an on-policy criterion), (2) more informative (via a principled measure of epistemic uncertainty), and (3) diverse (via a clustering-based filter). Experimental results on a variety of locomotion and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method can outperform state-of-the-art RLHF methods given the same total budget of queries, while being robust to possibly irrational teachers.
