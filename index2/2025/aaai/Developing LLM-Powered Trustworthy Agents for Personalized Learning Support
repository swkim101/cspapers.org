Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in educational applications, but challenges such as hallucinations, lack of contextual relevance, and limited personalization impede their practical adoption. To address these issues, my research introduces MerryQuery, an LLM-powered educational agent that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), rule-based content control, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The system features a dynamic learning profile module for adaptive personalization and a multi-step verification framework that cross-checks responses against external sources to enhance trustworthiness. A functional prototype of MerryQuery is being piloted in a real-world classroom. Preliminary results demonstrate improved response reliability and student understanding.
