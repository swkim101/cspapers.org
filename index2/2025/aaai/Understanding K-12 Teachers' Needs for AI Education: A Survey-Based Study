With the rapid rise of AI technologies such as ChatGPT, understanding and integrating AI into K-12 education has become increasingly important. However, teachers often lack the AI literacy necessary to navigate these tools, which can lead to the perpetuation of misconceptions and biases in the classroom. This study seeks to identify K-12 teachers’ self-identified needs regarding AI education and compare them with existing research on professional development (PD) for AI integration. We surveyed 34 K-12 teachers to assess their knowledge of AI, identify areas where they require further support, and evaluate the relevance of current PD offerings. Our findings reveal a significant disconnect between the top-down assumptions of expert-driven PD initiatives and the practical needs articulated by teachers. Key themes emerged, including a diverse range of AI understanding among educators, a strong preference for hands-on, practical training, and a demand for ongoing institutional support. Additionally, teachers expressed a desire for collaborative learning environments to share strategies and experiences related to AI. This study underscores the importance of tailoring PD programs to address the unique contexts and challenges faced by educators, advocating for a more personalized approach that fosters confidence and competence in AI integration. By aligning PD offerings with teachers’ needs, we aim to enhance their ability to effectively utilize AI tools in the classroom, ultimately enriching the educational experience for students.
