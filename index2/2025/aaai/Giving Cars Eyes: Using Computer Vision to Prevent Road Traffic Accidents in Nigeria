This paper explores the application of computer vision technology as a proactive solution to prevent Road Traffic Accidents in Nigeria. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and real-time video analysis, computer vision can reduce incidents caused by human error. The research focuses on designing an autonomous but elaborate system that monitors traffic patterns, road irregularities and triggers automated interventions when risky conditions are detected. The aim is to suggest that computer vision can be pivotal in enhancing road safety and reducing traffic-related fatalities in Nigeria.
