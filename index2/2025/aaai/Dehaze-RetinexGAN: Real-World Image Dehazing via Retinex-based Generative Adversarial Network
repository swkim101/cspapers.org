Deep learning based dehazing networks trained on paired synthetic data have shown impressive performance, but they struggle with significant degradation in generalization ability on real-world hazy scenes. 
In this paper, we propose Dehaze-RetinexGAN, a lightweight Retinex-based Generative Adversarial Network for real-world image Dehazing using unpaired data. Our Dehaze-RetinexGAN consists of two stages: self-supervised pre-training and weakly-supervised fine-tuning. During the pre-training, we reduce the image dehazing task to an illumination-reflectance decomposition task based on the duality correlation between Retinex and dehazing. Specifically, a decomposition network named DecomNet is constructed to obtain an illumination and a reflectance, simultaneously. Moreover, a self-supervised learning strategy is developed to construct the connection between the preliminary dehazed result and the input hazy image, which constrains the solution space of DecomNet and accelerates training, leading to a more realistic dehazed result. In the fine-tuning stage, we develop a dual DTCWT-based attention module and embed it into the U-Net architecture to further improve the quality of preliminary result in the frequency domain. In addition, the adversarial learning is employed to constrain the relevance between the clean image and the final dehazed result in a weakly supervised manner, which can promote more natural performance. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably over state-of-the-art dehazing methods in visual quality and quantitative evaluation.
