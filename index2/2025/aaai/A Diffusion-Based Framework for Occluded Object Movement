Seamlessly moving objects within a scene is a common requirement for image editing, but it is still a challenge for existing editing methods. Especially for real-world images, the occlusion situation further increases the difficulty. The main difficulty is that the occluded portion needs to be completed before movement can proceed. To leverage the real-world knowledge embedded in the pre-trained diffusion models, we propose a Diffusion-based framework specifically designed for Occluded Object Movement, named DiffOOM. The proposed DiffOOM consists of two parallel branches that perform object de-occlusion and movement simultaneously. The de-occlusion branch utilizes a background color-fill strategy and a continuously updated object mask to focus the diffusion process on completing the obscured portion of the target object. Concurrently, the movement branch employs latent optimization to place the completed object in the target location and adopts local text-conditioned guidance to integrate the object into new surroundings appropriately. Extensive evaluations across various metrics demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which is further validated by a comprehensive user study.
