Humanâ€“Computer Interaction for AI Systems Design is an eight-week short online course aimed at professional students. It is part of an online course platform called Cambridge Advance Online, which is a joint effort between Cambridge University Press & Assessment and the University of Cambridge. This course launched in July 2023 amidst a massive increase in interest in AI and its applications, and quickly became one of the platform's highest-enrolling courses, attracting about 50 students per quarterly course run. To date, more than 200 students have completed the course, and more than 90 percent have rated their experience `good' or `excellent'. This paper reports on our experiences in designing and teaching this course.
