Ocean exploration requires effective collaboration between the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We propose UACOF, a USV-AUV collaboration framework that enhances multi-AUV performance under extreme sea conditions. The framework includes high-precision multi-AUV location via USV path planning with Fisher information matrix optimization and reinforcement learning training for cooperative tasks. Experimental results show UACOF's superior feasibility, performance, coordination and robustness in extreme conditions.
