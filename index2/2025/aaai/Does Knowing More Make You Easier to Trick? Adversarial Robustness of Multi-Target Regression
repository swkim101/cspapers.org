Following the rapid rise of deep learning (DL) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of how these machine learning (ML) systems actually learn. What information are DL models retaining from the training data? What reasoning capabilities do these models have? In my proposed project, I aim to tackle these pressing questions through use of an adversarial lens.
