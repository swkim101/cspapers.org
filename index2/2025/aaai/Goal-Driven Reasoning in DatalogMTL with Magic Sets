DatalogMTL is a powerful rule-based language for temporal reasoning. Due to its high expressive power and flexible modeling capabilities, it is suitable for a wide range of applications, including tasks from industrial and financial sectors. However, due its high computational complexity, practical reasoning in DatalogMTL is highly challenging. To address this difficulty, we introduce a new reasoning method for DatalogMTL which exploits the magic sets techniqueâ€”a rewriting approach developed for (non-temporal) Datalog to simulate top-down evaluation with bottom-up reasoning. We have implemented this approach and evaluated it on publicly available benchmarks, showing that the proposed approach significantly and consistently outperformed state-of-the-art reasoning techniques.
