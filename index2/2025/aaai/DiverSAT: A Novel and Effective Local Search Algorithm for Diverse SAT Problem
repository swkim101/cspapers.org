For many real-world problems, users are often interested not only in finding a single solution but in obtaining a sufficiently diverse collection of solutions. In this work, we consider the Diverse SAT problem, aiming to find a set of diverse satisfying assignments for a given propositional formula. We propose a novel and effective local search algorithm, DiverSAT, to solve the problem. To cope with diversity, we introduce three heuristics and a perturbation strategy based on some relevant information. We conduct extensive experiments on a large number of public benchmarks, collected from semiformal hardware verification, logistics planning, and other domains. The results show that DiverSAT outperforms the existing algorithms on most of these benchmarks.
