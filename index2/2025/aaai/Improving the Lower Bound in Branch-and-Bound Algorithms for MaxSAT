The MaxSAT problem is an optimization version of the satisfiability problem (SAT). A tight lower bound (LB) on the number of falsified soft clauses in a MaxSAT solution is crucial for the efficiency of Branch-and-Bound (BnB) MaxSAT solvers. To compute an LB, modern BnB solvers detect disjoint inconsistent subsets of soft clauses, called cores, using unit propagation. A notable feature of these solvers is that soft clauses belonging to already detected cores cannot be reused to detect additional cores, limiting the number of cores that can be detected. In this paper, we propose an unlocking mechanism that allows the reuse of soft clauses in already detected cores while ensuring the soundness of LB. Experimental results show that this unlocking mechanism consistently improves the performance of a state-of-the-art BnB solver. In addition, it allowed us to win the first two places in the exact unweighted category of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024.
