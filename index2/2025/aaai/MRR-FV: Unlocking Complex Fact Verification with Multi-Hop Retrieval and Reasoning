The pervasive spread of misinformation on social networks highlights the critical necessity for effective fact verification systems. Traditional approaches primarily focus on pairwise correlations between claims and evidence, often neglecting comprehensive multi-hop retrieval and reasoning, which results in suboptimal performance when dealing with complex claims. In this paper, we propose MRR-FV, a generative retrieval-enhanced model designed to address the novel challenge of Multi-hop Retrieval and Reasoning for Fact Verification, which integrates two core modules: Generative Multi-hop Retriever and the Hierarchical Interaction Reasoner. MRR-FV utilizes an autoregressive model for iterative multi-hop evidence retrieval, complemented by a pre-trained compressor to address the challenge of intention shift across retrieval hops. For claim verification, we propose a hierarchical interaction reasoner that conducts intra-sentence reasoning to capture long-term semantic dependencies and inter-sentence reasoning across multi-hop evidence subgraphs to reveal complex evidence interactions. Experimental evaluations on the FEVER and HOVER datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in both claim verification and evidence retrieval tasks.
