Historical documents encompass a wealth of cultural treasures but suffer from severe damages including character missing, paper damage, and ink erosion over time. However, existing document processing methods primarily focus on binarization, enhancement, etc., neglecting the repair of these damages. To this end, we present a new task, termed Historical Document Repair (HDR), which aims to predict the original appearance of damaged historical documents. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a large-scale dataset HDR28K and a diffusion-based network DiffHDR for historical document repair. Specifically, HDR28K contains 28,552 damaged-repaired image pairs with character-level annotations and multi-style degradations. Moreover, DiffHDR augments the vanilla diffusion framework with semantic and spatial information and a meticulously designed character perceptual loss for contextual and visual coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DiffHDR trained on HDR28K significantly surpasses existing approaches and exhibits remarkable performance in handling real scenarios. Notably, DiffHDR can also be extended to document editing and text block generation, showcasing its high flexibility and generalization capacity. We believe this study could pioneer a new direction of document processing and contribute to the inheritance of invaluable cultures and civilizations.
