Mobility data from smartphones, connected cars, and GPS devices are widely used for tasks such as transportation mode classification and suspicious movement detection. Time series research, a closely related field, focuses more on classification methods. Yet, Mobility Data analysis faces unique challenges like geographic transferability and limited public data due to privacy issues. My PhD work focuses on developing reusable, interpretable MD representations. I created Trajectory Interval Forest and later Geolet, a shapelet-based transformation to improve MD classification across geographic regions. Ongoing research explores improving geographic transferability and event-based trajectory clustering.
