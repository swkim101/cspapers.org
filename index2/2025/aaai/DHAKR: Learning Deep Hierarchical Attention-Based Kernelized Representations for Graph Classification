Graph-based representations are powerful tools for analyzing structured data. In this paper, we propose a novel model to learn Deep Hierarchical Attention-based Kernelized Representations (DHAKR) for graph classification. To this end, we commence by learning an assignment matrix to hierarchically map the substructure invariants into a set of composite invariants, resulting in hierarchical kernelized representations for graphs. Moreover, we introduce the feature-channel attention mechanism to capture the interdependencies between different substructure invariants that will be converged into the composite invariants, addressing the shortcoming of discarding the importance of different substructures arising in most existing R-convolution graph kernels. We show that the proposed DHAKR model can adaptively compute the kernel-based similarity between graphs, identifying the common structural patterns over all graphs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DHAKR model.
