Oriented object detection is crucial for complex scenes such as aerial images and industrial inspection, providing precise delineation by minimizing background interference. Recently, the weakly-supervised detector paradigm H2RBox has demonstrated promise in learning rotated bounding box (RBox) from the more readily available horizontal bounding box (HBox), alleviating the scarcity and high cost of RBox annotations. However, these H2RBox-based methods have primarily focused on the gap in orientation information between HBox- and RBox-supervised approaches, overlooking the gap in training sample selection. In response, we propose the Adaptive Fine-grained Sample Mining (AFSM) strategy, which improves the selection of fine-grained training samples in HBox-supervised methods. AFSM assigns the best-matching prediction RBox to each ground truth (GT) HBox and selects positive samples based on these paired boxes. Furthermore, to effectively filter the best-matching prediction RBox for AFSM, we introduce the Prediction Rbox Assignment (PRA) scheme, employing Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) as a localization quality metric. Additionally, we introduce an improved self-supervised branch loss (Lss) to address the symmetry of weakly-supervised branch prediction boxes. Incorporating these core components (AFSM, PRA, and Lss), we develop an end-to-end network architecture (BGHR) to further bridge the gap between HBox- and RBox-supervised oriented object detection. Extensive experiments on DOTA-v1.0 and DIOR-R demonstrate that BGHR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to HBox-supervised methods without additional overhead. Even when benchmarked against fully supervised FCOS, our method still exhibits a slight performance advantage.
