The soaring drug overdose crisis in the United States has claimed more than half a million lives in the past decade and remains a major public health threat. The ability to predict drug overdose deaths at the county level can help local communities develop action plans in response to emerging changes. Applying off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms for prediction can be challenging due to the heterogeneous risk profiles of the counties and suppressed data in common publicly available data sources. To fill these gaps, we develop a cluster-aware supervised learning (CASL) framework to enhance the prediction of county-level drug overdose deaths. This CASL model simultaneously clusters counties into groups based on geographical and socioeconomic characteristics and minimizes the loss function that accounts for suppressed values and cluster-specific regularization. Our computational study uses real-world data from 2010 to 2021, focusing on the ten states most severely impacted by the drug overdose crisis. The results demonstrate that our proposed CASL framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a superior balance in prediction accuracy for both unsuppressed and suppressed observations. The proposed model also identifies different clusters of counties, capturing heterogeneous patterns of overdose mortality among counties of diverse characteristics.
