The complexity of the shipping industry, dynamic operational drivers, and diverse data sources present significant scalability challenges for digital twins. Agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with external tools offer a promising solution to accelerate digital twin adoption. Using pre-trained knowledge and reasoning capabilities, these LLMs autonomously select optimal tools and data streams for user-specific queries, enabling language to serve as a universal interface between digital twins and various stakeholders, from technicians to fleet managers. This interface facilitates real-time decision making and insight generation across multiple operational workflows. In this demonstration, we present an interactive agentic digital twin designed to enhance scalability, flexibility, and efficiency in managing the extensive and intricate decision-making requirements of the shipping industry. We showcase the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in reducing complexity and improving the practical application of digital twins, ultimately enabling more efficient operations in real-world settings.
