Language steganography in social networks primarily focuses on embedding secret information into social media text efficiently to achieve covert communication. The misuse of such techniques could pose significant potential threats to public cyberspace, such as the spread of malicious code, commands, or viruses. Existing social text steganalysis techniques mainly focus on the analysis of individual social media texts. However, the information content in a single text is very limited, leading to poor detection performance in practical applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a social text steganalysis method that combines large-scale language models with common-sense knowledge graphs (STLC-KG). This method first uses knowledge graphs to expand the knowledge contained in the text under investigation, enriching its linguistic expression, and then utilizes large-scale language models to extract the linguistic features of the social text. The results of tests conducted on three mainstream social media platforms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of social text steganalysis.
