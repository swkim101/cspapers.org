Federated Multi-View Clustering (FMVC) aims to learn a global clustering model from heterogeneous data distributed across different devices, where each device only stores one view of all clustering samples. The key to deal with such problem lies in how to effectively fuse these heterogeneous samples while strictly preserve the data privacy across multiple devices. In this paper, we propose a novel structural graph learning framework named MGCD, which leverages both consistency and diversity of multi-view graph structure across global view-fusion server and local view-specific clients to achieve desired clustering while better preserves data privacy. Specifically, in each local client, we design a dual autoencoder to extract the latent consensuses and specificities of each view, where self-representation construction is introduced to generate the corresponding view-specific diversity graph. In the global server, the consistency implied in uploaded diversity graphs are further distilled and then incorporated into the consistency graph for subsequent cross-view contrastive fusion. During the training process, the server generates a global consistency graph and distributes it to each client for assisting in diversity graph construction, while the clients extract view-specific information and upload it to the server for more reliable consistency graph generation. The ``server-client'' interaction is conducted in an iterative manner, where the consistency implied in each local client is gradually aggregated into the global consistency graph, and the final clustering results are obtained by spectral clustering on the desired global consistency graph. Extensive experiments on various datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method on clustering federated multi-view data.
