In the context of Omni-Directional Image (ODI) Super-Resolution (SR), the unique challenge arises from the non-uniform oversampling characteristics caused by EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). Considerable efforts in designing complex spherical convolutions or polyhedron reprojection offer significant performance improvements but at the expense of cumbersome processing procedures and slower inference speeds. Under these circumstances, this paper proposes a new ODI-SR model characterized by its capacity to perform Fast and Arbitrary-scale ODI-SR processes, denoted as FAOR. The key innovation lies in adapting the implicit image function from the planar image domain to the ERP image domain by incorporating spherical geometric priors at both the latent representation and image reconstruction stages, in a low-overhead manner. Specifically, at the latent representation stage, we adopt a pair of pixel-wise and semantic-wise sphere-to-planar distortion maps to perform affine transformations on the latent representation, thereby incorporating it with spherical properties. Moreover, during the image reconstruction stage, we introduce a geodesic-based resampling strategy, aligning the implicit image function with spherical geometrics without introducing additional parameters. As a result, the proposed FAOR outperforms the state-of-the-art ODI-SR models with a much faster inference speed. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.
