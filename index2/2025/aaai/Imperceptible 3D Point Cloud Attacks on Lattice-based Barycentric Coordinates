Imperceptible adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds rely on effective constraints. While manifold constraints have notable advantages over Euclidean ones, the global parameterization used in current methods often fails to fully preserve manifold properties. In this paper, we propose to constrain lattice-based barycentric coordinates during attacks from a local parametric perspective to ensure imperceptibility. Specifically, we utilize a permutohedral lattice to partition point clouds into multiple cells, and then extract barycentric coordinates for each point within these cells, forming a local parametric representation of the point clouds. By enforcing local parametric constraints that minimize the displacement of barycentric coordinates, we largely preserve the manifold properties, ultimately leading to improved imperceptibility. Extensive experiments validate that integrating these local parametric constraints into conventional adversarial attacks yields superior imperceptibility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
