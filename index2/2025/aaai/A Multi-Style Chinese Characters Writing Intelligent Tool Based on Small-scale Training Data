Chinese characters are a unique blend of language and art, featuring diverse artistic styles. Mastering these styles requires extensive practice and limits public participation. To encourage broader participation, we developed a real-time, interactive tool that supports multiple Chinese character art styles. This tool uses a diffusion model and several LoRA models to capture the diversity of Chinese character art. It generates personalized, visually striking Chinese character artworks in real-time by utilizing handwritten input, allowing users to adjust various stylistic parameters.
