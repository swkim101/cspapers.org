In recent years, diffusion modeling has shown great potential for image generation and editing. Beyond single-model approaches, various drawing workflows now exist to handle diverse drawing tasks. However, few solutions effectively identify user intentions through dialogue and progressively complete drawings. We introduce DialogDraw, which facilitates image generation and editing through continuous dialogue interaction. DialogDraw enables users to create and refine drawings using natural language and integrates with numerous open-source drawing workflows and models. The system accurately recognizes intentions and extracts user inputs via parameterization, adapts to various drawing function parameters, and provides an intuitive interaction mode. It effectively executes user instructions, supports dozens of image generation and editing methods, and offers robust scalability. Moreover, we employ SFT and RLHF to iterate the Intention Recognition and Parameter Extraction Model (IRPEM). To evaluate DialogDraw's functionality, we propose DrawnConvos, a dataset rich in drawing functions and command dialogue data collected from the open-source community. Our evaluation demonstrates that DialogDraw excels in command compliance, identifying and adapting to user drawing intentions, thereby proving the effectiveness of our method.
