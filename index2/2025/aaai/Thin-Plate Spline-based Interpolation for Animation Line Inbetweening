Animation line inbetweening is a crucial step in animation production aimed at enhancing animation fluidity by predicting intermediate line arts between two key frames. 
However, existing methods face challenges in effectively addressing sparse pixels and significant motion in line art key frames. 
In literature, Chamfer Distance (CD) is commonly adopted for evaluating inbetweening performance. 
Despite achieving favorable CD values, existing methods often generate interpolated frames with line disconnections, especially for scenarios involving large motion. 
Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple yet effective interpolation method for animation line inbetweening that adopts thin-plate spline-based transformation to estimate coarse motion more accurately by modeling the keypoint correspondence between two key frames, particularly for large motion scenarios.
Building upon the coarse estimation, a motion refine module is employed to further enhance motion details before final frame interpolation using a simple UNet model.
Furthermore, to more accurately assess the performance of animation line inbetweening, we refine the CD metric and introduce a novel metric termed Weighted Chamfer Distance, which demonstrates a higher consistency with visual perception quality. Additionally, we incorporate Earth Mover's Distance and conduct user study to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Our method outperforms existing approaches by delivering high-quality interpolation results with enhanced fluidity.
