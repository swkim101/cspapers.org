Graph anomaly detection is crucial for identifying anomalous nodes within graphs and addressing applications like financial fraud detection and social spam detection. Recent spectral graph neural network methods advance graph anomaly detection by focusing on anomalies that notably affect the distribution of graph spectral energy. Such spectrum-based methods rely on two steps: graph wavelet extraction and feature fusion. However, both steps are hand-designed, capturing incomprehensive anomaly information of wavelet-specific features and resulting in their inconsistent feature fusion. To address these problems, we propose a dynamic spectral graph anomaly detection framework DSGAD to adaptively capture comprehensive anomaly information and perform consistent feature fusion. DSGAD introduces dynamic wavelets, consisting of trainable wavelets to adaptively learn anomalous patterns and capture wavelet-specific features with comprehensive anomaly information. Furthermore, the consistent fusion of wavelet-specific features achieves dynamic fusion by combining wavelet-specific feature extraction with energy difference and channel convolution fusion using location correlation. Experimental results on four datasets substantiate the efficacy of our DSGAD method, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.
