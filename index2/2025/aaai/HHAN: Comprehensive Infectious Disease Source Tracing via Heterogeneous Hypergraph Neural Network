Infectious diseases have historically had profound effects on global health, economies, and social structures. Effective tracing of infectious diseases is essential not only for immediate public health responses but also for shaping future prevention strategies. Traditional tracing methods often emphasize homogeneous networks, overlooking the diverse transmission characteristics of heterogeneous populations. This research addresses two critical challenges: the heterogeneity of transmission across various media and modes, and the significant yet underexplored influence of community structures on epidemic spread and tracing.We propose a Heterogeneous Hypergraph Attention Network (HHAN) modelthat accounts for multiple transmission pathways and patterns within heterogeneous networks. HHAN integrates a heterogeneous graph neural network module to handle the complexity of communication among different populations, and an Agent-Based Modeling Module that combines agent-based ideas to model individual behaviors. This approach effectively captures complex interactions within community structures and addresses individual variability. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the HHAN model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in tackling the complex challenge of tracing infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations.
