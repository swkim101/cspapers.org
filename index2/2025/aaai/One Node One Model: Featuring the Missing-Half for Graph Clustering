Most existing graph clustering methods primarily focus on exploiting topological structure, often neglecting the "missing-half" node feature information, especially how these features can enhance clustering performance. This issue is further compounded by the challenges associated with high-dimensional features. Feature selection in graph clustering is particularly difficult because it requires simultaneously discovering clusters and identifying the relevant features for these clusters. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm called "one node one model", which builds an exclusive model for each node and defines the node label as a combination of predictions for node groups. Specifically, the proposed "Feature Personalized Graph Clustering (FPGC)" method identifies cluster-relevant features for each node using a squeeze-and-excitation block, integrating these features into each model to form the final representations. Additionally, the concept of feature cross is developed as a data augmentation technique to learn low-order feature interactions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FPGC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods. Moreover, the plug-and-play nature of our method provides a versatile solution to enhance GNN-based models from the feature perspective.
