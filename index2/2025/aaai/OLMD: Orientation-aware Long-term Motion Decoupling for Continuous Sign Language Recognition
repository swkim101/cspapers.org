The primary challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) mainly stems from the presence of multi-orientational and long-term motions. However, current research overlooks these crucial aspects, significantly impacting accuracy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel CSLR framework: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling (OLMD), which efficiently aggregates long-term motions and decouples multi-orientational signals into easily interpretable components. Specifically, our innovative Long-term Motion Aggregation (LMA) module filters out static redundancy while adaptively capturing abundant features of long-term motions.
 We further enhance orientation awareness by decoupling complex movements into horizontal and vertical components, allowing for motion purification in both orientations.
Additionally, two coupling mechanisms are proposed: stage and cross-stage coupling, which together enrich multi-scale features and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Experimentally, OLMD shows SOTA performance on three large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily. Notably, we improve the word error rate (WER) on PHOENIX14 by 
an absolute 1.6% compared to the previous SOTA.
