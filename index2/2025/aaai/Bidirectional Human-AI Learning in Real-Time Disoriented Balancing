We present a real-time system that enables bidirectional human-AI learning and teaching in a balancing task that is a realistic analogue of disorientation during piloting and spaceflight. A human subject and autonomous AI model of choice guide each other in maintaining balance using a visual inverted pendulum (VIP) display. We show how AI assistance changes human performance and vice versa.
