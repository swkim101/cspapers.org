Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy is increasingly important across many fields, yet caregivers remain underrepresented in AI-related fields due to a combination of systemic and individual barriers. To address this, the Caregivers and Machine Learning (C&ML) program developed and delivered an accessible AI education program to caregivers on parental leave. Two cohorts participated in this 6-week interprofessional program, featuring fundamental machine learning concepts, hands-on programming assignments, and a capstone project. This study examines the program's impact on participants, focusing on their motivations and barriers before, during, and after the program as outcomes after completion.

Post-program surveys and semi-structured interviews highlight that caregivers often face barriers such as the rapid pace of AI, discrimination, and balancing caregiving responsibilities with learning new skills. The C&ML program's flexible structure and personalized support network were critical in enabling participants to fully engage in the program, leading to significant improvements in their knowledge of ML and increased confidence in applying these skills. After completing the program, 20\% of participants transitioned into AI-related roles or pursued further education. This research highlights the value of targeted, inclusive educational programs for underrepresented groups and provides practical recommendations for refining future AI training programs for caregivers.
