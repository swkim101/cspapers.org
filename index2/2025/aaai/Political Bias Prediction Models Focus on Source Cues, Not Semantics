Significant efforts have been made to analyze the political stance or bias in news articles, especially as political polarization intensifies over the years. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled researchers to develop various bias prediction models, which typically learn features not only from the text of the news articles but also from external knowledge. However, when training these models, the political bias label assigned to a news article is often based solely on the news source which published it. This approach can be problematic, as a news outlet with a particular political stance might publish an article that reflects a different political perspective. To address this issue, we first identify distinct text patterns associated with specific news sources or publishers, that are minimally relevant to predicting the political bias of a news article. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate (i) whether existing models trained to predict political bias can also accurately predict the source, and (ii) whether these models change their predictions when a distinct pattern from a source with a different political stance is incorporated into a news article. Our experimental results reveal that all existing models tend to predict the source, even when trained solely to predict bias. Based on these findings, we propose a new deep learning model for political bias prediction that avoids learning source-indicative patterns specific to a given news source.
