In this paper, we present PRIORITY2REWARD a Large Language Model (LLM) based application which incorporates health worker preferences for resource allocation planning in public health programs. LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning problems. We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In the context of public health, our approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. We showcase a simulated application of PRIORITY2REWARD for a large-scale mobile health program in India. The tool allows health workers to enter natural language preferences and leverages LLMs to search for reward functions aligned with the preference. Our tool then dynamically showcases how the LLM generated reward function modifies the policy outcomes with respect to different demographic groups in the population. This can help inform policy implementation at a community level.
