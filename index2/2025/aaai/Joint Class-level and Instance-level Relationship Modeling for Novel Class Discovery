Novel class discovery(NCD) aims to cluster the unlabeled data with the help of a labeled set containing different but related classes. The key to solving NCD is the knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled sets.Since NCD requires that known classes and unknown classes are related, it is significant to explore class-level relationships between known and unknown for more effective knowledge transfer. However, most existing methods either facilitate knowledge transfer by learning a shared representation space or by modeling coarse-grained or asymmetric relationships between known and unknown, neglecting class-level relationships. To tackle these challenges, we propose a symmetric class-to-class relationship modeling and knowledge transfer method, achieving bidirectional knowledge transfer at class-level. Considering that class-level modeling often overlooks the subtle distinctions between samples, we propose pairwise similarity-based relationship modeling and consistency constraint for instance-level knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and three fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.
