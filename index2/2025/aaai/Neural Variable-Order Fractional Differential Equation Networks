The use of neural differential equation models in machine learning applications has gained significant traction in recent years. In particular, fractional differential equations (FDEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for capturing complex dynamics in various domains. While existing models have primarily focused on constant-order fractional derivatives, variable-order fractional operators offer a more flexible and expressive framework for modeling complex memory patterns. In this work, we introduce the Neural Variable-Order Fractional Differential Equation network (NvoFDE), a novel neural network framework that integrates variable-order fractional derivatives with learnable neural networks. Our framework allows for the modeling of adaptive derivative orders dependent on hidden features, capturing more complex feature-updating dynamics and providing enhanced flexibility. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results demonstrate that NvoFDE outperforms traditional constant-order fractional and integer models across a range of tasks, showcasing its superior adaptability and performance.
