Massive open online courses (MOOCs) recommendation provides online courses tailored to learners' individual preferences. Existing literature is limited by: 1) Ignoring the interrelations among courses, knowledge concepts, and videos, which leads to suboptimal recommendation performance; 2) Neglecting the hierarchical interactions between learners and components like courses, knowledge concepts, and videos, which makes it difficult to capture learners' intentions accurately. To address them, we propose a novel multi-type MOOCs recommendation framework, which enables multi-type educational content recommendations. This framework includes two important components: multi-relational representation and hierarchical reasoning. Regarding multi-relational representation, we first create two static course-relational and knowledge concept-relational graphs based on domain knowledge and construct a dynamic video-relational graph using learners' browsing historical sequences. Then, we capture the interactions among different components by learning the corresponding embeddings via graph neural networks. Regarding hierarchical reasoning, we implement a hierarchical beam search strategy to narrow down the candidate courses, knowledge concepts, and videos by calculating joint probability. Finally, we introduce an optional layer to increase the diversity and reasonableness of video recommendations by estimating learners' intentions. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability of our method.
