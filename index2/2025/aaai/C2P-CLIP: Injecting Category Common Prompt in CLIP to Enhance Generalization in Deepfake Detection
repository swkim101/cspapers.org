This work focuses on AIGC detection to develop universal detectors capable of identifying various types of forgery images. Recent studies have found large pre-trained models, such as CLIP, are effective for generalizable deepfake detection along with linear classifiers. However, two critical issues remain unresolved: 1) understanding why CLIP features are effective on deepfake detection through a linear classifier; and 2) exploring the detection potential of CLIP. In this study, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of CLIP's detection capabilities by decoding its detection features into text and performing word frequency analysis. Our finding indicates that CLIP detects deepfakes by recognizing similar concepts. Building on this insight, we introduce Category Common Prompt CLIP, called C2P-CLIP, which integrates the category common prompt into the text encoder to inject category-related concepts into the image encoder, thereby enhancing detection performance. Our method achieves a 12.4% improvement in detection accuracy compared to the original CLIP.
