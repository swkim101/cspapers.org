Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved significantly in recent decades, and, along with it, its applications to real-world scenarios. AI has been used within a wide variety of fields like health care and e-commerce, however, AI has yet to integrate with the agriculture industry. With the help of machine learning, AI can begin to integrate with the industry via a research assistant. The model will assist researchers conduct experiments by giving treatment methods that are best suited for the experiment rather than relying on the expertise of the researcher. This will help research within the industry to become more efficient and less error prone. To accomplish this, the model will use a Knowledge Graph created by the IDIR lab that converts the large CSV files into a graph that can be queried and then summarized by the model.
