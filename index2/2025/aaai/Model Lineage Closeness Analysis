As machine learning model modification techniques are extensively employed to obtain well-performing models at reduced costs, several studies have emerged to determine the presence of a modification relationship (i.e., lineage) between models. However, these methods are not robust to high-impact modification techniques and none of them have addressed the measurement of lineage closeness, which quantifies the degrees of modification.
 In this work, we visualize the changes in model decision boundaries resulting from different modification techniques and conclude that differences in decision boundaries serve as a precise metric of lineage closeness. Building upon this insight, we propose a modification-type agnostic and task-agnostic method to measure model lineage closeness by calculating mean adversarial distances from data points to decision boundaries and matching rate of data points, with data points selected through an efficient sampling method to reduce computational overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel indirect measurement approach to support lineage closeness measurement for models with different tasks. 
 Finally, comprehensive experiments show that our design achieves an impressive 97% accuracy in lineage determination, and can precisely measure model lineage closeness for different modifications.
