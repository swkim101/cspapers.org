We adopt a parametric approach to analyze the worst-case degradation in social welfare when the allocation of indivisible goods is constrained to be fair. Specifically, we are concerned with cardinality-constrained allocations, which require that each agent has at most k items in their allocated bundle. We propose the notion of the price of cardinality, which captures the worst-case multiplicative loss of utilitarian or egalitarian social welfare resulting from imposing the cardinality constraint. We then characterize tight or almost-tight bounds on the price of cardinality as exact functions of the instance parameters, demonstrating how the social welfare improves as k is increased. In particular, one of our main results refines and generalizes the existing asymptotic bound of Θ(√n) on the price of balancedness. We also further extend our analysis to the problem where the items are partitioned into disjoint categories, and each category has its own cardinality constraint. Through a parametric study of the price of cardinality, we provide a framework which aids decision makers in choosing an ideal level of cardinality-based fairness, using their knowledge of the potential loss of utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare.
