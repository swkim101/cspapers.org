The increasing adoption of conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) raises questions about its effects across culturally diverse interactions. While these agents are linguistically versatile and multilingual, their ability to adapt along cultural dimensions--defined as geographically and communally nurtured sets of values and behavioral norms--lacks close scrutiny of both their design and deployment. To achieve inclusive conversational AI, it is essential to understand how agents adapt to users from diverse cultural backgrounds. In this study, we analyze dialogues between human users from different countries and LLM-powered agents to examine how both parties adapt their word use, a salient aspect of linguistic styles, toward one another throughout casual conversations. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit varying degrees of style matching based on users' national cultures and demonstrate asymmetric adaptation when interacting with culturally diverse users. Moreover, we observe a reciprocal dynamic where both the LLMs and users from certain cultures adjust their styles in response to one another. Additionally, our findings support the hypothesis that LLMs and users naturally converge in conversational styles over the course of interactions, mirroring the dynamics of human conversations that accommodate and converge. 
To develop localized and culturally aware agents, there's a potential to utilize such cross-cultural convergence process during fine-tuning to align LLMs.
