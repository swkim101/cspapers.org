The maximin optimisation problem, inspired by Von Neumann’s work (von Neumann 1928) and widely applied in adversarial optimisation, has become a key research area in machine learning. Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) is a common method for solving these problems but requires the pay-off function to be differentiable, making it unsuitable for discrete or binary functions that often occur in game-theoretical scenarios. Co-evolutionary algorithms (CoEAs), which are derivative-free, offer an alternative to these problems. However, the theoretical understanding of CoEAs is still limited. 

This paper provides the first rigorous runtime analysis of CoEAs with pairwise dominance on binary two-player zero-sum games (or maximin problems), specifically focusing on the DIAGONAL game. The mathematical analysis rigorously shows that the PDCoEA can efficiently find the optimum in polynomial runtime with high probability under low mutation rates and large population sizes. Empirical evidence also identifies an error threshold where higher mutation rates lead to inefficiency. In contrast, single-pair-individual algorithms, i.e., RLS-PD and (1+1)-CoEAs, fail to find the optimum in polynomial time. These findings highlight the usefulness of pairwise dominance, low mutation rates, and large populations in maintaining a “co-evolutionary arms race”.
