In recent years, predicting Big Five personality traits from multimodal data has received significant attention in artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing computational models often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Psychological research has shown a strong correlation between pose and personality traits, yet previous research has largely ignored pose data in computational models. To address this gap, we develop a novel multimodal dataset that incorporates full-body pose data. The dataset includes video recordings of 287 participants completing a virtual interview with 36 questions, along with self-reported Big Five personality scores as labels. To effectively utilize this multimodal data, we introduce the Psychology-Inspired Network (PINet), which consists of three key modules: Multimodal Feature Awareness (MFA), Multimodal Feature Interaction (MFI), and Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss (PIMC Loss). The MFA module leverages the Vision Mamba Block to capture comprehensive visual features related to personality, while the MFI module efficiently fuses the multimodal features. The PIMC Loss, grounded in psychological theory, guides the model to emphasize different modalities for different personality dimensions. Experimental results show that the PINet outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore, the three modules of PINet contribute almost equally to the model’s overall performance. Incorporating pose data significantly enhances the model’s performance, with the pose modality ranking mid-level in importance among the five modalities. These findings address the existing gap in personality-related datasets that lack full-body pose data and provide a new approach for improving the accuracy of personality prediction models, highlighting the importance of integrating psychological insights into AI frameworks.
