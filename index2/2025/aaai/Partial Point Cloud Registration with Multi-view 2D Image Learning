Learning representations from numerous 2D image data has shown promising performance, yet very few works apply this representations to point cloud registration. In this paper, we explore how to leverage the 2D information to assist the point cloud registration, and propose IAPReg, an Image-Assisted Partial 3D point cloud Registration framework with the multi-view images generated by the input point cloud. It is expected to enrich 3D information with 2D knowledge, and leverage 2D knowledge to assist with point cloud registration. Specifically, we create multi-view depth maps by projecting the input point cloud from several specific views, and then extract 2D and 3D features using some well-established models. To fuse the information learned from 2D and 3D modalities, inter-modality multi-view learning module is proposed to enhance geometric information and complement semantic information. Weighted SVD is a common method to reduce the impact of inaccurate correspondences on registration. However, determining the correspondence weights is not trivial. Therefore, we design a 2D-weighted SVD method, where the 2D knowledge is employed to provide weight information of correspondences. Extensive experiments perform that our method outperform the state-of-the-art method without additional 2D training data.
