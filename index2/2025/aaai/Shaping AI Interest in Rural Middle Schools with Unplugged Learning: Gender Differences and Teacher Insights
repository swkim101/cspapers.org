Adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is at an inflection point. With daily use of AI escalating due to widely available software tools, educators, researchers, and policymakers must adapt swiftly to changing educational needs. While think tanks and Big Tech companies often promote the notion that AI serves as a powerful tool for democratizing access to knowledge and opportunities, our work in rural communities underscores the disparity in access to AI education and related opportunities. In this paper, we report on our experience introducing foundational AI concepts to rural middle school students using an unplugged game-based learning activity. By providing engaging learning experiences to rural populations, we hope to broaden interest in and understanding of AI technologies. To this end, we conducted a classroom study in which two middle school teachers implemented our unplugged AI learning activity with their students. Analyzing survey data from 60 of the participating students, we explore the impact of the activity on their interest in AI, their conceptual understanding, and examine potential gender differences. Additionally, we share insights from the teachers who participated in our professional development sessions in preparation for the classroom implementations.
