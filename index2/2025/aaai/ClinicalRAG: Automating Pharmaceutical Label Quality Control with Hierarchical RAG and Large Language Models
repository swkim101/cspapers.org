Every pharmaceutical product must be accompanied by a comprehensive label that delineates its indications, usage, dosages, and side effects, essential for safe medication practices. Traditionally, creating drug labels is labor-intensive and dependent on manual quality checks. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to streamline this process. In this paper we introduce ClinicalRAG, an automated labeling quality control pipeline that integrates LLM with hierarchical Retrieval Augmented Generation that allows to cross-check every statement in the drug label document. ClinicalRAG enhances the reliability of automated drug labeling by systematically reducing hallucination risks, achieving an accuracy of 96.1% in internal validation. With user-friendly interface, our pipeline aims to support pharmaceutical company in drug approval and expedite patients' access to new treatments.
