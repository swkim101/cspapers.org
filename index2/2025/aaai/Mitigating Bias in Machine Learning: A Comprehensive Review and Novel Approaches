Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in our daily lives, yet often exhibit discrimination against protected groups. In this talk, I discuss the growing concern of bias in ML and overview existing approaches to address fairness issues. Then, I present three novel approaches developed by my research group. The first leverages generative AI to eliminate biases in training datasets, the second tackles non-convex problems arise in fair learning, and the third introduces a matrix decomposition-based post-processing approach to identify and eliminate unfair model components.
