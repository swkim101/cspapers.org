The challenges tied to unstructured graph data are manifold, primarily falling into node, edge, and graph-level problem categories. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serve as effective tools to tackle these issues. However, individual tasks often demand distinct model architectures, and training these models typically requires abundant labeled data, a luxury often unavailable in practical settings. Recently, various "prompt tuning" methodologies have emerged to empower GNNs to adapt to multi-task learning with limited labels. The crux of these methods lies in bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and downstream objectives. Nonetheless, a prevalent oversight in existing studies is the homophily-centric nature of prompt tuning frameworks, disregarding scenarios characterized by high heterogeneity. To remedy this oversight, we introduce a novel prompting strategy named HeterGP tailored for highly heterophilic scenarios. Specifically, we present a dual-view approach to capture both homophilic and heterophilic information, along with a prompt graph design that encompasses token initialization and insertion patterns. Through extensive experiments conducted in a few-shot context encompassing node and graph classification tasks, our method showcases superior performance in highly heterophilic environments compared to state-of-the-art prompt tuning techniques.
