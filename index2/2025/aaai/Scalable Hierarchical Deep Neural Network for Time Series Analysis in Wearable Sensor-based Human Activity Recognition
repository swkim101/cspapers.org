Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to evolve rapidly, impacting numerous fields, including time series (TS) classification and human activity recognition (HAR). Despite the advancements in deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these models face several challenges, including the need for extensive labeled datasets, significant computational resources, and lack of interpretability. 
This research aims to address these limitations by developing an adaptive hierarchical deep neural network framework that integrates fuzzy logic principles and adaptive learning techniques for robust, computationally efficient, and interpretable real-time TS analysis. The reduction in the number of parameters and the efficient learning of hierarchical features mean that less training data is needed to achieve robust performance. The model's ability to generalize from hierarchical representations allows it to make effective use of smaller datasets, which is particularly advantageous in scenarios where data is limited or expensive to obtain.The proposed framework specifically targets HAR applications using data from wearable sensors.
