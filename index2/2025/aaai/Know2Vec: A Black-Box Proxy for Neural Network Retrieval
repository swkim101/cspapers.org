For general users, training a neural network from scratch is usually challenging and labor-intensive. Fortunately, neural network zoos enable them to find a well-performing model for directly use or fine-tuning it in their local environments. Although current model retrieval solutions attempt to convert neural network models into vectors to avoid complex multiple inference processes required for model selection, it is still difficult to choose a suitable model due to inaccurate vectorization and biased correlation alignment between the query dataset and models. From the perspective of knowledge consistency, i.e., whether the knowledge possessed by the model can meet the needs of query tasks, we propose a model retrieval scheme, named Know2Vec, that acts as a black-box retrieval proxy for model zoo. Know2Vec first accesses to models via a black-box interface in advance, capturing vital decision knowledge from models while ensuring their privacy. Next, it employs an effective encoding technique to transform the knowledge into precise model vectors. Secondly, it maps the user's query task to a knowledge vector by probing the semantic relationships within query samples. 
Furthermore, the proxy ensures the knowledge-consistency between query vector and model vectors within their alignment space, which is optimized through the supervised learning with diverse loss functions, and finally it can identify the most suitable model for a given task during the inference stage. Extensive experiments show that our Know2Vec achieves superior retrieval accuracy against the state-of-the-art methods in diverse neural network retrieval tasks.
