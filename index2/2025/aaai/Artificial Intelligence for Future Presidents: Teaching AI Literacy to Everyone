The rapid and nearly pervasive impact of artificial intelligence on fields as diverse as medicine, law, banking, and the arts has made many students who would never enroll in a computer science class become interested in understanding elements of artificial intelligence. Fueled by questions about how this technology would change their own fields, these students are not seeking to become experts in building AI systems but instead are searching for a sufficient understanding to be safe, effective, and informed users. In this paper, we describe a first-of-its-kind course offering, "Artificial Intelligence for Future Presidents" designed and taught during the spring of 2024. We share rationale on the design and structure of the course, consider how best to convey complex technical information to students without the background in programming or mathematics, and consider methods for supporting an understanding of the limits of this technology.
