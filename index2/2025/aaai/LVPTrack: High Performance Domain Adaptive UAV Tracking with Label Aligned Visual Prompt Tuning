Visual object tracking is essentially crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Despite the substantial progress, most of the existing UAV trackers are designed for well-conditioned daytime data, while for the scenarios in challenging weather condition, e.g. foggy or nighttime environment, the tremendous domain gap leads to significant performance degradation. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel robust UAV tracker termed LVPTrack, which conducts high quality label-aligned visual prompt tuning to adapt to various challenging weather conditions. Specifically, we first synthesize the sequential foggy and nighttime video frames to assist the model training. A domain adaptive teacher-student network is utilized to distill the hierarchical visual semantic of the target objects in cross-domain scenarios. Then we propose a target-aware pseudo-label voting (PLV) strategy to alleviate the target-level misalignment in the dual domains. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic aggregated prompt (DAP) module to facilitate the appearance variation adaptation of the target object in challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art UAV trackers.
