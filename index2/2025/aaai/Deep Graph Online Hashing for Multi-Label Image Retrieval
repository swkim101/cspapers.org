Online hashing has attracted much research attention for large-scale image retrieval in a streaming way. The main challenge lies in keeping balance between high retrieval accuracy and low training time. Existing online hashing methods almost rely on shallow models rather than deep networks due to high training costs, because it is unacceptable to update hash functions on an order of hours. In addition, the multi-label supervision information is not fully utilized to guide the hash learning process and the affinity matrix is always fixed once constructed. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Graph Online Hashing (DGOH) method, which for the first time introduces inductive graph neural networks (GNNs) to realize deep online hashing with acceptable training costs on an order of seconds. Furthermore, we mine the multi-label information of the images by constructing a label network and learn label-wise weights dynamically to help to update the affinity matrix. In addition, we provide a strategy to obtain examples from the old data to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem. An integrated objective function is designed to train the entire architecture. Extensive experiments on two common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 13.3% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art baselines and shows competitive performance on training time.
