A prevalent assumption in human-robot and human-AI teaming is that artificial teammates should be compliant and obedient. In this talk, I will question this assumption by presenting the Guide Robot Grand Challenge and discussing the components required to design and build a service robot that can intelligently disobey. This challenge encompasses a variety of research problems, as I will exemplify via three challenges: reasoning about the goals of other agents, choosing when to interrupt, and interacting in a tightly coupled physical environment.
