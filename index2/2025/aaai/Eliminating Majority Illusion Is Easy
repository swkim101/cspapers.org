Majority illusion is a phenomenon in social networks wherein the decision by the majority of the network is not the same as one's personal social circle's majority, leading to an incorrect perception of the majority in a large network. We present polynomial-time algorithms which completely eliminate majority illusion by altering as few connections in the network as possible. Eliminating majority illusion ensures each neighbourhood in the network has at least a 1/2-fraction of the majority winner. This result is surprising as partially eliminating majority illusion is NP-hard. We generalize the majority illusion problem to an arbitrary fraction p and show that the problem of ensuring all neighbourhoods in the network contain at least a p-fraction of nodes consistent with a given preference is NP-hard, for nearly all values of p.
