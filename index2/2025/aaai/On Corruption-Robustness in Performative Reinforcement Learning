In performative Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent faces a policy-dependent environment: the reward and transition functions depend on the agent's policy. Prior work on performative RL has studied the convergence of repeated retraining approaches to a performatively stable policy. In the finite sample regime, these approaches repeatedly solve for a saddle point of a convex-concave objective, which estimates the Lagrangian of a regularized version of the reinforcement learning problem. In this paper, we aim to extend such repeated retraining approaches, enabling them to operate under corrupted data. More specifically, we consider Huber's ε-contamination model, where an ε fraction of data points is corrupted by arbitrary adversarial noise. We propose a repeated retraining approach based on convex-concave optimization under corrupted gradients and a novel problem-specific robust mean estimator for the gradients. We prove that our approach exhibits last-iterate convergence to an approximately stable policy, with the approximation error linear in √ε. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of accounting for corruption in performative reinforcement learning.
