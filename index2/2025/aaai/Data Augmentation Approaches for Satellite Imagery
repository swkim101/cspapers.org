Deep learning models commonly benefit from data augmentation techniques to diversify the set of training images. When working with satellite imagery, it is common for practitioners to apply a limited set of transformations developed for natural images (e.g., flip and rotate) to expand the training set without overly modifying the satellite images. There are many techniques for natural image data augmentation, but given the differences between the two domains, it is not clear whether data augmentation methods developed for natural images are well suited for satellite imagery. This paper presents an extensive experimental study on three classification and three regression tasks over four satellite image datasets. We compare common computer vision data augmentation techniques and propose three novel satellite-specific data augmentation strategies. Across tasks and datasets, we find that geometric transformations are beneficial for satellite imagery while color transformations generally are not. Additionally, our novel Sat-SlideMix, Sat-CutMix, and Sat-Trivial methods all exhibit strong performance across all tasks and datasets.
