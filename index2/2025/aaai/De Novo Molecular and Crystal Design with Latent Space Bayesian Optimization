This thesis explores Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) for the generation and optimization of de novo molecules and crystal materials. Our goal is to develop practical, sample-efficient de novo discovery algorithms with a focus on real-world applicability, and our results so far demonstrate significant progress toward practical implementation.
