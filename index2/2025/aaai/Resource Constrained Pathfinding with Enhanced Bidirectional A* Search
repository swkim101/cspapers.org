The classic Resource Constrained Shortest Path (RCSP) problem aims to find a cost optimal path between a pair of nodes in a network such that the resources used in the path are within a given limit. Having been studied for over a decade, RCSP has seen recent solutions that utilize heuristic-guided search to solve the constrained problem faster. Building upon the bidirectional A* search paradigm, this paper introduces a novel constrained search framework that uses efficient pruning strategies to allow for accelerated and effective RCSP search in large-scale networks. Results show that, compared to the state of the art, our enhanced framework can significantly reduce the constrained search time, achieving speed-ups of over to two orders of magnitude.
