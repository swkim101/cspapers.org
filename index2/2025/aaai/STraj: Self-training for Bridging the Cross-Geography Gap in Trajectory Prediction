Accurate trajectory prediction has prominent significance in autonomous driving scenarios.
Most existing methods predict the trajectory of an agent by learning its interaction with 
other agents and the map within the scenario.
However, the heterogeneous distribution of these elements across different geographical scenarios is always ignored.
Thus, trajectory predictors might struggle to generalize well when deployed in different geographical scenarios.
To bridge the cross-geography gap, in this paper, 
we propose a plug-and-play self-training pipeline, termed STraj, for cross-geography trajectory prediction. STraj comprises three progressive steps: pseudo label (i.e., time-series trajectory) generation, update, and utilization.
First, to generate pseudo labels that generalize to the cross-geography scenarios,
STraj pre-trains the predictor through the complementary agent and map augmentations. 
Second, to facilitate the stable training of the predictor, 
we design a specific pseudo label update strategy. 
This strategy selects high-consistency pseudo trajectories from the current and historical epochs to supervise the target domain samples. 
Third, with generated pseudo trajectories, we introduce trajectory-induced contrastive learning to mitigate the representation bias of cross-geography agents.
Extensive experiment results on various cross-geography trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STraj.
