Neuron Sandbox is a browser-based tool that helps middle school students grasp basic principles of neural computation. It simulates a linear threshold unit applied to binary decision problems, which students solve by adjusting the unit's threshold and/or weights. Although Neuron Sandbox provides extensive visualization aids, solving these problems is challenging for students who have not yet been exposed to algebra. We collected survey, video, and worksheet data from 21 seventh grade students in two sections of an AI elective, taught by the same teacher, that used Neuron Sandbox. We present a scaffolding strategy that proved effective at guiding these students to achieve mastery of these problems. While the amount of scaffolding required was more than we originally anticipated, by the end of the exercise students understood the computation that linear threshold units perform and were able to generalize their understanding of the worksheetâ€™s "solve for threshold" strategy to also solve for weights.
