Recent advancement in text-to-image models and corresponding personalized technologies enables individuals to generate high-quality and imaginative images.
However, they often suffer from limitations when generating images with resolutions outside of their trained domain.
To overcome this limitation, we present the resolution adapter \textbf{(ResAdapter)}, a domain-consistent adapter designed for diffusion models to generate images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios.
Unlike other multi-resolution generation methods that process images of static resolution with complex post-process operations, ResAdapter directly generates images with the dynamical resolution. 
Especially, after learning a deep understanding of pure resolution priors, ResAdapter trained on the general dataset, generates resolution-free images with personalized diffusion models while preserving their original style domain.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter with only 0.5M can process images with flexible resolutions for arbitrary diffusion models.
More extended experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter is compatible with other modules for image generation across a broad range of resolutions, and can be integrated into other multi-resolution model for efficiently generating higher-resolution images.
