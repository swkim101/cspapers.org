Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) aims to evaluate image quality in line with human perception, without reference benchmarks. Currently, deep learning BIQA methods typically depend on using features from high-level tasks for transfer learning. However, the inherent differences between BIQA and these high-level tasks inevitably introduce noise into the quality-aware features. In this paper, we take an initial step toward exploring the diffusion model for feature denoising in BIQA, namely Perceptual Feature Diffusion for IQA (PFD-IQA), which aims to remove noise from quality-aware features. Specifically, 1) we propose a Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation module to establish two auxiliary tasks to discover potential low-level features in images that are used to aggregate perceptual textual prompt conditions for the diffusion model. 2) we propose a Perceptual Conditional Feature Refinement strategy, which matches noisy features to predefined denoising trajectories and then performs exact feature denoising based on textual prompt conditions. By incorporating a lightweight denoiser and requiring only a few feature denoising steps (e.g., just five iterations), our PFD-IQA framework achieves superior performance across eight standard BIQA datasets, validating its effectiveness.
