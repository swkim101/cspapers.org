Personalized learning represents a promising educational strategy within intelligent educational systems, aiming to enhance learners' practice efficiency. However, the scarcity of offline practice response data (e.g., answer correctness) and potential biases in human online practice create a significant gap between offline metrics and the actual online performance of personalized learning services. To address this challenge, we introduce Agent4Edu, a novel personalized learning simulator leveraging recent advancements in human intelligence through large language models (LLMs). Agent4Edu features LLM-powered generative agents equipped with learner profile, memory, and action modules tailored to personalized learning algorithms. The learner profiles are initialized using real-world response data, capturing practice styles and cognitive factors. Inspired by psychology theory, the memory module records practice facts and high-level summaries, integrating reflection mechanisms. The action module supports various behaviors, including exercise understanding, analysis, and response generation. Each agent can interact with personalized learning algorithms, such as computerized adaptive testing, enabling a multifaceted evaluation and enhancement of customized services. Through a comprehensive assessment, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of Agent4Edu, emphasizing the consistency and discrepancies in responses between agents and human learners.
