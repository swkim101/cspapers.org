Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in generative modeling. Due to their high training costs, many works leverage pre-trained diffusion models' powerful representations for downstream tasks, such as face super-resolution (FSR), through fine-tuning or prior-based methods. However, relying solely on priors without supervised training makes it challenging to meet the pixel-level accuracy requirements of discrimination task. Although prior-based methods can achieve high fidelity and high-quality results, ensuring consistency remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a masking strategy with strong and weak constraints and iterative refinement for real-world FSR, termed Diffusion Prior Interpolation (DPI). We introduce conditions and constraints on consistency by masking different sampling stages based on the structural characteristics of the face. Furthermore, we propose a condition Corrector (CRT) to establish a reciprocal posterior sampling process. DPI can balance consistency and diversity and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained models. In extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real datasets, along with consistency validation in face recognition, DPI demonstrates superiority over SOTA FSR methods.
