Existing approaches aiming to remove adverse weather degradations compromise the image quality and incur the long processing time. To this end, we introduce a multi-axis prompt and multi-dimension fusion network (MPMF-Net). Specifically, we develop a multi-axis prompts learning block (MPLB), which learns the prompts along three separate axis planes, requiring fewer parameters and achieving superior performance. Moreover, we present a multi-dimension feature interaction block (MFIB), which optimizes intra-scale feature fusion by segregating features along height, width and channel dimensions. This strategy enables more accurate mutual attention and adaptive weight determination. Additionally, we propose the coarse-scale degradation-free implicit neural representations (CDINR) to normalize the degradation levels of different weather conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements of our model over the recent well-performing approaches in both reconstruction fidelity and inference time.
