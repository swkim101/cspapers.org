Recent years have witnessed the rise of Neural-enhanced Video Streaming (NeVS), which integrates neural restoration models into video codecs for higher compression-restoration performance. Despite its benefit, existing work has not well explored the full potential of NeVS paradigm, due to: (1) post-streaming restoration by decoder while lacking the proactive collaboration of encoder, (2) end-to-end optimization based on conventional rate-distortion theory, which has been verified that low distortion is not always a synonym for high perceptual quality, and (3) coupled design for domain-specific tasks that cannot generalize to various video codecs. Observing these limitations, our objective is not to incrementally present an improved restoration model. Instead, we focus on the encoder-decoder synergy, i.e., the codec, which is non-trivial since it inherently strikes the rate-distortion-perception trade-off of NeVS. Aiming at this target, we propose the Diffusion-enhanced Neural Codec (DeNC), a plug-and-play module for current NeVS paradigm, to significantly reduce the required bitrates while preserving high perceptual quality of restored videos. Our key design is twofold. First, DeNC improves the encoder's compression efficiency by simultaneously reducing the resolution and color bit-depth of frame referencing. Second, DeNC empowers the decoder with perception-oriented restoration capability by making its diffusion-based restoration process aware of the encoder's compression conditions. Real-world evaluations show that DeNC improves compression ratios with nearly an order of magnitude and achieves much higher restoration quality (e.g., 93+ VMAF and 23% higher MOS) over the latest baselines.
