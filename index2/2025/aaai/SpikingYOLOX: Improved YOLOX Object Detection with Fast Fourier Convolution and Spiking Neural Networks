In recent years, with the advancements in brain science, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention. SNNs can generate spikes that mimic the function of neurons transmission in humans brain, thereby significantly reducing computational costs by the event-driven nature during training. While deep SNNs have shown impressive performance on classification tasks, they still face challenges in more complex tasks such as object detection. In this paper, we propose SpikingYOLOX, extending the structure of the original YOLOX by introducing signed spiking neurons and fast Fourier convolution (FFC). The designed ternary signed spiking neurons could generate three kinds of spikes to obtain more robust features in the deep layer of the backbone. Meanwhile, we integrate FFC with SNN modules to enhance object detection performance, because its global receptive field is beneficial to the object detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpikingYOLOX achieves state-of-the-art performance among other SNN-based object detection methods.
