On social media, it is easy to see how people are connected and find the leader, or mastermind of a network. The mastermind is responsible for the planning of the activities in the network. Hiding the mastermind is important to carry out these activities. This raises the question for the mastermind: How effectively can the mastermind hide his connections to avoid being found? We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm called HERMES (Hide Exposures by Removing Mastermindâ€™s External Sources) to address this. Experiments on Facebook and Google networks show that HERMES hides the mastermind more effectively than the state-of-the-art, achieving time gains of 103 and 1397 seconds, respectively, and improving influence value by up to 11.11%.
