Fake audios, videos, and images are now proliferating widely. We developed GODDS, the Global Online Deepfake Detection system, for a specific user community, namely journalists. GODDS leverages an ensemble of deepfake detectors, along with a human in the loop, to provide a deepfake report on each submitted video/image/audio or VIA artifact submitted to the system. To date, VIA artifacts submitted by over 50 journalists from outlets such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, CNN, Agence France Press, and others have been run through GODDS. Unlike other deepfake detection systems, GODDS doesn't just focus on the submitted artifact but automatically derives context about the subject of the VIA artifact. Because context is not always available on all subjects, GODDS focuses on alleged deepfakes of high profile individuals, organizations, and events, where there is likely to be considerable contextual information.
