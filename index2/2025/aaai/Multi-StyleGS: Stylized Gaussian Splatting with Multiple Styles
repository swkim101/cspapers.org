In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to automatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory-efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.
