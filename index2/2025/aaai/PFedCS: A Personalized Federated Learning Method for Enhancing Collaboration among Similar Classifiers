Personalized federated learning (PFL) has recently gained significant attention for its capability to address the poor convergence performance on highly heterogeneous data and the lack of personalized solutions of traditional federated learning (FL). Existing mainstream approaches either perform personalized aggregation based on a specific model architecture to leverage global knowledge or achieve personalization by exploiting client similarities. However, the former overlooks the discrepancies in client data distributions by indiscriminately aggregating all clients, while the latter lacks fine-grained collaboration of classifiers relevant to local tasks. In view of this challenge, we propose a Personalized Federated learning method for Enhancing Collaboration among Similar Classifiers (PFedCS), which aims at improving the clientâ€™s accuracy on local tasks. Concretely, it is achieved by leveraging awareness of the client classifier similarities to address the above problems. By iteratively measuring the distance of the classifier parameters between clients and clustering with each client as a cluster center, the central server adaptively identifies the collaborating clients with similar data distributions. In addition, a distance-constrained aggregation method is designed to generate customized collaborative classifiers to guide local training. As a result, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
