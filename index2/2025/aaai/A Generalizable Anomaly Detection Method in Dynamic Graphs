Anomaly detection aims to identify deviations from normal patterns within data. This task is particularly crucial in dynamic graphs, which are common in applications like social networks and cybersecurity, due to their evolving structures and complex relationships. Although recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in anomaly detection on dynamic graphs, they often lack of generalizability. 
In this study, we propose GeneralDyG, a method that samples temporal ego-graphs and sequentially extracts structural and temporal features to address the three key challenges in achieving generalizability: Data Diversity, Dynamic Feature Capture, and Computational Cost. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GeneralDyG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets.
