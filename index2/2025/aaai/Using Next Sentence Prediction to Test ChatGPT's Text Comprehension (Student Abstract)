We propose the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task as a simple, objective, scalable, automated way to test ChatGPT’s text comprehension. Given a context excerpted from a children’s story, the task is to distinguish the next story sentence from a later sentence in the story. We analyze how ChatGPT’s performance on this task is related to various features of the text, using data from English and Swahili children’s stories.
