Deep unfolding network (DUN) has shed new light on multi-sequence MRI reconstruction, providing both high interpretability and acceptable performance. However, current approaches still suffer from the plight of information isolation, i.e., learning features of multi-suquences individually and leaving the mask departed from model updating. In this work, we propose a new unfolding solution, namely Information-coupled MRI Acceleration (IMA), to address the isolation issue. Concretely, two specific mechanisms are presented. On the one hand, the latent connections across different sequences are explicitly molded via two auxiliary matrices. While the first matrix is meticulously engineered to assemble the spatial details, the second one hammers at capturing the depth information conditioned on the enriched channels. On the other hand, following a deep analysis on the non-uniform distribution in low- and high-frequency components of the given mask, we elaborate a new unfolding flow using a progressive masking scheme, featuring a dilation-contraction mechanism during forward propagation of successive stages. Massive experiments are conducted under various sampling patterns and acceleration rates, whose results demonstrate that, without any sophisticated architectures, our IMA outperforms the current cutting-edge methods both visually and numerically.
