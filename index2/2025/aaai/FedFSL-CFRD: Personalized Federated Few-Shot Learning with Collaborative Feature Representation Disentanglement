Federated few-shot learning (FedFSL) aims to enable the clients to obtain personalized generalization models for unseen categories with only a small number of referenceable samples in the distributed collaborative training paradigm. Most existing FedFSL-related algorithms suffer from domain bias and feature coupling in the presence of data heterogeneity and sample scarcity. In this work, we propose a collaborative feature representation disentanglement (CFRD) scheme for FedFSL to address these issues. After each client receives the global aggregation parameters, the original feature representation is decoupled into global communal features and local personality features with personalized bias representation, to maintain both global consistency and local relevance in the first feature representation disentanglement. On the few-shot metric space about the second feature representation disentanglement, category-independent information is encoded by class-specific and class-irrelevant reconstructions to separate the discriminative features. The proposed scheme collaboratively accomplishes global domain bias feature disentanglement and local category degradation feature disentanglement from client-wise and class-wise. Experiments on three few-shot benchmark datasets conforming to the FedFSL paradigm demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both global generality and local specificity.
