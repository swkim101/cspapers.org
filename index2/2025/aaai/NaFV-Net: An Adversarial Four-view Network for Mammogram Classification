Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women, with millions of new cases diagnosed annually. Early detection through screening is crucial. Using neural networks to improve the accuracy of breast cancer screening has become increasingly important. In accordance with radiologists' practices, we proposed using images from the unaffected side to create adversarial samples with critical medical implications in our adversarial learning process. By introducing beneficial perturbations, this method aims to reduce overconfidence and improve the precision and robustness of breast cancer classification. Our proposed framework is an adversarial quadruple-view classification network (NaFV-Net) incorporating images from both affected and unaffected perspectives. By comprehensively capturing local and global information and implementing adversarial learning from four mammography views, this framework allows for the fusion of features and the integration of medical principles and radiologist evaluation techniques, thus facilitating the accurate identification and characterization of breast tissues. Extensive experiments have shown the high effectiveness of our model in accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant findings, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification performance on both internal and public datasets.
