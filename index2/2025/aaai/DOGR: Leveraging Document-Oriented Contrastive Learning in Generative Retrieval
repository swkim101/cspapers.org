Generative retrieval constitutes an innovative approach in information retrieval, leveraging generative language models(LM) to generate a ranked list of document identifiers (docid) for a given query. It simplifies the retrieval pipeline by replacing the large external index with model parameters. However, existing works merely learned the relationship between queries and document identifiers, which is unable to directly represent the relevance between queries and documents. To address the above problem, we propose a novel and general generative retrieval framework, namely Leveraging Document-Oriented Contrastive Learning in Generative Retrieval (DOGR), which leverages contrastive learning to improve generative retrieval tasks. It adopts a two-stage learning strategy that captures the relationship between queries and documents comprehensively through direct interactions. Furthermore, negative sampling methods and corresponding contrastive learning objectives are implemented to enhance the learning of semantic representations, thereby promoting a thorough comprehension of the relationship between queries and documents. Experimental results demonstrate that DOGR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing generative retrieval methods on two public benchmark datasets. Further experiments have shown that our framework is generally effective for common identifier construction techniques.
