Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial task for deploying deep learning models in the wild. One of the major challenges is that well-trained deep models tend to perform over-confidence on unseen test data. Recent research attempts to leverage real or synthetic outliers to mitigate the issue, which may significantly increase computational costs and be biased toward specific outlier characteristics. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, Prototypical Outlier Proxy (POP), which introduces virtual OOD prototypes to reshape the decision boundaries between ID and OOD data. Specifically, we transform the learnable classifier into a fixed one and augment it with a set of prototypical weight vectors. Then, we introduce a hierarchical similarity boundary loss to impose adaptive penalties depending on the degree of misclassification. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of POP. Notably, POP achieves average FPR95 reductions of 7.70%, 6.30%, and 5.42% over the second-best methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200, respectively. Moreover, compared to the recent method NPOS, which relies on outlier synthesis, POP trains 7.2 times faster and performs inference 19.5 times faster.
