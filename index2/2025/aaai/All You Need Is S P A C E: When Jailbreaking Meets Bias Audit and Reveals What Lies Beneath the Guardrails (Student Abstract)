This paper makes a novel combination of a recently proposed bias audit framework and a recently proposed jailbreaking technique for Llama3. On an audit comprising several disadvantaged groups, our experiments reveal that a jailbroken Llama3 exhibits worrisome antisemitism, racism, misogyny, and homophobia (to list a few) much akin to a broad suite of LLMs that were susceptible to similar biases.
