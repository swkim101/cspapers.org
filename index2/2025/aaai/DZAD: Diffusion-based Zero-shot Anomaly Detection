Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in new classes of images, and itâ€™s vital in industry and other fields. Most current methods are based on the multimodal models CLIP and SAM, which have prior knowledge to assist model training, but they are highly dependent on the input of the prompts and their accuracy. We found that some diffusion model-based anomaly detection methods generate a large amount of semantic information and are very valuable for the ZSAD task. Therefore, we propose a diffusion model based zero-shot anomaly detection method, DZAD, and no additional prompt input is required. First, we propose the first diffusion-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework, which uses the proposed multi-timestep noise features extraction method to achieve anomaly detection in the denoising process of a latent space diffusion model with a semantic-guided (SG) network. Second, based on the detection results, we proposed a two-branch feature extractor for anomaly maps at different scales. Third, based on the difference between the anomaly detection task and other general image detection tasks, we propose a noise feature weight function for the diffusion model in the zero-shot anomaly detection task. Comparing with 7 recently state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on MVTec AD and VisA datasets and analysis of the role of each component in ablation studies. The experiments demonstrate the validity of the method beyond the existing methods.
