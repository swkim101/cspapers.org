In this paper, we present a sequential joint dependency aware model for monocular 2D-to-3D human pose estimation. While existing estimators leverage the (bi)directional joint dependency with graph convolutions and attention, we further propose to exploit the sequential dependency between joints with state space model (SSM). Our sequential dependency takes into consideration the information of kinematic chain, joint hierarchy and the body part. We design a sequential dependency aware representation to transform the pose data into sequential data for our pose SSM module. We tailor the SSM layer in the pose SSM module for pose estimation by learning joint-dependent parameters and introducing pose aware hidden state initialization. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed SSM module, and the results demonstrate that our pose estimator can deliver impressive performance.
