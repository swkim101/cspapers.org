Personality detection aims to deduce a user’s personality from their published posts. The goal of this task is to map posts to specific personality types. Existing methods encode post information to obtain user vectors, which are then mapped to personality labels. However, existing methods face two main issues: first, only using small models makes it hard to accurately extract semantic features from multiple long documents. Second, the relationship between user vectors and personality labels is not fully considered. To address the issue of poor user representation, we utilize the text embedding capabilities of LLM. To solve the problem of insufficient consideration of the relationship between user vectors and personality labels, we leverage the text generation capabilities of LLM. Therefore, we propose the LLM-Enhanced Text Mapping Model (ETM) for Personality Detection. The model applies LLM’s text embedding capability to enhance user vector representations. Additionally, it uses LLM’s text generation capability to create multi-perspective interpretations of the labels, which are then used within a contrastive learning framework to strengthen the mapping of these vectors to personality labels. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
