Recent advancements in graph representation learning have shifted attention towards dynamic graphs, which exhibit evolving topologies and features over time. The increased use of such graphs creates a paramount need for generative models suitable for applications such as data augmentation, obfuscation, and anomaly detection. However, there are few generative techniques that handle continuously changing temporal graph data; existing work largely relies on augmenting static graphs with additional temporal information to model dynamic interactions between nodes. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different approach: We instead directly model interactions as a joint probability of an edge forming between two nodes at a given time. This allows us to autoregressively generate new synthetic dynamic graphs in a largely assumption free, scalable, and inductive manner. We formalize this approach as DG-Gen, a generative framework for continuous time dynamic graphs, and demonstrate its effectiveness over five datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that DG-Gen not only generates higher fidelity graphs compared to traditional methods but also significantly advances link prediction tasks.
