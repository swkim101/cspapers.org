Efficient tracking has garnered attention for its ability to operate on resource-constrained platforms for real-world deployment beyond desktop GPUs. Current efficient trackers mainly follow precision-oriented trackers, adopting a one-stream framework with lightweight modules. However, blindly adhering to the one-stream paradigm may not be optimal, as incorporating template computation in every frame leads to redundancy, and pervasive semantic interaction between template and search region places stress on edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric Siamese tracker named AsymTrack for efficient tracking. AsymTrack disentangles template and search streams into separate branches, with template computing only once during initialization to generate modulation signals. Building on this architecture, we devise an efficient template modulation mechanism to unidirectional inject crucial cues into the search features, and design an object perception enhancement module that integrates abstract semantics and local details to overcome the limited representation in lightweight tracker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymTrack offers superior speed-precision trade-offs across different platforms compared to the current state-of-the-arts. For instance, AsymTrack-T achieves 60.8% AUC on LaSOT and 224/81/84 FPS on GPU/CPU/AGX, surpassing HiT-Tiny by 6.0% AUC with higher speeds.
