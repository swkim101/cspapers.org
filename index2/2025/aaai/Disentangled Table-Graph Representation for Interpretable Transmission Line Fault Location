The fault location task in power grids is crucial for maintaining social order and ensuring public safety. However, existing methods that rely on tabular state records often neglect the intrinsic topological influences of transmission lines, resulting in a segmented approach to fault location that consists of multiple stages. In this paper, we propose an Disentangled Table-Graph representation framework, termed DTG, which integrates fault location tasks at coarse-grained line levels and fine-grained point levels within an end-to-end learning paradigm. Our innovative disentanglement strategy produces interpretable attribution coefficients that connect tabular records and transmission line topology, thereby facilitating fault location at both line- and point-levels. The joint prediction tasks designed around our disentangled tabular graph representation promote mutual information exchange between features and topology of transmission lines in an interpretable manner. Experimental results on the 7-bus system, 36-bus system and a realistic 325-bus system in China demonstrate that the proposed method adapt to different topological structures and handle different types of faults. Compared to traditional methods, DTG4Power achieves high accuracy in both fault lines and fault points.
