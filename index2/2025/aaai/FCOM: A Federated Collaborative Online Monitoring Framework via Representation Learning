Monitoring a large population of dynamic processes with limited resources presents a significant challenge across various industrial sectors. This is due to 1) the inherent disparity between the available monitoring resources and the extensive number of processes to be monitored and 2) the unpredictable and heterogeneous dynamics inherent in the progression of these processes. Online learning approaches, commonly referred to as bandit methods, have demonstrated notable potential in addressing this issue by dynamically allocating resources and effectively balancing the exploitation of high-reward processes and the exploration of uncertain ones. However, most online learning algorithms are designed for 1) a centralized setting that requires data sharing across processes for accurate predictions or 2) a homogeneity assumption that estimates a single global model from decentralized data. To overcome these limitations and enable online learning in a heterogeneous population under a decentralized setting, we propose a federated collaborative online monitoring method. Our approach utilizes representation learning to capture the latent representative models within the population and introduces a novel federated collaborative UCB algorithm to estimate these models from sequentially observed decentralized data. This strategy facilitates informed monitoring of resource allocation. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and its application to decentralized cognitive degradation monitoring in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
