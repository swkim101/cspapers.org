Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) has become an indispensable tool in various fields, including tumor microenvironment identification, neurobiology, and the study of complex tissue architecture. However, the accuracy of these insights is often compromised by noise in spatial transcriptomics data due to technical limitations. While recent advancements in denoising methods have shown some promise, they frequently fall short by neglecting spatial features, overlooking the variability in noise levels among genes, and relying heavily on external histological images for supplementary information. In our study, we propose DUSTED, a Dual-Attention Enhanced Spatial Transcriptomics Denoiser, designed to address these challenges. Built on a graph autoencoder framework, DUSTED utilizes gene channel attention and graph attention mechanisms to simultaneously consider spatial features and noise variability in gene expression data. Additionally, it integrates the negative binomial distribution with or without zero-inflation, ensuring a more accurate fit for gene expression distributions. Benchmark tests using simulated datasets demonstrate that DUSTED outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, in real-world applications with the HOCWTA and DLPFC datasets, DUSTED excels in enhancing the correlation between gene and protein expression, recovering spatial gene expression patterns, and improving clustering results. These improvements underscore its potential impact on advancing our understanding of tumor microenvironments, neural tissue organization, and other biologically significant areas.
