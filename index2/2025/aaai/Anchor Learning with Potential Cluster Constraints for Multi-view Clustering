Anchor-based multi-view clustering has received extensive attention due to its efficient performance. Existing methods only focus on how to dynamically learn anchors from the original data and simultaneously construct anchor graphs describing the relationships between samples and perform clustering, while ignoring the reality of anchors, i.e., high-quality anchors should be generated uniformly from different clusters of data rather than scattered outside the clusters.
To deal with this problem, we propose a noval method termed Anchor Learning with Potential Cluster Constraints for Multi-view Clustering (ALPC) method. Specifically, ALPC first establishes a shared latent semantic module to constrain anchors to be generated from specific clusters, and subsequently, ALPC improves the representativeness and discriminability of anchors by adapting the anchor graph to capture the common clustering center of mass from samples and anchors, respectively.
Finally, ALPC combines anchor learning and graph construction into a unified framework for collaborative learning and mutual optimization to improve the clustering performance. 
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to some state-of-the-art MVC methods.
