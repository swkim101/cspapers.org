Top-one recommendation with anonymous user behaviors, also known as session-based recommendation (SBR), faces challenges of top-one ranking and short anonymous sequences. To this end, we propose a novel objective that combines (1) a reciprocal rank loss to directly optimize the benchmark metric of top-one recommendation, with (2) a listwise contrastive loss to handle short sequences through listwise augmented consistency regularization. Empirical studies demonstrate that optimizing the proposed objective significantly improves the performance of existing SBR baselines.
