Variational autoencoder performs well in community detection on static networks, but it is difficult to directly extend to continuous dynamic networks. The main reason is that traditional methods mainly rely on adjacency structures to complete the inference and generation processes. However, continuous dynamic networks cannot be described by this structure because the inherent timeliness and causality information of the network would be lost. To address this issue, we propose a novel variational autoencoder, CT-VAE, for community detection in continuous dynamic networks, along with its scalable variant, CT-CAVAE. By conceptualizing node interactions as event streams and adopting the Hawkes process to capture temporal dynamics and causality, and incorporating them into the inference process, CT-VAE can effectively extend the traditional inference approach to continuous dynamic networks. Additionally, in the generation phase, CT-VAE combines pseudo-labeling and compact constraint strategies to facilitate the reconstruction process of non-adjacent structures. For the scalable variant, CT-CAVAE, end-to-end community detection is achieved by cleverly combining Gaussian mixture distribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CT-VAE and CT-CAVAE achieve more favorable performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.
