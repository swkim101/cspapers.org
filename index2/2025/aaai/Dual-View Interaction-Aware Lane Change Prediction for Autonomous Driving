As artificial intelligence techniques evolve, we are approaching a critical moment for the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles. Subsequently, the emergence of mixed-autonomy traffic environments presents formidable challenges to autonomous vehicles, especially for the accurate prediction of lane change intentions of their surrounding human-driven vehicles, which is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles. Existing lane change prediction models mainly focus on capturing the temporal variations in the movement dynamics of individual vehicles. However, the neglect to consider inter-vehicle interactions hinders their capability in complex lane change scenarios, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Moreover, current interaction-aware approaches for autonomous driving fail to explicitly model future interactions between vehicles, leading to unreasonable prediction results that can cause collisions between vehicles. To address the above issues, we propose to incorporate the concept of perceived safety into future interaction modeling and design a dual-view interaction-aware lane change prediction model. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world datasets and experimental results show that the proposed model achieves average improvements of 11.7-12.4% in classification ability and 75.6-95.7% in forecast ability over the best-performing baselines across the two datasets. The ablation study and investigation into future interaction modeling demonstrate that our model has advantages in interpreting lane change scenarios from a driving safety perspective.
