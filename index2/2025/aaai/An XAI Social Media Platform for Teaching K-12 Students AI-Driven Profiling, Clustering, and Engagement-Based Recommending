This paper presents an explainable AI (XAI) education tool designed for K-12 classrooms, particularly for students aged 11-16. The tool was designed for interventions on the fundamental processes behind social media platforms, focusing on four AI- and data-driven core concepts: data collection, user profiling, engagement metrics, and recommendation algorithms. An Instagram-like interface and a monitoring tool for explaining the data-driven processes make these complex ideas accessible and engaging for young learners. The tool provides hands-on experiments and real-time visualizations, illustrating how user actions influence their personal experience on the platform as well as the experience of others. This approach seeks to enhance learners' data agency, AI literacy, and sensitivity to AI ethics. The paper includes a case example from 12 two-hour test sessions involving 209 children, using learning analytics to demonstrate how they navigated their social media feeds and the browsing patterns that emerged.
