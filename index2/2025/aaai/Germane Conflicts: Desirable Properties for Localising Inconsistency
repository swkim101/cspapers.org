Inconsistency is a common problem in knowledge, and so there is a need to analyse it. Inconsistency measures assess its severity, but there is a more basic question: "where is the inconsistency?". Typically, not all subsets of a knowledgebase are causing the inconsistency, and minimal inconsistent sets have been the standard way to localise the germane ones, even though there are shortcomings in some scenarios. Recently, â‹†-conflicts were proposed as a more suitable definition to localise inconsistency when considering a method to repair it. But in general there is no way to tell what is a sensible definition to capture the germane conflicts. This work provides a set of desirable properties to assess definitions for germane conflicts. Also, a new conflict definition, based on substitution, is presented and evaluated via the proposed properties, and the related computational complexity is analysed.
