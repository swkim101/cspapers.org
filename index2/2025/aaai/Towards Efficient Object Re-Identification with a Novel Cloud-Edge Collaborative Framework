Object re-identification (ReID) is committed to searching for objects of the same identity across cameras, and its real-world deployment is gradually increasing. Current ReID methods assume that the deployed system follows the centralized processing paradigm, i.e., all computations are conducted in the cloud server and edge devices are only used to capture images. As the number of videos experiences a rapid escalation, this paradigm has become impractical due to the finite computational resources in the cloud server. Therefore, the ReID system should be converted to fit in the cloud-edge collaborative processing paradigm, which is crucial to boost its scalability and practicality. However, current works lack relevant research on this important specific issue, making it difficult to adapt them into a cloud-edge framework effectively. In this paper, we propose a cloud-edge collaborative inference framework for ReID systems, aiming to expedite the return of the desired image captured by the camera to the cloud server by learning the spatial-temporal correlations among objects. In the system, a Distribution-aware Correlation Modeling network (DaCM) is particularly proposed to embed the spatial-temporal correlations of the camera network implicitly into a graph structure, and it can be applied 1) in the cloud to regulate the size of the upload window and 2) on the edge device to adjust the sequence of images, respectively. Notably, the proposed DaCM can be seamlessly combined with traditional ReID methods, enabling their application within our proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method obviously reduces transmission overhead and significantly improves performance.
