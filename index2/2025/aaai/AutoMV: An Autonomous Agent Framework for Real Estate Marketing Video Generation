In this paper, we introduce AutoMV, an autonomous agent framework designed for generating real estate marketing videos. The framework integrates a diverse set of existing models into a tool library, allowing the agent to intelligently select and execute the appropriate tools. Given property images and text, the agent decomposes the task into manageable subtasks, generating storyline directives and corresponding camera movement trajectories to guide the video production process. By automatically applying video synthesis techniques and incorporating multimedia elements such as subtitles and background music, the agent transforms static real estate images into dynamic, visually appealing videos, thereby optimizing their impact for digital marketing purposes.
