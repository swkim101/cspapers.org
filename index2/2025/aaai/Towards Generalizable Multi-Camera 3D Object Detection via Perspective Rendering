Detecting and localizing objects in 3D space using multiple cameras, known as Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection (MC3D-Det), has gained prominence with the advent of bird's-eye view (BEV) approaches. However, these methods often struggle with the serious domain gaps caused by various viewpoints and environments between the training and testing domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that aligns 3D detection with 2D camera plane results by perspective rendering, thus achieving consistent and accurate results when facing serious domain shifts. Our approach consists of two main steps in both source and target domains: 1) rendering diverse view maps from BEV features by leveraging implicit foreground volumes and 2) rectifying the perspective bias of these maps. This design promotes the learning of perspective- and context-independent features, crucial for accurate object detection across varying viewpoints, camera parameters, and environmental conditions. Notably, our model-agnostic approach preserves the original network structure without incurring additional inference costs, facilitating seamless integration across various models and simplifying deployment. Worth noting is that our approach achieves satisfactory results in real data when trained only with virtual datasets, eliminating the need for real scene annotations. Experimental results on both Domain Generalization (DG) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) demonstrate its effectiveness.
