We investigate constrained online convex optimization, in which decisions must belong to a fixed and typically complicated domain, and are required to approximately satisfy additional time-varying constraints over the long term. In this setting, the commonly used projection operations are often computationally expensive or even intractable. To avoid the time-consuming operation, several projection-free methods have been proposed with an O(T^¾ (log T)^½) regret bound and an O(T^⅞) cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bound for general convex losses. In this paper, we improve this result and further establish novel regret and CCV bounds when loss functions are strongly convex. The primary idea is to first construct a composite surrogate loss, involving the original loss and constraint functions, by utilizing the Lyapunov-based technique. Then, we propose a parameter-free variant of the classical projection-free method, namely online Frank-Wolfe (OFW), and run this new extension over the online-generated surrogate loss. Theoretically, for general convex losses, we achieve an O(T^¾) regret bound and an O(T^¾ log T) CCV bound, both of which are order-wise tighter than existing results. For strongly convex losses, we establish new guarantees of an O(T^⅔) regret bound and an O(T^⅚) CCV bound. Moreover, we also extend our methods to a more challenging setting with bandit feedback, obtaining similar theoretical findings. Empirically, experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.
