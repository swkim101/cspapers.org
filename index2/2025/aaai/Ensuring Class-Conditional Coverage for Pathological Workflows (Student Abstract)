Conformal Prediction (CP) is an uncertainty quantification framework that provides prediction sets with a user-specified probability to include the true class in the prediction set. This guarantee on the user-specified probability is known as marginal coverage. Marginal coverage refers to the probability that the true label is included in the prediction set, averaged over all test samples. However, this can lead to inconsistent coverage across different classes, constraining its suitability for high-stakes applications such as pathological workflows. This study implements a Classwise CP method applied to two cancer datasets to achieve class-conditional coverage which ensures that each class has a user-specified probability of being included in the prediction set when it is the true label. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a significant reduction in the average class coverage gap compared to the Baseline CP method.
