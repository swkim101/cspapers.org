Graph anomaly detection has attracted significant attention due to its critical applications, such as identifying money laundering in financial systems and detecting fake reviews on social networks. However, two major challenges persist: (1) anomaly detection at the node, edge, and graph levels is often addressed in isolation, hindering the integration of complementary information to identify anomalies arising from collective behaviors; and (2) the inherent label sparsity in graph data, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining high-quality annotations, exacerbates bias in detection. To address these challenges, we propose UniFORM, a unified self-supervised anomaly detection framework comprising two modules: UIO and UMC. UIO unifies node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks from a subgraph perspective, leveraging an energy-based GNN for iterative multi-granular anomaly detection. UMC enhances meta-learning through contrastive learning and employs Langevin dynamics to generate phantom samples as substitutes for anomalous data, reducing reliance on labeled data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniFORM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple granularities.
