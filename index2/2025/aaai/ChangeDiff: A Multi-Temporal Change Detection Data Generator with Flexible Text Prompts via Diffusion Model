Data-driven deep learning models have enabled tremendous progress in change detection (CD) with the support of pixel-level annotations. However, collecting diverse data and manually annotating them is costly, laborious, and knowledge-intensive. Existing generative methods for CD data synthesis show competitive potential in addressing this issue but still face the following limitations: 1) difficulty in flexibly controlling change events, 2) dependence on additional data to train the data generators, 3) focus on specific change detection tasks. To this end, this paper focuses on the semantic CD (SCD) task and develops a multi-temporal SCD data generator ChangeDiff by exploring powerful diffusion models. ChangeDiff innovatively generates change data in two steps: first, it uses text prompts and a text-to-layout (T2L) model to create continuous layouts, and then it employs layout-to-image (L2I) to convert these layouts into images. Specifically, we propose multi-class distribution-guided text prompts (MCDG-TP), allowing for layouts to be generated flexibly through controllable classes and their corresponding ratios. Subsequently, to generalize the T2L model to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution refinement loss is further designed as training supervision. Our generated data shows significant progress in temporal continuity, spatial diversity, and quality realism, empowering change detectors with accuracy and transferability.
