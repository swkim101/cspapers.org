Diffusion models are prominent in image generation for producing detailed and realistic images from Gaussian noises. However, they often encounter instability issues in image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution. Existing methods typically rely on multiple runs to find an initial noise that produces a reasonably restored image. Unfortunately, these methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming without guaranteeing stable and consistent performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Predictive Noise Fusion Strategy (PNFS) that predicts pixel-wise errors in the restored image and combines different noises to generate a more effective noise. Extensive experiments show that PNFS significantly improves the stability and performance of diffusion models in super-resolution, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, PNFS can be flexibly integrated into various diffusion models to enhance their stability.
