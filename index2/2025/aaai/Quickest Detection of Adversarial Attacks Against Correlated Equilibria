We consider correlated equilibria in an adversarial environment, where an adversary can compromise the public signal used by the players for choosing their strategies, while players aim at detecting a potential attack as soon as possible to avoid loss of utility. We model the interaction between the adversary and the players as a zero-sum game and we derive the maxmin strategies for both the defender and the attacker using the framework of quickest change detection. We define a class of adversarial strategies that achieve the optimal trade-off between the impact and the detectability of the attack for the adversary and show that a generalized CUSUM scheme is asymptotically optimal for their detection. Our numerical results on the Sioux-Falls benchmark traffic routing game show that the proposed detection scheme can effectively limit the utility loss by a potential adversary.
