Flow matching has emerged as a promising framework for training generative models, demonstrating impressive empirical performance while offering relative ease of training compared to diffusion-based models. However, this method still requires numerous function evaluations in the sampling process. To address these limitations, we introduce a self-corrected flow distillation method that effectively integrates consistency models and adversarial training within the flow-matching framework. This work is a pioneer in achieving consistent generation quality in both few-step and one-step sampling. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, yielding superior results both quantitatively and qualitatively on CelebA-HQ and zero-shot benchmarks on the COCO dataset.
