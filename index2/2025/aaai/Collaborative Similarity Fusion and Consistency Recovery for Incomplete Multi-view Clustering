As partial samples are often absent in certain views, incomplete multi-view clustering has become a challenging task. To tackle data with missing views, current methods either utilize the data similarity relations to recover missing samples or primarily consider the available information of existing samples, typically facing some inherent limitations. Firstly, traditional solutions cannot fully explore the potential information contained in missing samples due to their omission strategy, leading to sub-optimal graphs. Moreover, most methods mainly focus on data recovery from the view level, ignoring the differences among available/missing samples in various views. To this end, we propose a collaborative Similarity Fusion and Consistency Recovery (SFCR) method, which resolves the incomplete multi-view clustering problem by learning a unified similarity graph and recovering missing samples with consistent structures.
Specifically, to learn a reliable graph compatible across views, a novel view-to-sample fusion model is designed to adaptively coalesce the view-wise similarities among available samples, not only preserving the complementarity and consistency among views but also properly balancing different samples.
Furthermore, the missing samples are effectively recovered under the guidance of the fused similarity graph, so as to maintain the consistent structure of recovered data across views. In this way, the similarity learning and the missing data recovery benefit from each other in a collaborative reinforcement manner. Meanwhile, SFCR can directly obtain the final clustering labels without additional post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of SFCR.
