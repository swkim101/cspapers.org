Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize new concepts using a limited number of visual samples. Existing methods attempt to incorporate semantic information into the limited visual data for category understanding. However, these methods often enrich class-level feature representations with abstract category names, failing to capture nuanced features essential for effective generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for FSL, which incorporates both the abstract class semantics and the concrete class entities extracted from Large Language Models (LLMs), to enhance the representation of the class prototypes. Specifically, our framework composes a Semantic-guided Visual Pattern Extraction (SVPE) module and a Prototype-Calibration (PC) module, where the SVPE meticulously extracts semantic-aware visual patterns across diverse scales, while the PC module seamlessly integrates these patterns to refine the visual prototype, enhancing its representativeness. Extensive experiments on four few-shot classification benchmarks and the BSCD-FSL cross-domain benchmark showcase remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, for the challenging one-shot setting, our approach, utilizing the ResNet-12 backbone, achieves an impressive average improvement of 1.95% over the second-best competitor.
