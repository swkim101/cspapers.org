Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in unstructured environments presents significant challenges for intelligent robotic systems. However, due to partial observation or imprecise action prediction, failure may be unavoidable for learned policies. Moreover, operational failures can lead to the robotic arm entering an untrained state, potentially causing destructive results. Consequently, the ability to detect and self-correct failures is crucial for the development of practical robotic systems. To address this challenge, we propose a foresight-driven failure detection and self-correction module for robot manipulation. By leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting, we represent the current scene with multiple Gaussians. Subsequently, we train a prediction network to forecast the Gaussian representation of future scenes conditioned on planned actions. Failure is detected when the predicted future significantly deviates from the real observation after action execution. In such cases, the end-effector rolls back to the previous action to avoid an untrained state. Integrating this approach with the PerACT framework, we develop a self-correcting robot manipulation policy. Evaluations on ten RLBench tasks with 166 variations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.0% success rate on average.
