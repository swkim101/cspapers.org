We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among a group of agents, aiming to limit the envy between any two agents. The central open problem in this literature, which has proven to be extremely challenging, is regarding the existence of an EFX allocation, i.e., an allocation such that any envy from some agent i toward another agent j would vanish if we were to remove any single good from the bundle allocated to j. Prior work has shown that when the agentsâ€™ valuations are additive, which has been the main focus of prior works, an EFX allocation is guaranteed to exist for all instances involving up to three agents. Subsequent work extended this guarantee to more general valuations, like nice-cancelable and MMS-feasible. However, the existence of EFX allocations for instances involving four agents remains open, even
for additive valuations.
We contribute to this literature by focusing on EF2X, a relaxation of EFX which requires that any envy toward some agent would vanish if any two of the goods allocated to that agent were to be removed. Our main result shows that EF2X allocations exist for any instance with four agents, even for the class of cancelable valuations, which is more general than additive. Our proof is constructive, proposing an algorithm that computes such an allocation in pseudo-polynomial time.
Furthermore, for instances involving three agents we provide an algorithm that computes an EF2X allocation in polynomial time, in contrast to EFX for which the fastest known algorithm for three agents is only pseudo-polynomial.
