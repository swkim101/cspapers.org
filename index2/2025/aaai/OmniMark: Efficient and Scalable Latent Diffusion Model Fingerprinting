We introduce OmniMark, a novel and efficient fingerprinting method for Latent Diffusion Models (LDM). OmniMark can encode user-specific fingerprints across diverse dimensions of the weights of the LDM, including kernels, filters, channels, and spatial domains. The LDM is fine-tuned to encode the invisible fingerprint into generated images, which can be decoded by a decoder. By altering fingerprints and re-encoding the weights, OmniMark supports efficient and scalable ad-hoc generation (
