Acquiring pairwise noisy-clean training data is challenging. Consequently, some self-supervised denoising methods utilize noisy image pairs as both input and target for network training. However, a major issue with these methods is the gap between the clean images of the input and target. In this paper, we achieve high-quality image denoising by reducing or even eliminating this gap. Our method requires no training data or prior knowledge of the noise distribution. It consists of two lightweight networks that can be trained using only a single noisy test image. Specifically, we propose a random mask-based downsampler that generates multiple pairs of downsampled noisy images, which are similar but distinct. These image pairs serve as the input for the first network, with the mean image of each pair used as the target. This initially reduces the gap between the clean images of the input and target. Particularly, in our method, the clean counterpart of the first network's target (i.e., the mean image) can be obtained. We then train a second network using the mean image as input and its clean counterpart as the target. This effectively eliminates the gap and achieves better denoising results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms in both denoising performance and efficiency.
