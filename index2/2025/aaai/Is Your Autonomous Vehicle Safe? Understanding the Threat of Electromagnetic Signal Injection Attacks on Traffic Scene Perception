Autonomous vehicles rely on camera-based perception systems to comprehend their driving environment and make crucial decisions, thereby ensuring vehicles to steer safely. However, a significant threat known as Electromagnetic Signal Injection Attacks (ESIA) can distort the images captured by these cameras, leading to incorrect AI decisions and potentially compromising the safety of autonomous vehicles. Despite the serious implications of ESIA, there is limited understanding of its impacts on the robustness of AI models across various and complex driving scenarios. To address this gap, our research analyzes the performance of different models under ESIA, revealing their vulnerabilities to the attacks. Moreover, due to the challenges in obtaining real-world attack data, we develop a novel ESIA simulation method and generate a simulated attack dataset for different driving scenarios. Our research provides a comprehensive simulation and evaluation framework, aiming to enhance the development of more robust AI models and secure intelligent systems, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safer and more reliable technology across various fields.
