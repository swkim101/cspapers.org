In the rapidly advancing field of AI-assisted medical diagnosis, the generation of medical reports for Chest X-rays (CXR) has significantly improved with the increased availability of radiographs and their corresponding reports. However, these reports often contain complex medical terminology, making them difficult for patients and non-healthcare professionals to understand. In this study, we introduce a strategy called Chained Prompting for Improved Readability of Medical Reports (CPIR-MR), which translates original medical reports into more comprehensible language. Our primary contribution is the creation of a new extension to the IU X-Ray dataset, providing Simplified Medical Reports (SMRs) generated by CPIR-MR. Additionally, we demonstrate that standard methodologies can effectively produce these simplified reports by proposing a multi-modal text decoder (MTD) that combines BLIP with a classification network to generate simplified medical explanations (SMEs) when fine-tuned on SMRs.
