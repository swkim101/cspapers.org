Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown vulnerable to graph adversarial attacks. Current robust graph representation learning methods mainly defend against graph structure attack, and improves performance of GNNs. However node feature in graph can been easily attacked in reality. The joint defense on graph structure and feature dual attacks remains challenging yet less studied. To fulfill this gap, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Graph Masked AutoEncoder (ACGMAE) to defend against graph structure and feature dual attacks. ACGMAE employs adversarial feature masking for reconstructing node feature to mitigate the influence of feature attack. ACGMAE employs contrastive learning on kNN graph and attacked graph, considers neighbor nodes as positive samples, and further calculates their probabilities being true positive to mitigate the effect of adversarial edges. Extensive experiments on node classification and clustering demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ACGMAE especially under graph structure and feature dual attacks.
