In utilizing deep learning techniques for medical image segmentation, two types of imbalance issues are observed: inter-class imbalance between majority and minority classes and intra-class imbalance between easy and hard samples. However, existing loss functions typically confuse these issues, leading to enhancements that cater to only one aspect. Moreover, loss functions optimized for specific tasks often exhibit limited generalizability. To address these issues, we propose Inter-class and Intra-class Balance loss, as well as a unified loss termed Balance loss. The Inter-class Balance loss controls the extent of hard sample mining for majority class samples by considering the frequency of minority classes present in each input image. This approach requires no manual adjustment weights and adapts automatically to different datasets. The Intra-class Balance loss enhances the network's ability to learn from hard samples by performing mining on hard samples within each class. We evaluate our loss functions on five segmentation tasks with varying degrees of class imbalance. The experimental results show that our proposed Balance loss enhances segmentation performance compared with the current loss functions and exhibits superior robustness.
