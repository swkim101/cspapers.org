Traditional multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods try to compute entire collision free start-goal paths, with several algorithms offering completeness guarantees. However, computing partial paths offers significant advantages including faster planning, adaptability to changes, and enabling decentralized planning. Methods that compute partial paths employ a "windowed" approach and only try to find collision free paths for a limited timestep horizon. While this improves flexibility, this adaptation introduces incompleteness; all existing windowed approaches can become stuck in deadlock or livelock. Our main contribution is to introduce our framework, WinC-MAPF, for Windowed MAPF that enables completeness. Our framework leverages heuristic update insights from single-agent real-time heuristic search algorithms and agent independence ideas from MAPF algorithms. We also develop Single-Step Conflict Based Search (SS-CBS), an instantiation of this framework using a novel modification to CBS. We show how SS-CBS, which only plans a single step and updates heuristics, can effectively solve tough scenarios where existing windowed approaches fail.
