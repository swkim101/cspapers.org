The purpose of partial multi-label feature selection is to select the most representative feature subset, where the data comes from partial multi-label datasets that have label ambiguity issues. For label disambiguation, previous methods mainly focus on utilizing the information inside the labels and the relationship between the labels and features. However, the information existing in the feature space is rarely considered, especially in partial multi-label scenarios where the noises is considered to be concentrated in the label space while the feature information is correct. This paper proposes a method based on latent space alignment, which uses the information mined in feature space to disambiguate in latent space through the structural consistency between labels and features. In addition, previous methods overestimate the consistency of features and labels in the latent space after convergence. We comprehensively consider the similarity of latent space projections to feature space and label space, and propose new feature selection term. This method also significantly improves the positive label identification ability of the selected features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
