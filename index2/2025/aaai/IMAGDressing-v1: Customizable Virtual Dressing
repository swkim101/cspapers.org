Existing virtual try-on (VTON) methods provide only limited user control over garment attributes and generally overlook essential factors such as face, pose, and scene context. To address these limitations, we introduce the virtual dressing (VD) task, which aims to synthesize freely editable human images conditioned on fixed garments and optional user-defined inputs. We further propose a comprehensive affinity metric index (CAMI) to quantify the consistency between generated outputs and reference garments.
We present IMAGDressing-v1, which leverages a garment-specific U-Net to integrate semantic features from CLIP and texture features from a VAE. To incorporate these garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net for flexible text-driven scene control, we employ a hybrid attention mechanism composed of frozen self-attention and trainable cross-attention layers. IMAGDressing-v1 seamlessly integrates with extension modules, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, enabling enhanced diversity and controllability.
To alleviate data constraints, we introduce the Interactive Garment Pairing (IGPair) dataset, comprising over 300,000 garmentâ€“image pairs and a standardized data assembly pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGDressing-v1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlled human image synthesis.
