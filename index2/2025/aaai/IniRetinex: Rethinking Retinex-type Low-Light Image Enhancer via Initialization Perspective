Retinex-based methods have become a general approach for solving low-light image enhancement (LLIE). However, traditional methods require post-processing of illumination (e.g., gamma correction), which lacks adaptability and disrupts the illumination structure. Retinex-based deep networks typically follow a ‘decomposition-adjustment-exposure control’ process, which is redundant and lacks robustness. One major issue is the inaccuracy in estimating and decomposing the initial illumination. Accurate initial illumination can prevent further post-processing instability. We propose IniRetinex, rethinking the Retinex-based LLIE method from the perspective of initialization. By using neural networks to provide reasonable initial illumination and solving for smooth illumination through optimization, higher performance LLIE is achieved. We construct a two-layer convolutional neural network to capture the low-frequency structure of the image, adaptively compensating for classical initial illumination and avoiding additional post-processing. The network requires no pre-training and can be implemented in an unsupervised manner with just a few iterations, making it highly efficient. Additionally, we propose a new illumination optimization strategy by introducing an additional proximal penalty term, improving illumination in areas with varying levels and enhancing image details. Extensive experiments on various low-light image datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple benchmarks, offering higher stability and inference efficiency compared to current advanced methods.
