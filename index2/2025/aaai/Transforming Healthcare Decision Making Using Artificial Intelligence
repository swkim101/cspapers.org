Decision making is at the core of healthcare: clinicians constantly make complex decisions that span diagnosis, treatment, care coordination, and resource allocation. Yet, human decisions are never perfect, leading to suboptimal patient care. My research uses AI to augment and improve decision-making in healthcare, following a synergistic approach that combines novel AI methods with practical, real-world implementation. Here, I will explore two key themes: Application-Inspired AI Innovations, focused on novel AI methods grounded in practical healthcare problems; and Path to Deployment and Impact, which addresses AI integration into clinical workflows for real-world improvements.
