In this student paper, we report on our project to enhance road safety in South Carolina (SC) by analyzing traffic data provided by the Department of Transportation and evaluating the impact of a school-level student driver education program called Alive@25. We improve the understanding of road safety using these traffic and training data to understand collision patterns and areas for improvement and assess training coverage gaps. Our approach combines geospatial analysis, economic impact assessment, temporal trend analysis, and interactive visualizations while leveraging AI techniques to clean and analyze extensive datasets. Key findings revealed higher collision rates in urban counties and rising collision rates in mostly rural areas, where Alive@25 participation is declining. These insights led to recommendations for improving road infrastructure and expanding safety training programs. This research demonstrates the potential of AI-driven insights to inform timely, cost-effective interventions and promote multi-stakeholder engagement in addressing public safety challenges while teaching students data science and AI skills and civic engagement.
