Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) reduces the dependence on high-quality data annotation, which plays a crucial role in computational pathology. Benefit from the ability to localize the objects with only binary labels, Class Activation Map (CAM) is a widely used method to initial pseudo masks. However, due to the low contrast among different tissues in histopathological images, most existing CAM-based methods perform poorly in gland segmentation. We retrospect this process and find that class consistency and semantic consistency can guide the network to effectively distinguish confusing pixels and generate fine-grained pseudo masks. Specifically, for class consistency, we propose Consistency Correlation Attention (CCA) to encourage the network to focus on the contribution of class features to semantic dependencies. For semantic consistency, we propose Multi-scale Pyramid Fusion Pooling (MPFP) to aggregate coarse-to-fine global semantic information from CAMs at multiple spatial resolutions, thus identifying class localization. Additionally, we introduce a Purified Labels Filtration (PLF) strategy during the segmentation phase to mitigate the noisy supervision signal and improve the segmentation quality of the model. Extensive experiments show that the our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on three publicly available gland datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates impressive domain adaptation capability, achieving satisfactory results with only a small portion of samples when faced with unseen domain data.
