Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has achieved remarkable success in synthesizing impressive novel views. However, existing methods usually fail to handle scenes with adverse lighting conditions caused by external time variations and different camera settings, leading to poor visual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a physical-aware NeRF for efficient exposure correction, named PHY-NeRF. Specifically, we design Adaptive Lighting Particles inspired by the theory of light scattering and absorption, which can adjust the illumination intensity during volume rendering. Subsequently, we can handle scenes with different lighting conditions by jointly optimizing camera parameters and these lighting particles. Moreover, to promote natural brightness transitions, we devise a global illumination consistency module to control the lighting intensity across views at the feature level while completing more details. Benefiting from the above designs, our PHY-NeRF can tackle arbitrary low-light or overexposed scenes in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments show that our PHY-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in addressing adverse lighting problems while ensuring high rendering efficiency.
