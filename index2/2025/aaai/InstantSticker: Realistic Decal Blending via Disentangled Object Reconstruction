We present InstantSticker, a disentangled reconstruction pipeline based on Image-Based Lighting (IBL), which focuses on highly realistic decal blending, simulates stickers attached to the reconstructed surface, and allows for instant editing and real-time rendering. To achieve stereoscopic impression of the decal, we introduce shadow factor into IBL, which can be adaptively optimized during training. This allows the shadow brightness of surfaces to be accurately decomposed rather than baked into the diffuse color, ensuring that the edited texture exhibits authentic shading. To address the issues of warping and blurriness in previous methods, we apply As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) parameterization to pre-unfold a specified area of the mesh and use the local UV mapping combined with a neural texture map to enhance the ability to express high-frequency details in that area. For instant editing, we utilize the Disney BRDF model, explicitly defining material colors with 3-channel diffuse albedo. This enables instant replacement of albedo RGB values during the editing process, avoiding the prolonged optimization required in previous approaches. In our experiment, we introduce the Ratio Variance Warping (RVW) metric to evaluate the local geometric warping of the decal area. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses previous decal blending methods in terms of editing quality, editing speed and rendering speed, achieving the state-of-the-art.
