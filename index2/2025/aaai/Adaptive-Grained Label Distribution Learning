Label polysemy, where an instance can be associated with multiple labels, is common in real-world tasks. LDL (label distribution learning) is an effective learning paradigm for handling label polysemy, where each instance is associated with a label distribution. Although numerous LDL algorithms have been proposed and achieved satisfactory performance on most existing datasets, they are typically trained directly on the collected label distributions which often lack quality guarantees in real-world tasks due to annotator subjectivity and algorithm assumptions. Consequently, direct learning from such uncertain label distributions can lead to unpredictable generalization performance. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive-grained label distribution learning framework whose main idea is to extract relatively reliable supervision information from unreliable label distributions, and thus the label distribution learning task can be decomposed into three subtasks: coarsening label distributions, learning coarse-grained labels and refining coarse-grained labels. In this framework, we design an adaptive label coarsening algorithm to extract an optimal coarsen-grained labels and a label refining function to enhance the coarse-grained label into the final label distributions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our proposal.
