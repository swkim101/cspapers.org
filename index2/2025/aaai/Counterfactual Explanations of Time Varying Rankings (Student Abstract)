Counterfactual explanations in Explainable AI (XAI) identify which features to change to alter an outcome, but existing methods adjust only the features of a single agent. We present a new approach to re-evaluating rankings that is based on predictions of future features of the other agents in a ranking system. It uses an algorithm that provides a more realistic counterfactual explanation of changing the ranking of a particular agent. Computer experiments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can capture the time variation of the entire ranking system in the inference results.
