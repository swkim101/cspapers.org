In this paper, I review approaches for acquiring hierarchical knowledge
to improve the effectiveness of planning systems. First I note some
benefits of such hierarchical content and the advantages of learning
over manual construction. After this, I consider alternative paradigms
for encoding and acquiring plan expertise before turning to hierarchical
task networks. I specify the inputs to HTN learners and three subproblems
they must address: identifying hierarchical structure, unifying method
heads, and finding method conditions. Finally, I pose seven challenges
the community should pursue so that techniques for learning HTNs can
reach their full potential.
