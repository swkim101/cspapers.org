Lane detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in complex environment. Despite significant advancements in recent years, accurate lane detection remains a challenging task, particularly in scenarios with occlusions, ambiguous lane markings, and diverse lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose the Global Enhancement and Optimization Network (GEONet) for lane detection, which is designed to refine both feature extraction and global feature transmission. Traditional approaches typically depend on deep convolutional layer stacks for global feature extraction, a process that often compromises inference speed and the precision of global feature representation. In contrast, GEONet introduces a novel and more effective methodology. We present the Global Feature Extraction Module (GFEM), which is specifically engineered to capture comprehensive global features with higher accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Top-Tier Supplementary Module (TTSM), which enhances these features through a bottom-up approach, improving overall lane detection accuracy. To further bolster our framework, we incorporate Whitening Batch Normalization (WBN) and Whitening Contrastive Learning (WCL), which enhance feature robustness and ensure better generalization. In addition to our novel network design, we propose two new loss functions to enhance lane detection accuracy. The Generalized Rectangular Intersection over Union (GRIoU) Loss extends the predicted points into rectangles, optimizing overlap and smoothness of lane predictions.The Angle Loss accounts for angular differences between predicted and ground truth lanes, improving alignment and continuity. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art lane detection techniques.
