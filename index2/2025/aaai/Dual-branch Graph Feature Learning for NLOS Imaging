The domain of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is advancing rapidly, offering the capability to reveal occluded scenes that are not directly visible. However, contemporary NLOS systems face several significant challenges: (1) The computational and storage requirements are profound due to the inherent three-dimensional grid data structure, which restricts practical application. (2) The simultaneous reconstruction of albedo and depth information requires a delicate balance using hyperparameters in the loss function, rendering the concurrent reconstruction of texture and depth information difficult. This paper introduces the innovative methodology, DG-NLOS, which integrates an albedo-focused reconstruction branch dedicated to albedo information recovery and a depth-focused reconstruction branch that extracts geometrical structure, to overcome these obstacles. The dual-branch framework segregates content delivery to the respective reconstructions, thereby enhancing the quality of the retrieved data. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ the GNN as a fundamental component to transform dense NLOS grid data into sparse structural features for efficient reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method attains the highest level of performance among existing methods across synthetic and real data.
