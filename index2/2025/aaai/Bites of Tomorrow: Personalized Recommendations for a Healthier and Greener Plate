The recent emergence of extreme climate events has significantly raised awareness about sustainable living. In addition to developing energy-saving materials and technologies, existing research mainly relies on traditional methods that encourage behavioral shifts towards sustainability, which can be overly demanding or only passively engaging. In this work, we propose to employ recommendation systems to actively nudge users toward more sustainable choices. We introduce Green Recommender Aligned with Personalized Eating (GRAPE), which is designed to prioritize and recommend sustainable food options that align with usersâ€™ evolving preferences. We also design two innovative Green Loss functions that cater to green indicators with either uniform or differentiated priorities, thereby enhancing adaptability across a range of scenarios. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our GRAPE.
