Current multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) and emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) methods based on pre-trained language models exhibit two primary limitations:
1) Once trained for MSA and ERC tasks, these pre-trained language models lose their original generalized capabilities. 2) They demand considerable computational resources. As the size of pre-trained language models continues to grow, training larger multimodal sentiment analysis models using previous approaches could result in unnecessary computational cost. In response to this challenge, we propose Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition Adapter (MSE-Adapter), a lightweight and adaptable plugin. This plugin enables a large language model (LLM) to carry out MSA or ERC tasks with minimal computational overhead (only introduces approximately 2.6M to 2.8M trainable parameters upon the 6/7B models), while preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the LLM. In the MSE-Adapter, the Text-Guide-Mixer (TGM) module is introduced to establish explicit connections between non-textual and textual modalities through the Hadamard product. This allows non-textual modalities to better align with textual modalities at the feature level, promoting the generation of higher-quality pseudo tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public English and Chinese datasets using consumer-grade GPUs and open-source LLMs (Qwen-1.8B, ChatGLM3-6B-base, and LLaMA2-7B) as the backbone. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plugin.
