Personality identification plays important roles in understanding user behavior and offering foresight ability for downstream applications. The key challenge is how to address the scarcity of labeled personality data. Recently, some studies have adopted data augmentation and prompt learning to perform personality identification. However, they still heavily require a large amount of labeled data to learn an appropriate distance strategy, which limits the generalization and flexibility of the model. This study proposes a knowledge-enhanced hierarchical heterogeneous graph model, which adopts a global multi-view graph node encoding to acquire comprehensive personality features and their inherent associations, where three types of knowledge including part-of-speech (POS) tag, entity, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) are introduced. Then, a hierarchical heterogeneous graph with a “post-word-diverse knowledge” structure is constructed for each post to obtain enhanced representation. Finally, a relation guided representation optimization that considers intra-user relationships and inter-label relationships is further developed to learn more discriminative semantic representation. Experimental results on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when training with only 100 samples (approximately 1% of the total data set).
