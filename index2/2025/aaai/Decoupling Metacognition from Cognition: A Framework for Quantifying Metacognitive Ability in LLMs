Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate facts and make non-factual statements which can undermine trust in their output.
The essence of hallucination lies in the absence of metacognition in LLMs, namely the understanding of their own cognitive processes. However, there has been limited research on quantitatively measuring metacognition within LLMs. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology theories, we first quantify the metacognitive ability of LLMs as their ability to evaluate the correctness of responses through confidence. Subsequently, we introduce a general framework called DMC designed to decouple metacognitive ability and cognitive ability. This framework tackles the challenge of noisy quantification caused by the coupling of metacognition and cognition in current research, such as calibration-based metrics. Specifically, the DMC framework comprises two key steps. Initially, the framework tasks the LLM with failure prediction, aiming to evaluate the model's performance in predicting failures, a performance jointly determined by both cognitive and metacognitive abilities of the LLM. Following this, the framework disentangles metacognitive ability and cognitive ability based on the failure prediction performance, providing a quantification of the LLM's metacognitive ability independent of cognitive influences. Experiments conducted on eight datasets across five domains reveal that (1) Our proposed DMC framework effectively separates the metacognition and cognition of LLMs; (2) Various confidence elicitation methods impact the quantification of metacognitve ability differently; (3) Stronger metacognitive ability are exhibited by LLMs with better overall performance; (4) Enhancing metacognition holds promise for alleviating hallucination issues.
