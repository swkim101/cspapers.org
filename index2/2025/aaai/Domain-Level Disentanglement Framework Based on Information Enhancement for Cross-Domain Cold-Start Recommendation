Recommender systems in various applications often encounter the challenge of cold-start, which refers to how to provide recommendations for completely new users. Cross-domain recommendation offers a solution to address this cold-start issue by leveraging user interaction information from other domains and providing recommendations for users in the target domain. However, applying the classic two-tower model in cross-domain scenarios for pure cold-start users proves challenging, and most existing cross-domain cold-start recommendation models adopt an embedding-mapping framework that lacks end-to-end efficiency. The parallel training recommendation method lacks consideration of the domain-level intrinsic characteristics of cross-domain information. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework that Domain-level Disentanglement framework based on information enhancement for Cross-domain Cold-start Recommendation. On one hand, we achieve deep utilization of domain-level information through independent extraction of domain knowledge and fusion using heuristic strategies. On the other hand, our model is incorporated with an information enhancement network based on user attention and a user personalized adaptor. We introduce measures to assess user variability and immutability in cross-domain recommendation, aiming to eliminate inter-domain bias and highlight individual user preferences. Experimental results on widely used cross-domain recommendation datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness.
