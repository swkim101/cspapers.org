Despite the widespread success of pattern database (PDB) heuristics in classical planning, to date there has been no application of PDBs to planning with numeric variables. In this paper we attempt to close this gap. We address optimal numeric planning involving conditions characterized by linear expressions and actions that modify numeric variables by constant quantities. Building upon prior research, we present an adaptation of PDB heuristics to numeric planning, introducing several approaches to deal with the unbounded nature of numeric variable projections. These approaches aim to restrict the initially infinite projections, thereby bounding the number of states and ultimately constraining the resulting PDBs. We show that the PDB heuristics obtained with our approach can provide strong guidance for the search.
