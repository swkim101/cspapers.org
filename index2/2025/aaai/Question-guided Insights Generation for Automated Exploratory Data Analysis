Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) derives meaningful insights from extensive and complex datasets. This process typically involves a series of analytical operations to identify the patterns within the data. However, the effectiveness of EDA is often limited by the user's domain knowledge and proficiency in data exploration methods. To overcome these challenges, we developed QUIS, a fully automated EDA system that uncovers insights by generating data-related questions and exploring subspaces in the dataset without prior training. QUIS allows users to control key system parameters such as beam width, beam depth, and expansion factor for subspace selection, the interestingness score for filtering valuable insights, and parameters for managing the quality and quantity of generated questions.
