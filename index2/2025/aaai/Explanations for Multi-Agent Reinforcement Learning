Explainable reinforcement learning (xRL) provides explanations for ``black-box" decision making systems. However, most work in xRL is based on single-agent settings instead of the more complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Several different types of post-hoc explanations must be provided to increase understanding of both centralized and decentralized MARL systems. For centralized MARL, this research develops methods to generate global policy summaries, query-based explanations, and temporal explanations. For decentralized MARL, this research develops global policy summaries and query-based explanations.
