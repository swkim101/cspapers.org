3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we observed this prototype is straightforward and effective. As a result, we introduce a newly designed mode named Internal Spatial Modality Perception (ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine (SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction method for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further precise spatial structure aligning. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 4.2% and 13.1%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and verified in both classification and segmentation tasks. Our code will be released upon acceptance.
