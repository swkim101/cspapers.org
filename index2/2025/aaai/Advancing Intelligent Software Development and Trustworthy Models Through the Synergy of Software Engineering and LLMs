Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering unlocks new opportunities to automate manual processes but raises challenges around reliability, safety, and scalability. My research centers on this synergy, with two key objectives: first, harnessing LLMs to solve software engineering tasks traditionally dependent on labor-intensive, domain-specific methods, and second, applying robust software engineering principles to improve LLM safety and performance. This dual focus creates a powerful feedback loop, where LLMs drive innovation while engineering rigor ensures these systems meet the high standards required for real-world applications.
