Unsupervised multi-view feature selection involves selecting a subset of crucial features across diverse views to diminish feature dimensionality without leveraging label information.
While numerous studies have delved into this area, current solutions predominantly rely on linear multi-view data or employ weakly supervised learning to aid in feature selection.
These approaches may risk losing semantic information when applied to real-world multi-view datasets.
In this study,
we introduce a novel model, Unsupervised Kernel-based Multi-view Feature selection with Robust self-representation and Binary hashing (UKMFS), which aims to identify robust consistent graph representation across views and leverage binary hashing codes to guide feature selection.
Specifically,
we first explore the underlying geometry by unifying the dimension of multi-view data with non-linear kernel mapping.
Then, we search the consistent graph across views by fusing unique graph representations of each view in a self-representation manner.
Additionally, we impose low-rank constraints on the graph of each view to mitigate noise and unimportant parts for preserving the main structures and patterns.
Furthermore, we design an unsupervised hashing feature selection model to exploit reliable binary labels across views and weighted matrices from each view.
Finally, an effective optimization method is customised to solve the formulated problem iteratively.
Comprehensive experiments on public multi-view datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with the representative comparison methods regarding the clustering and the feature selection task.
