Video surveillance systems are crucial components for ensuring public safety and management in smart city. As a fundamental task in video surveillance, text-to-image person retrieval aims to retrieve the target person from an image gallery that best matches the given text description. Most existing text-to-image person retrieval methods are trained in a supervised manner that requires sufficient labeled data in the target domain. However, it is common in practice that only unlabeled data is available in the target domain due to the difficulty and cost of data annotation, which limits the generalization of existing methods in practical application scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, termed Graph-Based Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation (GCKD), to learn the cross-modal feature representation for text-to-image person retrieval in a cross-dataset scenario. The proposed GCKD method consists of two main components. Firstly, a graph-based multi-modal propagation module is designed to bridge the cross-domain correlation among the visual and textual samples. Secondly, a contrastive momentum knowledge distillation module is proposed to learn the cross-modal feature representation using the online knowledge distillation strategy. By jointly optimizing the two modules, the proposed method is able to achieve efficient performance for cross-dataset text-to-image person retrieval. Extensive experiments on three publicly available text-to-image person retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCKD method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
