Healthcare information is scattered across heterogeneous data sources, such as patient medical records, clinical guidelines, research literature, and online knowledge bases. Segmented information, both structured and unstructured, when integrated together using context augmentation - a knowledge fusion technique, has the ability to contextualize broader medical context. Current approaches lack knowledge aggregation that is necessary to generate personalized healthcare recommendations. I propose novel AI frameworks that leverage language models and hybrid retrieval techniques to aggregate multi source knowledge, enabling the generation of contextual and accurate medical response.
