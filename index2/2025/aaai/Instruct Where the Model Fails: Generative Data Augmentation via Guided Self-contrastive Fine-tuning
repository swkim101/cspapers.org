Data augmentation is expected to bring about unseen features of training set, enhancing the model’s ability to generalize in situations where data is limited. Generative image models trained on large web-crawled datasets such as LAION are known to produce images with stereotypes and imperceptible bias when used to augment training data, owing to dataset misalignment and the generator’s ignorance of the downstream model. We improve downstream task awareness in generated images by proposing a task-aware fine-tuning strategy that actively detects failures of downstream task in the target model to fine-tune the generation process between epochs. The dynamic fine-tuning strategy is achieved by (1) inspecting misalignment between generated data and original data via VLM captioners and (2) adjusts both prompts and diffusion model so that the strategy dynamically guides the generator by focusing on the detected bias of VLM. This is done via re-captioning the overfitted data as well as finetuning the diffusion trajectory in a contrastive manner. To co-operate with the VLM captioner, the contrastive fine-tuning process dynamically adjusts different parts of the diffusion trajectory based on detected misalignment, thus shifting the the generated distribution away from making the downstream model overfit. Our experiments on few-shot class incremental learning show that our instruction-guided finetuning strategy consistently assists the downstream model with higher classification accuracy compared to generative data augmentation baselines such as Stable Diffusion and GPT-4o, and state-of-the-art non-generative strategies.
