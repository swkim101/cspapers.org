Existing fine-tuning paradigms are predominantly characterized by Full Parameter Tuning (FPT) and Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET). FPT fine-tunes all parameters of a pre-trained model on downstream tasks, whereas PET freezes the pre-trained model and employs only a minimal number of learnable parameters for fine-tuning. However, both approaches face issues of overfitting, especially in scenarios where downstream samples are limited. This issue has been thoroughly explored in FPT, but less so in PET. To this end, this paper investigates overfitting in PET, representing a pioneering study in the field. Specifically, across 19 image classification datasets, we employ three classic PET methods (e.g., VPT, Adapter/Adaptformer, and LoRA) and explore various regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting. Regrettably, the results suggest that existing regularization techniques are incompatible with the PET process and may even lead to performance degradation. Consequently, we introduce a new framework named TTE (Two Tokens are Enough), which effectively alleviates overfitting in PET through a novel constraint function based on the learnable tokens. Experiments conducted on 24 datasets across image and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that our fine-tuning framework not only mitigates overfitting but also significantly enhances PET's performance. Notably, our TTE framework surpasses the highest-performing FPT framework (DR-Tune), utilizing significantly fewer parameters (0.15M vs. 85.84M) and achieving an improvement of 1%.
