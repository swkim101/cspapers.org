Gradient Descent (GD) and Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods are among the most effective iterative algorithms for solving unconstrained optimization problems, particularly in machine learning and statistical modeling, where they are employed to minimize cost functions. In these algorithms, tunable parameters, such as step sizes or conjugate parameters, play a crucial role in determining key performance metrics, like runtime and solution quality. In this work, we introduce a framework that models algorithm selection as a statistical learning problem, and thus learning complexity can be estimated by the pseudo-dimension of the algorithm group. We first propose a new cost measure for unconstrained optimization algorithms, inspired by the concept of primal-dual integral in mixed-integer linear programming. Based on the new cost measure, we derive an improved upper bound for the pseudo-dimension of gradient descent algorithm group by discretizing the set of step size configurations. Moreover, we generalize our findings from gradient descent algorithm to the conjugate gradient algorithm group for the first time, and prove the existence a learning algorithm capable of probabilistically identifying the optimal algorithm with a sufficiently large sample size.
