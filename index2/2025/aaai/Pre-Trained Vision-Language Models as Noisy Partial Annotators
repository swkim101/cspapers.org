In noisy partial label learning, each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels, and the ground-truth label may be contained within this set. With the emergence of powerful pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, it is natural to consider using these models to automatically label training samples instead of relying on laborious manual annotation. In this paper, we investigate the pipeline of learning with CLIP annotated noisy partial labels and propose a novel collaborative consistency regularization method, in which we simultaneously train two neural networks, which collaboratively purify training labels for each other, called Co-Pseudo-Labeling, and perform consistency regularization between label and representation levels. For instance-dependent noise that embodies the underlying patterns of the pre-trained model, our method employs multiple mechanisms to avoid overfitting to noisy annotations, effectively mines information from potentially noisy sample set while iteratively optimizing both representations and pseudo-labels during the training process. Comparison experiments with various kinds of annotations and weakly supervised methods, as well as other pre-trained model application methods demonstrates the effectiveness of method and the feasibility of incorporating weakly supervised learning into the distillation of pre-trained models.
