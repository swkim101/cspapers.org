We propose Orpheus, a novel programming model for communicating agents based on information protocols and realized using cognitive programming. Whereas traditional models are focused on reactions to handle incoming messages, Orpheus supports organizing the internal logic of an agent based on its goals. We give an operational semantics for Orpheus and implement this semantics in an adapter to help build agents. We use the adapter to demonstrate how Orpheus simplifies the programming of decentralized multiagent systems compared to the reactive programming model.
