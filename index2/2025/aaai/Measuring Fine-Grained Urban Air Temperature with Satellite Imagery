Recent studies on the urban heat island phenomenon reveal how rapid urbanization intensifies temperature disparities in urban cores, highlighting the need for sustainable urban planning solutions. Analyzing the problems caused by these effects requires high-resolution climate data; however, physical weather stations often lack sufficient regional coverage and resolution. Proposals for alternative methods have attempted to bridge this gap, but they fall short in capturing regional characteristics adequately or necessitate obtaining difficult-to-get input data. This research proposes to use satellite data, where the visual spectrum provides rich information about the degree of human development and is easy to obtain, to measure urban air temperature. Our model, UrbanHeat, uses multi-resolution satellite imagery and employs land surface temperature and global climate data as proxy labels to predict air temperature at a granular scale. The results show that the model provides predictions at a much finer scale while showing superior performance in measuring ordinal relationships between points by capturing both local and broad land cover details of the region. Our case studies demonstrate how predictions at high resolution can help protect vulnerable populations from extreme heat (e.g., elders or developing countries) and contribute to sustainable urban development worldwide.
