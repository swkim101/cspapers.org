As a fundamental problem of graph analysis, graph visualization aims to embed a set of graphs in a low-dimensional (e.g., 2D) space and provide insights into their distribution and clustering structure. 
Focusing on this problem, we propose a novel Wasserstein t-distributed embedding (WatE) method, leading to an information-enriched graph visualization paradigm. 
Our method learns a graph neural network to represent each graph as the mean and covariance of its node embedding distribution. 
Accordingly, our method can visualize each graph as an ellipse (determined by the mean and the covariance) rather than a single point. 
The positions of different ellipses reveal the relations among different graphs as traditional visualization methods do, while the size and shape of an ellipse preserve the node-level structural information of the corresponding graph. 
We propose a regularized t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (Rt-SNE) framework to learn the visualization model, deriving a Wasserstein distance-based Student's t-distribution of graph pairs and fitting the distribution to the data distribution under regularization. 
Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that WatE achieves encouraging performance in various graph visualization and clustering tasks.
