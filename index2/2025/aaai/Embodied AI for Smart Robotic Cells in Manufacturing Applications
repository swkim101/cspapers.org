Many manufacturing companies are facing an acute shortage of qualified workers. Deploying robotic cells is a potential solution to address this challenge. Historically robots have been deployed only in mass production applications in manufacturing. A large fraction of manufacturing is classified as high-mix manufacturing where a large variety of products are produced. Manually programming robots is not a viable solution in high-mix manufacturing applications. Robotic cells need to be powered by embodied AI to make them useful in high-mix manufacturing applications. This paper aims to build a bridge between smart manufacturing and AI communities to enable AI researchers to develop methods and tool that can be successfully deployed to realize smart robotic cells for high-mix manufacturing applications. This paper highlights key requirements for developing embodied AI for powering robotic cells for high-mix manufacturing applications. It also makes the case for approaches that combine model-based and data-driven methods to meet the needs of embodied AI in manufacturing applications and describes the role of generative AI approaches in smart manufacturing applications. Finally, it describes how AI can be used to enhance digital twins and augment human-machine interfaces in manufacturing applications.
