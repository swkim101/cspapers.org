While advances in machine learning and the expansion of massive datasets have significantly improved predictive accuracy, the translation of these predictions into actionable decisions—alongside a robust understanding of associated risks—remains underexplored. My research focuses on developing methodology and theory in data-driven decision-making and uncertainty quantification that effectively address core data challenges. This paper presents two connected pillars of my research: data-driven contextual optimization, uncertainty quantification and reduction.
