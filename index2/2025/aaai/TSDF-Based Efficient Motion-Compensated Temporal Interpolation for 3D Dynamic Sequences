This paper introduces a method for efficiently interpolating 3D dynamic sequences using truncated signed distance function (TSDF) volumes. The method calculates bi-directional motions between TSDF volumes of two frames and refines them to reconstruct intermediate frames. Unlike point cloud-based methods, which can suffer from varying and irregular point densities, the uniform and dense grid structure of TSDF offers a consistent framework for estimating the true motion of objects within a scene. In our experiments, the TSDF-based method offers more precise and reliable smooth motion prediction compared to the often error-prone surface depiction in point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications.
