Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) spotlights the tag of novel entity types in data-limited scenarios or lower-resource settings. Advances with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), including BERT, GPT, and their variants, have driven tremendous strategies to leverage context-dependent representations and exploit predefined relational cues, yielding significant gains in witnessing unseen entities. Nevertheless, a fundamental issue exists in prior efforts regarding their susceptibility to adversarial attacks in the intricate semantic environment. This vulnerability undermines the robustness of semantic representations, exacerbating the challenge of accurate entity identification, especially when transitioning across domains. To this end, we propose an Adversity-aware Augment Learning (AAL) solution for the few-shot NER task, dedicated to retrieving and reinforcing entity prototypes resilient to adversarial inference, thereby enhancing cross-domain semantic coherence. In particular, AAL employs a two-stage paradigm consisting of training and fine-tuning. The process initiates with augmentation learning by leveraging two kinds of prompt learning schemes, then identifies prototypes under the guidance of a variational manner. Furthermore, we devise a domain-oriented prototype refinement to optimize prototype learning under conditions of uncertainty attack, facilitating the effective transfer of common knowledge from source to target domains. The experimental results, encompassing the few-shot NER datasets under both certainty and uncertainty conditions, affirm the superiority of the proposed AAL over several representative baselines, particularly its capability against adversarial attacks.
