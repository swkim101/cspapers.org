In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains. Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that our ICPAD framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task horizon.
