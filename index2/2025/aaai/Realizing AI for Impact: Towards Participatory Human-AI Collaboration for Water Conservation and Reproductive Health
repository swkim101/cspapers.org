AI has immense potential for positive social impact, including in domains ranging from conservation to health. However, it can be challenging to account for human collaborations and real-world uncertainties when deploying such systems, which can lead to critical errors. Therefore, my research focuses on developing new methods in multi-agent systems and machine learning, including methods for participatory design of AI, human-AI collaboration, and uncertainty quantification, to develop safe, impactful AI systems, particularly in the domains of water conservation and reproductive health.
