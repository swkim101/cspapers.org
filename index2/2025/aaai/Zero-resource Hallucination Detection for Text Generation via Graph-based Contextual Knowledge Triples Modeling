LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more hard. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long texts without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pair of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection method for text generations, which aligns facts and considers the dependencies between contextual facts in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual triples (facts), we construct contextual triples into a graph and enhance triplesâ€™ interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long texts, we conduct an LLM-based reverse verification by reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.
