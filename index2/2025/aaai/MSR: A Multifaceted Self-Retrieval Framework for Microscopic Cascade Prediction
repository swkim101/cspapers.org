The microscopic cascade prediction task has wide applications in downstream areas like ''rumor detection''.
Its goal is to forecast the diffusion routines of information cascade within networks.
Existing works typically formulate it as a classification task, which fails to well align with the Social Homophily assumption, as it just use the features of ''infected'' users while neglecting those of ''uninfected'' users in representation learning.
Moreover, these methods focus primarily on social relationships, thereby dismissing other vital dimensions like users' historical behavior and the underlying preferences behind it. 
To address these challenges, we introduce the MSR (Multifaceted Self-Retrieval) framework. 
During encoding, in addition to the existing social graph, we construct a preference graph to represent ''behavioral preferences'' and further propose a modified multi-channel GRAU for multi-view analysis of cascade phenomenon.
For decoding, our approach diverges from classification-based methods by reformulating the task as an information retrieval problem that predicts the target user with similarity measures.
Empirical evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms baselines on Hits@κ and MAP@κ, affirming its enhanced ability.
