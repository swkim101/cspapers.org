Aerodynamic coefficient prediction is pivotal in aircraft and vehicles' design, performance evaluation, and motion control. Integrating artificial neural networks into aerodynamic coefficient prediction offers a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods burdened by extensive computations and high costs. Nevertheless, this data-driven approach faces several critical challenges, which limit its further performance enhancement: i) The current research lacks a profound understanding of the complex interplay between the shape of an object and its aerodynamic characteristics. ii) The scarcity of high-quality aerodynamic data poses a significant barrier. The models trained on limited datasets lack generalization ability, struggling to accurately predict and adapt to diverse aerodynamic performance under new shapes or conditions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework that employs cross-attention to capture the intimate interplay between shape and flow conditions and allows for the direct utilization of pre-trained models on general shape datasets to mitigate the scarcity of aerodynamic data. Furthermore, to bolster the inference capabilities of this data-driven approach, we integrate physical information constraints into the model, leveraging them as guiding principles to enhance the model's predictive power under unknown conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates that our proposed method performs excellently in multiple aerodynamic prediction tasks. This achievement brings a new technological breakthrough to the field of aerodynamic prediction and provides robust support for the design optimization of complex systems such as aircraft and vehicles.
