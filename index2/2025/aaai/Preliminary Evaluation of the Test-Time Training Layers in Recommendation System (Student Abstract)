This paper explores the application and effectiveness of TestTime Training (TTT) layers in improving the performance of recommendation systems. We developed a model, TTT4Rec, utilizing TTT-Linear as the feature extraction layer. Our tests across multiple datasets indicate that TTT4Rec, as a base model, performs comparably or even surpasses other baseline models in similar environments.
