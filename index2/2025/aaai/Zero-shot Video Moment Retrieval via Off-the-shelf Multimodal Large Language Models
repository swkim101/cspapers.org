The target of video moment retrieval (VMR) is predicting temporal spans within a video that semantically match a given linguistic query. Existing VMR methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. Although some recent studies introduce a zero-shot setting to avoid fine-tuning, they overlook inherent language bias in the query, leading to erroneous localization. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes Moment-GPT, a tuning-free pipeline for zero-shot VMR utilizing frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we first employ LLaMA-3 to correct and rephrase the query to mitigate language bias. Subsequently, we design a span generator combined with MiniGPT-v2 to produce candidate spans adaptively. Finally, to leverage the video comprehension capabilities of MLLMs, we apply Video-ChatGPT and span scorer to select the most appropriate spans. Our proposed method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art MLLM-based and zero-shot models on several public datasets, including QVHighlights, ActivityNet-Captions, and Charades-STA.
