Creating group choreography from music is crucial in cultural entertainment and virtual reality, with a focus on generating harmonious movements. 
Despite growing interest, recent approaches often struggle with two major challenges: multi-dancer collisions and single-dancer foot sliding.
To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff) framework, which leverages non-overlapping trajectories to ensure coherent and aesthetically pleasing dance movements. To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories.
Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority.
