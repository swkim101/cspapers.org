Social Intelligence Queries (Social-IQ) serve as the primary multimodal benchmark for evaluating a model’s social intelligence level. While impressive multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy is achieved by current solutions, increasing evidence shows that they are largely, and in some cases entirely, dependent on language modality, overlooking visual context. Additionally, the closed-set nature further prevents the exploration of whether and to what extent the reasoning path behind selection is correct. To address these limitations, we propose the Visually Explainable and Grounded Artificial Social Intelligence (VEGAS) model. As a generative multimodal model, VEGAS leverages open-ended answering to provide explainable responses, which enhances the clarity and evaluation of reasoning paths. To enable visually grounded answering, we propose a novel sampling strategy to provide the model with more relevant visual frames. We then enhance the model’s interpretation of these frames through Generalist Instruction Fine-Tuning (GIFT), which aims to: i) learn multimodal language transformations for fundamental emotional social traits, and ii) establish multimodal joint reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments, comprising modality ablation, open-ended assessments, and supervised MCQ evaluations, consistently show that VEGAS effectively utilizes visual information in reasoning to produce correct and also credible answers. We expect this work to offer a new perspective on Social-IQ and advance the development of human-like social AI.
