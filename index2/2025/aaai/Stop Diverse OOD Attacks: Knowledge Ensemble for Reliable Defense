Enhancing defense through model ensemble is an emerging trend, where the challenge lies in how to use ensemble knowledge to counter Out-of-Distribution (OOD) attacks. In this paper, we propose the Reliable Defense Ensemble (REE) to address this issue. REE optimizes the ensemble knowledge of models through aggregation and enhances multidimensional robust performance through collaboration. It employs the Dynamic Synergy Amplification for weight allocation and strategy adjustment. Furthermore, we design a new Kernel Anomaly Smoothing Detection Module, which detects anomalous attacks using a smoothing feature function based on Gaussian kernel mean embedding and a multi-layer feedback structure. Particularly, we build a framework that uses reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune the parameters of inter-model communication and consensus. Extensive experimental results show that REE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in defending against OOD attacks.
