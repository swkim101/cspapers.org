This paper examines the co-design process for a foundational AI microcredential course targeting K-12 teachers' knowledge, agency, and effectiveness in integrating AI into their classrooms. We collaborated with six K-12 teachers and instructional coaches to ensure the course's relevance and practicality. Using conjecture mapping and memoing, we systematically captured and analyzed insights from the collaborative process. These methods helped us pinpoint essential themes and requirements for effective professional development (PD) that meets the unique challenges and opportunities of teaching about and using AI in K-12 classrooms. Themes included concerns about in-class monitoring for unethical impacts of AI integration and the desire for empowerment in evaluating and selecting AI tools that they can best leverage to meet state and national standards. Educator requirements centered on the creation of quick, easily accessible, and asynchronous learning activities. In addition, educators requested just-in-time AI integration resources and learning opportunities that can be leveraged throughout the year, rather than being limited to PD sessions. This study contributes to AI education by providing a framework for designing teacher professional development programs that are responsive to the evolving educational landscape and the specific needs of K-12 teachers.
