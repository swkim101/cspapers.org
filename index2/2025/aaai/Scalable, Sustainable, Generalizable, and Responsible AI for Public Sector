AI for public sector research is about using AI to tackle the numerous challenges faced by public sector organizations when they are out there making our world a better place. AI for public sector research is use-inspired research. It differs from traditional AI research first and foremost in its key objective being measurable societal impact. AI for public sector research contributes to the computing community by proposing new problem models, raising complexities that challenge abstractions which often leads to new methodologies, and introducing new contexts for evaluation. However, fulfilling this promise is easier said than done. This talk consists of three parts about our preliminary work in our long-term quest to make AI for public sector operationally scalable, financially sustainable, technically generalizable, and socially responsible. We will cover (1) a concrete AI for public sector project from problem scoping to field trials and deployment, (2) a generalizable algorithm applicable to various public sector domains, and (3) an overview of our work in a wide variety of applications.
