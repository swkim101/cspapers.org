The fair and objective assessment of performances and competitions is a common pursuit and challenge in human society. The application of computer vision technology offers hope for this purpose, but it still faces obstacles such as occlusion and motion blur. To address these hindrances, our DanceFix proposes a bidirectional spatial-temporal context optical flow correction (BOFC) method. This approach leverages the consistency and complementarity of motion information between two modalities: optical flow, which excels at pixel capture, and lightweight skeleton data. It enables the extraction of pixel-level motion changes and the correction of abnormal skeleton data. Furthermore, we propose a part-level dance dataset (Dancer Parts) and part-level motion feature extraction based on task decoupling (PETD). This aims to decouple complex whole-body parts tracking into fine-grained limb-level motion extraction, enhancing the confidence of temporal information and the accuracy of correction for abnormal data. Finally, we present the DNV dataset, which simulates fully neat group dance scenes and provides reliable labels and validation methods for the newly introduced group dance neatness assessment (GDNA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop quantitative criteria for assessing limb and joint neatness in group dance. We conduct experiments on DNV and video-based public JHMDB datasets. Our method effectively corrects abnormal skeleton points, flexibly embeds, and improves the accuracy of existing pose estimation algorithms.
