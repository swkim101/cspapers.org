In dyadic human-human interactions, individuals may express multiple different facial reactions in response to the same/similar behaviours expressed by their conversational partners depending on their personalised behaviour patterns. As a result, frequently-employed reconstruction loss-based strategies lead the training of previous automatic facial reaction generation (FRG) models to not only suffer from the 'one-to-many mapping' problem, but also fail to comprehensively consider the quality of the generated facial reactions. Besides, none of them considered such personalised behaviour patterns in generating facial reactions. In this paper, we propose the first adversarial FRG model training strategy which jointly learns appropriateness and realism discriminators to provide comprehensive task-specific supervision for training the target facial reaction generators, and reformulates the 'one-to-many (facial reactions) mapping' training problem as a 'one-to-one (distribution) mapping' training task, i.e., the FRG model is trained to output a distribution representing multiple appropriate/plausible facial reaction from each input human behaviour. In addition, our approach also serves as the first offline FRG approach that considers personalised behaviour patterns in generating of target individuals' facial reactions. Experiments show that our PerReactor not only largely outperformed all existing offline solutions for generating more appropriate, diverse and realistic facial reactions, but also is the first approach that can effectively generate personalised appropriate facial reactions.
