Efficient human-agent collaboration requires understanding each otherâ€™s capabilities and establishing appropriate reliance. My thesis focuses on optimizing performance in mixed-initiative settings, where humans and agents dynamically contribute to decisions and actions. I first explore key factors shaping human reliance on decision-support agents, then examine how agents can model this reliance to initiate actions. My proposed work aims to enable agents to jointly provide decision and action support in multi-objective tasks, using bi-directional communication to enhance collaboration.
