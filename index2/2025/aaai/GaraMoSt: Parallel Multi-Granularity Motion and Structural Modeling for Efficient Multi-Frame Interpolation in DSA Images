The rapid and accurate direct multi-frame interpolation method for Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images is crucial for reducing radiation and providing real-time assistance to physicians for precise diagnostics and treatment. DSA images contain complex vascular structures and various motions. Applying natural scene Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods results in motion artifacts, structural dissipation, and blurriness. Recently, MoSt-DSA has specifically addressed these issues for the first time and achieved SOTA results. However, MoSt-DSA's focus on real-time performance leads to insufficient suppression of high-frequency noise and incomplete filtering of low-frequency noise in the generated images. To address these issues within the same computational time scale, we propose GaraMoSt. Specifically, we optimize the network pipeline with a parallel design and propose a module named MG-MSFE. MG-MSFE extracts frame-relative motion and structural features at various granularities in a fully convolutional parallel manner and supports independent, flexible adjustment of context-aware granularity at different scales, thus enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaraMoSt achieves the SOTA performance in accuracy, robustness, visual effects, and noise suppression, comprehensively surpassing MoSt-DSA and other natural scene VFI methods.
