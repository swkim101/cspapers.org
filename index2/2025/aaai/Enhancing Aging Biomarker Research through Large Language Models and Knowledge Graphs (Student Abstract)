Aging biomarkers play a crucial role in uncovering the biological mechanisms behind aging and in developing strategies to support healthy aging. However, the search for reliable aging biomarkers is particularly challenging due to the intricate and multifactorial nature of the aging process. Furthermore, biomarker names and categories are not well-standardized in the current literature. While, a formal definition of a biomarker is nonexistent in the current literature, formally defining biomarkers and standardizing the vocabulary for biomarkers can help accelerate AI research around this concept which can lead to better, faster and more accurate analyses of the existing data and literature.
Thus, in this work, we generated Knowledge Graphs that can help us define and standardize biomarkers. We present our Knowledge Graphs (KGs) generated using both an LLM and expert-curated datasets. We compare both KGs to understand why systematic integration between these two models is needed. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising approach to advancing aging biomarker research through the inherent structured and standardized nature of ontology schemas in knowledge graphs. We showcase that the accuracy of LLM-generated KGs remains questionable but systematic methods such as KNARM can help us with the accuracy of these efforts. In future work, we will propose a synergistic framework where KGs and LLMs interact iteratively to improve both the comprehensiveness and accuracy of aging biomarker information.
