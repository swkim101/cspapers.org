Recent talking avatar generation models have made strides in achieving realistic and accurate lip synchronization with the audio, but often fall short in controlling and conveying detailed expressions and emotions of the avatar, making the generated video less vivid and controllable. In this paper, we propose a text-guided approach for generating emotionally expressive 2D avatars, offering fine-grained control, improved interactivity, and generalizability to the resulting video. Our framework, named InstructAvatar, leverages a natural language interface to control the emotion as well as the facial motion of avatars. Technically, we utilize GPT-4V to design an automatic annotation pipeline, constructing an instruction-video paired training dataset. This is combined with a novel two-branch diffusion-based generator to predict avatars using both audio and text instructions simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that InstructAvatar produces results that align well with both conditions, and outperforms existing methods in fine-grained emotion control, lip-sync quality, and naturalness.
