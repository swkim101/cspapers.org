Lens flares arise from light reflection and refraction within sensor arrays, whose diverse types include glow, veiling glare, reflective flare and so on. Existing methods are specialized for one specific type only, and overlook the simultaneous occurrence of multiple typed lens flares, which is common in the real-world, e.g. coexistence of glow and displacement reflections from the same light source. These co-occurring lens flares cannot be effectively resolved by the simple combination of individual flare removal methods, since these coexisting flares originates from the same light source and are generated simultaneously within the same sensor array, exhibit a complex interdependence rather than simple additive relation. To model this interdependent flaresâ€™ relationship, our Nighttime Lens Flare Formation model is the first attempt to learn the intrinsic physical relationship between flares on the imaging plane. Building on this physical model, we introduce a solution to this joint flare removal task named Self-supervised Generation-based Lens Flare Removal Network (SGLFR-Net), which is self-supervised without pre-training. Specifically, the nighttime glow is detangled in PSF Rendering Network(PSFR-Net) based on PSF Rendering Prior, while the reflective flare is modelled in Texture Prior Based Reflection Flare Removal Network (TPRR-Net). Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both joint and individual glare removal tasks.
