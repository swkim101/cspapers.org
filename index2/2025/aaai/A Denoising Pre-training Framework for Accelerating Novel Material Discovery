Crystal materials play an important role in the development of society. The discovery of new materials is critical to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as climate change mitigation, affordable and clean energy, and fostering innovation in industry and infrastructure. Recent advances in deep learning for crystal property prediction have accelerated material discovery, but these methods typically rely on labeled data, which is often limited and varies across different properties. This limitation hinders the full utilization of the vast amount of unlabeled data in materials science. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an unsupervised Denoising Pre-training Framework (DPF) tailored for crystal structures. DPF trains a model to reconstruct the original crystal structure by recovering the masked atom types, perturbed atom positions, and perturbed crystal lattices. Through pre-training, models learn the intrinsic features of crystal structures and capture the key features influencing crystal properties. We pre-train models on a dataset of 380,743 unlabeled crystal structures and fine-tune them on downstream property prediction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing its potential to significantly advance material science and contribute to the development of society by accelerating the discovery of materials crucial for sustainable technologies.
