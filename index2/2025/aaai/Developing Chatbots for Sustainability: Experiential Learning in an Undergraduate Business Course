This paper presents an experiential learning pedagogy that teaches undergraduate business management information systems students hands-on AI skills through the lens of sustainability. The learning modules aim to empower undergraduate business students to gain interest and confidence in AI knowledge, skills, and careers, to sharpen their higher order thinking abilities, and to help them gain a deeper understanding of sustainability issues. Students learn AI through developing chatbots that address pressing sustainability issues within their own communities. Results of the pilot study indicate that students have increased self-efficacy in AI, more positive attitudes towards AI learning and AI-related careers, enhanced sustainability awareness, and more confidence in their ability to innovate.
