The storage and recall of factual associations in auto-regressive transformer language models (LMs) have drawn a great deal of attention, inspiring knowledge editing by directly modifying the located model weights. Most editing works achieve knowledge editing under the guidance of existing interpretations of knowledge recall that mainly focus on subject knowledge. However, these interpretations are seriously flawed, neglecting relation information and leading to the *over-generalizing* problem for editing. In this work, we discover a novel relation-focused perspective to interpret the knowledge recall of transformer LMs during inference and apply it on single knowledge editing to avoid over-generalizing. Experimental results on the dataset supplemented with a new R-Specificity criterion demonstrate that our editing approach significantly alleviates over-generalizing while remaining competitive on other criteria, breaking the domination of subject-focused editing for future research.
