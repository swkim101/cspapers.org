The predominant setting in classic auction theory considers bidders as utility maximizers (UMs), who aim to maximize quasi-linear utility functions. Recent autobidding strategies in online advertising have sparked interest in auction design with value maximizers (VMs), who aim to maximize the total value obtained. In this work, we investigate revenue-maximizing auction design for selling a single item to a mix of UMs and VMs. Crucially, we assume the UM/VM type is private information of a bidder. This shift to a multi-parameter domain complicates the design of incentive compatible mechanisms. Under this setting, we first characterize the optimal auction structure for auctions with a single bidder. We observe that the optimal auction moves gradually from a first-price auction to a Myerson auction as the probability of the bidder being a UM increases from 0 to 1. We also extend our study to multi-bidder setting and present an algorithm for deriving the optimal lookahead auction with multiple mixed types of bidders.
