Existing ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration methods often struggle with consistency due to downsampling. We aim to address these challenges by leveraging the powerful latent space representation and reconstruction capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAE). However, applying VAE to UHD image restoration presents challenges: 1) High-performing VAEs have large parameter sizes, leading to significant carbon footprints; 2) The self-reconstruction property of VAE hinders bridging the domain gap between clean and degraded images; 3) Latent encoding in VAE can lose high-frequency information, compromising image detail.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a frequency enhanced VAE UHD image restoration framework by integrating frequency priors. First, we design the Fourier-based lightweight frequency learning within the VAE to improve parameter efficiency. Then, we introduce a wavelet-based adapter that extracts multi-scale image information and employs frequency-aware adaptive modulation to bridge the domain gap by integrating degraded image data into the pre-trained VAE. Additionally, the adapter injects high-frequency information into the VAE decoder, enhancing detail in the restored images. In this way, our method effectively combines the powerful latent space representation with frequency priors to enhance UHD image restoration. Extensive experiments on various UHD image restoration tasks show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
