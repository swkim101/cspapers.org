Text-driven video editing has recently experienced rapid development. Despite this, evaluating edited videos remains a considerable challenge. Current metrics tend to fail to align with human perceptions, and effective quantitative metrics for video editing are still notably absent. To address this, we introduce VE-Bench, a benchmark suite tailored to the assessment of text-driven video editing. This suite includes VE-Bench DB, a video quality assessment (VQA) database for video editing. VE-Bench DB encompasses a diverse set of source videos featuring various motions and subjects, along with multiple distinct editing prompts, editing results from 8 different models, and the corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 24 human annotators. Based on VE-Bench DB, we further propose VE-Bench QA, a quantitative human-aligned measurement for the text-driven video editing task. In addition to the aesthetic, distortion, and other visual quality indicators that traditional VQA methods emphasize, VE-Bench QA focuses on the text-video alignment and the relevance modeling between source and edited videos. It introduces a new assessment network for video editing that attains superior performance in alignment with human preferences.To the best of our knowledge, VE-Bench introduces the first quality assessment dataset for video editing and proposes an effective subjective-aligned quantitative metric for this domain. All models, data, and code will be publicly available to the community.
