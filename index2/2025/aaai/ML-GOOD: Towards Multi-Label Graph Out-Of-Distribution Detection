The out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on graph-structured data is crucial for deploying graph neural networks securely in open-world scenarios. However, existing methods have overlooked the prevalent scenario of multi-label classification in real-world applications. In this work, we investigate the unexplored issue of OOD detection within multi-label node classification tasks. We propose ML-GOOD, a simple yet sufficient approach that utilizes an energy function to gauge the OOD score for each label. We further develop a strategy for amalgamating multiple label energies, allowing for the comprehensive utilization of label information to tackle the primary challenges encountered in multi-label scenarios. Extensive experimentation conducted on seven diverse sets of real-world multi-label graph datasets, encompassing cross-domain scenarios. The results show that the AUROC of ML-GOOD is improved by 5.26% in intra-domain and 6.54% in cross-domain compared to the previous methods. These empirical validations not only affirm the robustness of our methodology but also illuminate new avenues for further exploration within this burgeoning field of research.
