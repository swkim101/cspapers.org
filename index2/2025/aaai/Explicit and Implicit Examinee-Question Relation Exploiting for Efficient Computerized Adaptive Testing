Computerized adaptive testing(CAT) is a crucial task in computer-aided education, which aims to adaptively select suitable question to diagnose examinees' ability status. Existing CAT approaches enhance selection performance by exploring examinee-question(E-Q) relation. These approaches either exclusively utilize explicit E-Q relation. For instance, policy-based approaches determine question selection based on predefined criteria. While effective in adapting to changes in question banks, these methods often entail significant computational costs in searching for suitable questions. Conversely, some studies focus solely on implicit E-Q relation. For example, learning-based approaches train agents to efficiently select questions by learning from large-scale datasets. However, they may struggle with newly introduced questions. Additionally, most of these existing question selectors are based on greedy strategies, which potentially overlooks promising quuestions. To bridge the above two types of approaches, we propose a novel framework named Relation Exploiting-based CAT(RECAT) by exploring and exploiting the implicit and explicit examinee-question relation. Specifically, we first define an examinee true ability-oriented selection objective to select more suitable questions. Then, to learn the implicit E-Q relation, we design a question selector, which explores the examinee ability and generates best-fitting questions for specific examinee ability from two aspects, including generation consistency and knowledge matching. The former aims to maximize the likelihood estimation of the implicit E-Q relation learning process, while the latter is employed to fit the distribution of real questions. To fully exploit explicit E-Q relation, we generate a high-quality candidate set for the given examinee's ability using implicit E-Q relation, which streamlines the search process, minimizing selection latency. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets.
