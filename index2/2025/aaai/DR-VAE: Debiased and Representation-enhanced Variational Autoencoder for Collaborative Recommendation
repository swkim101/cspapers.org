Recommender Systems (RSs) are widely applied for navigating information, and Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of prominent recommendation techniques due to the advantages of domain independence and easy interpretation. Among the numerous CF methods, Variational Autoencoders (VAE), benefiting from modeling in a probabilitistic way, stands out in capturing user preferences through representation learning. Despite the superiority, VAE-based CF models still suffer from two challenging problems: (1) Exposure bias: models in training state are narrowly exposed to a limited, biased sample of data, leading to a skewed understanding of users' true preferences; (2) Posterior collapse: models excessively simplify the learned latent variable distributions, generating na"ive representations that are unable to encapsulate the complex data patterns and thereby resulting improper recommendations. In this paper, we propose a Debiased and Representation-enhanced Variational AutoEncoder (DR-VAE) framework for collaborative recommendations. Specifically, for exposure bias problem, DR-VAE incorporates a Debiasing Estimator, mitigating the impact of exposure bias. For poster collapse issue, DR-VAE innovatively introduces a Flow-based Representation Enhancement module, ensuring us to encapsulate complex data patterns by fitting complex and intricate posterior distributions directly. We provide experimental validations over four datasets to substantiate the efficacy of our DR-VAE framework.
