Algorithms and hardware for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems have made significant recent progress. This advancement has focused attention on formulating combinatorial optimization problems as quadratic polynomials. To improve the performance of solving large QUBO problems, it is essential to minimize the number of binary variables used in the objective function. In this paper, we propose a QUBO formulation that offers a bit capacity advantage over conventional quadratization techniques. As a key application, this formulation significantly reduces the number of binary variables required for score-based Bayesian network structure learning. Experimental results on 16 instances, ranging from 37 to 223 variables, demonstrate that our approach requires fewer binary variables than quadratization by orders of magnitude. Moreover, an annealing machine that implement our formulation have outperformed existing algorithms in score maximization.
