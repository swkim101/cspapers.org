My PhD research focuses on developing a highly accurate and explainable multi-output virtual metrology system for semiconductor manufacturing. Using machine learning, we predict the physical properties of metal layers from process parameters captured by production equipment sensors. Key contributions include a model-agnostic explanatory method based on projective operators, providing insights into the most influential features for multi-output predictions and feature selection algorithms for these tasks.
