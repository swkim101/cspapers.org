Recent development in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved superior performance and generalization capabilities, covered extensive areas of traditional tasks. However, existing large model training frameworks support only a limited number of models and techniques, particularly lacking in support for new models, which makes fine-tuning LLMs challenging for most developers. Therefore, we develop SWIFT, a customizable one-stop infrastructure for large models. With support of over 350+ LLMs and 80+ MLLMs, SWIFT stands as the open-source framework that provide the most comprehensive support for fine-tuning large models. In particular, it is the first training framework that provides systematic support for MLLMs. Moreover, SWIFT integrates post-training processes such as inference, evaluation, and quantization, to facilitate fast adoptions of large models in various application scenarios, offering helpful utilities like benchmark comparisons among different training techniques.
