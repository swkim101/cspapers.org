Anomaly detection has garnered significant attention for its extensive industrial application value. Most existing methods focus on single-view scenarios and fail to detect anomalies hidden in blind spots, leaving a gap in addressing the demands of multi-view detection in practical applications. Ensemble of multiple single-view models is a typical way to tackle the multi-view situation, but it overlooks the correlations between different views. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view anomaly detection framework, Intra-view Decoupling and Inter-view Fusion (IDIF), to explore correlations among views. Our method contains three key components: 1) a proposed Consistency Bottleneck module extracting the common features of different views through information compression and mutual information maximization; 2) an Implicit Voxel Construction module fusing features of different views with prior knowledge represented in the form of voxels; and 3) a View-wise Dropout training strategy enabling the model to learn how to cope with missing views during test. The proposed IDIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Extensive ablation studies also demonstrate the superiority of our methods.
