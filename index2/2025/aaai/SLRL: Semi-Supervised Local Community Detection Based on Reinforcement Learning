Most existing semi-supervised community detection algorithms leverage known communities to learn community structures, subsequently identifying communities that align with these learned community structures. However, differences in community structures may render the community structures learned by these methods inappropriate for the community containing the given node of interest. As a result, the identified community may exclude the given node or be of poor quality. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning, we propose a Semi-supervised Local community detection method based on Reinforcement Learning, named SLRL, which only explores parts of the network surrounding the given node. It first extracts the local structure around a given node with an extractor, followed by selecting communities that are similar to this local structure to distill useful communities. These selected communities are employed to train the expander, which expands the community containing a given node. Experimental results demonstrate that SLRL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on five real-world datasets.
