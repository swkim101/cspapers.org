In bounded-suboptimal heuristic search, the aim is to find a solution path within a given bound as quickly as possible, which is crucial when computational resources are limited. Recent research has demonstrated Weighted A* variants such as XDP that find bounded suboptimal solutions without needing to perform state re-expansions; they work by shifting where the suboptimality in the search is allowed. However, the suboptimality distribution is fixed before the search begins. This paper introduces Dynamic Suboptimality Weighted A* (DSWA*), a search framework that allows suboptimality to be dynamically distributed at runtime, based on the properties of the search. Experiments show that dynamic policies can consistently outperform existing algorithms across a diverse set of domains, particularly those with dynamic costs.
