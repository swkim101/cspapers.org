Text-to-Video (T2V) models, despite recent advancements, struggle with factual accuracy, especially for knowledge-dense content. We introduce FACT-V (Factual Accuracy in Content Translation to Video), a system integrating multi-source knowledge retrieval into T2V pipelines. FACT-V offers two key benefits: i) improved factual accuracy of generated videos through dynamically retrieved information, and ii) increased interpretability by providing users with the augmented prompt information. A preliminary evaluation demonstrates the potential of knowledge-augmented approaches in improving the accuracy and reliability of T2V systems, particularly for entity-specific or time-sensitive prompts.
