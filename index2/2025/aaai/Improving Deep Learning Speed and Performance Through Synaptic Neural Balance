We present theory of synaptic neural balance and we show experimentally that synaptic neural balance can improve deep learning speed, and accuracy, even in data-scarce environments. Given an additive cost function (regularizer) of the synaptic weights, a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its incoming weights is equal to the total cost of its outgoing weights. For large classes of networks, activation functions, and regularizers, neurons can be balanced fully or partially using scaling operations that do not change their functionality. Furthermore, these balancing operations are associated with a strictly convex optimization problem with a single optimum and can be carried out in any order. 
In our simulations, we systematically observe that: (1) Fully balancing before training results in better performance as compared to several other training approaches; (2) Interleaving partial (layer-wise) balancing and stochastic gradient descent steps during training results in faster learning convergence and better overall accuracy (with L1 balancing converging faster than L2 balancing); and (3) When given limited training data, neural balanced models outperform plain or regularized models; and this is observed in both feedforward and recurrent networks. In short, the evidence supports that neural balancing operations could be added to the arsenal of methods used to regularize and train neural networks. Furthermore, balancing operations are entirely local and can be carried out asynchronously, making them plausible for biological or neuromorphic systems.
