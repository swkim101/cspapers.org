In this paper, we explore how to develop salient object detection models using adder neural networks (ANNs), which are more energy efficient than convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially for real-world applications. Based on our empirical studies, we show that directly replacing the convolutions in CNN-based models with adder layers leads to a substantial loss of activations in the decoder part. This makes the feature maps learned in the decoder lack pattern diversity and hence results in a significant performance drop. To alleviate this issue, by investigating the statistics of the feature maps produced by adder layers, we introduce a simple yet effective differential merging strategy to augment the feature representations learned by adder layers and present a simple baseline for SOD using ANNs. Experiments on popular salient object detection benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method with a simple feature pyramid network (FPN) architecture achieves comparable performance to previous state-of-theart CNN-based models and consumes much less energy. We hope this work could facilitate the development of ANNs in binary segmentation tasks.
