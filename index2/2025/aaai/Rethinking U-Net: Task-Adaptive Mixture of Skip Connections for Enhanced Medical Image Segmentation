U-Net is a widely used model for medical image segmentation, renowned for its strong feature extraction capabilities and U-shaped design, which incorporates skip connections to preserve critical information. However, its decoders exhibit information-specific preferences for the supplementary content provided by skip connections, instead of adhering to a strict one-to-one correspondence, which limits its flexibility across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, we propose the Task-Adaptive Mixture of Skip Connections (TA-MoSC) module, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. TA-MoSC innovatively reinterprets skip connections as a task allocation problem, employing a routing mechanism to adaptively select expert combinations at different decoding stages. By introducing MoE, our approach enhances the sparsity of the model, and lightweight convolutional experts are shared across all skip connection stages, with a Balanced Expert Utilization (BEU) strategy ensuring that all experts are effectively trained, maintaining training balance and preserving computational efficiency. Our approach introduces minimal additional parameters to the original U-Net but significantly enhances its performance and stability. Experiments on GlaS, MoNuSeg, Synapse, and ISIC16 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and better generalization across diverse tasks. Moreover, while this work focuses on medical image segmentation, the proposed method can be seamlessly extended to other segmentation tasks, offering a flexible and efficient solution for diverse applications.
