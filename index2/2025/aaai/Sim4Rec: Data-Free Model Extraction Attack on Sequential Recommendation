Model extraction attack shows promising performance in revealing sequential recommendation (SeqRec) robustness, e.g., as an upstream task of transfer-based attack to provide optimization feedback for downstream attacks. However, existing work either heavily relies on impractical prior knowledge or has impressive attack performance. In this paper, we focus on data-free model extraction attack on SeqRec, which aims to efficiently train a surrogate model that closely imitates the target model in a practical setting. Conducting such an attack is challenging. First, imitating sequential training data for accurate model extraction is hard without prior knowledge. Second, limited queries for the target model require the attack to be efficient. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial framework Sim4Rec which includes two modules, i.e., controllable sequence generation and reinforced adversarial distillation. The former allows a sequential generator to produce synthetic data similar to training data through pre-training with controllable generated samples. The latter efficiently extracts the target model via reinforced adversarial knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of Sim4Rec.
