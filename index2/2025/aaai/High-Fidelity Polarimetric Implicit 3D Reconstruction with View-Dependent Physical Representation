Neural implicit methods have made remarkable progress in 3D reconstruction. However, previous methods often assume view-independent properties of target objects, which fails to accurately reconstruct objects with challenging characteristics, such as transparency and high reflectivity. To address this limitation, we propose a polarimetric implicit 3D reconstruction method that integrates geometric and polarization information, enabling the production of high-quality meshes in complex scenes. For high-fidelity surface reconstruction, we introduce a view-dependent physical representation that thoroughly analyzes the subtle physical properties of reflections. The reconstruction process is further enhanced by a simple yet effective view-dependent detection algorithm and optimized using the principles of ray tracing and polarization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in both real and synthetic scenarios.
