Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (GenAI) have markedly changed the landscape of many fields, including education. While these tools have significant capabilities, they also require understanding to effectively and responsibly use them. Additionally, little work has been done to evaluate how these tools can best benefit education at the secondary level, with design insights from instructors. My work focuses on informing secondary instructors of these tools, receiving their input on how to make these tools work best for them, and finally using this input to create and evaluate an in-class Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot for their students to use to improve learning outcomes. This work aims to bridge the gap between the latest in computing technology and secondary education classrooms.
