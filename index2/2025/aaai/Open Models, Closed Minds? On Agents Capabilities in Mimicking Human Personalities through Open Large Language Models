The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology. However, research on the personalities exhibited by LLMs has largely been confined to limited investigations using individual psychological tests, primarily focusing on a small number of commercially licensed LLMs. This approach overlooks the extensive use and significant advancements observed in open-source LLMs. This work aims to address both the above limitations by conducting an in-depth investigation of a significant body of 12 LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models, through the two most well-known psychological assessment tests, namely Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Big Five Inventory (BFI). Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that (i) each LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; (ii) personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); and (iii) combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of LLMs.
