Unsupervised Person Re-identification (Re-ID) aims to identify the same person shot from non-overlapping cameras without any annotated data. In this task, attributes such as contrast, saturation, and resolution of the camera cause the deviation in target features. Since the camera label is readily available, they are employed to achieve the constraints across cameras and smooth the deviations during the model training phase. However, features from the same camera are prone to generating false positives due to the identical camera properties, which induce camera deviations on pseudo-label assignment. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel camera-unbiased method named Camera Deviation Elimination Learning (CDE-Learning). In CDE-Learning, the Camera Deviation Compensation (CDC) module is designed to align data distributions from disparate cameras to decouple camera information from identity information during the pseudo-label allocation. Our Camera Deviation Balancing (CDB) module integrates different camera constraints in a united loss and adjusts camera constraints by constructing contrastive pairs between intra-camera and inter-camera. After explicit constraints, the Camera Attribution Auxiliary (CAA) task predicts whether a pair of images originates from the same camera to implicitly enhance the capacity to distinguish the camera deviation. We demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed CDE-Learning on benchmark datasets.
