Despite the advanced long-sequence modeling of Mamba, which has expanded its applications in image restoration, there remains a lack of exploration combining its strengths with the specific characteristics of JPEG image restoration, where high-frequency components are lost after the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). To address this, we introduce DCTMamba, a new framework designed to apply Mamba more effectively to JPEG image restoration. Specifically, our method integrates the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) into the Mamba to establish the sequential scanning from lower to higher frequencies, enabling the network to initially reconstruct coarse structures and progressively refine the image with more intricate details. Furthermore, recognizing the variable frequency distributions that arise from DCT transformations across different image sizes, we have developed Scale-Adaptive Normalization to manage these variations adeptly. Comprehensive experiments confirm that DCTMamba significantly outperforms existing solutions, achieving high fidelity in both coarse structures and fine details.CTMamba significantly outperforms existing solutions, achieving high fidelity
