Identifying cancer genes is crucial for treatment and understanding pathogenesis. Recent methods typically leverage protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or gene functional association data from annotated gene sets. There may be some shared neighborhood structure information between these two types of gene association data. While this common information may contain more accurate gene association information, existing methods often overlook this potential. To address this gap, we introduce DISFusion, which integrates multi-omics cancer data, PPI networks, and gene functional associations to identify cancer genes. A key innovation of DISFusion is the cross-view decorrelation loss, which enhances the common information between PPI networks and gene functional associations, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments indicate that DISFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits greater generalization ability. Moreover, analysis of CPTAC pan-cancer proteomic data highlights significant associations between the 30 novel cancer genes predicted by DISFusion and multiple cancer types, underscoring its practical utility. These findings validate the effectiveness of enhancing common information and provide new insights into cancer gene identification.
