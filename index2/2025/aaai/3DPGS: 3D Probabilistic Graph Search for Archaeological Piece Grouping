In this paper, we propose a new benchmark called "Archaeological Piece Grouping." In the field of archaeology, it is common for broken archaeological pieces, such as artifact fragments, to be mixed. Archaeologists often spend significant time distinguishing these pieces and categorizing them into different groups. Our benchmark introduces a novel, comprehensive dataset named ArcPie, along with new evaluation metrics for this task. Additionally, we propose a new framework called "3D Probabilistic Graph Search" (3DPGS) to address the problem of grouping mixed archaeological pieces. This framework includes a relation network designed to learn the relationships among all the input 3D pieces. Utilizing the relationships learned, our framework generates a probabilistic matching graph that describes the affinity of any two pieces. We also introduce a novel search algorithm to identify groups according to this matrix. Our framework significantly outperforms other baselines.
