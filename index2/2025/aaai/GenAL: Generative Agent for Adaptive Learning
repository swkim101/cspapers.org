Adaptive learning, also known as adaptive teaching, relies on learning path recommendations that sequentially suggest personalized learning items (such as lectures and exercises) to meet the unique needs of each learner. Despite the extensive research in this field, previous approaches have primarily modeled the interaction sequences between learners and items using simple indexing, leading to three issues: (1) The utilization of information from both learners and items is not sufficient. For instance, these models are unable to leverage the semantic information contained within the textual content of the items. (2) Models need to be retrained on different datasets separately, which makes it difficult to adapt to the continuously expanding item pool in online educational scenarios. 
(3) The existing recommendation paradigm based on trained reinforcement learning frameworks, suffers from unstable recommendation performance in sparse learning logs.
To address these challenges, we propose a generalized Generative Agent for Adaptive Learning (GenAL), which integrates educational tools with LLMs' semantic understanding to enable effective and generalizable learning path recommendations across diverse data distributions. Specifically, our framework consists of two components: the Global Thinking Agent, which updates the learner profile and reflects on recommendation outcomes based on the learner's historical learning records. The other is the Local Teaching Agent, which recommends items using educational prior knowledge. Leveraging the LLM's robust semantic understanding, our framework does not rely on item indexing but instead extracts relevant information from the textual content. We evaluated our approach on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our GenAL not only consistently outperforms all baselines but also exhibits strong generalization ability.
