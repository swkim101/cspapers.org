Multi-interest recommendation constantly aspires to an oracle individual preference modeling approach, that satisfies the diverse and dynamic properties. Fueled by the deep learning technology, existing neural network (NN)-based recommender systems employ single-point or multi-point interest representation strategy to realize preference modeling,and boost the recommendation performance with a remarkable margin. However, as parameterized approximate functions, NN-based methods remain deficiencies with respect to the adaptability towards distinctive preference patterns cross different users and the calibration over the individual current intent. In this paper, we revisit multi-interest recommendation with the lens of stochastic process and Bayesian inference. Specifically, we propose to learn a distribution over functions to depict the individual diverse preferences rather than a unified function to approximate preference. Subsequently, the recommendation is encouraged with the uncertainty estimation which conforms to the dynamic shifting intent. Along these lines, we establish the connection between multi-interest recommendation and neural processes by proposing NP-Rec, which realizes the flexible multiple interests modeling and uncertainty estimation, simultaneously. Empirical study on 4 real world datasets demonstrates that our NP-Rec attains superior recommendation performances to several state-of-the-art baselines, where the average improvement achieves up to 13.94%.
