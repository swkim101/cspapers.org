Image super-resolution (SR) is essential for bridging the gap between modern hardware and real-time computer graphics (CG) applications. It reduces CG workload by allowing low-resolution rendering, with original quality restored later via mathematical operations or machine learning. However, recent learning-based SR methods often rely on complex models, demanding high computational resources and undermining the benefits of reduced rendering workload.

Our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the SR process and rendering reveals that readily accessible rendering information can significantly enhance neural network design by serving as additional features. To capitalize on this, we propose CGSR, an optimization framework designed for lightweight real-time super-resolution. CGSR utilizes rendering information to boost both network extensibility and efficiency. It utilizes progressively available rendering information from the pipeline, which arrives earlier than the rendered frame, enabling pre-processing and masking of latency. These features are then integrated into a selected SR network backbone to form a CG-enhanced network. This network is further optimized and refined into a CG-optimized version using neural architecture search (NAS). To improve runtime performance, CGSR also employs rendering-aware hybrid pruning, which dynamically prunes the network based on temporal rendering data. Evaluation results show that CGSR significantly reduces parameter size, multi-add operations, and inference time while maintaining high SR quality across various backbone SR networks.
