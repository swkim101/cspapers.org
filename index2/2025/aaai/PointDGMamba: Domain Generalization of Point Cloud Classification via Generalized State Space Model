Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to improve the generalizability of point cloud classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. However, they often suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to the use of convolution neural networks or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of state space models (SSMs) in DG PCC and find that directly applying SSMs into DG PCC will encounter several challenges: the inherent topology of the point cloud tends to be disrupted and leads to noise accumulation during the serialization stage. Besides, the lack of designs in domain-agnostic feature learning and data scanning will introduce unanticipated domain-specific information into the 3D sequence data. To this end, we propose a novel framework, PointDGMamba, that excels in strong generalizability toward unseen domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. PointDGMamba consists of three innovative components: Masked Sequence Denoising (MSD), Sequence-wise Cross-domain Feature Aggregation (SCFA), and Dual-level Domain Scanning (DDS). In particular, MSD selectively masks out the noised point tokens of the point cloud sequences, SCFA introduces cross-domain but same-class point cloud features to encourage the model to learn how to extract more generalized features. DDS includes intra-domain scanning and cross-domain scanning to facilitate information exchange between features. In addition, we propose a new and more challenging benchmark PointDG-3to1 for multi-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of PointDGMamba.
