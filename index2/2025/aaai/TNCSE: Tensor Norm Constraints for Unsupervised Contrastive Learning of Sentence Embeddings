Unsupervised sentence embedding representation has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. As a tensor, sentence embedding has two critical properties: direction and norm.
Existing works have been limited to constraining only the orientation of the samples' representations while ignoring the features of their module lengths. To address this issue, we propose a new training objective that optimizes the training of unsupervised contrastive learning by constraining the module length features between positive samples. We combine the training objective of Tensor's Norm Constraints with ensemble learning to propose a new Sentence Embedding representation framework, TNCSE. We evaluate seven semantic text similarity tasks, and the results show that TNCSE and derived models are the current state-of-the-art approach; in addition, we conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations, and the results show that TNCSE outperforms other baselines.
