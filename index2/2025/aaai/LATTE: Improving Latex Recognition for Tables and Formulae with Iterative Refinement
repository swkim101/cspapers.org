Portable Document Format (PDF) files are dominantly used for storing and disseminating scientific research, legal documents, and tax information. LaTeX is a popular application for creating PDF documents. Despite its advantages, LaTeX is not WYSWYG---what you see is what you get, i.e., the LaTeX source and rendered PDF images look drastically different, especially for formulae and tables. This gap makes it hard to modify or export LaTeX sources for formulae and tables from PDF images, and existing work is still limited. First, prior work generates LaTeX sources in a single iteration and struggles with complex LaTeX formulae. Second, existing work mainly recognizes and extracts LaTeX sources for formulae; and is incapable or ineffective for tables. This paper proposes LATTE, the first iterative refinement framework for LaTeX recognition. Specifically, we propose delta-view as feedback, which compares and pinpoints the differences between a pair of rendered images of the extracted LaTeX source and the expected correct image. Such delta-view feedback enables our fault localization model to localize the faulty parts of the incorrect recognition more accurately and enables our LaTeX refinement model to repair the incorrect extraction more accurately. LATTE improves the LaTeX source extraction accuracy of both LaTeX formulae and tables, outperforming existing techniques as well as GPT-4V by at least 7.07% of exact match, with a success refinement rate of 46.08% (formula) and 25.51% (table).
