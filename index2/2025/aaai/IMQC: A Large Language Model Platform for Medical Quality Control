Medical quality control (MQC) indicators are essential for evaluating the performance of healthcare institutions to ensure high-quality patient care. In this paper, we report the design, implementation, and deployment of the Intelligent EMR-LLM platform for Medical Quality Control (IMQC), a large language model (LLM)-empowered system for automatically computing MQC indicators for enhancing the quality of medical services in Shanghai. It consists of an LLM (i.e., EMR-LLM) for processing electronic medical records (EMRs). With EMR-LLM, IMQC translates existing MQC indicators into a standardized representation language and automatically computes them based on EMRs. Since its deployment in February 2024, IMQC has been adopted by the Shanghai Medical Quality Management Center and associated hospitals. So far, it has processed 1,245 medical quality indicators for secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals, achieving an MQC evaluation accuracy of 93.31%, which is comparable to human experts. It has significantly improved efficiency, increasing from 10 EMRs per hour per human expert to over 1,000 EMRs per hour on average using one single H800 GPU. Over the first round of deployment in Shanghai, it is estimated that IMQC saves around 3.42 million RMB per month in manpower costs compared to traditional reporting methods. The successful deployment of IMQC sets a precedence for other regions to adopt similar AI-driven solutions to enhance medical quality control.
