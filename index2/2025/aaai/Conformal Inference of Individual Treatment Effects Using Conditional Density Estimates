In an era where diverse and complex data are increasingly accessible, the precise prediction of individual treatment effects (ITE) becomes crucial across fields such as healthcare, economics, and social policy. Current state-of-the-art approaches, while providing valid prediction intervals through Conformal Quantile Regression (CQR) and related techniques, often yield overly conservative prediction intervals. In this work, we introduce a conformal inference approach to ITE using the conditional density of the outcome given the covariates. We leverage the reference distribution technique to efficiently estimate the conditional densities as the score functions under a two-stage conformal ITE framework. We show that our prediction intervals are not only marginally valid but are narrower than existing methods. Experimental results further validate the usefulness of our method.
