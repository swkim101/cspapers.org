Multi-object tracking is a challenging vision task that requires simultaneous reasoning about object detection and object association. Conventional solutions use frame as the basic unit and typically rely on a motion predictor that exploits the appearance features to associate detected candidates, leading to insufficient adaptability to long-term associations. In this study, we propose a section-based multi-object tracking approach that integrates a temporal coherent Object Flow Tracker (OFTrack), capable of achieving simultaneous multi-frame tracking by treating multiple consecutive frames as the basic processing unit, denoted as a “section”. Our OFTrack boosts the optical flow to the object flow by employing object perception and section-based motion estimation strategies. Object perception adopts object-aware sampling and scale-aware correlation to enable precise target discrimination. Motion estimation models the correlation of different objects in multi-frames via specialized temporal-spatial attention to achieve robust association in very long videos. Additionally, to address the oscillation of unpredictable trajectories in multi-frame estimation, we have designed temporal coherent enhancement including the trajectory masking pre-training and the smoothing constraint on trajectory curves. Comprehensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.
