Long-term series forecasting aims to predict future data over long horizons based on historical information. However, existing methods struggle to effectively utilize long lookback windows due to overfitting, computational resource constraints, or information extraction challenges, thereby limiting them to using limited lookback windows for predicting long-term future series. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Input Refinement and Prediction Auxiliary (IRPA) framework, a lightweight model consisting of four linear layers designed to extract key information from ultra-long lookback windows to enhance limited lookback windows and assist prediction processes. IRPA comprises an Input Refinement Module (IRM) and a Prediction Auxiliary Module (PAM), each constructed from two linear layer sub-modules. The IRM performs effective decomposition and patching of ultra-long series, refining seasonal and trend features to increase the information density in limited lookback windows and mitigate overfitting and parameter inflation. The PAM extracts historical similarities and seasonal patterns from ultra-long lookback windows to significantly improve prediction accuracy. IRPA substantially extends the utilization of lookback windows, offering a lightweight and efficient solution with broad applicability. Experimental results on eight datasets show IRPA reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by an average of 16.1% for various models.
