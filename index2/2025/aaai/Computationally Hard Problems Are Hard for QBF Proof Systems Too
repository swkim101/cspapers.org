There has been tremendous progress in the past decade in the
field of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), both in practical
solving as well as in creating a theory of corresponding proof
systems and their proof complexity analysis. Both for solving
and for proof complexity, it is important to have interesting
formula families on which we can test solvers and gauge the
strength of the proof systems. There are currently few such
formula families in the literature.
We initiate a general programme how to transform computationally
hard problems (located in the polynomial hierarchy)
into QBFs hard for the main QBF resolution systems Q-Res
and QU-Res that relate to core QBF solvers. We illustrate
this general approach on three problems from graph theory
and logic. This yields QBF families that are provably hard for
Q-Res and QU-Res (without any complexity assumptions).
