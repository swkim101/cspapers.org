Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed vision and language modeling, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) complements data-driven AI via a knowledge-driven approach, enhancing our understanding of the physical world. My work focuses on: 1) automating scientific reasoning with language models, 2) improving geometric interpretation, 3) developing foundation models for multiphysics.
