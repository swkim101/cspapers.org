Recent advancements in single image super-resolution have been predominantly driven by token mixers and transformer architectures. WaveMixSR utilized the WaveMix architecture, employing a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform for spatial token mixing, achieving superior performance in super-resolution tasks with remarkable resource efficiency. In this work, we present an enhanced version of the WaveMixSR architecture by (1) replacing the traditional transpose convolution layer with a pixel shuffle operation and (2) implementing a multistage design for higher resolution tasks (4x). Our experiments demonstrate that our enhanced model -- WaveMixSR-V2 -- outperforms other architectures in multiple super-resolution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art for the BSD100 dataset, while also consuming fewer resources and exhibiting higher parameter efficiency and throughput.
