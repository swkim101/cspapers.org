The learnware paradigm aims to establish a learnware dock system of numerous well-trained machine learning models, enabling users to reuse existing helpful models for their tasks instead of starting from scratch. Each learnware in the system is a well-established model submitted by its developer, associated with a specification generated by the learnware dock system. The specification characterizes the specialty of the corresponding model, enabling it to be identified accurately for new task requirements. Existing specification generation methods are mostly based on the Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) technique, which uses the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to seek a reduced set that characterizes the model's capabilities. However, existing RKME-based methods mainly utilize feature information to generate specifications by assuming the existence of the ground-truth labeling function, while leaving the label information, which is capable of providing rich semantic characterization, untouched. Furthermore, the quality of the generated specifications heavily relies on the choice of the kernels, which makes it prohibitive to adapt to all real-world scenarios. In this paper, to overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel specification approach named LANE, i.e., Label-Aware Neural Embedding. In LANE, the neural embedding space is utilized to replace the RKHS, effectively circumventing the step of kernel selection and thereby addressing the dependency on kernels in existing RKME-based specification methods. More importantly, LANE uses the label information as additional supervision to enhance the generation process, resulting in specifications of superior quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed LANE approach in the learnware paradigm.
