Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) aims to transfer knowledge from seen source domains to unseen target domains, which is crucial for evaluating the generalization and robustness of models. Recent studies focus on utilizing visual styles to bridge the domain gap between different domains. However, the serious dilemma of gradient instability and local optimization problem occurs in those style-based CD-FSL methods. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a novel crop-global style perturbation method, called Self-Versatility Adversarial Style Perturbation (SVasP), which enhances the gradient stability and escapes from poor sharp minima jointly. Specifically, SVasP simulates more diverse potential target domain adversarial styles via diversifying input patterns and aggregating localized crop style gradients, to serve as global style perturbation stabilizers within one image, a concept we refer to as self-versatility. Then a novel objective function is proposed to maximize visual discrepancy while maintaining semantic consistency between global, crop, and adversarial features. Having the stabilized global style perturbation in the training phase, one can obtain a flattened minima in the loss landscape, boosting the transferability of the model to the target domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
