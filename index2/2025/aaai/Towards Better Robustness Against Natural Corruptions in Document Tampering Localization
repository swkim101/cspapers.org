Marvelous advances have been exhibited in recent document tampering localization (DTL) systems. However, confronted with corrupted tampered document images, their vulnerability is fatal in real-world scenarios. While robustness against adversarial attack has been extensively studied by adversarial training (AT), the robustness on natural corruptions remains under-explored for DTL. In this paper, to overcome forensic dependency, we propose the adversarial forensic regularization (AFR) based on min-max optimization to improve robustness. Specifically, we adopt mutual information (MI) to represent forensic dependency between two random variable over tampered and authentic pixels spaces, where the MI can be approximated by Jensen-Shannon-Divergence (JSD) with empirical sampling. To further enable a trade-off between predictive representations in clean tampered document pixels and robust ones in corrupted pixels, an additional regularization term is formulated with divergence between clean and perturbed pixels distribution (DDR). Following min-max optimization framework, our method can also work well against adversarial attacks. To evaluate our proposed method, we collect a dataset (i.e., TSorie-CRP) for evaluating robustness against natural corruptions in real scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against natural corruptions. Without any surprise, our method also achieves good performance against adversarial attack on DTL benchmark datasets.
