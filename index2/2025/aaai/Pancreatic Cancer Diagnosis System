My research direction is about the pancreatic cancer diagnosis system. Pancreatic cancer, as one of the cancers with the highest mortality rate, has always been a difficult problem in world medicine. I hope that through my efforts, I can contribute to the integration of AI and medicine, and contribute to increasing the probability of early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
