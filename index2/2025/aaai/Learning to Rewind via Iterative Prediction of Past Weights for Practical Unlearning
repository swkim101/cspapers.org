In artificial intelligence (AI), many legal conflicts have arisen, especially concerning privacy and copyright associated with training data. When an AI model's training data incurs privacy concerns, it becomes imperative to develop a new model devoid of influences from such contentious data. However, retraining from scratch is often not viable due to the extensive data requirements and heavy computational costs. Machine unlearning presents a promising solution by enabling the selective erasure of specific knowledge from models. Despite its potential, many existing approaches in machine unlearning are based on scenarios that are either impractical or could lead to unintended degradation of model performance. We utilize the concept of weight prediction to approximate the less-learned weights based on observations about further training. By repetition of 1) finetuning on specific data and 2) weight prediction, our work gradually eliminates knowledge about the specific data. We verify its ability to eliminate side effects caused by problematic data and show its effectiveness across various architectures, datasets, and tasks.
