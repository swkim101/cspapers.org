Parsers and printers are vital for data synchronisation between different serialisation formats. As they are tightly related, much research has been devoted to showing that both can be derived from a single definition. It, however, turns out to be challenging to extend this work with exact-printing, which recovers the original source text for the parsed data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackling the challenge that considers a parser-printer pair as a mechanism to synchronize the input text string with the data, and formalizes them as a bidirectional program (lens). We propose the first biparser framework to support exact-printing with non-injective parsers, provide a library of combinators for common patterns, and demonstrate its usefulness with biparsers for subsets of JSON and YAML.
