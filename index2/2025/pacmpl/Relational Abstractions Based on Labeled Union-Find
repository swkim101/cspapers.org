We introduce a new family of abstractions based on a data structure that we call labeled union-find, an extension of the classic efficient union-find data structure where edges carry labels. These labels have a composition operation that obey the group axioms. Like union-find, the labeled version can efficiently compute the transitive closure of a relation, but it is not limited to equivalence relations; it can represent any injective transformation between equivalence classes, which includes two-variables per equality (TVPE) constraints of the form y = a√ó x + b. Using abstract interpretation theory, we study the properties deriving from the use of abstract relations as labels, and the combination of labeled union-find with other representations of constraints, allowing both improvements in precision and simplification of existing constraints. Due to its efficiency, the labeled union-find abstractions could find many uses; we use it in two use cases, program analysis based on abstract interpretation and constraint solving for SMT, with encouraging preliminary results.
