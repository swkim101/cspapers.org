 Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices with error correction. We study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. Optimal or near-optimal compilation is critical for both efficiency and correctness. The compilation problem requires (1)
 mapping
 circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2)
 routing
 execution paths between interacting qubits. We solve this problem efficiently and near-optimally with a novel algorithm that exploits the
 dependency structure
 of circuit operations to formulate discrete optimization problems that can be approximated via
 simulated annealing
 , a classic and simple algorithm. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach is powerful and flexible for compiling realistic workloads.
