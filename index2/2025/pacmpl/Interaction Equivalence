 Contextual equivalence is the
 de facto
 standard notion of program equivalence. A key theorem is that contextual equivalence is an
 equational theory
 . Making contextual equivalence more intensional, for example taking into account the time cost of the computation, seems a natural refinement. Such a change, however, does
 not
 induce an equational theory, for an apparently essential reason: cost is not invariant under reduction.
 

 
In the paradigmatic case of the untyped λ-calculus, we introduce
 interaction equivalence
 . Inspired by game semantics, we observe the number of interaction steps between terms and contexts but—crucially—ignore their internal steps. We prove that interaction equivalence is an equational theory and characterize it as ℬ, the well-known theory induced by Böhm tree equality. It is the first observational characterization of ℬ obtained
 without
 enriching the discriminating power of contexts with extra features such as non-determinism. To prove our results, we develop interaction-based refinements of the Böhm-out technique and of intersection types.
