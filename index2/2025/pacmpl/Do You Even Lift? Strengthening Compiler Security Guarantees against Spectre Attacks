Mainstream compilers implement different countermeasures to prevent specific classes of speculative execution
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attacks. Unfortunately, these countermeasures either lack formal guarantees or come with proofs restricted to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
speculative semantics capturing only a subset of the speculation mechanisms supported by modern CPUs,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thereby limiting their practical applicability. Ideally, these security proofs should target a speculative semantics
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capturing the effects of all speculation mechanisms implemented in modern CPUs. However, this is impractical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and requires new secure compilation proofs to support additional speculation mechanisms.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel secure compilation framework that allows lifting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the security guarantees provided by Spectre countermeasures from weaker speculative semantics (ignoring
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
some speculation mechanisms) to stronger ones (accounting for the omitted mechanisms) without requiring
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
new secure compilation proofs. Using our lifting framework, we performed the most comprehensive security

different countermeasures against 5 classes of Spectre attacks, which we proved secure against a speculative
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
semantics accounting for 5 different speculation mechanisms. Our analysis highlights that fence-based and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
retpoline-based countermeasures can be securely lifted to the strongest speculative semantics under study.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In contrast, countermeasures based on speculative load hardening cannot be securely lifted to semantics
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
supporting indirect jump speculation.
