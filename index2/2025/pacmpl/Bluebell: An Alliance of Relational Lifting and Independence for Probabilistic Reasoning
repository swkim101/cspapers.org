 We present Bluebell, a program logic for reasoning about
 
 
 
probabilistic programs where unary and relational styles of reasoning
 
 
 
come together to create new reasoning tools. Unary-style reasoning is
 
 
 
very expressive and is powered by foundational mechanisms to reason
 
 
 
about probabilistic behavior like
 independence
 and
 conditioning
 . The relational style of reasoning, on the other
 
 
 
hand, naturally shines when the properties of interest
 compare
 the behavior of similar programs (e.g. when proving differential
 
 
 
privacy) managing to avoid having to characterize the output
 
 
 
distributions of the individual programs. So far, the two styles of
 
 
 
reasoning have largely remained separate in the many program logics
 
 
 
designed for the deductive verification of probabilistic programs. In
 
 
 
Bluebell, we unify these styles of reasoning through the introduction of
 
 
 
a new modality called “joint conditioning” that can encode and
 
 
 
illuminate the rich interaction between
 conditional
 
 
 
independence
 and
 relational liftings
 ; the two powerhouses
 
 
 
from the two styles of reasoning.
