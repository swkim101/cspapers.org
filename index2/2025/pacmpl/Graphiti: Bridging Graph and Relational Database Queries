This paper presents an automated reasoning technique for checking equivalence between graph database queries written in Cypher and relational queries in SQL. To formalize a suitable notion of equivalence in this setting, we introduce the concept of database transformers, which transform database instances between graph and relational models. We then propose a novel verification methodology that checks equivalence modulo a given transformer by reducing the original problem to verifying equivalence between a pair of SQL queries. This reduction is achieved by embedding a subset of Cypher into SQL through syntax-directed translation, allowing us to leverage existing research on automated reasoning for SQL while obviating the need for reasoning simultaneously over two different data models. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Graphiti and used it to check equivalence between graph and relational queries. Our experiments demonstrate that Graphiti is useful both for verification and refutation and that it can uncover subtle bugs, including those found in Cypher tutorials and academic papers.
