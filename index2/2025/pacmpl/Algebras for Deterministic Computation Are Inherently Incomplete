Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) provides an elegant algebraic framework for describing non-deterministic finite-state computations. Using a small finite set of non-deterministic programming constructs (sequencing, non-deterministic choice, and iteration) it is able to express all non-deterministic finite state control flow over a finite set of primitives. It is natural to ask whether there exists a similar finite set of constructs that can capture all deterministic computation. We show that this is not the case. More precisely, the deterministic fragment of KAT is not generated by any finite set of regular control flow operations. This generalizes earlier results about the expressivity of the traditional control flow operations, i.e., sequential composition, if-then-else and while.
