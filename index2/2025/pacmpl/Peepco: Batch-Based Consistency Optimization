We present batch-based consistency, a new approach for consistency optimization that allows programmers to specialize consistency with application-level integrity properties. We implement the approach with a two-step process: we statically infer optimal consistency requirements for executions of bounded sets of operations, and then, use the inferred requirements to parameterize a new distributed protocol to relax operation reordering at run time when it is safe to do so. Our approach supports standard notions of consistency. We implement batch-based consistency in Peepco, demonstrate its expressiveness for partial data replication, and examine Peepcoâ€™s run-time performance impact in different settings.
