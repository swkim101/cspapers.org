We operate one of the largest short video streaming platforms in the world, serving billions of global users every day. Similar to other platforms, we employ Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, which adaptively selects an appropriate representation from a group of video representations forming a bitrate ladder. In this paper, instead of developing yet another ABR algorithm, we optimize the bitrate ladder configuration, which constitutes the decision space of ABR, by developing a system called TLadder. TLadder explicitly maximizes the quality-of-experience (QoE) that a ladder is expected to incur, through a principled optimization framework with polynomial complexity and provable optimality. TLadder's optimization jointly considers the video content dimension (i.e., the bitrate-quality tradeoff of candidate representations) and the playback feedback dimension (e.g., network condition, rebuffering time, and playback bitrate). TLadder also introduces a high-fidelity simulator that provides the optimizer with accurate QoE estimation. We evaluate TLadder via a large-scale A/B test across 0.24 billion users. TLadder achieves a 6.2–20% reduction in rebuffering time, a 2.7–3.5 unit increase in visual quality (in an 85–100 unit range), and a 1–4% reduction in CDN traffic cost, compared to our previous bitrate laddering approach. It also outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches based on extensive trace-driven simulation.
