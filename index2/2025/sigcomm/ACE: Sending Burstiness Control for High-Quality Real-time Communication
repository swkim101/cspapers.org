Modern real-time communication (RTC) demands both ultra-low latency and consistently high visual quality. Yet, as content becomes more dynamic and RTTs shrink, we reveal a previously overlooked problem: long-tail queuing latency in the sender's pacing queue between encoder and network. This phenomenon is rooted in a mismatch between the bursty frame stream produced by the encoder and the smooth traffic expected by the network. Existing approaches trying to smoothen the bitrate inevitably force an undesirable trade-off between latency and video quality. To address this, we propose a dual-control approach that manages both the encoding and transmission burstiness. At the sender, we dynamically adjust the bucket size of a token-based pacer to control burstiness at the granularity of frame level. Within the encoder, we introduce an adaptive complexity mechanism that smoothens frame sizes without sacrificing quality. Trace-driven emulation and real-world experiments show our solution ACE reduces end-to-end 95th percentile latency by up to 43% while maintaining superior visual quality versus the state of the art.
