Cloud providers use SmartNIC-accelerated virtual switches (vSwitches) to offer rich network functions (NFs) for tenant VMs. Constrained by limited SmartNIC resources, it is a challenge to provide sufficient network performance for high-demand VMs. Meanwhile, we observed a significant number of idle vSwitches in the data center, which led us to consider leveraging them to build a remote resource pool for high-demand virtual NICs (vNICs). In this work, we propose Nezha, a distributed vSwitch load sharing system. Nezha reuses the existing idle SmartNICs to handle the excess load from the local SmartNIC without adding new devices. Nezha offloads stateless rule/flow tables to the remote, while keeping states locally. This eliminates the need for state synchronization, facilitating load sharing and failover. The deployment cost of Nezha is only a small fraction of that required to deploy new devices. Data collected from production show that our CPS capability bottleneck has shifted from the vSwitch to the VM kernel stack, with #concurrent flows and #vNICs increased by up to 50.4x and 40x, respectively.
