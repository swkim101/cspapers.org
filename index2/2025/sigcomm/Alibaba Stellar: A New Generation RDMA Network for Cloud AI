The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cloud environments has intensified the demand for high-performance AI training and inference, where Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) plays a critical role. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions, such as Single-Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV), face significant limitations in scalability, performance, and stability. These issues include lengthy container initialization times, hardware resource constraints, and inefficient traffic steering. To address these challenges, we propose Stellar, a new generation RDMA network for cloud AI. Stellar introduces three key innovations: Para-Virtualized Direct Memory Access (PVDMA) for on-demand memory pinning, extended Memory Translation Table (eMTT) for optimized GPU Direct RDMA (GDR) performance, and RDMA Packet Spray for efficient multi-path utilization. Deployed in our large-scale AI clusters, Stellar spins up virtual devices in seconds, reduces container initialization time by 15 times, and improves LLM training speed by up to 14%. Our evaluations demonstrate that Stellar significantly outperforms existing solutions, offering a scalable, stable, and high-performance RDMA network for cloud AI.
