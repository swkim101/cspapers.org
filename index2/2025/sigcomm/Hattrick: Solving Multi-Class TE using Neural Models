While recent work shows ML-based approaches are a promising alternative to conventional optimization methods for Traffic Engineering (TE), existing research is limited to a single traffic class. In this paper, we present Hattrick, the first ML-based approach for handling multiple traffic classes, a key requirement of cloud and ISP WANs. As part of Hattrick we have developed (i) a novel neural architecture aligned with the sequence of optimization problems in multiclass TE; and (ii) a variant of classical multitask learning methods to deal with the unique challenge of optimizing multiple metrics that have a precedence relationship. Evaluations on a large private WAN and other public datasets show Hattrick outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based multiclass TE methods by better coping with prediction error - e.g., for GEANT, Hattrick outperforms SWAN by 5.48% to 19.3% across classes when considering the traffic that can be supported 99% of the time.
