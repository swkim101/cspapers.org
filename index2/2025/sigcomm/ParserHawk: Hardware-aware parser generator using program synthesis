Parser programs are becoming increasingly complex to accommodate intricate network packet formats and advanced protocols. Existing parser compilers incorporate predefined program rewrite rules to output the low-level parser implementation. Yet, these rules are often brittle and sensitive to how the input parser program is written. As a result, generated implementations could consume more hardware resources than necessary. In some cases, these compilers unnecessarily reject valid parser programs that could have fit within the target device parser's resource constraints. We leverage program-synthesis-based techniques to build a parser compiler, ParserHawk, for 2 network devices: the Intel Infrastructure Processing Unit (IPU) and the Barefoot Tofino programmable switch. Naively formulating code generation as a program synthesis problem can take hours, if not days, to complete. As a result, ParserHawk incorporates several optimization algorithms, which achieve a geometric mean speed-up of 309.44×. Within a compile time on the order of minutes for most benchmarks, ParserHawk can correctly compile parser programs rejected by existing compilers and can generate parser implementations that use fewer hardware resources.
