Due to the high operational complexity and limited deployment scale of lossless RDMA networks, the community has been exploring efficient RDMA communication over lossy fabrics. State-of-the-art (SOTA) lossy RDMA solutions implement a simplified selective repeat mechanism in RDMA NICs (RNICs) to enhance loss recovery efficiency. However, these solutions still face performance challenges, such as unavoidable ECMP hash collisions and excessive retransmission timeouts (RTOs). In this paper, we revisit RDMA reliability with the goals of being independent of PFC, compatible with packet-level load balancing, free from RTO, and friendly to hardware offloading. To this end, we propose DCP, a transport architecture that co-designs both the switch and RNICs, fully meeting the design goals. At its core, DCP-Switch introduces a simple yet effective lossless control plane, which is leveraged by DCP-RNIC to enhance reliability support for high-speed lossy fabrics, primarily including header-only-based retransmission and bitmap-free packet tracking. We prototype DCP-Switch using P4 switch and DCP-RNIC using FPGA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCP achieves 1.6× and 2.1× performance improvements, compared to SOTA lossless and lossy RDMA solutions, respectively.
