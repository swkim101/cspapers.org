Serverless computing offers resource efficiency but suffers from a heavyweight data plane. We present Palladium, a DPU-offloaded serverless data plane enabling distributed zero-copy communication. Palladium uses two-sided RDMA and cross-processor shared memory to mitigate limitations of wimpy DPU cores. Its DPU-enabled network engine (DNE) isolates RDMA resources and manages flows across tenants. By converting HTTP/TCP to RDMA at ingress, Palladium reduces protocol overhead on the critical path.
