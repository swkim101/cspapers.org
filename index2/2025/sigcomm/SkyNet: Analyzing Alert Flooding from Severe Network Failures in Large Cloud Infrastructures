For providers operating large-scale global networks, the timeliness of network failure recovery significantly affects the reliability of network services. Ideally, a network monitoring system should have enough coverage to detect even minor issues, but high coverage means alert floods during severe network failures. In practice, there is a gap between the flooding raw alerts data collected by network monitoring tools and the readable information needed for failure diagnosis. Existing solutions using limited network monitoring data sources and heuristic diagnostic rules, lack comprehensive coverage and the capability to address severe failures, especially which network operators have never handled a similar one before. This paper presents SkyNet, a network analysis system to extract scope and severity information from alert floods. SkyNet ensures comprehensive coverage by integrating multiple monitoring data sources through a uniform input format, enhancing extensibility for new network monitoring tools. During alert floods, SkyNet groups alerts, assesses their severity, and filters out insignificant ones to aid network operators in mitigating network failures. To date, SkyNet has been running stably on our network for one and a half years without any false negatives and has successfully reduced the time-to-mitigation for over 80% of network failures since its deployment in production.
