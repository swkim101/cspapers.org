As microservices grow in scale and complexity, their operation and debugging become increasingly challenging. Even a single user request can involve interactions across hundreds of components. In such intricate systems, distributed tracing, which tracks the end-to-end execution flow of requests, has become a critical monitoring tool. Among these, non-intrusive tracing frameworks that do not require code modification are particularly valued for their convenience. However, existing non-intrusive solutions either have limited applicability or lack sufficient accuracy under high concurrency. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTrace, a transaction-based, non-intrusive distributed tracing framework designed for microservices. DeepTrace leverages API endpoints and transaction fields embedded within request content to categorize requests into distinct transactions, thereby reducing the likelihood of incorrectly merging traces from different transactions. Compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, DeepTrace maintains an accuracy rate of over 95% even under high concurrency. It has also been adopted by dozens of companies in their production systems for tasks such as failure diagnosis and resource optimization.
