The recent renaissance of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks expands the boundaries of global Internet access, but also introduces substantial new challenges for existing end-to-end congestion control algorithms (CCAs). The rapid and continuous movement of LEO satellites leads to infrastructure-level dynamics, resulting in frequent, LEO-dynamics-induced changes in link capacity, delay, and packet loss rate, which can further mislead the rate control in existing CCAs and cause self-limited performance. This paper presents LeoCC, a novel CCA that addresses the above challenges and is robust to LEO satellite dynamics. The core idea behind LeoCC lies in a critical characteristic of emerging LEO networks called "connection reconfiguration", which implicitly reflects satellite path changes and is strongly correlated to network variations. Specifically, LeoCC employs a suite of new techniques to: (i) efficiently detect reconfiguration on the endpoint; (ii) apply a reconfiguration-aware model to characterize and estimate network conditions accurately; and (iii) precisely regulate the sending rate. We implement LeoCC in Linux kernel and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments conducted in both real LEO networks and a controlled lab environment. The results show that LeoCC can achieve the best throughput-delay balance under various LEO network conditions as compared to other existing CCAs: it achieves 85~494% higher throughput than Cubic, Copa, BBRv3, and accomplishes 44~56% lower delay than BBRv1 and VIVACE.
