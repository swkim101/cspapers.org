A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that enables both RDMA and TCP provides advantages for both tenants and cloud providers. It serves the flexible demands of RDMA and TCP of tenant applications while delivering a cost-effective solution compared to the construction of two distinct overlay networks. In this study, we introduce Jakiro, an innovative framework of vNIC design that supports both RDMA and TCP within ByteDance Cloud. Jakiro holds the capability to support fundamental VPC features such as QoS, security groups, etc., for both RDMA and TCP streams while maintaining compatibility with applications and intra-host RDMA optimization techniques. We benchmark Jakiro's performance using basic test cases and real-world high-performance computing applications and distributed machine learning training. The results indicate that the RDMA performance of Jakiro is close to that of the physical RDMA. Concurrently, Jakiro guarantees a weighted fair QoS between RDMA and TCP. Jakiro has been deployed in ByteDance Cloud for one year, we share our critical design and deployment decisions, as well as experiences and lessons from production.
