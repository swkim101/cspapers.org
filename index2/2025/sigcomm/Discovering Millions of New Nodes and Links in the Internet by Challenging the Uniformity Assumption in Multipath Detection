Multipath Detection Algorithms (MDAs) are proposed to discover Internet topology in the presence of load balancing (LB). Existing methods assume uniformity in the load-balancing responses (LBR), i.e., responses from the successors of a LB router. However, we reveal that only 20% of the cases exhibit uniformity in the Internet. This finding significantly challenges the completeness of the Internet topology discovered using current MDAs. In this paper, we propose a novel system BayMuDA, that can estimate LBR distributions and calculate the minimum number of probes needed to statistically discover all nodes and links within a given hop. The validation on controlled topologies shows that BayMuDA discovers at least 85%/73% of nodes/links in ~90% of the cases. Our Internet-wide measurement results indicate that BayMuDA can discover millions of Internet nodes and links obscured by the state-of-the-art MDA algorithm, D-Miner, due to uneven responses.
