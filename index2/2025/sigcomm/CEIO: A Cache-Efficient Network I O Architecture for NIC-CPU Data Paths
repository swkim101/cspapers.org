Efficient Input/Output (I/O) data path between NICs and CPUs/DRAMs is critical for supporting datacenter applications with high-performance network transmission, especially as link speed scales to 100Gbps and beyond. Traditional I/O acceleration strategies, such as Data Direct I/O (DDIO) and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), perform suboptimally due to the inefficient utilization of the Last-Level Cache (LLC). This paper presents CEIO, a novel cache-efficient network I/O architecture that employs proactive rate control and elastic buffering to achieve zero LLC misses in the I/O data path while ensuring the effectiveness of DDIO and RDMA under various network conditions. We have implemented CEIO on commodity SmartNICs and incorporated it into widely-used DPDK and RDMA libraries. Experiments with well-optimized RPC framework and distributed file system under realistic workloads demonstrate that CEIO achieves up to 2.9× higher throughput and 1.9× lower P99.9 latency over prior work.
