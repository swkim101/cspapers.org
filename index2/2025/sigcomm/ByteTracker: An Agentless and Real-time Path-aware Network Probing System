As the number of data center servers grows into the millions and due to the demand for more accurate, rapid and powerful network fault detection and location, the existing Pingmesh-centric monitoring and diagnostic system is not efficient enough. In this paper, we propose ByteTracker, the first agentless probing and diagnostic system for large-scale data center networks. It does not need to deploy probe processes or make any configurations on end hosts, and all probes are launched by a small number of centralized Probers. ByteTracker achieves accurate, real-time probe path tracking with packet mirroring on switches. By reducing end-host probe noise, precisely identifying network timeout probes, accurately tracking probe paths, and marking the failed switch with multiple network timeout probes, ByteTracker can locate network failures with nearly 100% accuracy. We have deployed ByteTracker in all of our data centers for over half a year. During deployment, ByteTracker can detect almost all network anomalies and locate them within 5 seconds with 100% accuracy.
