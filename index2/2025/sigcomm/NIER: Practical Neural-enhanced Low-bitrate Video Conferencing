We present NIER, a video conferencing system that can adaptively maintain a low bitrate (e.g., 10–100 Kbps) with reasonable visual quality while being robust to packet losses. We use key-point-based deep image animation (DIA) as a key building block and address a series of networking and system challenges to make NIER practical. Our evaluations show that NIER significantly outperforms the baseline solutions.
