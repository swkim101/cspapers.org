Live streaming that supports real-time interaction has become increasingly popular. To support the ensuing requirements on low end-to-end latency, RTM, the state-of-the-art live streaming system at Douyin, replaces the HTTP-FLV streaming protocol with WebRTC. To tailor the WebRTC stack to the live streaming scenario, we focus on optimizing first-frame delay, startup video rebuffering, audio-to-video drift, and per-session CPU usage. Those are the top-priority metrics identified from an importance analysis with respect to two user engagement metrics, i.e., viewer penetration and viewing time. To date, WebRTC-based streaming in RTM has been in operation for 4 years, and serves billions of viewer sessions every day. It dramatically optimizes QoE metrics (e.g., end-to-end latency reduced by 54.5%), and delivers statistically significant user engagement gains (e.g., number of paid orders increased by 0.8%). In this paper, we report our deployment experiences comprehensively.
