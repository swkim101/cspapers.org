Computational reductions are an important and powerful concept in computer science. However, they are difficult for many students to grasp. In this paper, we outline a concept for how the learning of reductions can be supported by educational support systems. We present an implementation of the concept within such a system, concrete web-based and interactive learning material for reductions, and report on our experiences using the material in a large introductory course on theoretical computer science.
