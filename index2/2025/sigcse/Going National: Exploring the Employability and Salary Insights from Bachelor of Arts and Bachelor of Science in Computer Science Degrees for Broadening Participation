This study describes our current effort to expand our previous research to a national scale, exploring the implications of students' employability and salary between Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Sciences (BS) in Computer Science (CS) degrees. The literature on broadening participation has identified numerous barriers, but these challenges frequently burden students instead of addressing the underlying systemic issues within the curriculum. Previous research has identified bottleneck courses like calculus and physics as barriers to persistence in CS. Reimagining the curriculum and introducing alternative pathways, such as BA in CS, can eliminate bottlenecks and enhance access and retention without compromising essential skills in computing. To understand the implications of the BA pathway on employability and salary, we conducted a study at a large minority-serving institution (MSI) with a CS department serving around 2,000 students. Our research revealed that the BA degree offers comparable employment opportunities to the BS. Students choose BA due to broader career aspirations, a faster route to graduation, and view math courses as a significant barrier. Despite earning potential being important, we discovered salary differences between the two degrees, emphasizing the need for clear communication to help diverse students make informed decisions about their degree paths in CS. Given the findings from a single MSI, we recognize the importance of expanding this project nationally. This lightning talk will discuss background context, lessons learned, and potential collaborations for broader implementation.
