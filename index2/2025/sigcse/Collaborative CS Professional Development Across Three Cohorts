This poster presents the design and outcomes of Computer Science for San Antonio, (CS4SA), a three-cohort teacher professional development (PD) program conducted from 2020 to 2024, developed and led by a university team. CS4SA aimed to equip middle and high school educators in a predominantly Latinx South Texas school district with computer science (CS) knowledge to expand access. The partnership with the local district, a STEM organization, and integrating culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices supported teachers in embedding CS into their classrooms. Participants reported increased confidence in teaching CS. Insights from feedback will inform future improvements.
