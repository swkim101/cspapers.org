This paper presents an educational tool designed to enhance cryptography education for K-12 students, utilizing Kolb's Experiential Learning (EL) model and engaging visual components. Our tool incorporates the four stages of EL -- Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation -- to teach key cryptographic concepts, including hashing, symmetric cryptography, and asymmetric cryptography. The learning experience is enriched with real-world simulations, customized AI-based conversation agents, video demonstrations, interactive scenarios, and a simplified Python coding terminal focused on cryptography. Targeted at beginners in cybersecurity, the tool encourages independent learning with minimal instructor involvement. An evaluation with 51 middle and high school students showed positive feedback from 93% of participants, who found the simulations, visualizations, AI reflections, scenarios, and coding capabilities engaging and conducive to learning. Comprehension surveys indicated a high understanding of cryptography concepts: hashing (middle school: 89%, high school: 92%), symmetric cryptography (middle school: 93%, high school: 97%), and asymmetric cryptography (middle school: 91%, high school: 94%).
