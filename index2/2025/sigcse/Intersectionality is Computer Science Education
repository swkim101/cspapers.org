When the Double Bind Report (Malcom, Hall & Brown, 1975) was released fifty years ago, it was groundbreaking in that it illuminated, for the first time, the unique experiences of women of color in STEM careers, as students and professionals. It helped to expose the factors that describe why their experiences were different - factors that, until then, had largely gone unacknowledged. When it comes to computer science education, intersectionality, much like accessibility, presents the same opportunity - it informs our ability to develop CS curricula that meets all students' needs by bringing awareness to the obstacles that affect some of our students. The result is transformative. In this talk, I will walk us through the brief, yet rich history of intersectionality in computing and show how its alignment to CS education drives outsized impact for the computing discipline.
