As discussions of computing's impact on society increase in public discourse, so does recognition for computing students to address the ethical and sociotechnical implications of their work. While efforts to integrate issues of ethics and social justice into computing curricula are nascent, we lack a standardized measure to monitor our progress towards these goals. In this poster, we report on the development and validation of the Critical Reflection and Agency in Computing Index, a novel instrument designed to assess undergraduate computing students' attitudes towards practicing critically conscious computing. The resulting index is a theoretically grounded, expert-reviewed tool with evidence for reliability and validity to support research and practice in computing ethics education. This enables researchers and educators to gain insights into students' perspectives, inform the design of targeted ethics interventions, and monitor the effectiveness of computing ethics education initiatives.
