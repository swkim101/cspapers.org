Given the underrepresentation of Black individuals in computer science education and research, this Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session at SIGCSE aims to foster a supportive and inclusive community for members of the Black computer science education community. By bringing together members of the community, students, faculty, and allies, we seek to create a space to celebrate achievements as well as discuss issues faced by Black individuals in the field that impact diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our goals include: 1) Creating a supportive community: Foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among Black CS educators through witnessing a larger representation of Black computer scientists; 2) Address systemic challenges: Discuss and explore strategies to address systemic barriers and biases in computer science education; 3) Share best practices: Exchange ideas and experiences related to teaching, research, and mentorship; 4) Inspire the next generation: Acknowledge present Black CS Ed trailblazers and encourage students to pursue graduate education and careers in computer science academia. 5) Gain inspiration: Learn from the personal journeys and experiences of senior students and faculty, gaining valuable insights for perseverance in computer science; 6) Promote joining supportive Black CS communities: e.g. IAAMCS, AAPHDCSR.
