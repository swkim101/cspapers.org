Students from historically underrepresented communities in computer science (CS) report being told that their successes are due to special treatment based on their gender and/or racial identity. We refer to this microaggression as the discounting-success microaggression.We analyzed survey responses from 4,327 CS majors across 221 institutions in the U.S. We found that students who identify as women, Black, and/or Asian were more likely than men and white students, respectively, to report the discounting-success microaggression. This discounting-success microaggression significantly and negatively predicts students' self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and plans to persist in CS. Our results elucidate the negative influence of the discounting-success microaggression on CS student outcomes. Efforts are needed to improve the culture and interactions in CS to eliminate the prevalence of this harmful microaggression.
