Edugator is a browser-based, AI-enabled tool designed to help instructors of introductory computing courses create and deliver interactive educational content. It streamlines the content authoring process by incorporating generative AI models into both the creation and delivery stages. Instructors can create bespoke interactive computing lessons and programming problems by providing a prompt and a few clicks. They can also author templates and test cases in programming languages such as C++, Java, C, and Python. Additionally, instructors can validate programming problems by running them against an auto-generated solution, allowing them to refine the problems before releasing it to students, preventing misinformation or ambiguity. Students can complete lessons and solve programming problems in a browser-based text editor receiving immediate feedback. They can also interact with a large language model-powered AI chatbot that scaffolds a student on how to approach the problem without giving out solutions. Edugator is built using modern web frameworks and the goal of the tool is to accelerate the adoption of automated assessment tools by minimizing the challenges instructors face with such tools. It also supports Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), allowing seamless integration with learning management systems (LMS). The demo will provide an overview of Edugator's features, including authoring programming problems and lessons using AI or remixing existing problems obtained from test banks, LTI integration, and AI-chatbot.
