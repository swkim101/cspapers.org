ChatGPT potential value in education is broadly recognized and many studies report experiments of its use inside or outside the classroom by students and teachers. On the other hand, the use of ChatGPT rises lots of concerns about well-known problems such as hallucination, plagiarism, overreliance, or misinformation. It is of primary importance to teach students a correct and constructive use of ChatGPT and a critical approach to its returned outputs. The paper presents a classroom experience where students were asked to interact with ChatGPT in the context of a database course. The declared challenge for the students was, given a set of predefined relational database schemata, to invent questions for ChatGPT and try to force wrong SQL solutions. Students had to record the question, the ChatGPT solution, their solution, and the comments about the eventual ChatGPT syntactical and/or semantical errors. This gamification approach was meant to enhance students' motivation, but the main teachers' goal was to make them reflect critically (i) on ChatGPT output, experiencing that it does make mistakes, (ii) on the interpretation of ChatGPT errors, and (iii) on the possible strategies for forcing ChatGPT errors. The experiment involved 166 B.S. students in Engineering and the collected data have been analyzed under different points of view to get an insight into the approach and the critical attitude of the students. The paper reports the results of this analysis and discusses the impact of the activity on learning by analyzing the correlation between students' participation and exam performance.
