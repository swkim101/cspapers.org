In this paper, we focus on the certificate redesign of our machine learning program within the context of a three-program bundle; we used an outcome-based approach with the student's targeted career outcome in mind. The purpose of this curriculum redesign is threefold: (1) To align the course content with the industry's rapidly changing needs and demands of the job market; (2) To identify the proper sequence of laddering structure for students taking multiple programs; and (3) To create a natural and streamline flow of the learning experience (i.e., removing overlapping content). We show that the resulting redesign is a holistic set of certificate programs with industry-relevant content tailored for skills-based experiential learning.
