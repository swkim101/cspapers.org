''A generation which ignores history has no past - and no future.'' -Robert A. Heinlein, Time Enough for Love, 1973. This tutorial will provide inspiration for integrating relevant historical lessons into existing computing courses. Each lesson is based on historical examples that support common learning outcomes. By exploring historical examples relevant to critical computing subjects, participants will engage in hands-on activities that inspire creative adaptations tailored to their own teaching needs. Our examples will include essential courses such as Data Networking, Databases, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence. By the end of this tutorial, participants will be equipped with several ready-to-implement lessons that not only align with course objectives but also foster a deeper appreciation for the vast landscape of computing history. The ultimate goal is to help students connect historical milestones with contemporary computing issues, highlighting the significance of our shared legacy in the digital age.
