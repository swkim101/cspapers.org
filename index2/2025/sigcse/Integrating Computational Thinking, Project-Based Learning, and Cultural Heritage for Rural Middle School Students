Based on work in an ongoing research-practice partnership, we share teacher-designed project-based learning (PBL) units that sought to integrate Appalachian heritage and CT. We offer reflections on the lessons learned in the design and implementation of PBL units in addition to making recommendations for future PBL units that integrate CT and cultural heritage. This work has implications for improving computing education in rural contexts and in PBL settings.
