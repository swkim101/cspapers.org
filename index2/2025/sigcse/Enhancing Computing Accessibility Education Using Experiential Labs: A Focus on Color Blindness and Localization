Accessibility is a crucial component in developing inclusive software. However, studies reveal that much of today's software is not designed with accessibility in mind. This issue is compounded by the fact that students often lack an understanding of both how to create accessible software and why it is important. To address this educational gap, we developed a set of labs known as Accessible Learning Labs (ALL). These experiential labs aim to teach participants the proper methods for creating accessible software while highlighting the significance of inclusivity. Additionally, these labs allow students to experience the effects of inaccessible software firsthand and apply corrective measures to improve accessibility. All project materials are freely accessible on the project website: https://all.rit.edu. This demo will involve a step-by-step walkthrough of two of our labs, Lab 2: Accessibility to Color Blindness, and Lab 9: Accessibility to Localization. Both of these labs employ an active learning model and comprise of five subsections: an about section, a reading section, an exercise section, a reinforcement section, and a quiz section. During the demo, we will showcase each of the five sections for both Lab 2 and Lab 9, which will allow users to learn about the background of the accessibility issue, experience the issue firsthand, and reinforce and test their knowledge of the accessibility topic. Attendees will learn how to use these labs to design customized learning experiences that align with the specific objectives of various courses and programs.
