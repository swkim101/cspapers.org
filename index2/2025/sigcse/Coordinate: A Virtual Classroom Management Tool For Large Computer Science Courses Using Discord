Effective classroom management is becoming increasingly challenging with the growing size of core computer science classrooms. However, classroom management remains a critical component of instruction in higher education. Successful classroom management ensures a structured, respectful environment that maximizes student engagement and learning outcomes. To address this, we present Coordinate, a novel educational tool based on Discord, a widely used free voice, video, and text chat application. Coordinate leverages Discord's interface, extensibility, and familiarity with young people. With the innovative blending between communication and logistics, this tool addresses the need to reduce instructors' time on classroom management tasks. Coordinate automatically manages several integral classroom offerings, including office hour queues, student assignment extension requests, teaching team performance, student feedback, and Q&As. Alongside these features, we present details about the tool architecture, implementation, and deployment. Our tool has been deployed throughout a growing number of classes at a large state university to thousands of students. We present the perception of four distinct computer science instructors and their students. Overall, students are satisfied with the tool and find it valuable and easy to use. At the same time, instructors believe it can be a critical component of their classrooms, significantly reducing their time spent on class management and allowing them to focus on other necessary tasks. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities of using the Discord platform in an educational context. Our findings suggest that Coordinate can be a valuable tool for classroom management in higher education.
