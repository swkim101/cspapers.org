This exploratory study aims to identify the needs of computing students within a consortium of community colleges and 4-year, primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to inform faculty training programs and student support services. The Ohio Pathways to Undergraduate Computing Success (OPUCS) project survey addressed key factors influencing academic experiences and outcomes, particularly for historically underrepresented groups. This survey was piloted in Spring 2024 at four partner institutions, two PUIs and two community colleges. Participants were recruited through institutional outreach, resulting in a final sample of 156 students: 26% women, 29% underrepresented racialized minorities (URMs), and 71% first- or second-year students. Significant differences along gender lines were found in belongingness and self-efficacy, with women reporting lower levels in both. The findings highlight disparities in belongingness, self-efficacy, and persistence among women and URMs in computing, emphasizing the need for tailored support strategies. The OPUCS project aims to create and collaborate with ACM-W chapters to provide mentorship and resources across the consortium. Future research will evaluate the impact of ACM-W involvement on students' attitudes, persistence, and satisfaction.
