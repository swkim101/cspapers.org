It is essential for CS students to graduate with competence about ethics and societal impacts of technology. We designed and taught a new reading discussion course, at Grinnell College, Algorithms, Ethics, and Society, for advanced undergraduate students who have completed CS1 and CS2. Course topics included Identity in Computing, Tech Ethics, Algorithms Informing Policies, Large Language Models, Networks and Social Media, Health Applications, and Robotics. We encountered some challenges with the discussion format, which we addressed by upholding class norms, employing discussion techniques learned from humanities and social science colleagues, and being open to learn from our mistakes.
