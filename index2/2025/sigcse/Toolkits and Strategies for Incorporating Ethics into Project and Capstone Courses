As ethical concerns continue to arise around the design of digital technologies, there is an increasing need to incorporate ethics education into project and capstone courses. While students frequently receive instruction in ethical theory and philosophy, they also need practical tools and strategies that they can apply to their class projects and carry with them into their careers. For example, ethical toolkits can provide frameworks and methods for identifying, discussing, and prioritizing ethical concerns in technology design and development. In this session we will invite participants to share their experiences with incorporating ethics into project-based learning. Participants will be able to review and discuss existing toolkits and methods for incorporating ethics into project courses. Some material for this BoF is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant nos. 2419005 & 2046245.
