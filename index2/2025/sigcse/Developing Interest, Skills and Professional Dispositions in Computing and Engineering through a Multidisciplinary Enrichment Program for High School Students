This paper is an experience report on a program involving robotics and engineering that has been run for several years with high-school students at a university in Ghana. Since 2014, we have hosted, on our university campus, an annual two-week enrichment program that employs design thinking, leadership training, entrepreneurship, robotics, engineering and the creative arts, to inspire high school students to become innovative problem-solvers. The hands-on robotics and engineering modules are key parts of the program, used to enhance students' interest in computer science and engineering, and their awareness of related careers. The goal is to expand the pool of promising young people from the developing world who can join the ranks of creators of technological solutions. The highlight of the experience is when participants work in teams to create solutions to a challenge related to a real-world and contextually relevant scenario. The achievements of these students during the short period of the enrichment program, and anecdotal reports on the long-term impact of this program, show great promise of what can be achieved with the right conditions.
