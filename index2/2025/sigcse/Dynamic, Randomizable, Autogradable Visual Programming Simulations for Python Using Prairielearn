We debut a visual program simulation tool for Python in PrairieLearn, a web-based assessment system. Our tool allows students to create program visualizations based on Python code through direct interaction with elements on a virtual canvas. Students can submit their visualizations, which are then automatically evaluated for correctness. For instructors, the integration of our tool with PrairieLearn allows problems to be randomly generated based on template problems they write. Instructors can use these randomizations to generate unique questions for each student.
