Technology is evolving rapidly worldwide, making computational knowledge integral across virtually every field. Consequently, broadening access and promoting equity in computer science (CS) education at the high school level is crucial. Certified CS teachers are critical in creating opportunities to provide equitable CS access to high school students. In recent years, Code.org reports have highlighted a significant increase in student access to CS content across the U.S., particularly in high schools. Therefore, this paper provides a high-level overview of Wisconsin (WI) public high school CS education, examining CS teacher certification and course enrollment data from 2017 through 2023 academic years. Increasing the supply of certified CS teachers is essential for WI public high schools to sustain the current growth rate of student enrollment in CS courses or maintain the status quo. While the ongoing teacher shortage in the U.S. is well-documented, our analysis reveals that the gaps in CS education are particularly severe in WI and are poised to worsen. We discuss various pathways available for CS certification, identify four archetypes of CS teacher/CS enrollment access, and explore opportunities from a geographical standpoint. Our analysis offers data-driven insights for stakeholders and policymakers in WI, guiding policy changes and recommendations to improve CS teacher supply. Furthermore, our methodology, using data from the State Department of Education, is replicable in other states, facilitating a broader understanding to identify critical patterns in CS teacher supply nationwide.
