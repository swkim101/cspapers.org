Despite their shared goal of improving learner outcomes [6], a persistent gap often exists between practitioners and education researchers. Team building within a Research Practice Partnership (RPP) requires leadership and team members that are not only committed to working together but also have the proper tools to do so. Thus, our research question is, What would an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) reveal about the formation of an RPP against Dimension 1 of the Five Dimensions of Effectiveness Framework? We conducted a series of interviews with RPP members every six months of the course of three years, conducting six sets of interviews in total with participating members of the RPP ranging from n=7 to n=12 participants.
