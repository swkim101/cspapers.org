This experience report examines a new course, "Debugging: From Art to Science,'' and its impact on students' debugging approach, skills, confidence, and overall attitudes towards debugging. The course is designed to transform perceptions and approaches to debugging from a daunting task into a systematic and methodical approach, implementing the scientific method. The course introduced students to debugging techniques, tools, and best practices, and utilized exercises from several different programming languages, allowing students to apply debugging techniques to a wide range of defects. This multi-language approach ensured that students could generalize their debugging skills. Quantitative data collected from two smaller assignments with similar bugs, before and after the course, showed a notable improvement in students' debugging performance, with average error resolution times decreasing by an average of 60%. At the end of the course, 80% of the project teams working on a bug report in a non-trivial, open-source project found and fixed the code defect using the methods from the course. Qualitative data from surveys and interviews revealed that students felt more confident and positive about their debugging abilities, with 89% of participants expressing a heightened sense of competence and reduced anxiety when facing debugging tasks. This report highlights the course structure, key materials covered, and the pedagogical approaches that contributed to these outcomes. The findings suggest that a well-structured debugging course can enhance students' practical skills and alter their mindset, fostering a more confident, positive, and proactive approach to debugging in their future careers.
