In this discussion, we seek to create a space for computing educators interested in teaching in prisons. Recent policy changes are leading to a growing number of higher education institutions providing programs in prison to combat the national crisis of mass incarceration, which disproportionately impacts already marginalized groups. Within the computing education community, we see an opportunity for several mutual benefits through our increased involvement in these programs including: a) providing computing courses in prisons, where STEM education opportunities are severely lacking, b) increasing diverse perspectives by bringing justice-impacted people into computing, and c) gaining experience and improving known methods in effective CS education in settings with low-technology infrastructure, for adult and non-traditional students, and for students from diverse backgrounds. All discussion leaders have experience in and/or plans to teach CS in a college-in-prison program. No experience is required, and we welcome all members of the community interested in learning more about these opportunities.
