There have been extraordinary advances in our ability to collect, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data which have transformed the fundamental nature of artificial intelligence (AI). The human aspects of AI, including how to support creativity and human insight without violating individual rights, how to address ethical concerns, and the consideration of societal impacts, have received less attention. Yet these human issues are becoming increasingly vital to the future of AI. Dr. Aragon will reflect on a 30-year career in data science and AI in industry, government, and academia, discuss what it means for AI to be both rigorous and human-centered, and speculate upon future directions for data science and AI.
