As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and society, there is an increasing demand for early AI education to ensure future generations are equipped with the skills and critical thinking required to navigate an AI-driven world. Day of AI Australia is part of an international initiative designed to equip educators and students in upper primary and early secondary school (ages 10 to 16) with foundational AI literacy. The Australian program provides a series of lessons that introduces students to core AI concepts such as machine learning, natural language processing, and AI ethics. Insights from post-lesson feedback data from over 60 participating school teachers highlights the efficacy of the curriculum, the challenges faced, and the potential for scaling AI education in Australian classrooms. We provide practical recommendations for integrating AI literacy into national and global curricula, with the goal of preparing students for the AI-driven future.
