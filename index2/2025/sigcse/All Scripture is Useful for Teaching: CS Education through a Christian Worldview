This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session offers a space for Christians at SIGCSE TS to freely explore the interactions between a Biblical worldview and their teaching, research, and even general view of technology. Our session is designed with a dual-purpose: (1) create opportunities for Christian attendees at SIGCSE TS to connect and build a supportive community, and (2) spark thoughtful discussions on how a Christian perspective can shape ethical considerations, teaching practices, and the broader challenges in CS education. Participants will have the chance to engage with peers who share similar values, exchange ideas on integrating faith into their work, and reflect on the influence of a Christian worldview in navigating the complexities of technology and education. We will also facilitate ways for attendees to continue the conversation post-conference through a dedicated mailing list, helping to foster ongoing connections, collaboration, and encouragement.
