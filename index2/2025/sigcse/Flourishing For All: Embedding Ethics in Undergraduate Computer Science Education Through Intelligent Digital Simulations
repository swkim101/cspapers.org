The need for and challenges of including ethics in Computer Science (CS) education are well documented. At our university we will embed ethics in CS courses through a web-based simulation tool (Rehearsals) where students can practice scenarios based on the ACM Code of Ethics with the support of personalized AI coaching. We hypothesize that this focus on ethics will attract more historically marginalized groups of students to CS, recognizing how embodying ethical behavior such that it is part and parcel of how they show up in the world as computer scientists will contribute to flourishing for all [1]. Rehearsals, currently under development, uses text, audio, and video to present scenarios to students and allows students to respond via text and audio. In this lightning talk we will present the design and implementation of Rehearsals and gather feedback from the SIGCSE community via online survey. We will also provide instructions (with handouts where needed) for community members to contribute to scenario creation and tool evaluation, building a community of practice for all CS educators who want to use Rehearsals to embed ethics learning in their courses.
