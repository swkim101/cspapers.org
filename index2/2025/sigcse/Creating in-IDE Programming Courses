The in-IDE learning format represents a novel way of teaching programming to students entirely within an industry-grade IDE, allowing them to learn both the language and the necessary tooling at the same time. In this tutorial, we will teach the audience everything they need to know to create in-IDE courses and analyze how the students are working in them. In the first part of the tutorial, the audience will get to know the JetBrains Academy plugin that allows creating courses for IntelliJ-based IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm. The participants will develop their own simple courses with theory, programming tasks, and quizzes, as well as employ some LLM-based features like automatic test generation. In the second part, we will learn how to use another plugin to collect code snapshots and the usage of IDE features of students when they are solving the tasks. Finally, the participants will solve tasks in their own course while using the data gathering plugin, and we will show them how to process and analyze the collected data. As the outcome of the tutorial, the audience will know how to create in-IDE courses, track the students' performance and analyze it, and will already have their own simple course and a dataset that can be expanded or used for further research.
