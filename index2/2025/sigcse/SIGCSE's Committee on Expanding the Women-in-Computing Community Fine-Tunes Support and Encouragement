ACM Books recently published Rendering History: The Women of ACM-W. ACM-W is ACM's Women in Computing organization: supporting, celebrating, and advocating for women in computing. Rendering History contains a brief history of ACM-W and an annotated bibliography of important resources concerning women in computing. These two sections sandwich a longer section containing the first-hand stories of 38 women who served ACM-W in its first 30 years. The stories further divide into sections including The Presidents, The Directors, The Chairs, and The Professors and Researchers. This BOF continues the theme of Rendering History. The BOF will divide into subgroups for more intimate conversations about the rewards and challenges of the careers that define our lives and absorb our time. Anticipated groups: Professors, Chairs and Program Directors, and Students. Former Chairs of ACM-W, Valerie Barr and Jodi Tims, will lead a subgroup discussing ACM-W projects that can recruit and retain our students and encourage women in industry. Executive Director and CEO of the Computing Research Association, Tracy Camp, will guide a similar subgroup examining CRA-WP projects (Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research). The remaining subgroups will examine the issues that attendees bring to the discussion group. MaryAnne Egan and Wendy Powley will oversee a student subgroup; Elizabeth Hawthorne and Rachelle Hippler, a professor subgroup; and Gloria Townsend and Ellen Walker, a chair/director subgroup.
