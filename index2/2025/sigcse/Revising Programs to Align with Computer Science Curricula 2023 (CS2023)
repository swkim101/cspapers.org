Computer Science Curricula 2023 (CS2023) was released in early 2024 by the Joint Task Force of the ACM, IEEE-Computer Society, and AAAI. Viewed from an educational perspective, CS2023 reflects the decennial changes in computer science (CS) since the release of the previous curricular guidelines, Computer Science Curricula 2013. CS2023 comprises curricular content and curricular practices: the former includes updates to the computer science knowledge areas and a competency model framework while curricular practices cover other aspects such as program design and delivery issues. As CS2023 has proposed several changes to curricular content and emphases, this special session examines efforts that have already started to align computer science to reflect the CS2023 curricular guidelines. The presenters will discuss how their programs were reexamined in detail and changes are being proposed to align with CS2023 better. The session targets educators, administrators, and professionals interested in understanding computer science curricular issues and aligning their programs for the future.
