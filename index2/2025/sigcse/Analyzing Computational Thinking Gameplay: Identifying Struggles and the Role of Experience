Computational thinking (CT) skills are essential for navigating daily life, but how best to teach these skills is still being explored. Educational programming games can provide engaging environments to develop CT, yet uncovering student struggles during gameplay remains challenging. This study analyzed 15 undergraduates with varying programming experience playing the CT game, Fox and Field, utilizing gameplay videos, heart rate data, and surveys. Results revealed common struggle points in understanding the character's perspective, degree angles, and debugging, with notable differences between novice and experienced players. Findings suggest support targeting abstraction, pattern recognition, and debugging skills to improve future game design and scaffolding.
