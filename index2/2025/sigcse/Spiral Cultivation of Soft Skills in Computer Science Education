Contemporary educational systems worldwide have embraced the understanding that imparting knowledge alone is insufficient, and that both school and university graduates must be equipped with skills and competencies for success in academia, employment, and society. These skills, known as soft skills, are increasingly acknowledged as essential at all life stages, and are categorized (sometimes overlapping) as cognitive, interpersonal, or personal. While HR professionals and hiring managers recognize problem solving, time management, and adaptability as critical soft skills for today's CS graduates, the task of training and mentoring learners in these skills is challenging and is, therefore, largely not done. Unlike technical skills or knowledge per-se, soft skills focus on habits, strengths, and perspectives that influence performance, hence, their subjective nature makes them challenging to teach, learn and assess. In this lightening talk, I describe a unique national project conducted in Israel that cultivates (1) self-directed learning and lifelong learning, (2) teamwork, collaboration, and partnership, and (3) complex problem solving and critical thinking, among high school and academic students. I introduce a spiral model for cultivating these skills while training CS high school teachers and university lecturers, which includes practical experience, theory, reflection, discussion, feedback, evaluation, and assessment. Examples of how these activities apply to CS education are presented, as well as difficulties that arose in the perception of teachers and lecturers and in the application phase. The model's main message is that it is not enough ''to do it'', one must ''teach it'', in the broadest sense of the word.
