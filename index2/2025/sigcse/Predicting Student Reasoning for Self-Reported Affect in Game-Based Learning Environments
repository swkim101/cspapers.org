Student affect is widely recognized as a major influence on learning gains and engagement, which has led to the development of many automated affect detectors. However, in order to respond effectively to student affect, we must know how students interpret it. This study proposes a novel automated detector that models when students attribute their epistemic emotion to task difficulty. The goal is to use detectors like this one to better understand how to respond to students' affective states (in this case, boredom, confusion, frustration and nervousness). We then discuss the implications of this novel detector for real-time support in game-based learning environments.
