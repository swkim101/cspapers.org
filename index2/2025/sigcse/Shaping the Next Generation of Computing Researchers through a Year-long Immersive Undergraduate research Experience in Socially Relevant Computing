Preparing future computing researchers requires more than traditional classroom education; it calls for immersive, hands-on experiences that build research identity and critical skills. This work presents a year-long undergraduate research engagement program in socially relevant computing designed to address this need. This work underscores the importance of immersive, socially relevant research experiences in cultivating the next generation of computing researchers and supporting their professional advancement. The program combines immersive research experiences with research seminars and graduate application preparation, providing students with a comprehensive pathway from undergraduate study to advanced research careers. Participants work on projects addressing real-world challenges-such as healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability-fostering a deep connection between technical expertise and societal impact. Through mentorship, collaboration, research seminars, and structured guidance on graduate school applications, students gain not only research skills but also the tools to navigate the transition to graduate studies. Hence, in this lightning talk, we will present the design and facilitation of the program, including mentorship structures, research seminar contents, and dedicated support for graduate school applications. By integrating research methodology, ethical considerations, and communication skills, the program empowers students to tackle complex issues while building their confidence and research identities. Findings reveal significant growth in participants' research capabilities, graduate school readiness, and sense of belonging within the computing community, particularly among underrepresented groups. We will also share how other institutions can replicate this program with limited resources.
