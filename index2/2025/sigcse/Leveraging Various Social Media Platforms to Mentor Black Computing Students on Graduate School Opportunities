The Institute for African American Mentoring in Computing Sciences leverages social media platforms to share information, offer mentorship, and connect Black computing students with vital resources. Through platforms : YouTube, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn, iAAMCS provides insights into graduate programs, application strategies, and funding opportunities. These efforts are part of a broader initiative aimed at increasing the recruitment and retention of Black students in computing by fostering niche online communities and providing culturally relevant mentorship. IAAMCS plays a crucial role in empowering African American students to navigate the challenges of graduate school and succeed in the field of computing. Through this poster, we explore IAAMCS's social media strategies and their impact on increasing Black student participation and retention in computing disciplines.
