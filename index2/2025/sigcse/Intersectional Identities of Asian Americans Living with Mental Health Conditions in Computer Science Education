Exploring the intersection of identity, mental health, and computer science (CS) education, we focus on the unique challenges faced by Asian American students living with mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. In a nationwide survey, participants shared experiences around mental health stigma and impacts of the model minority myth. Preliminary findings reveal a reluctance among Asian American CS students to address their mental health. This study aims to fill a research gap, helping to identify educational strategies that can support the well-being of students living with mental health conditions in CS.
