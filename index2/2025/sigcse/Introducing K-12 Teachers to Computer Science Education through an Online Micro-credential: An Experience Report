As efforts to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) into K-12 classrooms continue to expand, there is a growing need for programs that prepare teachers for the effective teaching and integration of CS and CT into their instruction. An ongoing challenge is preparing current and future teachers to develop the skills and confidence needed to teach and integrate CS and CT. Micro-credentials, designed as a short, focused course, offer opportunities for teachers to build skills and confidence through targeted study. This experience report examines a self-paced online micro-credential developed and implemented within a university-based college of education. The micro-credential was designed to equip both pre-service and in-service teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to teach and integrate CS and CT into K-12 teaching and learning. We describe the micro-credential, including its structure, sequencing, and content. We then present an exploration of teachers' experiences in the micro-credential. Findings from surveys and CS autobiographies show increases in participants' attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward the conceptual and technical aspects of teaching CS, with a particular focus on designing clear and actionable plans for integration. The results from this study provide valuable insights for the development of future CS- and CT-focused micro-credentials.
