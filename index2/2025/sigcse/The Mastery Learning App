The Mastery Learning App, or MLA, is a web-based app designed to support courses taught using a Mastery Learning Assessment pedagogy. This demo presents a brief tutorial showing how to create a class on the MLA, using Discrete Mathematics as the example class. Class creation will cover the creation of skills or learning objectives for the course, creating exams, and using the pass/fail grading system to measure student progress on the course's skills. The app provides a list of skills (that can be modified by the instructor) and a library of problems for each of the skills that can be used to create weekly exams. Instructors can add skills and problems to the skill libraries and choose to share them with others or keep them private. The app will generate personalized exams for each student, showing questions only for the skills they have yet to master and has an interface to allow students to upload photos of their answers if paper exams are used. The app supports a third user type, TAs, who are able to anonymously grade and give feedback on student work. All three views, teacher, student, and TA, will be covered in the demo. The app can be hosted locally assuming an https connection, and the app without the grading features can also be accessed via a site we host for free.
