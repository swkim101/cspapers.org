While many recent studies have explored how large language models can transform computer science instruction from the instructor perspective, they are primarily at the college level. Thus, little is known about using large language models towards curriculum development and teacher supports outside of the college setting. Given the emphasis placed on culturally responsive teaching at the K-8 level and well-documented evidence of insensitive and inaccurate language model outputs from a cultural perspective, it is imperative to perform systematic and principled research before considering their use in this setting. This paper explores the potential of teachers using large language models to brainstorm instructional Scratch projects. Specifically, we use GPT-3 to mimic structured projects from an existing computer science curriculum but situate the generated projects in different contexts/themes. We qualitatively analyze 300 project ideas generated by GPT and find 81% of the generated ideas satisfy our metrics for technical alignment and theme quality. We identify two major weaknesses: code complexity of generated projects and presence of potential insensitive elements that would require human filtering. We conclude that, while not ready as a student-facing solution, teachers could use GPT to effectively brainstorm customized instructional materials.
