Recent advancements in image translation for enhancing underexposed and overexposed images have highlighted the efficacy of deep learning algorithms. Transforming images into high-contrast representations is challenging due to the varying contrast levels within a single image, necessitating models that can adapt to these variations. Deep learning methods have shown significant success in processing RGB images captured under varying lighting conditions. However, limited research addresses images with extreme exposure variations within the same image, where existing models encounter difficulties due to the inherent complexity of such images. In this study, titled HiPyr, we present a novel integration of a HyperNetwork within a laplacian pyramid based network to address these image enhancement challenges. A HyperNetwork is a specialized architecture that generates weights for another network, allowing it to adapt its performance to the inputs. HyperNetworks in our paper are leveraged to dynamically predict an optimal kernel used in the decomposition of the Laplacian Pyramid. This capability enables a tailored decomposition process that adapts to each image's unique characteristics. The pyramid network enhances image quality through multiscale decomposition and reconstruction, enabling effective manipulation of features across different scales. Our modifications to the Laplacian pyramid framework involve adjusting the number of residual blocks and activation functions across all levels of the translation networks. By integrating these enhancements with the HyperNetwork's dynamic kernel prediction, we achieve a more efficient and effective solution for image enhancement.
