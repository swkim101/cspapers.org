Equity and diversity issues persist in computer science education. Prior research has identified marginalizing factors prevalent in the computing fields that discourage women and people of color, while also highlighting experiences that help them persist. Extending prior studies and applying an intersectional lens, this study aims to center the voice of Black girl high school students and present their experiences taking Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) courses. We investigate how and why they persisted by conducting semi-structured interviews with eight Black girl students who have completed at least one AP CS course, and connect their stories to prior work. Applying situated expectancy-value theory (SEVT), our findings reveal examples of marginalizing and empowering social interactions within learning environments, students' awareness and active construction of social support networks, and conscious effort to resist inequity as motivation for studying CS. Our findings build upon prior studies of Black women's experiences in post-secondary and computing careers, and extend this research to secondary education contexts.
