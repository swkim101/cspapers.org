This study examines the challenges and opportunities of teaching computing ethics within the context of a large, low-workload, standalone course. CS199 is a one-unit, pass/fail computing ethics course designed to provide students with exposure to a wide array of topics and promote critical peer-based engagement. We leverage submitted work via Question, Quote, Comment, and Replies (QQCRs) and podcasts to facilitate discussions outside the classroom. While QQCRs have shown promise in promoting engagement and exposing students to diverse perspectives, limitations remain in stimulating deeper critiques of the material. We reflect on the effectiveness of asynchronous discussion and its alignment with broader learning goals in computing ethics education.
