Web applications are increasingly the main way to create user interfaces, and they are often the most common software beginners have encountered. However, web development relies on concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies, which are challenges beyond the scope of an introductory course. Additionally, many features of modern web frameworks conflict with CS1 principles, such as avoiding global mutable state and promoting test-driven development. Consequently, web development is rarely integrated into CS1 courses, despite its motivational potential. This paper introduces Drafter, a new open-source Python library for CS1, enabling students to develop full-stack web applications using pure functions with minimal boilerplate. Drafter has simple functions to generate HTML, eliminating the need to learn HTML or templating languages. The data model scales with students' mastery of types, from primitives to nested lists, Dataclasses, and dictionaries. Drafter supports unit testing of entire web applications and reinforces CS1 concepts like decomposition and reusability. Websites created with Drafter can be deployed through GitHub Pages, with plotting and image manipulation. Students receive extensive debug information, including unit test scaffolding, program state visualization, and enhanced error messages and tests. This paper discusses the pedagogical features and design decisions behind Drafter, along with instructor reflections on its use. We believe Drafter can significantly enhance student engagement in CS1 courses and reinforce key learning objectives.
