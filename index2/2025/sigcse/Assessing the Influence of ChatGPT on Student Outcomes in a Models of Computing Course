This study investigates the impact of ChatGPT on student performance in a Models of Computing course, foundational for the computer science major. Analysing data from 11 pre-lecture quizzes across four terms, we found a decline in average quiz scores, particularly in the latest term. The results suggest a correlation between increased reliance on ChatGPT and decreased student performance, especially on challenging questions where the AI frequently strug-gled. These findings highlight both the benefits and challenges of integrating AI in education. Our ongoing research aims to explore this further across multiple courses, ultimately promoting responsible AI use to enhance learning outcomes.
