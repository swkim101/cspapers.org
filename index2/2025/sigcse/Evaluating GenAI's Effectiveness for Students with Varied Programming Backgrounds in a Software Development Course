Using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in education presents both opportunities and challenges to the traditional teaching methods and students' learning experience and outcomes, particularly in technical and programming courses. This experience report evaluates the impact of GenAI tools, specifically ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot, in leveling the playing field for Information Systems students with varying technical backgrounds in an application design and development course. By integrating these tools into course labs and projects, this study aimed to determine whether they improve the success rates of less technically prepared and struggling students. Data were collected from five sessions of a semester-long course across two campuses, involving 162 students with five parallel sessions across two continents. The analysis of student performance metrics and surveys revealed that GenAI tools significantly helped students complete programming tasks. However, those who were less technically prepared and relied heavily on AI assistance struggled with more complex, transformative tasks, such as closed-book exams. These findings suggest that while GenAI tools can help close gaps in temporary programming skills, they are less effective - and may even exacerbate disparities - in fostering long-term deeper learning and developing transformative knowledge and critical thinking.
