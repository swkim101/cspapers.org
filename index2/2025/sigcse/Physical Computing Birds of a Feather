Physical computing across K-12 and higher education is increasing worldwide. As its popularity grows, the need to generate and leverage high-quality research-based evidence is also increasing. Schools, governments, NGOs, nonprofits and corporations are integrating physical computing for in-school, out-of-school, and employee engagement programs as a result of better access to low cost devices, rising demand for computer science education, updated school curricula, and a shifting global footprint of the semi-conductor industry. While hands-on learning experiences can be some of the most influential in a student's education, they are not guaranteed to lead to positive outcomes. How might we integrate physical computing into existing and new programming to reach students with experiences that positively contribute to their life chances? What are effective strategies for scaling physical computing education programs to ensure the end user - students - are engaging in equitable and culturally relevant/responsive experiences? What key information do decision makers need to consider when organizing, launching, funding and/or assessing such programs? Bring your ideas, questions, stories, and research for discussion with this cross-sector group of physical computing stakeholders.
