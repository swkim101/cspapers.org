This poster presents the development and implementation of a 10-day remix-based summer camp curriculum designed to introduce high school students, particularly a multinational cohort of young women, to programming through creative coding. The curriculum integrates music composition using EarSketch and web development with HTML and CSS. The camp aims to inspire participants to gain self-efficacy in programming and motivate them to explore STEM/computing careers. Preliminary results from surveys and interviews indicate increased confidence in programming skills. This ongoing research explores the impact of remixing as a gateway for transitioning into more general-purpose computing domains such as web development.
