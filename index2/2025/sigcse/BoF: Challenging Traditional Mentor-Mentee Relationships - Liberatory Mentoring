This BoF session invites all that are interested in discussing the relationship between mentoring and professional socialization. We will identify common barriers to accessing mentorship and the specific challenges racial and ethnic minoritized (REM) students encounter, and contrast liberatory mentoring with "traditional" forms of mentorship. Students from REM groups often seek out same-race mentors for support; however, given the limited number of REM faculty, students from marginalized groups may encounter unique challenges in obtaining mentoring support, Attention needs to be paid on mentorship practices that create inclusive program environments that allow for successful matriculation into their programs and retention in the profession. Based on the relevant scholarship, the facilitators will afford discussions for providing liberatory mentoring practices to promote students' inclusion and retention.
