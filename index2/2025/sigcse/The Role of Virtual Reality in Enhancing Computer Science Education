This paper examines the application of Virtual Reality (VR) in com- puter science education through a review of 28 academic papers. The study investigates VR's effectiveness in teaching complex topics such as finite state machines, computational thinking, and algo- rithms. The authors highlight VR's advantages, including immersive learning experiences and intuitive visualization of abstract concepts, while also noting challenges such as high costs and limited acces- sibility. The analysis reveals critical research gaps, including the need to evaluate VR's cost-effectiveness, scalability, integration with AI for adaptive learning, and support for diverse learners. To address these gaps, the paper proposes research questions for future investigations. While underscoring VR's potential to revolutionize computer science education, the study emphasizes the need for further research to optimize its implementation and effectiveness.
