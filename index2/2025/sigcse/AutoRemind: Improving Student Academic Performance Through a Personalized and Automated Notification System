University students, with their busy schedules and endless assignments, often struggle to remember due dates, upcoming tasks, and available course resources. Currently, courses use various educational platforms to navigate through coursework, causing confusion for students. We are developing AutoRemind, an opt-in notification tool that delivers personalized reminders for upcoming tasks and course resources via students' preferred communication platforms. AutoRemind is built to integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to extract real-time data on student progress, assignment status, and available resources. This microservice, built for the GradeView platform, will serve as a centralized hub for students to gain access to all course deadlines and resources from a single source of truth, simplifying the process of tracking and completing tasks. This tool is not specific to computer science classes, so it potentially has very broad reach, hopefully leading to improved academic performance and increased course engagement. We aim to reduce administrative burdens on instructors and support mastery learning, enabling students to progress at their own pace while maintaining consistent academic performance.
