This poster examines the commitment of the computer science (CS) education community to equity and justice. By analyzing 146 public pledges from 119 organizations using the Kapor Center's Culturally Responsive-Sustaining Computer Science (CR-SCS) Framework, we assessed focus areas such as racism, inclusive classroom cultures, rigorous curriculum, student voice, community engagement, and diverse experts. Findings show efforts in affirming student identities and community involvement but reveal gaps in addressing racism and recruiting diverse speakers. The results highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to ensure equity and inclusions in CS education. This study provides crucial insights into the current state of CS education and emphasizes the importance of holistic commitments towards justice.
