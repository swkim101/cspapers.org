The demand for data storytelling, or communication with data, has surged significantly in recent years. Despite its growing recognition, large-scale coaching support tools for students and instructors remain lacking. The field of information visualization has explored data visualization and storytelling. Still, this knowledge has yet to be integrated with learning science in classroom settings to enhance student learning. Post-secondary data science educators require specialized tools and guidance to teach data storytelling on a larger scale. This tutorial invites those interested in the pedagogy of data storytelling to explore the initial version of a new coaching tool, Story Studio, developed by our team. The tool's design is based on our understanding of the data storytelling process and the application of relevant learning science principles, incorporating insights from experts, educators, and students. During the tutorial, participants will engage in hands-on experiences with the tool and interact with the research and development team, providing valuable feedback to support the tool's iterative improvement. This session aims to bridge the gap between data storytelling research and educational practice, equipping educators with the necessary resources to effectively teach this critical skill set.
