The Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles (CSP) course was developed to broaden access to both computer science (CS) and AP courses, especially for students who have not had access or felt invited to these courses. Yet, it can be challenging for schools to create, sustain, and grow AP CSP programs, given the demands of building student enrollment, finding and retaining qualified teachers, and sustaining school and district commitment to offering the course. The authors have worked with high schools across the country to support AP CSP programs using the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) curriculum, through a U.S. Department of Education (ED)-funded project working with thirty-six schools across 11 states. We found that a key aspect of supporting strong AP CSP programs is focusing on implementation planning through school consultations. Implementation planning promotes equitable access to CS as teachers and administrators work together in a structured way to think critically about CS-related goals, including diverse enrollment in CS courses, particularly AP CSP, and address strategies and barriers to student recruitment and success as well as course sustainability. Here, we share ideas for applying implementation planning as a school support structure, for AP CSP implementation and high school CS pathways more broadly.
