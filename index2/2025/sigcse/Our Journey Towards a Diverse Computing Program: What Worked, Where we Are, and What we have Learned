Women and individuals from underrepresented groups are significantly underrepresented in educational pathways and professional roles in computing. This imbalance not only reveals broader social inequities but also alters the viewpoints of both current and future technologists. These perspectives can lead to a lack of motivation or self-efficacy in academia and implicit hiring and algorithmic biases in the professional world [22][18][13]. The underrepresentation of women and other marginalized groups presents a significant challenge. Addressing the barriers to entry and advancement in the field is essential for creating a more inclusive computing landscape that reflects and serves the needs of all people. Our work toward addressing these barriers was conducted in a large R1 state university where computer science is increasingly popular among students. This work reports the approaches that we implemented, starting Fall 2019, their outcomes, and the challenges faced throughout this journey's stage. More importantly, we show that the changes implemented in our program had a positive impact on both underrepresented groups and the overall student body.
