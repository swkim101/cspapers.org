Maine AI Arena (MAIA) is a platform designed to facilitate single-school (or club) agent-based AI competitions. It provides competition organizers with tools to design environments, complex agents, teams and goals. It supports multiple task types from simple single-agent navigation to complex multi-agent team-based scenarios such as capture the flag. MAIA's is designed to be inclusive with respect to local resources and use cases. Our goal is to give educators at any level the ability to introduce AI-related CS skills to students without the need for big budgets, personnel or hardware. Therefore, MAIA's technology requirements are minimal. It is open source Python3 with few dependencies and runs locally (no server or network required). MAIA's creation was assisted by a team of undergraduate students who helped to shape and test its current state.
