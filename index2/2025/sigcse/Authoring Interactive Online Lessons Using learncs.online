learncs.online is a free and open online learning platform hosting interactive lessons. Each lesson comprises text; code playgrounds; interactive code walkthroughs; videos; and programming, test authoring, and debugging exercises-in Java, Kotlin, or Python. Thousands of students are using this free online resource to begin their journey in computer science, and several instructors at other institutions are already using it to support their own courses. Instructors can contribute to existing lessons, author their own, and freely author and deploy new programming exercises. This tutorial will show instructors how to author their own lessons and exercises and publish them to learncs.online. Lessons are authored in MDX: Markdown supporting JSX components. Exercises are authored using the Questioner problem-authoring framework. Participants will set up a local development environment allowing them to preview their lessons and questions before submitting them for official publication. The creator and maintainer of learncs.online will lead the tutorial and be available to answer questions or address issues encountered by participants. Participants are expected to bring a laptop to this workshop.
