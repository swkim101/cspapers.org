Ensuring accessibility is essential for developing software that is inclusive for all users. Unfortunately, research shows that a significant portion of modern software fails to meet accessibility standards. Many students not only lack the knowledge of how to create accessible software but also do not fully grasp why it matters. To bridge this educational gap, we created a series of labs called the Accessible Learning Labs (ALL). These labs are designed to teach the techniques for developing accessible software, while also emphasizing the importance of accessibility in software design. Through hands-on activities, students can experience the consequences of inaccessible software and learn to fix these issues to make the software more accessible. This collection of labs is beneficial to learners at various stages, from beginners to professionals looking to improve their skills in creating accessible software.
