Identifying Knowledge Components (KCs) in computer science education improves curriculum design and teaching strategies. We introduce a framework using Large Language Models to identify KCs from programming assignments automatically. Our framework helps educators align assignments with course objectives. GPT-4 identifies relevant KCs well, though there's a low match with expert-generated KCs at the course level. At the problem level, performance is lower, but key KCs are reasonably identified.
