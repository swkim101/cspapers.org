This special session leverages the enthusiasm for Todd Zakrajsek's SIGCSE 2024 keynote address. His book, The New Science of Learning: How to Learn in Harmony With Your Brain, this year's SIGCSE READS nonfiction reading, will be used, along with CS Teaching Tips, to focus discussion. During this interactive session, participants will engage in roundtable discussions on the way we do and can use Science of Learning-style teaching in our classes, with the goal of broadly engaging faculty and students in effective learning using evidence-based practices.
