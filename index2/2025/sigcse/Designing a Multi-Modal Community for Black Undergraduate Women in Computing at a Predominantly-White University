Black women are significantly underrepresented in computer sci- ence, which limits the field's diversity and innovation. Existing university programs often lack cultural relevance, making interven- tions that resonate with Black women's experiences crucial. This paper details the auto-ethnographic design and implementation of a multi-modal community during the 2023-24 academic year at a predominantly white institution in the U.S. Designed by a Black woman, the community aimed to increase participation and support for Black undergraduate women in computing. The virtual commu- nity grew, with increasing engagement in in-person events. The paper explores the cultural foundations, design process, challenges, and recommendations for expanding similar interventions across other institutions
