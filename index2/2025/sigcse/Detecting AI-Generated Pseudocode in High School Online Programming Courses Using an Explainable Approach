Despite extensive research on code plagiarism detection in higher education and for programming languages like Java and Python, limited work has focused on K-12 settings, particularly for pseudocode. This study aims to address this gap by building explainable machine learning models for pseudocode plagiarism detection in online programming education. To achieve this, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 7,838 pseudocode submissions from 2,578 high school students enrolled in an online programming foundations course, along with 6,300 pseudocode samples generated by three versions of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. Utilizing this dataset, we develop an explainable model to detect AI-generated pseudocode across various assessments. The model not only identifies AI-generated content but also provides insights into its predictions at both the student and problem levels, thus enhancing our understanding of AI-generated pseudocode in K-12 education. Furthermore, we analyzed SHAP values and key features of the model to pinpoint student submissions that closely resemble AI-generated pseudocode. This research offers implications for developing robust educational technologies and methodologies to uphold academic integrity in online programming courses.
