As AI technologies become more prevalent, it is crucial for students to develop responsible, ethical, and proactive AI engagement skills. Recent educational initiatives have focused on enhancing CS and engineering students' AI ethics education but have largely overlooked integrating these concepts across other disciplines. This paper presents and assesses a pioneering initiative that integrates AI ethics into university curricula through a collaborative framework between CS and domain educators. We introduced 1-3 week AI ethics modules in seven diverse courses from Art to Chemistry, incorporating case studies and hands-on activities using chat- or image-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Student surveys indicated significant gains in confidence regarding AI ethics discussions, application of principles, and reasoning skills. Our approach advocates for utilizing structured frameworks and faculty collaboration in embedding AI ethics into university curricula, enhancing students' practical skills and ethical understanding across diverse professional settings.
