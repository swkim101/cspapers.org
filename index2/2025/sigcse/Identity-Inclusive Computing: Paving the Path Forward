This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session brings together computing educators, administrators, and graduate students to explore innovative approaches for creating supportive learning environments in computer science education. Building on the success of the Cultural Competence in Computing (3C) Fellows program, which has cultivated a community of over 250 computing professionals, this session provides a structured framework for addressing current challenges in computing education and developing effective teaching strategies. Participants will engage in dynamic discussions and collaborative activities examining successful pedagogical approaches, sharing implementation experiences, and exploring evidence-based practices for improving student outcomes. The session format includes focused breakout groups organized by geographical region, allowing participants to network with colleagues facing similar institutional challenges. Each group will include experienced educators who have successfully implemented innovative teaching practices, facilitating knowledge transfer and mentorship opportunities. Through guided discussions, participants will identify key obstacles in their educational environments and develop practical solutions based on peer experiences and proven methodologies. The BoF concludes with a collaborative planning session where participants will develop actionable steps for implementing new teaching approaches at their institutions. This session emphasizes building sustainable professional networks and communities of practice, enabling ongoing collaboration and resource sharing. Attendees will gain practical insights into educational innovation, forge valuable professional connections, and develop specific strategies to advance the work at their home institutions. This session particularly benefits educators seeking to implement research-based improvements in computing education.
