Computer Science (CS) equity initiatives in high schools are increasingly common, but their evaluation remains challenging due to a lack of specialized assessment tools. Existing tools for general education evaluation often fail to address the unique aspects of CS education. This study addresses this gap by leveraging the Experience lens of the CAPE framework (Capacity, Access, Participation, and Experience) to develop a survey tool in collaboration with educators in a Researcher-Practitioner Partnership. These survey questions are designed to capture nuanced data about students' CS experiences, which generic survey tools could overlook.
