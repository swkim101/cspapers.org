Many studies link imposter syndrome to mental health and psychological well-being in computing students. However, the role of feedback is underexplored in this context. In this study, we sought to explore the relationship between feedback types (positive, neutral, and negative) and imposter syndrome characteristics and stress levels using the Ecological Momentary Assessment data collection method. The study was conducted with seven computing students at a minority-serving institution over 14 days. The ecological momentary assessment survey included questions on context, feedback type (positive, neutral, and negative), stress levels, and imposter syndrome characteristics. Descriptive data analysis illustrates a consistent relationship between feedback types and the imposter syndrome characteristics. Specifically, students who received negative feedback were more likely to experience feelings of procrastination, incompetence/incapability, and fear of being shamed or humiliated. In contrast, positive feedback is associated with a lower prevalence of such negative feelings. Our findings highlight the need to expand the scope of feedback in computing education in the context of imposter syndrome. It opens up avenues for further research on how feedback can be carefully designed to help computing students manage feelings of imposter syndrome, thus reducing their stress level and improving their overall psychological well-being, and learning outcomes.
