Have you ever thought about spending an academic leave teaching in a different country or advising United States (U.S.) policy-makers on emerging technologies, or spending time at the National Science Foundation (NSF), or working at one of the U.S. service academies? For computer science academics located in the U.S., the federal government offers a variety of opportunities for those interested in such positions, either as an academic leave or as a career change. This panel session explores several of these opportunities, including: American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Fellowships, Fulbright U.S. Scholars Awards, Jefferson Science Fellowships, NSF rotator opportunities, and U.S. service academy careers. Panelists will describe their experiences in such positions and answer questions from the audience.
