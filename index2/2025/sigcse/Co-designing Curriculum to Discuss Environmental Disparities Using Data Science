Data has never been more abundant and accessible. Those who understand how to collect, clean, analyze and visualize data, and to build arguments with data are at an enormous advantage. With data literacy skills as impactful as they are, students should be exposed to meaningful, data-enhanced projects as early as elementary school. As a response to this need, researchers and eight fifth-grade teachers engaged in a Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to collaboratively design (co-design) a curriculum that integrates data literacy with environmentally-themed projects. The teachers were from school districts with 94% Latine student populations. This poster reports on how teacher insights and perspectives guided the curriculum to be more relevant and engaging to the Gen Alpha student population.
