Theoretical Computer Science is a non-trivial subject to motivate and teach to students starting their learning in Computer Science degrees. Addressing this topic at the high school level within the context of Physics courses, and associating real problems from this subject with theoretical computer science problems, could make the study of computability theory more accessible and appealing to students at the college level. This poster describes an approach to integrate theoretical computer science concepts, such as computability and algorithmic complexity, in the context of high school physics courses, along with a variety of educational activities to implement this approach and allow students to reason instinctively about computable and non-computable problems. This novel approach allows us to broaden students' exposure to complex ideas in theoretical computer science, within a familiar subject and in a more natural and intuitive way. All the problems and activities are framed within courses in Physics, but are clearly related to computing problems in other subjects within the K-12 curriculum.
