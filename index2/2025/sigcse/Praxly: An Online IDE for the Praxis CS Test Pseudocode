We are collaborating with a nonprofit organization to train high school Career Technical Education (CTE) teachers to teach computer science courses. In the United States, many CTE teachers are not automatically licensed to teach CS. The traditional pathway to licensure requires 18 credits of CS at a university, which is impractical for teachers while working full-time. Another pathway to licensure is taking the Praxis CS test, which in many states gives teachers an add-on endorsement in computer science. One of the biggest challenges for our teachers is learning how to program with the pseudocode used on the test. We have created an online development environment, named Praxly, that visualizes and runs the pseudocode, providing a space in which teachers can practice. Praxly supports both a text-based editor and a block-based editor, and the editors are synchronized with each other. This poster highlights Praxly's features and implementation details, outlines early research results, and discusses next steps for the project.
