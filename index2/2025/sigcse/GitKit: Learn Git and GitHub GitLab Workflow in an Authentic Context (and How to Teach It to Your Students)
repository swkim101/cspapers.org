The aim of this tutorial is to teach faculty the fundamentals of Git and GitHub using the GitKit. The GitKit is a snapshot of the artifacts (codebase, issues, etc.) of an authentic Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project, packaged with learning activities, an instructor guide, and a cloud-based development environment. The GitKit's learning activities introduce a GitHub workflow and Git basics by modeling the process of contributing to an authentic FOSS project. The activities introduce not only Git and GitHub, but also provide exposure to how these tools support the needs of Open Source (and commercial) development practices. The majority of the tutorial time will be dedicated to hands-on learning with the GitKit. Participants will work in small groups to complete key activities from the GitKit to learn both Git and GitHub fundamentals, and to see what their students would experience while using the GitKit. This will include an introduction to FOSS community principles, roles and practices as well at basic Git commands and GitHub workflow. The tutorial will conclude with information about how participants can deploy the GitKit as a short (1-2 session) or medium (4-6 session) length module in software development courses ranging from high school through college. A laptop is required for participants.
