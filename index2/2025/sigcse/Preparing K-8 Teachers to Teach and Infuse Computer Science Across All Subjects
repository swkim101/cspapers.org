The rapid advancement of computing technology and increasing dependency on digital information impact the career paths and the lives of all current students. The dynamic nature of technology necessitates ongoing evaluation and adaptation of computer science (CS) curricula and teaching methodologies to prepare a technology-driven workforce. While an abundance of curriculum material is available, this experience paper highlights a project focused on development of resources by teachers to specifically align to the New Jersey Student Learning Standards (NJSLS) for Computer Science and Design Thinking (CSDT). The work was designed by teachers for teachers as part of a professional learning community (PLC). The PLC aimed to provide learning opportunities, resources, and technical assistance to schools and districts. With the diverse demographics of the state, the PLC looked to expand access to equitable high-quality, standards-based computer science education for all K-12 students. The paper describes the methodology to create teacher-focused instructional materials based on a teacher PLC and survey data from 37 respondents, highlighting key insights, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements. This paper thus contributes to the existing literature by reaffirming the need for content resources and underscoring the role teachers play in ensuring computer science instruction is more accessible to teachers new to computer science education.
