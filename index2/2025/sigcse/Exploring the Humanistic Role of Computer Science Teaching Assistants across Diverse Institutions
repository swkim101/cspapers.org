Recently, there has been a growing interest in the role of teaching assistants (TAs) in computer science (CS). This interest is due to the vital role CS TAs play in supporting student learning and their expanding responsibilities driven by growing enrollments in CS programs worldwide. While much of this research focuses on the technical and pedagogical aspects of CS TAs' duties, researchers recognize the need to further explore the unique value human CS TAs provide, particularly with the rise of AI tools and assistants. In this paper, we use qualitative methods to analyze 109 survey responses collected across two different institutions in the United States as part of a larger design-based research project to make two contributions. First, we illustrate how CS TAs adopt humanistic stances and demonstrate care in their roles, thereby expanding prevailing understandings of CS TAs. Second, we detail similarities and differences across CS TAs' experiences at each institution that underscore the importance of understanding CS TAs as they are situated in different institutional contexts. We conclude by discussing implications of this work for computing instruction and TA training, emphasizing the importance of foregrounding the roles and values brought by TAs.
