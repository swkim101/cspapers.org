As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform industries and impact daily life, it's crucial for K-12 students to be AI literate. However, many teachers feel unprepared to teach AI-related concepts. This session will focus on strategies to equip teachers with the knowledge and confidence they need to bring AI into their classrooms. Drawing on insights from the Day of AI, which has provided AI education to half a million students and professional development to thousands of teachers worldwide, the session will explore successful models for scaling teacher training in AI. Topics will include debunking common misconceptions about AI, addressing logistical challenges, and offering practical, adaptable resources that allow teachers to integrate AI into a variety of subjects. Attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiences and insights, particularly focusing on how to overcome barriers to teaching AI, such as lack of prior technical expertise or insufficient time to devote to professional development. The session will emphasise the importance of creating a collaborative and supportive network for developing and sharing AI teaching resources. Through interactive discussions, participants will collaboratively explore strategies to expand AI literacy and develop teacher confidence, aiming to create a sustainable model for equipping educators to teach AI at scale. This session will foster community engagement, promote shared learning, and serve as a launchpad for continued collaboration on AI education.
