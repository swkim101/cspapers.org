A three-week creative coding module was implemented as part of an introductory high school computer science class using a novel programming platform in virtual reality. This paper examines students' open-ended, independent final projects to assess how they leveraged coding concepts covered during lessons and guided practices. Projects reflected mastery of fundamentals such as input and output, lists, and events, but limited use of more complex structures, such as conditionals or loops. Strategies for improving transfer of learning from structured lessons to more independent, creative work are discussed.
