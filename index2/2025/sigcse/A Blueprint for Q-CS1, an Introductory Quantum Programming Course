Despite the need to build a quantum workforce, current courses that introduce quantum programming are rooted in quantum notation that students may find intimidating. We propose Q-CS1, a quantum equivalent of CS1 that begins with hands-on quantum programming. Q-CS1 is enabled by the Qwerty quantum programming language, which allows for reasoning about qubit behavior without physics notation or quantum circuits. An outline of Q-CS1 is provided along with plans for assessing its effectiveness.
