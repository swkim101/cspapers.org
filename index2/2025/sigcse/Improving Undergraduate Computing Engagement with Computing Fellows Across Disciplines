This paper explores the efficacy of near-peer computing mentors in fostering computing identity among students in courses across disciplines. The Computing Fellows program ''attaches'' near-peer mentors to a wide range of undergraduate courses to create a cross-disciplinary learning environment for mentors and students. The mentors support the integration of computing into courses through activities including in-class workshops, one-on-one consultations, and drop-in office hours. Prior research has established the positive impact of near-peer mentoring on students' sense of computer science identity in computer science educational pathways. Our paper contributes to this literature by studying the experience of near-peer mentoring for students in courses across disciplines, including in courses in which there is no coding prerequisite. Our research demonstrates a positive relationship between increases in key aspects of computing identity and interaction with a computing fellow. In a multi-year mixed-methods study, we analyze student evaluations from courses with attached fellows and cross-reference the results with student focus group data. Among our findings, students who say they met with a fellow at least once demonstrate a reported increase in computing interest (not seen in our full sample) and computing competency (larger than in our full sample). These increases also hold among the sub-group of students in courses with no coding prerequisites. Our qualitative data further shows the variety of ways students describe the impact of computing fellows on their engagement with computing.
