The widespread release of generative AI tools has led to a rapid rise in publications evaluating their impact on CS education. While there is no doubt that the area is new and rapidly evolving, it is important to begin to catalogue and map the literature at this early stage. In this work, we systematically search and map 82 papers evaluating the impact of generative AI tools on CS education. We then build a literature map of these papers using the axes of population, use of generative AI, and method of evaluation. This work will serve as both a snapshot of the first generation of generative AI papers in the field, and a road-map for further classification and literature review as the field develops.
