Large Language Models (LLMs) present a transformative opportunity to address longstanding challenges in computing education. This paper presents a conversational AI extension to an LLM-enhanced C/C++ compiler which generates pedagogically sound programming error explanations. Our new tool, DCC Sidekick, retains compiler integration, allowing students to see their code, error messages, and stack frames alongside a conversational AI interface. Compiler context improves error explanations, and provides a seamless development experience. We present quantitative analyses of Sidekick's usage and engagement patterns in a large CS1 course. In the first seven weeks of use, 959 students initiated 11,222 DCC Sidekick sessions, generating 17,982 error explanations. Over half of all conversations occur outside of business hours, highlighting the value of these always-available tools. Early results indicate strong adoption of conversational AI debugging tools, demonstrating scalability in supporting large CS1 courses. We share implementation details and lessons learned, offering guidance to educators considering integrating AI tools with pedagogical guardrails.
