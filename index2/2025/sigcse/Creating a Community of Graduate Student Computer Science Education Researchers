This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session serves to build a community of graduate student researchers in Computer Science Education (CSEd) at SIGCSE TS and beyond. Many graduate students lack a CSEd research community within their own institution. This BoF session will serve to provide a space for SIGCSE TS graduate students to build their community across institutions, both during and after the conference. During the session, we will discuss the successes and challenges that come with being a CSEd graduate student, including work/life balance, advisor-student relationships, and developing collaborations. Attendees will leave with an opportunity to connect with other CSEd graduate students beyond the conference through a dedicated CSEd graduate student Slack channel.
