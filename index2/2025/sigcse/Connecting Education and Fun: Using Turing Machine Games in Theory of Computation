Active learning in computer science can take many forms: group problem-solving, project-based learning, peer instruction, and interactive lab exercises. This poster presents activities in a Theory of Computation course, where students solved puzzles for three games related to Turing Machines: Turing Tumble, Code Master, and the Game of Life. After the game session, students completed reflections to make connections between the games and Turing Machines. While the reflections were graded solely on completion, they demonstrated that students can make connections between these game environments and Turing Machines. For example, students recorded similarities about the infinite tape and the Game of Life grid cells, switches in Turing Tumble and transitions in Turing Machines, and string acceptance in a state machine being similar to the conditions to reach the portal in Code Master.
