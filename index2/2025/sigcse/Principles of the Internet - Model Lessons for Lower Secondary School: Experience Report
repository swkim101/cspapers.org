The national computing curriculum in Czechia was revised in 2021 to incorporate various topics, including fundamental principles of the internet and computer networks at the ISCED level 2 (age \sim11-15). However, schools face a shortage of age-appropriate teaching materials on this subject. To address this gap, we developed four model lessons and corresponding materials tailored for ISCED 2 students and teachers at two levels of difficulty. The primary objective of these lessons is to elucidate the structure and fundamental principles of the internet, building on prevalent student preconceptions. This work is grounded in the constructivist instructional framework known as Evocation - Realisation of Meaning - Reflection (ERR). The lessons were created and validated through design-based research conducted across six schools, involving 13 classes and a total of approximately 270 students. Pre-post-delayed testing revealed very large immediate improvements following the intervention ( d = 1.72, p < 0.001, n = 204) as well as large, sustained effects months later ( d = 1.10, p < 0.001, n = 59). This paper details the development, implementation, and evaluation of these lessons, providing a valuable resource for educators in various contexts.
