Students with disabilities face a variety of challenges in computer science education including those related to stigma around disability, inaccessible curriculum, instruction and tools, disability disclosure, and a lack of mentors. In addition, few computer science classes teach students to understand accessibility and design accessible technology. This BOF will bring together individuals who are interested in increasing the representation of people with disabilities in computing and improving their success as well as those interested in teaching about accessibility. Participants will share strategies to help each other do a better job of addressing disability inclusion and accessibility in our classes and research projects. Resources related to accessible tools and instruction, universal design of learning, opportunities for students, teaching accessibility, and more will be shared.
