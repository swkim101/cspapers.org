Engaging diverse learners in Computer Science (CS) can be challenging. This lightning talk gives an example of addressing this challenge through a novel educational comic book called "Bit by Bit", based on Stanford University's CS1 and CS2 classes, CS106A and CS106B. Serving as a source of edutainment- educational entertainment- and employing personified characters like Fabulous Function and Sir Python, "Bit by Bit" aims to make complex CS concepts more visual, simple, and accessible while providing code-based examples for CS106A and CS106B students to walk through. This presentation will briefly explore the underlying philosophies-including visual thinking, the Fractal Gridding methodology, and educational learning psychology- that inform the novel comic book. These principles can support diverse learning styles while encouraging greater student engagement. Additionally, the inclusion of the author's personal and cultural experiences highlights new possibilities for representation in learning CS. Feedback from the Stanford CS community also helped balance the educational content and entertainment value of the book. This community-driven approach is also touched upon in addition to the potential for replicating this experience in other educational contexts.
