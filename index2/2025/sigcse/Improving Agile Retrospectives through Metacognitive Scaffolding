The retrospective is a crucial component of the agile software development process. In previous studies of retrospectives in undergraduate team software development projects, students exhibited limited and shallow reflection. We speculate that this is due to students' limited experience with reflection and the absence of clear guidance for engaging in deep reflection during agile retrospectives. To explore the potential for a pedagogical intervention to foster deeper reflection in retrospectives, we present an empirical comparison of a standard retrospective model against an enhanced retrospective model that scaffolds deeper levels of reflection by prompting students to justify and critique their practices and weigh alternative approaches. Through a systematic classification of the reflection level of statements made during individual brainstorming and team discussion phases of retrospectives, our study found that the enhanced model led to individuals and teams engaging in significantly higher levels of reflection. Our findings contribute to improving software engineering education by demonstrating the efficacy of an enhanced pedagogical model for team retrospectives.
