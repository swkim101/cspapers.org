We present the Requirement Elicitation Tool that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) (gpt-4o-mini) to enable simulated real-world interactions of requirements gathering from three synthetic personas. We demonstrate the use case of Computer Science (CS) students in Database Management Systems leveraging the tool to build a conceptual model and Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. Our preliminary findings show the potential of this tool to engage students in discovery process without providing predefined solutions and set the directions for future work.
