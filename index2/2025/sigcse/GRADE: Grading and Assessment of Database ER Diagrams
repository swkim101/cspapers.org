Entity-relationship (ER) modeling is a crucial component of database education, allowing students to conceptualize real-world problems and translate them into database schemas. Existing tools, such as AutoER, provide automated grading for UML-style diagrams but often lack flexibility in representing more complex relationships. In this poster, we introduce GRADE (Gr ading and Assessment of Database ER Diagrams), a tool designed to support the creation and automatic grading of ER diagrams. Unlike UML-based alternatives, GRADE focuses on providing a flexible environment for students to construct ER diagrams, improving their understanding of core database concepts. GRADE also offers real-time feedback and scalability in assessments. This poster outlines the features of GRADE and discusses its potential impact on database education.
