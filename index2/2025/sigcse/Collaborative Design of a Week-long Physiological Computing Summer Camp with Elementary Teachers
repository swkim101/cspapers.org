This report presents several main collaborative design scenarios involved in designing a week-long summer camp program to engage elementary students in physiological computing. The design team consists of the research team (the authors of this report) and four elementary school teachers from a school district with a majority of historically underrepresented students in a southeastern state in the U.S. We present the goals for the co-design, followed by an account of the nature of the conversations and discussions during the synchronous co-design sessions. With the research team leading with questions, teachers contributed with abundant knowledge and experience with pedagogies to engage upper elementary-grade students, including activities that relate to students' everyday learning, scaffolding strategies to bridge potential learning gaps, and suggestions for software development and updates. These insights are expected to help enable adoptions by researchers and practitioners in collaborative design for K-12 students.
