Rural populations represent an important and often overlooked audience for broadening participation in computing efforts. More than 20% of all students in the United States live in a rural region, and surveys of access to computing education consistently show these students have less opportunity to and engagement in learning computer science than both suburban and urban peers. Recent scholarship has suggested that rural populations subscribe to a cohesive group identity that (at least in some cases) can subsume ethnic and racial identities, especially important when we consider 22% of the rural population is composed of individuals with these intersectional identities. In this paper we describe example lessons under development for use in our Cyber Pipeline project, an outreach program that provides Kansas schools with a modular computing curriculum and in-service teachers with professional development training to utilize it. These lessons are being developed using culturally relevant pedagogy and a community learning approach to ground the lessons in the everyday experiences, cultural identities, and concerns of these rural students. We are co-developing these lessons with both K-12 teachers in the Cyber Pipeline and disciplinary experts across our campus. We present our our approach in the hopes that it will be of benefit to other educators seeking to reach rural populations.
