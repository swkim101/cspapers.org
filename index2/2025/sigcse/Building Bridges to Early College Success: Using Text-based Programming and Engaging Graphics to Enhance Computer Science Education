In 2024, 32.9% of undergraduate students dropped out of college. The major with the most significant dropout rate was computer science (CS), with 10.7%. The free text-based curriculum project from Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy addresses gaps that enable students to learn CS concepts up to the university level. Since 2018, this project has been globally available and has worked with professors, teachers, and content developers to create multiple courses: a short introductory course, the flagship CS1 year-long course, a college-level course, and more. Courses are offered through our online, web-based platform, which is free to use by teachers in K-12 classrooms. The goal is to bridge knowledge from block-based curriculum to text-based college-level courses. In addition, our college-level course allows students to earn credit (four credit hours/12 units) for their work through an end-of-course exam proctored by teachers in their schools. Currently in its first-year post-pilot, College Programming and Computer Science (CPCS) has allowed students to earn Carnegie Mellon University credit that is recognized at universities across the United States and beyond. Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy has served over 450,000 students and 13,000 teachers worldwide. The curriculum is also being translated into Spanish and has pilots in various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Ecuador, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Colombia.
