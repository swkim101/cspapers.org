Understanding task relevance in dialogue is important for identifying engagement patterns and shifts in focus during learning activities. Using this information, educators can gain valuable insights into student behaviors and identify potential learning gaps. This paper investigates the characteristics and trends of task-relevant dialogue when middle school students develop AI-based chatbot in a science learning context. We use a keyword-based approach to identify on-task and off-task utterances and further divide the on-task utterances to AI discussion and Science discussion. We visualize the trends among 30 dialogue sessions that reflect students' focus on specific topics over time. Our results show that as the conversation progressed, students' discussion on AI topics decreased but discussion on science topics increased. This analysis provides a contextual-relevant approach to understand dialogue topic shifts and student engagement when building AI artifacts, which help inform the design of effective interventions.
