Efforts to diversify the tech industry have heavily focused on post-secondary education, but research increasingly highlights the importance of early K-12 interventions in broadening interest and engagement. This poster presents a summary of processes we have been engaged in over the last three years to plan a 7-year longitudinal study exploring persistence and motivation among students in grades 6th-12th in the U.S. The major processes included engaging a group of vested collaborators, identifying appropriate funding, developing a formal feasibility plan, and developing and launching a one-year pilot study. This poster details this nearly three-year process (including the pilot study) as well as next steps as we intend to launch the study across three dozen sites in Fall 2025.
