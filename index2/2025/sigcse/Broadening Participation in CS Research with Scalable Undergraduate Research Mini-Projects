Undergraduate research experiences have been shown to increase student retention rates in STEM pathways, with a notable impact on students from Historically Underrepresented Groups (HUGs). However, undergraduate research experiences are often inaccessible to students, particularly in high-demand research areas and at large institutions with low faculty-to-student ratios. We present an approach to broadening participation in computer science (CS) research by integrating a research project into a standard, upper-division optimization for machine learning (ML) course. We developed mini research projects which provided students with structured guidance to a new research area. In the projects, students were introduced to a recent publication in the area through a series of guided questions and then completed one of several recommended open-ended extensions for which they submitted a final report. In contrast to many undergraduate courses or programs that are focused on research, this approach introduces research in a large course in a scalable manner, lowering the barrier to entry for students and the implementation burden for instructors. The results of our intervention revealed a positive impact on students' academic and personal development. A majority of participants who completed a project reported heightened comfort and familiarity with research, as well as benefits in their exposure to and perceptions of research. Specifically, these gains were present for two groups of students we were particularly interested in: students from HUGs and students with no prior research experience.
