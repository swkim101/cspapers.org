The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that was established in 1950 by Congress to support science and engineering efforts nationwide. NSF distributes federal funding among scientists to support their research and development initiatives promoting progress in science, advancing national health, prosperity and welfare and national defense. NSF Program Directors (PDs) ensure that proposals are reviewed in a fair, competitive, transparent, and thorough manner, supporting scientists and educators throughout the submission process. A common misconception is that it is difficult and inadvisable to contact NSF Program Directors during any stage of proposal submission, whether before or after submission. This misconception leads some faculty members to avoid discussing their ideas with Program Directors, thereby missing opportunities to advance their proposals effectively. As a former faculty member and now a Program Director, the presenter aims to clarify some of these common misconceptions or generate greater awareness by posing and answering a few not-so-frequently-asked-questions (FAQ)s for engaging with PDs. The session aims to empower educators to engage meaningfully with NSF Program Directors about funding ideas, bringing them one step closer to successful grant writing in support of their academic endeavors.
