Office hours are a core feature of CS courses. They provide a crucial vector for personalized instruction and individual support. Despite their importance, we the impact of these personal events has not been well assessed each office hour interaction is often hidden from instructors. We do not know if students actually understand the solution or the advice given during the interaction. This lack of knowledge presents a challenge to efforts geared at improving instructional practices and student outcomes. In this poster we report on the results of a survey analysis of office hour participants. Our results show that students and instructional staff had divergent assessments of the interactions with teaching staff overestimating the benefits more than 18.9% of the time. This work highlights detailed analyses of these results along with implications for teaching strategies.
