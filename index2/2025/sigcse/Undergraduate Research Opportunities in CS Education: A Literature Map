Involving undergraduate students in research has a wide array of benefits, for the students themselves, for the research team, and for the community. In this work, we identify and map research papers from the CS education community that focus on the implementation and evaluation of undergraduate research experiences. Our mapping of 26 papers on the dimensions of population, research components, and evaluation metrics will provide a systematic resource for finding and categorizing research into these experiences, and for identifying gaps in the literature.
