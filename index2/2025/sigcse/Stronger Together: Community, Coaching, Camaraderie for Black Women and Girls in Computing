Modern Figures Podcast serves to elevate the voices of Black women and girls in computing to inspire the next generation of the advanced technology workforce. Through a National Science Foundation-funded Broadening Participation in Computing Development Project (Award No. 2315480), we are uncovering the strategies Black women have used to navigate through academia and into successful careers in computing. Several themes have emerged from their narratives, which were pulled from their episodes. These themes include 1) Educational Experiences, 2) Early Childhood Engagement, 3) Hinderances & Barriers, 4) Disrupting the Status Quo, and 5) Critical Mentorship. This interactive BoF will serve as an opportunity to listen to pieces of their stories and discuss the strategies that allow Black women and girls to successfully traverse the landscape of the computing ecosystem, from early childhood, through education, and into their careers. We will encourage participants to discuss ways they support Black women and girls in their context. BoF participants should be open to discussing intersectional identities from an anti-deficit-based approach with a diverse audience. This session will be documented and a de-identified transcript with best practices and strategies will be reported on the project's website and disseminated to attendees.
