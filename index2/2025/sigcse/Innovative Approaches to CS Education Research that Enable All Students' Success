What does it mean to conduct computer science education research in a manner that ensures that the evidence produced is high quality and benefits a wide variety of students? One can pour over various guides from institutions like What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) and the American Psychology Association (APA). However, what many standards fail to include is a holistic perspective of conducting education research, including guidelines for ensuring that the aggregated data presented represents the student population that the research will ultimately serve. In this panel, we tackle both and explore approaches that have been used in other education research fields as well as those appropriate to CS education research that can be leveraged to ensure that all students' needs, experiences, cultures, identities, and voices are captured and presented in our research.
