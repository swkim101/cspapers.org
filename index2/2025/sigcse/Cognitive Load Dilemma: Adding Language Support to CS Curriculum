Approximately 43.4 million people in the United States are native Spanish speakers, accounting for 13.7% of the population. Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, only behind English. Cognitive load affects how much information can be moved into and from our working memory. When students are unable to lessen their cognitive load, it is impossible or almost impossible for them to continue learning. Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy is a free Python curriculum and professional development project that offers Spanish as a toggleable option so that students have it easily accessible to them when/if needed [1]. We use translanguaging and cognitive load theories in the development of the curriculum translation [2]. In addition to the translation, all supporting materials are also available in Spanish, allowing teaching and learning in either Spanish or English. We have pilots running in Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, where every year, more teachers and students benefit from the Spanish-language translation of the curriculum. Since the beginning of Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy in 2018 and launch of Spanish in 2021, the project has gone from 90 active daily Spanish users to over 2600 active daily users and has seen a doubling of users yearly. The goal for the 2024-2025 school year is to reach a total of 6000 daily users and launch additional pilots in Latin America.
