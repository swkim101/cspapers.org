Discrete mathematics has been a topic taught in the undergraduate computer science curriculum for decades. Most research publications that are focused on discrete mathematics focus on the teacher's perspective of the course and the students. They also suggest that students struggle in the course due to a lack of mathematical maturity or motivation without presenting much empirical evidence. This paper fills the gap in research by focusing on what students think of discrete mathematics, including the concepts that they find easier and the ones that challenge them the most. We collected survey data from 132 computing students at a large public university. We analyzed the data utilizing descriptive statistics and open coding. We found that students identify proof writing as the most difficult concept to learn due to its difference from mathematics that they are most used to. Students also suggest that their challenge is not that they find the course as a whole irrelevant, which could cause a lack of motivation, but rather that specific topics were hard to understand or connect to computer science. We discuss these findings and discuss the implications and possible future directions for research in the area of discrete mathematics in the computer science curriculum.
