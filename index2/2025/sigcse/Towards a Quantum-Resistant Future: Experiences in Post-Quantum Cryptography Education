With recent progress in the development of cryptographically relevant Quantum Computing (QC), significant effort is being made in the cryptography community to create viable long-term solutions against the threat of QC breaking classical public-key security schemes. The current Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process led by the NIST has made some selections and is about to recommend new cryptographic protocols resistant to QC. This work reports our experiences teaching a first-in-kind module- based course in Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (QRC) at two universities.
