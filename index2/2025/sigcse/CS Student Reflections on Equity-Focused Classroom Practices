Pedagogical practices that promote equity in the classroom play a crucial role in broadening participation and enhancing student success. These practices directly address the critical challenge of low diversity in the field of computing. We implemented four equity-focused practices in a large CS1 course and gathered student reflection on how these practices impacted their performance, confidence, and sense of belonging. Additionally, for each practice, we asked students to respond to open-ended questions to capture any other effects these practices might have had. This allowed students to suggest specific ways these practices impacted or highlight impacts beyond the three constructs we were measuring. We utilized thematic analysis to find insights from these 531 open-ended responses, which resulted in 11 categories, with four being the most evident. Our findings suggest that students found these practices helped them grow from mistakes and feedback, support their emotional well-being, improve their learning and recall, and develop effective self-regulation and productivity. Our work shows that equitable practices can have effects beyond common measures like performance, and affective constructs like confidence, and sense of belonging. Our results indicate positive impacts in areas such as emotional well-being and learning, which were experienced by a substantial number of student participants.
