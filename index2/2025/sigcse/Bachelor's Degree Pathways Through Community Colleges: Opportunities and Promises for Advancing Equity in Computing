Despite the pivotal role that community colleges play in facilitating access to higher education, efforts to broaden participation in computing majors often center the experiences of students who follow direct pathways from high school to university computing programs. As a step to correct this bias, this panel will discuss the diverse pathways that students follow through community colleges in pursuit of computing bachelor's degrees. Panelists will present research on equity and student success in relation to community college transfer and community college bachelor's degree programs. The panel will highlight the promise of community college pathways to advance equity in computing and the barriers that constrain community colleges from fully realizing that promise.
