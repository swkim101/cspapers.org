This Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session offers LGBTQ+ researchers, educators, and practitioners in computing education an inclusive space for community-building, advocacy, and creative expression. The session seeks to expand beyond traditional networking by offering attendees a variety of opt-in activities, such as fiber arts, crafting, media sharing, and Pittsburgh-themed games. Attendees will have the opportunity to decompress after a long conference day, participate in discussions on queer scholarship and activism, and explore ways to make computing education more inclusive to LGBTQ+ individuals. A major focus of this session will be fostering connections beyond the conference itself. We will introduce a Slack channel for coordinating meetups throughout the conference and with monthly check-ins to ensure the community remains vibrant year-round. In light of the ongoing marginalization of the LGBTQ+ community and the political climate in the U.S., this session provides an essential space for decompressing, building support networks, and engaging in activism.
