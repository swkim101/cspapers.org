Delivering personalised and timely feedback is crucial for helping students address gaps in their understanding. However, the increasing demands of large class sizes make this task particularly challenging for CS1 educators, especially for casual teaching assistants who lack formal training and experience. Existing feedback training methods are often inconsistent and ineffective, leaving educators unprepared to handle diverse student needs. To address this, we designed an adaptive fading procedure based on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) to support educators in delivering high-quality, personalised feedback. This pedagogical technique is integrated into FeedbackPulse-CLT, an automated tool that evaluates feedback in real-time and provides guidance for improvement. This paper outlines our approach to designing scalable, evidence-based feedback instruction using Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to overcome feedback quality concerns in CS1 education.
