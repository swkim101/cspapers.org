The SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts College is charged with providing a network for faculty interested in liberal arts computing programs and providing a voice for the community in larger discussions of computing education. This BoF will invite the SIGCSE community to learn more about the liberal arts and gather information about community priorities for networking and/or advocacy. After a brief introduction to the Committee and its goals, participants will form breakout groups to discuss the priorities and needs of liberal arts CS education. Facilitators will report back high priority items to the room. Then groups will be formed around the common themes, and participants will discuss concrete work for the Committee. The Committee will use the feedback from this session to plan events and activities for the coming year, including the creation of Working Groups, which BoF participants can join. Any SIGCSE attendee with an interest in the liberal arts is welcome to attend. We interpret the liberal arts broadly as programs emphasizing education for the breadth of graduates' career, civic, and personal lives. Faculty at all institution types may also be interested in attending if they supervise graduate students or lead REU programs. Because the stated objective of this event is to hear from new voices, including students, and build connections, our activities will be structured to encourage participation among all attendees.
