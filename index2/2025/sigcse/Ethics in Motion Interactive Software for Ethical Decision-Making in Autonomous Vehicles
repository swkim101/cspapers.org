We developed an interactive software tool tailored for introductory computer science education, specifically for courses taught in Python. The software is designed to engage students in ethical decision-making through the simulation of emergency scenarios involving self-driving vehicles. In these scenarios, where the vehicle's brakes fail, students must refine the car's "ethics engine" to determine the best course of action: continuing straight, swerving into another lane, or crashing into a barrier. Students develop algorithms that consider various factors such as age, gender, race, and physical ability, emphasizing that algorithms are not neutral but reflect embedded societal values. This hands-on, iterative process encourages students to critically evaluate their decisions and understand the broader ethical implications of programming choices. By providing real-time feedback on the consequences of their algorithms, the software fosters critical thinking and ethical awareness, helping students to see how technology and societal values intersect in real-world applications. This project highlights the essential role of ethics in CS education, preparing students to navigate complex moral landscapes in technology.
