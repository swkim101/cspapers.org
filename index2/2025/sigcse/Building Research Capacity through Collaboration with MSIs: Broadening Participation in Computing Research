Establishing productive research collaborations can be complex. As all universities and colleges are unique, the context in which potential collaborators work must be understood. Collaborations between MSI and non-MSI institutions are particularly challenging due to the diversity of MSI institutions, their missions, and the context in which MSI faculty work. This panel will discuss successful research collaborations between Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), particularly emerging research institutions (ERIs) and non-MSI institutions, an essential part of broadening participation in computing and increasing postgraduate research opportunities for undergraduate students. The panelists have experience at a diverse range of MSIs, including public, private, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Research 2 (R2) institutions, master's comprehensive institutions, and predominantly undergraduate institutions. Collectively, the researchers have led, joined, and contributed to various collaborations, ranging from paired, short-term collaborations up to multi-institution, multi-year collaborations. The panel will provide examples of successful research collaborations and discuss how they were established. Attendees will discuss the various MSI research environments and best practices for building a long-lasting relationship between faculty, which will benefit all. Specific topics include identifying collaborators, submitting collaborative proposals to NSF and other agencies, growing as a cooperative team or group, and anticipating and managing collaboration changes. The panelists will also discuss how MSI departments can use strategic partnerships to build capacity and develop programs, research portfolios, and students, fostering longlasting relationships.
