Generative AI tools are rapidly evolving and impacting many domains, including programming. Computer Science (CS) instructors must address student access to these tools. While some advocate to ban the tools entirely, others suggest embracing them so that students develop the skills for utilizing the tools safely and responsibly. Studies indicate positive impacts, as well as cautions, on student outcomes when these tools are integrated into courses. We studied the impact of incorporating instruction on industry-standard generative AI tools into a mid-level software development course with students from 16 Minority Serving Institutions. 89% of student participants used generative AI tools prior to the course without any formal instruction. After formal instruction, students most frequently used generative AI tools for explaining concepts and learning new things. Students generally reported positive viewpoints on their ability to learn to program and learn problem-solving skills while using generative AI tools. Finally, we found that students: reported to understand their code when they work with generative AI tools, are critical about the outputs that generative AI tools provide, and check outputs of generative AI tools to ensure accuracy.
