In an age where artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly pivotal role in daily life, it is essential to equip our youngest learners with foundational knowledge of AI. The AI by 8 project aims to empower kindergarten through second grade teachers in rural North Carolina by introducing AI concepts through engaging, unplugged activities integrated into English Language Arts (ELA) instruction. This initiative seeks to address the gap in AI education expertise among early childhood educators and seeks to foster a generation of students who are well-prepared to navigate a technology-driven future. We present in this poster the guiding theoretical framework for our work, outlining the objectives of the research-practice partnership, and our initial efforts at recruiting rural K-2 teachers.
