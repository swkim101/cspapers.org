We identify barriers to successful cross-sector educational research partnerships and describe effective, evidence-based strategies for overcoming challenges. We developed educational interventions and deployed them at higher education institutions. Significant challenges arose in the research-practice partnership between faculty at a research institution and a local community college. We successfully implemented strategies to advance research, co-design educational interventions, and implement them in diverse contexts. We share insights gleaned that may be useful for others forging cross-institutional research partnerships, particularly between faculty at research institutions and partners at community colleges.
