We describe a semester-long course in which university students develop original software products to teach K--12 learners ideas in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The university students build their knowledge of AI/ML, gain skills in education research, and build expertise in software development. Our research participants are public school students at the middle school level who learn ideas in AI/ML when they interact with the university students' software tools. The university students often continue their scholarship after the semester and have produced multiple publications based on their original work. We are developing a growing collection of software tools to teach AI/ML that are available for use by curriculum developers. This paper presents the approach and insights from teaching the university course, now in its third iteration.
