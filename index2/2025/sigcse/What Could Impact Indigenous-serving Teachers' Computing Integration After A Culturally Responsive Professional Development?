Computer Science (CS) professional development has increased opportunities to broaden K12 teachers' and students' exposure to CS learning. However, many Indigenous-serving teacher professional development (PD) participants could not facilitate in-classroom implementation without significant follow-up and support. This study aims to understand how the factors emerging from our CS PD affected teachers' PD transition to in-classroom implementation. We analyzed multiple data sources collected over three years of our project. We use logistic regression to explore the data from the PD course. Through analysis, our study indicates that providing teachers with targeted mentorship and ensuring the completion of detailed lesson plans are two factors in the transition of teachers' learning from PD to teachers' implementations in the classroom.
