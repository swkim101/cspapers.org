Internships can allow computing students to cultivate valuable skills while offering them practical insight into industry. The aim of our study was to gain an understanding of undergraduate computing students' perceptions of a three-week micro-internship (called a ''Sprinternship'') program. We sought to explore their experiences throughout its duration, which included a priori professional and technical development training. We applied the methodology of phenomenography, conducting semi-structured interviews with n = 27 students and taking the developmental approach to the analysis. We noted cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and career-oriented factors often influenced students' views of the experience. In this work, we share the seven categories of description that emerged from the analysis and provide the implications. The findings of this investigation can offer guidance for educators and administrators looking to create similar short-term internship opportunities.
