The expansion of K-12 computer science education has led to an increasing effort in preparing in-service teachers to learn and teach CS through participation in micro credentials, professional development, and online certificate programs. In this study, we recruited five novice K-12 in-service teachers enrolled in an online CS certificate program and highlighted their strategies used in programming a Java assignment through a three-phase process of planning, monitoring and evaluation.
