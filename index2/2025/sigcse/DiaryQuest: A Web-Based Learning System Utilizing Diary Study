Diary studies are pivotal in enhancing student reflection and deepening understanding of subjects such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, traditional methods of diary entry analysis are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Based on Jixiang Fan's four-phase diary study model, we designed and implemented the new learning management system -- DiaryQuest. DiaryQuest is a web-based learning management system designed to address challenges in implementing diary studies within educational settings, especially in large classroom environments. It offers a streamlined approach by providing tools for educators to create diary assignments, track student submissions, and analyze entries using advanced methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and sentiment analysis. For students, it features an intuitive interface that includes progress tracking to ensure consistent and timely diary entries. The platform also incorporates interactive visualizations, such as word clouds and dynamic analytics tables, which allow educators to delve deeper into student insights and observations. These features make DiaryQuest an effective tool for managing diary studies, increasing engagement, and fostering a personalized and reflective learning experience. By simplifying the management and analysis of diary studies, DiaryQuest promotes a more interactive and productive educational environment, enabling students and educators to understand the learning material and each other better. This innovation enhances educational outcomes and prepares students with critical skills in data analysis and reflective thinking, which are essential for the HCI field.
