This poster introduces a curricular checklist designed to evaluate the quality of integrated computer science (CS) instructional materials, with a focus on ensuring equity and inclusivity in K-8 education. Early exposure to CS, especially through integrated learning in elementary and middle grades, can improve student outcomes and increase interest in CS, particularly among students from marginalized communities. However, implementing integrated CS lessons continues to face barriers such as the lack of high-quality instructional resources and limited guidance for educators. The checklist, developed from established curricular rubrics and refined through multiple iterations, contains 47 criteria organized across five key categories. Piloted with educators, the checklist addressed gaps in existing resources by providing clear, research-based guidance that supports novice and experienced educators. Feedback from educators led to refinements that improved the checklist's clarity and usability. The checklist offers a structured framework for lesson evaluation by simplifying the selection process and promoting equitable access to CS education.
