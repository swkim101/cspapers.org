For non-native English speakers, learning programming presents unique challenges, particularly in languages like Python, which heavily rely on English syntax and documentation. This study explores the challenges faced by non-native English-speaking Japanese university students enrolled in introductory Python programming courses. A survey was held to examined various aspects of their learning experience, including their programming proficiency, English fluency, use of translation tools, and the impact of bilingual resources on their learning. Clustering analysis was employed to group the participants into three distinct clusters: beginners, intermediate learners, and advanced learners. Cluster 0 (beginners) had low programming experience and English fluency, relying on non-English materials and translation tools. Cluster 1 (intermediate) showed moderate skills, using bilingual resources and translation aids. Cluster 2 (advanced) had higher proficiency but faced challenges with debugging and code optimization. Our findings highlight the need for tailored resources to support students navigating English-based programming environments.
