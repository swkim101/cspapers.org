While hackathons are often celebrated for their impact on participants, less attention has been given to the unique leadership development opportunities for the student organizers who create and run these events. Unlike traditional classroom settings, where leadership and collaboration skills are typically delayed until upper-level courses, hackathon organizers must tackle these challenges earlier on. In managing a large-scale, formative event, student organizers take on roles that require decision-making, teamwork, and project management. This poster explores the experiences of student organizers at Anonymous Hackathon, emphasizing how this informal learning opportunity complements gaps in the traditional computer science (CS) curriculum by fostering essential leadership and collaboration skills earlier in students' academic careers.
