Integrated Computer Science (CS) learning fosters the learning of CS concepts and skills within the context of a non-CS discipline, offering an avenue to expand equitable access to high-quality K-8 CS education. However, prior research has identified a lack of curriculum as a barrier to integrated CS implementation and in existing curriculum, gaps in CS concept coverage. This indicates a need for both refinement of existing and the creation of new integrated CS learning experiences. CS learning experiences are often designed by adults, with little input from students until the (re-)design is complete. Intergenerational participatory design offers methods to center students' voices earlier in the design process, rather than at its completion. However, scholars have mostly studied intergenerational participatory design in the context of families. Since classroom contexts differ greatly from familial contexts, we investigated the opportunities and challenges that could emerge when incorporating intergenerational participatory design techniques in a team comprised of both students and teachers. We hope to get feedback on this approach at SIGCSE 2025 as this study moves from a preliminary pilot to a full study.
