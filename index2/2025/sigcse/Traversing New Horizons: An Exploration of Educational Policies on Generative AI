Understanding how tertiary academic institutions approach the integration of generative AI (GAI) into their course policies is crucial since AI technologies are rapidly transforming society. AI is being used and applied across sectors and industries, and it is important to do so with regard to ethics. This exploratory study sought to examine how GAI policies were discussed across academic institutions. The policies were analyzed using NLP techniques and utilized existing publicly available datasets, which consisted of a collection of over 100 university policies and syllabi policies. Unsupervised clustering techniques were applied to analyze patterns in how different institutions may express their policies and best practices. These findings illuminate how universities and colleges may approach topics and challenges around AI, and specifically GAI.
