There is a wealth of evidence that involving undergraduate students in research has positive impacts in a variety of areas, from representation and retention to outcomes and self-efficacy. However, developing and growing an undergraduate research program can be daunting, especially for institutions that do not have a large existing research enterprise. In this work, we detail a program that revolves around student-developed literature maps to help students gain the ability to read and assess research papers in a way that is accessible, robust, and requires relatively little faculty overhead. We further detail how this program has been run through 4 iterations, with a total of 47 students producing 5 posters or short papers, and 3 full papers. In this work, we provide our experiences using literature mapping projects to boot-strap an undergraduate research program and provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the students who have participated. All of the materials, including sample spreadsheets, and scripts to generate LaTeX tables and figures are included for anyone wishing to undertake a literature mapping project of their own.
