Theory of Computing (ToC) courses have important connections to other CS courses as ToC is a foundation for them. ToC course grading schemes often involve mostly exams, and sometimes a small weight for traditional assignments. Recent work experimented with a "mock conference'' project where students write up solutions to ToC problems as if they were submitting them to a "real'' CS conference. In this poster we give our experiences in scaffolding this existing project idea.
