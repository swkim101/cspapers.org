Despite evidence of its effectiveness, Peer Instruction (PI) has not been widely adopted by undergraduate computing instructors. In PI, an instructor displays a hard multiple-choice question that students answer individually, then discuss their answer with peers, then answer again, and finally an instructor leads a discussion of the question. Even though the benefits of PI are well documented, it can be difficult to convince computing instructors to move away from passive lectures. Major reasons why instructors do not adopt PI include a lack of awareness, lack of time, and concerns over their ability to cover content. We hypothesized that we could encourage the adoption of PI by creating Peer+, a free tool in an ebook platform, a searchable question bank, and running summer instructor workshops. We offered a three-day in-person summer workshop to a total of 37 instructors in 2022 and 2023. Instructors completed a pre-survey, immediate post-survey, and a follow-up post survey after the fall semester. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 instructors. On the immediate post-survey most (33/37, 89%) instructors reported that they were very likely or likely to use the tool in the fall. However, on the follow-up survey, less than a quarter (6/26, 23%) actually did. The number one reason for not using the tool was a lack of time (18/26, 69%). Notably, all of the instructors who used Peer+ planned to use it again. This work informs efforts to increase the adoption of evidence-based pedagogical approaches in computing.
