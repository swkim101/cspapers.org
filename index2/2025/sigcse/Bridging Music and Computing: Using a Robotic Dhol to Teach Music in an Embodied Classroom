This study explores interdisciplinary interactions between learning through the Arts and Computer Science in an embodied classroom. Improving Computing Literacy at a young age has incredible benefits, especially with the increasing adoption of Artificial intelligence. This research study explores Music as a pathway to Computer Science (CS) by engaging middle and high school students in an after-school program with a musical robot. Learning modules introduce CS concepts such as algorithm design, problem decomposition and debugging. A preliminary study in our lab showed that Music and CS can intersect when discussing concepts like looping and debugging. Results from the study showed that interest in CS and getting feedback in the form of music had a significant impact in learning. The musical instrument used in this study is called a Dhol (Punjabi Folk Percussion-based Musical Instrument). This is a double-headed drum that is a landmark in the energetic world of Bhangra (Punjabi Dance). Originating from the Punjab region of South Asia, it is often used in celebratory events like festivals, gatherings and Bhangra performances. We measure interactions, interest and learning through pre-and post-tests alongside semi-structured interviews and explore identity formation through this process. Middle and high-school-aged students are invited to participate in this mixed-methods case study research based on whether they have little to no experience playing the Dhol.
