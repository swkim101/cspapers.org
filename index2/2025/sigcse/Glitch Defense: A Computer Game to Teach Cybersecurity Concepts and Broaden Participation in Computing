In this poster we introduce Glitch Defense, an educational computer game designed to teach basic cybersecurity concepts. This work aims to educate traditionally underrepresented communities on basic cybersecurity concepts. We also intend to promote interest in STEM careers, particularly Computer Science. Hence, broadening participation in computing and potentially improving the conditions for upward social mobility that technical careers afford. The implementation of the game is complete, and we have developed a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in partnership with local middle schools. Metrics collected from game play sessions, as well as observational data and user surveys, will be used to improve and expand the game to ensure that it adequately addresses community needs and increases interest in computing careers. The main contribution of this work is the development and evaluation of an innovative mechanism to make cybersecurity education more engaging and accessible, improving conditions to broaden participation in computing.
