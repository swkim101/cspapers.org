Generative AI and other emerging technologies are significantly impacting the work of software engineers. This impact is not re- stricted to programming; rather it has permeated multiple phases in the software development pipeline. As such, it is increasingly important to understand and analyze the changing work of the AI-enabled software developers who work at the cutting edge of AI Integration. This poster shares the ''Profile of the AI-enhanced Software Engineer'' developed in collaboration between Education Development Center (EDC) and Google. The profile describes in detail the work goals and associated tasks; and the skills, knowledge and attributes needed to do that work effectively. The poster will also share a framework for prompting used by skilled AI-enhanced software engineers across a variety of tasks. Though rapid change is predicted for the field, the Profile can inform K-20 CS and AI education efforts as well as workforce development of the current state of the field and stimulate discussion of how best to prepare for and adapt to the future of work.
