The landscape of education is shifting rapidly. Recent trends reveal declining student numbers and rising learner neurodiversity, leading to historically high college dropout rates, especially in computer science. Educators face challenges of a tech-driven era, shorter attention spans, and changing demographics, where students expect meaningful, discovery-based learning. In computer science, abstract concepts require focus, and traditional methods often fall short. Gamified learning apps, blending game design with education, have emerged as a promising solution. However, gamification must be carefully tailored to resonate with diverse learners. Aristotle's three unities of classic drama-action, place, and time-offer a fresh way to reshape teaching strategies, creating immersive experiences for classrooms and homework. The Aristotelian Way was first introduced at ACM MoDELS'22 Educators Symposium. A digital remake can be watched https://youtu.be/fLoV7TiLIew. This approach now pairs with AI tools to help educators craft personalized teaching paths. The tutorial explores how classic drama principles and AI-via the LightCode platform-can create compelling gamified learning experiences. This method addresses today's diverse student needs, ensuring education stays engaging and relevant. The LightCode Erasmus+ Project (Nr. 2022-1-FR01-KA220-HED-00086863) is co-funded by the European Union. More than a traditional pedagogical shift, this approach exemplifies what passionate educators can achieve through focused efforts while embracing a universal perspective. By overcoming the curse of knowledge, educators can guide students through the knowledge maze using a compass grounded in three simple metrics: action, space, and time.
