Although there is extensive research on what makes K-12 teacher computer science (CS) professional development (PD) effective, little attention has been given to how PD providers prefer to collect and report data. A platform that met the needs of teachers while also simultaneously meeting the needs of funding bodies could be powerful in answering questions about participation and experiences in CS PD. Our research question for this study was: Which features and types of data do teachers find most important to include in a platform designed to record data related to their engagement with PD? We used an exploratory-sequential mixed methods approach that included focus groups and a survey created from an analysis of the data from the focus groups. The three most desired features included adding information about the subject/topics targeted by the CS PD offerings for the CS PD they took, the grade levels targeted by the CS PD offering, and the number of training hours, points, and/or CEU credits earned or available to be earned by each CS PD offering taken. The three least desired features included having the capability to enter data about non-CS PDs teachers have completed, adding QR codes for entering data about participation in a CS PD, and capability to see other teachers who signed up for a CS PD. While we will use this data to inform the development of the platform, this study is significant as states can leverage this knowledge as they create their own systems for creating platforms for teachers within their own states.
