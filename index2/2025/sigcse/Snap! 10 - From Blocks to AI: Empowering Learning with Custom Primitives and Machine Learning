This year's Snap! 10 release marks a major leap forward, bringing advanced machine learning capabilities directly into the hands of students and educators. Version 10 introduces support for building ML models, including single-layer perceptrons, making it easier than ever for students to explore AI concepts within a block-based environment. These updates are accompanied by the ability to define Snap! primitives using Snap! blocks themselves, empowering users to deeply customize and extend the language. Building on the rich foundation of previous versions, Snap! 10 also includes hundreds of improvements aimed at enhancing both the classroom and the individual learning experience. These include quality-of-life updates such as new debugging tools, dynamic runtime access via the ''this'' reporter, and expanded support for working with dictionaries and APIs. In this demo, we'll showcase the exciting new features in Snap! 10, focusing on how they can be used to engage students in advanced topics like machine learning, data science, and computational thinking. Attendees will learn how to leverage these tools to build custom experiences that meet the evolving needs of their classrooms.
