We describe the implementation of a flexible grading scheme in a large introductory computer science course, where students were given the option to be assessed through a traditional final project or a technical interview. The technical interview, modeled after real-world coding interviews, allowed students to practice and demonstrate both their problem-solving and communication skills under pressure. In this report, we outline the structure of the assessment, the preparation provided to students, and the opportunities for practice interviews aimed at reducing performance anxiety. We also present key observations regarding student performance and motivation, with data indicating higher engagement among non-CS majors and increased autonomy, involvement, and satisfaction overall. The experience highlights both the benefits and challenges of offering such an assessment in a large class setting, providing valuable insights for educators considering similar approaches to evaluation.
