The Department of Computer Science at Hochschule Hannover, Germany, offers students an intriguing practical project that allows them to gain experience in a simulated and protected working environment. This environment provides students with the opportunity to assume responsibilities and exercise autonomy. The project, entitled "StudyTalk", requires students to develop and manage a communication and social networking software in a simulated business environment. In contrast to the conventional approach of instructors delineating precise specifications and objectives, students are empowered to determine their desired outcomes, including the characteristics and structure of the software. However, they are also accountable for ensuring the successful realization of these elements. Moreover, the StudyTalk project is distinctive in that the resulting product is designed and implemented by students for other students. This poster presents our three years of experience with this practical project in the interdisciplinary study program "Media Design Computing", which was developed in accordance with the curricular requirements for practical projects in the final phase of study. During this period, multiple project teams of students iteratively developed a high-quality, ready-to-use software system. Simulation-based learning represents a compromise between higher education teaching and internships in companies, providing a basis for students to enhance the skills they have acquired during their studies. The publication aims to demonstrate how practical projects can be organised in a simulated, protected business environment. It is hoped that other instructors will find inspiration for their own implementation of this approach.
