This tutorial for CS0/1/2 instructors will explore how to use the Vizard IDE from Worldviz to teach CS topics via virtual reality projects in Python. Participants will work with free versions of the Vizard IDE to learn how to motivate concepts ranging from CS-0-1-2 topics such as iteration, data structures, and object orientation, to topics in virtual reality and 3D data visualization. This tutorial assumes no background in virtual reality or game design, but does assume knowledge of Python. Participants must bring their own laptops. Vizard runs on Windows platforms only. It also runs well on common Windows emulators on MacOS laptops. Headsets are optional. Three laptops with a headset will be made available for participants to preview sample projects. Participants will receive a set of sample programs discussed in the tutorial.
