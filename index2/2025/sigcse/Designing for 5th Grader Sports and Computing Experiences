In lieu of ongoing efforts to broaden participation in computing education, we explore a curriculum that integrates sports and computer science, aiming to engage students by drawing on their experiences in both domains. Through an in-school implementation with 5th-grade learners, we examine their engagement by analyzing their attitudes toward sports and computing. Using clustering analysis of student survey responses, we identify four distinct groups, each reflecting different motivations tied to the integration of sports. Our findings highlight how the curriculum's design provided varying levels of access to computer science for different groups of learners.
