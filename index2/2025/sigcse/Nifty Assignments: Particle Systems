In this CS2 assignment, students use a linked list to implement a particle system, a collection of graphical particles that move around the screen. Each particle has its own color, position, and velocity. By creating and moving thousands of particles, students can build scenes like a water fountain, an erupting volcano, a snowy day, a fireworks show, etc. In completing the assignment, students practice writing core operations on linked lists: appending items, removing items, and mutating a list during iteration. It works well for a CS2 course with an audience of both majors and nonmajors: majors gain experience with traditional linked list manipulation, and nonmajors get to work on an intrinsically-motivating graphics program.
