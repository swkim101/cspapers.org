This poster introduces ChartCode, a cloud-based tool designed for introductory programming courses that enables students to code by interacting with flowcharts. With a simple web interface, ChartCode allows users to create and modify flowcharts, translating them into code in real-time for multiple programming languages. The tool supports a wide range of statements, including simple statements and control flow structures. Additionally, ChartCode generates syntax trees for expressions, providing a deeper understanding of syntax. The tool can also be tailored for assessments focused on practicing specific programming constructs. By bridging visual learning and coding, ChartCode offers an accessible and flexible environment for beginners to learn programming.
