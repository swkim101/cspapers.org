We improved on our peer-instruction approach to supplementary education sessions for CS1 by building on prior work in the Computer Science Education community for weekly review sessions. In this iteration, we adapted our materials from Java-only to include Python, and we studied students' learning gains, motivation, and sense of belonging to the field of Computer Science. This poster shares with the community our materials and lessons learned about important session features from the initial data analysis. Learning gain information was collected by recording results of peer instruction questions during each session. The learning gain information supported our validation of efficacy of the peer-instruction approach and of the requirement that the questions used be created by an experienced instructor, as expected from previous work. Motivation and sense of belonging was measured by surveys during the course of the semester. We made four conclusions from survey data we collected. First, incentives in the form of quiz re-takes notably increased attendance. Second, students who did not attend the review sessions had a greater sense of belonging, likely because many of them were not struggling. Third, the primary reason students reported not attending is that they did not see value in attending, possibly because they have a greater sense of belonging than students who attended. Finally, the average sense of belonging increased in the course of the semester in students who identified with she/her pronouns and ever-attended our review sessions.
