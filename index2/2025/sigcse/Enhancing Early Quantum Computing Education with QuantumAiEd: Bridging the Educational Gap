Quantum computing (QC) offers unprecedented computational power for solving complex problems in various domains. However, there is a significant gap in accessible QC educational resources for young learners, particularly at the high school and undergraduate levels. Early exposure to quantum concepts is crucial for cultivating future innovators. Moreover, QC education is often limited to institutions with higher resources. As QC is anticipated to become mainstream and disrupt many industries, the demand for a skilled, diverse workforce in QC will rise significantly. Current QC educational tools either only touch on surface-level concepts, relying on gamified concepts without depth, or are too advanced, requiring extensive mathematical and quantum physics backgrounds. To address this, QuantumAiEd bridges the educational gap by offering personalized, accessible QC education, ensuring inclusivity, and preparing a diverse future workforce. QuantumAiEd is an AI-based platform that bridges the educational gap by providing personalized, accessible QC education. AI chatbots have shown promise in personalized learning, but their application in QC education remains underexplored. QuantumAiEd offers interactive learning through AI-generated content, short quizzes, and immediate feedback, dynamically adapting to individual needs and making complex concepts more approachable. A preliminary study with 20 students showed that QuantumAiEd improves understanding and engagement, increasing performance after revisiting incorrectly answered concepts. The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S) also indicated a positive user experience. This study demonstrates the potential of AI-powered platforms to democratize QC education and address existing educational gaps.
