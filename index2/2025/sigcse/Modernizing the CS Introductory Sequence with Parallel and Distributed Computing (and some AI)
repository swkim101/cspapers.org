Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) has become pervasive in all aspects of computing, so it is essential that students include parallelism and distribution in the computational thinking that they apply to problem solving, from the beginning of their computing education. With all computing devices that students use having multiple cores as well as a GPU in many cases, many students' favorite applications use multiple cores and/or distributed processors. However, we are still teaching them to solve problems using only sequential thinking. Why? This hands-on tutorial will demonstrate how easy it is to open students' eyes to exploiting concurrency in problem solving. You will participate in plugged and unplugged activities that will help students to recognize examples of PDC concepts and concurrency in the world around them. We introduce plugged and unplugged curriculum modules that have been successfully integrated in existing computing classes at multiple institutions. We will also discuss recent efforts at integrating AI methods, including LLMs, into introductory classes. A laptop capable of running a C/C++ compiler, a Java virtual environment, and a Python interpreter is needed to fully participate in activities. However, attendees may learn the core concepts without a laptop. The activities and curriculum modules have been used successfully to teach PDC concepts in early computing courses and will be available after the workshop. Participants will receive a stipend of 400 to defray their cost of registration and one-night hotel stay. The CDER center will also have a booth in the exhibition hall for additional support.
