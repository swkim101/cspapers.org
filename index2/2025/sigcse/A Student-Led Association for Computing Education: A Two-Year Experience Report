Student-led organizations for computing are becoming more commonplace in large universities, ranging from chapters of larger organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers or the ACM Student Chapter to campus-based local groups. However, student organizations dedicated to computing education remain uncommon. Compared to existing resources such as computing-focused clubs, TA training, and research seminars, a computing education-focused organization offers peer-to-peer pedagogical training and education-focused resources so that members are conscientious of both the way that computing is taught and their own positionality in the field. This experience report details the founding, implementation, and impact of one such student-led organization, whose primary goal is to create an inclusive community of practice centered on computing education by serving as an intermediary between students, faculty, and researchers. We present the successes and challenges of running this organization so that students, particularly undergraduates interested in computing education, may undertake similar initiatives at their own institutions. Further, we hope that this report will also provide guidance for faculty and departmental staff in effectively supporting these student-led organizations.
