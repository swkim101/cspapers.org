This tutorial is for CS1 teachers and introduces a novel online compiler that emphasizes the coding process. In a CS1 class, a key to effective learning lies in identifying students' productive and less-productive coding habits. One way to gain such insights is to review the steps students take while coding. Therefore, students need coding tools that collect and display data about their working process. This tutorial introduces CS1 teachers to Process Feedback, a free online compiler that makes the coding process transparent. It enables students to explore their working process so they can self-reflect and learn. By focusing on the process, students are motivated to excel not only in their final code but also in how they approach coding. Analyzing process data also helps students develop critical thinking and metacognitive skills. The compiler also translates compiler-generated error messages to plain English explanations, enabling students to use AI in a safeguarded manner. During the tutorial, participants will learn how they can integrate the Process Feedback compiler into their courses and how their students can use it. The online compiler is available at www.processfeedback.org, and students do not need to create an account to use it. Participants are expected to bring their laptops to the tutorial.
