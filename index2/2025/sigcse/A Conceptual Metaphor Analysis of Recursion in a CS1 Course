Metaphors are powerful tools often used by instructors in CS1 courses to bridge abstract ideas and concrete student understanding. This study applies Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) to analyze how instructors and students conceptualize and communicate recursion through metaphor. We analyzed transcripts from three 50-minute lectures on recursion and surveys from 34 students in a CS1 course. We identified metaphorical expressions and derived conceptual metaphors from instructor lecture transcripts. We then compare student survey responses to these conceptual metaphors. Our analysis revealed several prevalent conceptual metaphors used by instructors for recursion. Student responses showed varying degrees of alignment, suggesting some metaphors do not resonate and may be misinterpreted. This work leverages CMT to provide insights into how recursion is taught and understood. This can help instructors become more conscious of their implicit metaphorical language and reveal insights into student understanding.
