College Board is in the final stages of rolling out changes to the APÂ® Computer Science A course and exam for 2025--2026. This is routine, in the sense that such revisions occur periodically to maintain the course alignment, but in this instance some of the changes are fairly substantial. Early announcements of the general plans have reliably generated much discussion and many questions, both in formal presentations and on social media. We are convening this panel as a way to connect the SIGCSE community directly with some of the people involved in devising and implementing the updates. Each of the panel members has a long history with the AP program and community and we are eager to show everyone what to expect, and to answer questions about what is coming.
