The popularity of autograding has grown due to increasing class sizes and the need to reduce grading load while ensuring quality. Autograding has conventionally been used for multiple choice and fill in the blank questions, or to check code correctness. In this work, we discuss the use of autograders at UBC and some non-conventional autograding implementations in our curricula. We reflect upon our autograder use in our courses and discuss the benefits, implications, and considerations of this pedagogical choice.
