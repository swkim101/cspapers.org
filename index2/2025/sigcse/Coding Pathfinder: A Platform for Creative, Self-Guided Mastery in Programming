We present Coding Pathfinder, a platform to help non-programmers learn to code for a specific purpose. This paper explores how we can scaffold generative AI to provide structure and ensure mastery in informal learning settings, introducing a new approach to coding education. In the current iteration of Pathfinder, a user describes the coding task that they are working on. After collecting some details and scoping the project, Pathfinder identifies the skills that the user will master upon successful completion of the project. It then assesses which of the skills our users already has, and designs a personalised learning journey. The guided journey consists of instructions, explanations, tasks and videos. We also incorporate a chat feature so users can ask questions and engage as if they are working with a tutor.
