Modern society has a compelling need for computer science (CS) graduates to have sufficient knowledge and skills in Security. The recently released Computer Science Curricula 2023 (CS2023) by the ACM, IEEE Computer Society, and AAAI has a revamped Security knowledge area that inherently aims to make security unavoidable in a program curriculum. That is, by incorporating appropriate topics from the CS2023 Security Area, a CS program can prepare graduates capable of designing and developing secure computing infrastructure for modern societal functioning As there are challenges in modifying existing CS program curricula, proposing security-related changes is easier said than done. This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session addresses this very point. It is meant for educators and administrators interested in improving the security content of CS program coursework and incorporating additional content as needed. For course packaging, the CS2023 Security Area outlined two approaches: (1) infuse security content into existing coursework, or (2) use an additional course dedicated to security. Led by the presenter, the BoF participants will review these two approaches and evaluate the pluses and minuses of each, keeping their programs in mind. The BoF will be considered successful if the participants feel prepared to begin to increase security content in their CS programs.
