Quantum Computing is typically the realm of upper-division undergraduate or graduate level university courses, taught with substantial higher-level mathematics, and taught by domain experts. More intuitive methods of teaching concepts, such as a visual representation, online game, physical card game, and hands-on activities have been developed more recently to allow K-12 and university to learn and teach such content. In this tutorial, we tailor content to novices who know nothing about quantum computing so they can confidently run activities in their classrooms or at outreach events. We teach using a combination of slides, hands-on activities, games and elementary Python programming to provide a variety of learning opportunities and build familiarity with different avenues for teaching.
