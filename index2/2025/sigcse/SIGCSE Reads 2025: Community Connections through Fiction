Have you read any of the common reads for SIGCSE 2025? Now's your chance to talk about them (or other science fiction)! Our novel selection, Light from Uncommon Stars, by Ryka Aoki (https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250789075/lightfromuncommonstars), and a short story with a long title by Pittsburgh author Timons Esaias, "Excerpts from the Text of an Explanatory Stele Erected for our Edification by the Scholars of the Outer Orion Tendril" (https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/esaias0921/) will be featured, but we welcome all book discussion. If you're interested in books, whether on a personal, academic, or pedagogical level, come join us in this BoF and discuss one or more of the books and short story. We'll provide potential topics and discussion questions targeting how to incorporate these books into a CS course, but the discussion will be open. The BoF will close with a discussion of potential books and stories for the 2026 conference.
