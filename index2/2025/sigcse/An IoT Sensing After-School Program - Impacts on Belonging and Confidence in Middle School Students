This paper describes the design and findings from a 15 week after-school program offered to middle-school students that covered a variety of computer science and engineering topics. Students in the program completed a short survey before and after the program conclusion that measured their sense of belonging, confidence, interest, and more in both fields. Throughout the program, students learned and applied skills in emerging areas in both computer science and engineering. Students then applied these skills to create a micro air-quality sensor that would allow their community to have a better understanding of their local air quality. Our initial quantitative results from the survey indicate little impact on the students. However, when examining the open questions from the students, it is more clear that there was indeed a positive impact with students. We also describe our experiences in providing the program and what changes we would make for future offerings.
