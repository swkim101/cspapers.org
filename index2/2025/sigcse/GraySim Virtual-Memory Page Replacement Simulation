A foundational component of any Operating Systems course is the exploration of virtual memory, and a key topic within virtual memory is page replacement. Traditionally, teaching this topic has involved static methods such as descriptions, diagrams, and worksheets. This poster introduces GraySim to support students learning about page replacement policies. Students use the simulation to explore different policies, placing pages into frames according to the selected policy. In response, GraySim provides corrective feedback and also displays the correct solution. This poster presents the findings of a qualitative study aimed at evaluating the usability of GraySim's page replacement simulation.
