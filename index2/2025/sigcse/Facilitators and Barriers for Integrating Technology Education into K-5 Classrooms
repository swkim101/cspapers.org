In recent years, grade K-5 teachers have increasingly integrated computer science instruction into different subject areas. To identify strategies to support K-5 teachers in providing computer science instruction, it is crucial to understand the primary challenges and facilitators that they experience. This study surveyed 1,054 teachers from diverse Texas schools and identified key supports and barriers to integrating new state technology education standards in K-5 classrooms. Teachers completed a survey before participating in a professional development program. The teachers identified facilitators to integrating the standards into their instruction, such as access to technology, professional development, and administrator support. They also shared barriers such as time constraints, lack of curriculum and training, and insufficient technology infrastructure. The findings underscore the need for stronger teacher support systems, including improved resources, more targeted professional development, and enhanced administrator buy-in, to ensure all K-5 students benefit from comprehensive technology education.
