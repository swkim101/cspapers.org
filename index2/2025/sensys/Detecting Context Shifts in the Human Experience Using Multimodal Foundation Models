Detecting context shifts in human experience is critical for applications in cognitive modeling, human-AI interaction, and adaptive neurotechnology. However, formalizing and identifying these shifts in real-world settings remains challenging due to annotation inconsistencies, data sparsity, and the multimodal nature of human perception. In this poster, we explore the use of multimodal foundation models for detecting context shifts by leveraging neural, wearable, and environmental sensors. Initial findings from a neuroscience-driven annotation study highlight discrepancies in human-labeled transitions, emphasizing the need for a model-driven approach. Given the limited availability of labeled datasets, we examine: 1) Surrogate models trained on synthetic datasets, 2) Sensor fusion techniques to align real-world neural and behavioral signals, and 3) The role of foundation models in interpreting multimodal context shifts. We outline key challenges in sensor data alignment, inter-rater variability, and transfer learning from synthetic to real-world data.
