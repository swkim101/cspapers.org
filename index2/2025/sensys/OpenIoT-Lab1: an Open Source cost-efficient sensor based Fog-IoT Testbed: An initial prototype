The need for reliable test environments grows as IoT applications become more complex. The hardware testbeds are crucial for evaluating network protocols, device interoperability, security mechanisms, and performance optimization. However, because of the growing demand, most state-of-the-art IoT testbeds are either not available or are costly and are not open-source for reproduction. In this paper, we propose OpenIoT-Lab1, which uses low-cost devices, and with its code available online, it can be easily reproduced at scale in various industries and academic institutions to support research in sensor networks and Fog/IoT networks.
