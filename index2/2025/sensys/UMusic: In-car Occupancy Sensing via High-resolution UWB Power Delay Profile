Occupancy sensing is essential for vehicle safety and security applications such as seat belt reminders, airbag deployment, intrusion detection, and child-left-behind alerts. This paper presents UMusic, a novel in-car occupancy sensing system that reuses the ultra-wideband (UWB) devices already installed for access control in modern vehicles. However, due to the compact size and metal structure, the in-car environment is full of reflected propagation paths, which cannot be precisely resolved even with UWB's wide-bandwidth feature. To overcome this challenge, UMusic introduces a reflected-path decomposition technique to extract a high-resolution power delay profile (PDP) from the channel impulse response (CIR) provided by commodity UWB devices, enabling precise environmental perception. By comparing PDPs in empty and occupied conditions, UMusic is able to detect the occupancy status in both a sedan and an SUV with multiple passengers across various scenarios. Our results show that UMusic achieves a 90.2% detection rate using a single CIR measurement collected within 50 ms, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 15.7%. When aggregating six consecutive CIR measurements, UMusic reaches 99.4% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world deployment.
