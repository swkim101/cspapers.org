Accurate leaf wetness detection is essential to understanding plant health and growth conditions. The mmWave radar, with its sensitivity to subtle changes, is well-suited for leaf wetness detection. Existing mmWave-based approaches utilize the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) algorithm to generate image-like inputs and rely on multi-modality fusion with an RGB camera to classify leaf wetness. However, the lack of understanding of SAR-based mmWave imaging limits its accuracy in various environments. This paper presents Proteus, a novel way of understanding mmWave SAR imaging. We design a noise reduction algorithm to reduce speckle noise and improve image clarity for SAR-based mmWave imaging. Then, we incorporate phase angle data to enrich SAR texture information to capture high-resolution surface details, increasing informative features for precise wetness assessment in complex plant structures. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modality Teacher-Student network, using an RGB-based teacher model to guide the mmWave SAR-based student model for feature extraction. This network transfers the explicit knowledge in the RGB image domain to the mmWave image domain. We use commercial-off-the-shelf mmWave radar to prototype Proteus. The evaluation results show that Proteus achieves up to 96.3% accuracy across varied environmental scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
