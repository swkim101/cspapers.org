We present a demonstration of a wireless sensor network system to measure power output from nontraditional low-power energy sources. Our system has the necessary measurement fidelity for logging power traces and environmental data to a web based measurement portal and facilitates transition from in-lab experiments to the field. Our demonstration shows different use cases of our system by logging various energy sources: a soil-based microbial fuel cell, a prickly pear cactus, and a thermoelectric generator. A large screen will be used to continuously display live data traces.
