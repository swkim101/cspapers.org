For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we replace traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system designed for drone landings. To fully leverage the temporal consistency and spatial complementarity between these modalities, we propose two innovative modules, consistency-instructed collaborative tracking and graph-informed adaptive joint optimization, for accurate drone measurement extraction and efficient sensor fusion. Real-world experiments in landing scenarios from a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and latency.
