LoRa technology promises to enable Internet of Things applications over large geographical areas. However, its performance is often hampered by poor channel quality in urban environments, where blockage and multipath effects are prevalent. Our study uncovers that a slight shift in the position or attitude of the receiving antenna can substantially improve the received signal quality. This phenomenon can be attributed to the rich multipath characteristics of wireless signal propagation in urban environments, wherein even small antenna movement can alter the dominant signal path or reduce the polarization angular difference between transceivers. Leveraging these key observations, we propose and implement MoLoRa, an intelligent mobile antenna system designed to enhance LoRa packet reception. At its core, MoLoRa represents the position and attitude of an antenna as a state and employs a statistical optimization method to search for states that offer optimal signal quality efficiently. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that MoLoRa achieves a maximum Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gain of 13 dB in a few attempts, enabling formerly problematic blind spots to reconnect and strengthening links for other nodes.
