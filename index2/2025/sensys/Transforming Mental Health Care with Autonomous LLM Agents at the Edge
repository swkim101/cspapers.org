The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with mobile devices is set to transform mental health care accessibility and quality. This paper introduces MindGuard, an autonomous LLM agent that utilizes mobile sensor data and engages in proactive, personalized conversations while ensuring user privacy through local processing. Unlike traditional mental health AI tools, MindGuard enables real-time, context-aware interventions by dynamically adapting to users' emotional and physiological states. The real-world implementation demonstrates its effectiveness with the ultimate goal of creating an accessible, scalable, and personalized mental healthcare ecosystem for anyone with smart mobile devices.
