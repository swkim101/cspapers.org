In this paper, we propose an occlusion-resilient Ultra-Wideband (UWB) localization system by rethinking anchor placement. Typically, anchors are installed near the ceiling for broader line-of-sight (LOS) coverage. However, in crowded environments, practical ceiling heights often fail to maintain stable LOS. By placing anchors near the floor and leveraging ceiling reflections, we create a virtual anchor that extends LOS coverage. Experiments show our approach outperforms ceiling-mounted solutions in accuracy and resilience, opening new possibilities for practical UWB localization.
