The study investigates the effectiveness of a differential neural network architecture in ultrasonic tomography (UST) for industrial applications. The proposed model employs a dual-branch structure, where each branch independently processes identical input data before passing the outputs to a differential layer. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture residual components, improving the reconstruction of tomographic images. Experiments were conducted using a tomographic system with 16 transducers, generating training and validation datasets. Comparative analysis between a differential LSTM-based network and a standard LSTM model demonstrated that the differential architecture achieved superior reconstruction quality. The results confirm that this approach enhances accuracy, sharpness, and overall image clarity, making it a promising solution for improving UST image reconstruction.
