To guarantee the timing constraints of real-time IoT devices, engineers need to estimate the Worst-Case Execution Time. Such estimation is always very pessimistic and represents a condition that almost never occurs in practice. In this poster, we present a novel compiler-based approach that instruments the tasks to inform, at run-time, the operating system when non-worst-case branches are taken. The generated slack is then used to take better scheduling decisions.
