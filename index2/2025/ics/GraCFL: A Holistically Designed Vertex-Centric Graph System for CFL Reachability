Many program analyses can be formulated as context-free language (CFL) reachability problems on an edge-labeled graph. While graph systems have been proposed recently for large-scale CFL reachability analysis of system software, the design space has not yet been systematically explored, leading to sub-optimal performance. This work presents GraCFL 1 , a holistically designed graph system for CFL reachability. Inspired by the vertex-centric processing paradigm, we formalize CFL reachability using a multi-directional vertex-centric model. We then analyze this model in terms of computation redundancy, strategies for deriving new reachability, data locality, and parallelism. The analysis reveals a set of insights that guide the design of new techniques and optimizations to improve system performance. As a result of the systematic design, GraCFL demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art graph systems, with an average 14.14 × speedup over Graspan and 8.33 × speedup over POCR .
