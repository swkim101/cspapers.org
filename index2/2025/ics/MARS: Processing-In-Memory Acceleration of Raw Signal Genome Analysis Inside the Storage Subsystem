Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals. However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement. Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by 427x and 72x.
