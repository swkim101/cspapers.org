System-on-Chip (SoC) Clusters, i.e., servers consisting of many stacked mobile SoCs, have emerged as a popular platform for serving mobile cloud gaming. Sharing the underlying hardware and OS, these SoC Clusters enable native mobile games to be executed and rendered efﬁciently without modiﬁcation. However, the number of deployed game sessions is limited due to conservative deployment strategies and high GPU utilization in current game ofﬂoading methods. To address these challenges, we introduce SFG, the ﬁrst system that enables high-density mobile cloud gaming on SoC Clusters with two novel techniques: (1) It employs a resource-efﬁcient game partitioning and cross-SoC ofﬂoading design that maximally preserves GPU optimization intents in the standard graphics rendering pipeline; (2) It proposes an NPU-enhanced game partition coordination strategy to adjust game performance when co-locating partitioned and complete game sessions. Our evaluation of ﬁve Unity games shows that SFG achieves up to 4.5× higher game density than existing methods with trivial performance loss. Equally important, SFG extends the lifespan of SoC Clusters, enabling outdated SoC Clusters to serve new games that are unfeasible on a single SoC due to GPU resource shortages.
