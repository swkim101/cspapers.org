Recent advances in Information Retrieval have shown the effectiveness of embedding queries and documents in a latent high-dimensional space to compute their similarity. While operating on such high-dimensional spaces is effective, in this paper, we hypothesize that we can improve the retrieval performance by adequately moving to a query-dependent subspace. More in detail, we formulate the Manifold Clustering (MC) Hypothesis: projecting queries and documents onto a subspace of the original representation space can improve retrieval effectiveness. To empirically validate our hypothesis, we define a novel class of Dimension IMportance Estimators (DIME). Such models aim to determine how much each dimension of a high-dimensional representation contributes to the quality of the final ranking and provide an empirical method to select a subset of dimensions where to project the query and the documents. To support our hypothesis, we propose an oracle DIME, capable of effectively selecting dimensions and almost doubling the retrieval performance. To show the practical applicability of our approach, we then propose a set of DIMEs that do not require any oracular piece of information to estimate the importance of dimensions. These estimators allow us to carry out a dimensionality selection that enables performance improvements of up to +11.5% (moving from 0.675 to 0.752 nDCG@10) compared to the baseline methods using all dimensions. Finally, we show that, with simple and realistic active feedback, such as the user's interaction with a single relevant document, we can design a highly effective DIME, allowing us to outperform the baseline by up to +0.224 nDCG@10 points (+58.6%, moving from 0.384 to 0.608).
