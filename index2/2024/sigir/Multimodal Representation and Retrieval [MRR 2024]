Multimodal data is available in many applications like e-commerce production listings, social media posts and short videos. However, existing algorithms dealing with those types of data still focus on uni-modal representation learning by vision-language alignment and cross-modal retrieval. In this workshop, we target to bring a new retrieval problem where both queries and documents are multimodal. With the popularity of vision language modeling, large language models (LLMs), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal LLM, we see a lot of new opportunities for multimodal representation and retrieval tasks. This event will be a comprehensive half-day workshop focusing on the subject of multimodal representation and retrieval. The agenda includes keynote speeches, oral presentations, and an interactive panel discussion.
