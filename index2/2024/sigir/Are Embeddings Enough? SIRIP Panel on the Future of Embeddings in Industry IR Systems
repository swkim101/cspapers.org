The IR community as a whole is considering whether search and recommendations can move entirely to embedding-based technologies. This SIRIP panel discusses the future of embedding-based technologies in industry search given its broad range of document types, its specific query types, its performance requirements, and the features that accompany search. The panel comprises long-time industry experts and academics with industry ties. The panelists vary as to whether they believe that the industry in practice will move entirely to embeddings or will remain a hybrid domain.
