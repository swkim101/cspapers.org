Accurately evaluating the impact of scientific papers is crucial. However, existing methodologies face certain challenges, including latent factors affecting citation behaviors and dynamic intrinsic of citation networks. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework named CoDy (modeling scholarly Collaboration and temporal Dynamics in citation networks for impact prediction). CoDy strategically predicts author collaborations as an auxiliary task, forecasting not only the number of current collaborations between scholars but also the number of future collaborations among them. Besides, CoDy proposes a fine-grained temporal encoding module to model the multiple different temporal patterns for publication and citation. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate CoDy's effectiveness in predicting citation counts and classifying impact levels. In-depth analyses provide further validation of its reliability and robustness. CoDy can significantly enhance impact prediction by explicitly modeling collaboration and temporal patterns and offer valuable insights into paper impact formation.
