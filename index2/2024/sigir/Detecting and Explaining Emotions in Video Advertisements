The use of video advertisements is a common marketing strategy in today's digital age. Extensive research is conducted by companies to comprehend the emotions conveyed in video advertisements, as they play a crucial role in crafting memorable commercials. Understanding and explaining these abstract concepts in videos is an unsolved problem. There is a large body of work that tries to predict human emotion or activity from videos, however, this is not sufficient. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting and, most importantly, explaining emotions in video advertisements. Our framework consists of two main stages: emotion detection and explanation generation. We use a deep learning model to detect the underlying emotions of a video advertisement and generate visual explanations to give insight into our model's predictions. We demonstrate our system on a dataset of video advertisements and show that our framework can accurately detect and explain emotions in video advertisements. Our results suggest that our novel algorithm has the potential to explain decisions from any video classification model.
