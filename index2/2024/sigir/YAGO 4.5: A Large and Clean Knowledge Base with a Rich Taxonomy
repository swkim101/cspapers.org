Knowledge Bases (KBs) find applications in many knowledge-intensive tasks and, most notably, in information retrieval. Wikidata is one of the largest public general-purpose KBs. Yet, its collaborative nature has led to a convoluted schema and taxonomy. The YAGO 4 KB cleaned up the taxonomy by incorporating the ontology of Schema.org, resulting in a cleaner structure amenable to automated reasoning. However, it also cut away large parts of the Wikidata taxonomy, which is essential for information retrieval. In this paper, we extend YAGO 4 with a large part of the Wikidata taxonomy - while respecting logical constraints and the distinction between classes and instances. This yields YAGO 4.5, a new, logically consistent version of YAGO that adds a rich layer of informative classes. An intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation show the value of the new resource.
