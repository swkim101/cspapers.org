Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a crucial role in recommendation systems, with significant impact on user experience and platform revenue generation. Despite the various public CTR datasets available due to increasing interest from both academia and industry, these datasets have limitations. They cover a limited range of scenarios and predominantly focus on ID-based features, neglecting the vital role of multi-modal features for effective multi-scenario CTR prediction. Moreover, their scale is modest compared to real-world industrial datasets, hindering robust and comprehensive evaluation of complex models. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset named AntM2 C, built from real industrial data from Alipay. This dataset offers an impressive breadth and depth of information, covering CTR data from four diverse business scenarios, including advertisements, consumer coupons, mini-programs, and videos. Unlike existing datasets, AntM2 C provides not only ID-based features but also five textual features and one image feature for both users and items, supporting more delicate multi-modal CTR prediction. AntM2 C is also substantially larger than existing datasets, comprising 100 million CTR data. This scale allows for robust and comprehensive evaluation and comparison of CTR prediction models. We employ AntM2 C to construct several typical CTR tasks, including multi-scenario modeling, item and user cold-start modeling, and multi-modal modeling. Initial experiments and comparisons with baseline methods have shown that AntM2 C presents both new challenges and opportunities for CTR models, with the potential to significantly advance CTR research.
