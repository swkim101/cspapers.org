Buy It Again (BIA) recommendations are a crucial component in enhancing the customer experience and site engagement for retailers. In this paper, we build a short (S) and long (L) term Hawkes (H) process for each item and use it to obtain BIA recommendations for each customer. The challenges of deploying into a production environment including model scalability, an evolving item catalog, and real-time inference are discussed along with solutions such as model compression, frequency-based item filtering, training data sampling, data parallelization, parallel execution and microservice-based real-time recommendations. We significantly reduced model training time from roughly 250 hours to about 3 hours by applying the solutions, while serving real-time inference with less than 70ms latency. We compare our BIA model against state-of-the-art baselines using three publicly available datasets and provide results from A/B tests with millions of live customers. On 3 public datasets, our model outperforms SOTA baseline models in recall and NDCG metrics by around 85% and 10%, respectively, and in live A/B testing it exhibited more than 30% increase in click-through rate and roughly 30% revenue increase compared to other state of the art models.
