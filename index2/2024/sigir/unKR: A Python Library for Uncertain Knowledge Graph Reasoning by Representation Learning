Recently, uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs), where each relation between entities is associated with a confidence score, have gained much attention. Compared with traditional knowledge graphs, UKGs possess the capability of uncertainty knowledge expression, which facilitates more reliable and precise knowledge graph reasoning by not only completing missing triples but also predicting triple confidences. In this paper, we release unKR, the first open-source python library for uncertain Knowledge graph (UKG) Reasoning by representation learning. We design a unified framework to implement two types of representation learning models for UKG reasoning, i.e., normal and few-shot ones. Besides, we standardize the evaluation tasks and metrics for UKG reasoning to ensure fair comparisons, and report the detailed results of each model under the consistent test setting. With unKR, it is effortless for users to reproduce existing models, as well as efficiently customize their own models. The library, documentation, demo, and re-implementing results are all publicly released at https://github.com/seucoin/unKR.
