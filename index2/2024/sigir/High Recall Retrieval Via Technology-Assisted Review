High Recall Retrieval (HRR) tasks, including eDiscovery in the law, systematic literature reviews, and sunshine law requests focus on efficiently prioritizing relevant documents for human review.Technology-assisted review (TAR) refers to iterative human-in-the-loop workflows that combine human review with IR and AI techniques to minimize both time and manual effort while maximizing recall. This full-day tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to TAR. The morning session presents an overview of the key technologies and workflow designs used, the basics of practical evaluation methods, and the social and ethical implications of TAR deployment. The afternoon session provides more technical depth on the implications of TAR workflows for supervised learning algorithm design, how generative AI is can be applied in TAR, more sophisticated statistical evaluation techniques, and a wide range of open research questions.
