Semi-supervised cross-modal retrieval (SS-CMR) aims at learning modality invariance and semantic discrimination from labeled data and unlabeled data, which is crucial for practical applications in the real-world. The key to essentially addressing the SS-CMR task is to solve the semantic association and modality heterogeneity problems. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised cross-modal retrieval method, namely Semi-supervised Prototype Semantic Association Learning (SPAL) for robust cross-modal retrieval. To be specific, we employ shared semantic prototypes to associate labeled and unlabeled data over both modalities to minimize intra-class and maximize inter-class variations, thereby improving discriminative representations on unlabeled data. What is more important is that we propose a novel pseudo-label guided contrastive learning to refine cross-modal representation consistency in the common space, which leverages pseudo-label semantic graph information to constrain cross-modal consistent representations. Meanwhile, multi-modal data inevitably suffers from the cost and difficulty of data collection, resulting in the incomplete multimodal data problem. Thus, to strengthen the robustness of the SS-CMR, we propose a novel prototype propagation method for incomplete data to reconstruct completion representations which preserves the semantic consistency. Extensive evaluations using several baseline methods across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
