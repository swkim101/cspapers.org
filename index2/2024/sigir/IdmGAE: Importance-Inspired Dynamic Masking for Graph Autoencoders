Generative self-supervised learning, exemplified by masked graph autoencoders (GAEs), aims to reconstruct the masked graph characteristics, garnering increasing research interest and achieving promising results. Despite the progress made, existing research on masked GAEs predominantly relies on a random strategy to obscure input graph characteristics, disregarding the potential variability in node importance during the reconstruction process. In this study, we propose an efficient masking strategy termed importance-inspired dynamic masking to explore diverse node sampling. Our approach employs an auxiliary network to assess the importance of nodes within the graph. Subsequently, we derive sampling probabilities guided by the learned node importance. To enhance model training, we introduce a dynamic sampling strategy that adapts to nodes of varying importance across different training stages. This importance-inspired dynamic masking strategy empowers masked GAEs to acquire refined representations for graph-related tasks. We have conducted extensive experiments on node classification, which validate the efficacy of our proposed strategy.
