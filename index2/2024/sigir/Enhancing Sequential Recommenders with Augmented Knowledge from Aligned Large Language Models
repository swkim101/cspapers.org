Recommender systems are widely used in various online platforms. In the context of sequential recommendation, it is essential to accurately capture the chronological patterns in user activities to generate relevant recommendations. Conventional ID-based sequential recommenders have shown promise but lack comprehensive real-world knowledge about items, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to bridge this gap by leveraging the extensive real-world knowledge encapsulated in LLMs. However, integrating LLMs into sequential recommender systems comes with its own challenges, including inadequate representation of sequential behavior patterns and long inference latency. In this paper, we propose SeRALM (Enhancing Sequential Recommenders with Augmented Knowledge from Aligned Large Language Models) to address these challenges. SeRALM integrates LLMs with conventional ID-based sequential recommenders for sequential recommendation tasks. We combine text-format knowledge generated by LLMs with item IDs and feed this enriched data into ID-based recommenders, benefitting from the strengths of both paradigms. Moreover, we develop a theoretically underpinned alignment training method to refine LLMs' generation using feedback from ID-based recommenders for better knowledge augmentation. We also present an asynchronous technique to expedite the alignment training process. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that SeRALM significantly improves the performances of ID-based sequential recommenders. Further, a series of ablation studies and analyses corroborate SeRALM's proficiency in steering LLMs to generate more pertinent and advantageous knowledge across diverse scenarios.
