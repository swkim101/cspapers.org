During the past decades, healthcare institutions continually amassed clinical data that is not intended to support research. Despite the increasing number of publicly available electronic health record (EHR) datasets, it is difficult to find publicly available datasets in Orthopedics that can be used to compare and evaluate downstream tasks. This paper presents OEHR, a healthcare benchmark dataset in Orthopedics, sourced from the EHR of real hospitals. Information available includes patient measurements, diagnoses, treatments, clinical notes, and medical images. OEHR is intended to support clinical research. To evaluate the quality of OEHR, we conduct extensive experiments by implementing state-of-the-art methods for performing downstream tasks. The results show that OEHR serves as a valuable extension to existing publicly available EHR datasets. The dataset is available at http://47.94.174.82/.
