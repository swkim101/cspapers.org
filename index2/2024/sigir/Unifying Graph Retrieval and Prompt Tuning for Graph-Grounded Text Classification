Text classification has long time been researched as a fundamental problem in information retrieval. Since text data are frequently connected with graph structures, it poses new possibilities for a more accurate and explainable classification. One common approach of this graph-text integration is to consider text as graph attributes and utilize GNNs to conduct a node classification task. While both text and graph data are modeled, GNNs treat text in a rather coarse-grained way, have limitations in preserving the detailed structures of a graph, and are less robust to graph sparsity. In this paper, we propose to take an alternative perspective instead, viewing graph as the context of texts, as enlightened by retrieval augmented generation. We propose a novel framework called Graph Retrieval Prompt Tuning (GRPT), consisting of a Graph Retrieval Module and a Prompt Tuning Module integrated with graph context. For graph retrieval, two retrieval strategies are designed to retrieve node context and path context, preserving both node proximity and detailed connectivity patterns. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework in both standard supervised and sparse settings.
