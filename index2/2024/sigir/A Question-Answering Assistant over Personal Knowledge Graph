We develop a Personal Knowledge Graph Question-Answering (PKGQA) assistant, seamlessly integrating information from multiple mobile applications into a unified and user-friendly query interface to offer users convenient information retrieval and personalized knowledge services. Based on a fine-grained schema customized for PKG, the PKGQA system in this paper comprises Symbolic Semantic Parsing, Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) Semantic Matching, and Neural Semantic Parsing modules, which are designed to take into account both accuracy and efficiency. The PKGQA system achieves high accuracy on the constructed dataset and demonstrates good performance in answering complex questions. Our system is implemented through an Android application, which is shown in https://youtu.be/p732U5KPEq4.
