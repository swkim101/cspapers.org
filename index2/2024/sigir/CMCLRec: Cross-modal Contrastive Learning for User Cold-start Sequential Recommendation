Sequential recommendation models generate embeddings for items through the analysis of historical user-item interactions and utilize the acquired embeddings to predict user preferences. Despite being effective in revealing personalized preferences for users, these models heavily rely on user-item interactions. However, due to the lack of interaction information, new users face challenges when utilizing sequential recommendation models for predictions, which is recognized as the cold-start problem. Recent studies, while addressing this problem within specific structures, often neglect the compatibility with existing sequential recommendation models, making seamless integration into existing models unfeasible.To address this challenge, we propose CMCLRec, a Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning framework for user cold-start RECommendation. This approach aims to solve the user cold-start problem by customizing inputs for cold-start users that align with the requirements of sequential recommendation models in a cross-modal manner. Specifically, CMCLRec adopts cross-modal contrastive learning to construct a mapping from user features to user-item interactions based on warm user data. It then generates a simulated behavior sequence for each cold-start user in turn for recommendation purposes. In this way, CMCLRec is theoretically compatible with any extant sequential recommendation model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets substantiate that, compared with state-of-the-art baseline models, CMCLRec markedly enhances the performance of conventional sequential recommendation models, particularly for cold-start users.
