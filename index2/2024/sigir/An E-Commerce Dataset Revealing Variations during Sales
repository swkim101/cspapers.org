Since the development of artificial intelligence technology, E-Commerce has gradually become one of the world's largest commercial markets. Within this domain, sales events, which are based on sociological mechanisms, play a significant role. E-Commerce platforms frequently offer sales and promotions to encourage users to purchase items, leading to significant changes in live environments. Learning-To-Rank (LTR) is a crucial component of E-Commerce search and recommendations, and substantial efforts have been devoted to this area. However, existing methods often assume an independent and identically distributed data setting, which does not account for the evolving distribution of online systems beyond online finetuning strategies. This limitation can lead to inaccurate predictions of user behaviors during sales events, resulting in significant loss of revenue. In addition, models must readjust themselves once sales have concluded in order to eliminate any effects caused by the sales events, leading to further regret. To address these limitations, we introduce a long-term E-Commerce search data set specifically designed to incubate LTR algorithms during such sales events, with the objective of advancing the capabilities of E-Commerce search engines. Our investigation focuses on typical industry practices and aims to identify potential solutions to address these challenges.
