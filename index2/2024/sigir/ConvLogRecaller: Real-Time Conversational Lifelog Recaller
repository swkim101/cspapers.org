The popularization of networks fosters the convenience of communication. People can easily share their life experiences and thoughts with relatives and friends via instant messaging software. As time passes, individuals may forget certain details of life events, leading to difficulties in effectively communicating with others. The propensity of individuals to forget or mix up life events highlights the importance of services aimed at retrieving information about past experiences. This paper presents a conversational information recall system, ConvLogRecaller, which proactively supports real-time memory recall assistance during online conversations. Given a conversation of the user with others, ConvLogRecaller suggests a message if the user forgets the details of the life experiences. The services provided by our system can avoid hesitations or memory lapses that might hinder the efficiency of a conversation.
