Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) continues to be an actively studied topic in information retrieval (IR), and there have been consistent efforts in curating test collections to support its research. However, there is a lack of high-quality human-annotated CLIR resources for African languages: the few existing collections are mostly curated synthetically or from sources with limited corpora for these languages. We present CIRAL, a test collection for cross-lingual retrieval with English queries and passages in four African languages: Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba. CIRAL's corpora are obtained from Indigenous African websites and consist of a total of over 2.5 million passages. We gathered over 1,600 queries and 30k high-quality binary relevance judgments annotated by native speakers of the languages. Additional pools were also obtained at CIRAL's shared task, which was hosted at the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2023 to encourage community participation in CLIR for African languages. We describe the design and curation process of our test collection and provide reproducible baselines that demonstrate CIRAL's utility in evaluating the effectiveness of systems.
