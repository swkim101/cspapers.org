Bipartite graph representation learning embeds users and items into a low-dimensional latent space based on observed interactions. Previous studies mainly fall into two categories: one reconstructs the structural relations of the graph through the representations of nodes, while the other aggregates neighboring node information using graph neural networks. However, existing methods only explore the local structural information of nodes during the learning process. This makes it difficult to represent the macroscopic structural information and leaves it easily affected by data sparsity and noise. To address this issue, we propose the Intent Distribution based Bipartite graph Representation learning (IDBR) model, which explicitly integrates node intent distribution information into the representation learning process. Specifically, we obtain node intent distributions through clustering and design an intent distribution based graph convolution neural network to generate node representations. Compared to traditional methods, we expand the scope of node representations, enabling us to obtain more comprehensive representations of global intent. When constructing the intent distributions, we effectively alleviated the issues of data sparsity and noise. Additionally, we enrich the representations of nodes by integrating potential neighboring nodes from both structural and semantic dimensions. Experiments on the link prediction and recommendation tasks illustrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
