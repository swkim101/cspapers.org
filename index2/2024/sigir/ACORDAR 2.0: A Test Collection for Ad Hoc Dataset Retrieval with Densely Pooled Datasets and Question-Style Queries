Dataset search, or more specifically, ad hoc dataset retrieval which is a trending specialized IR task, has received increasing attention in both academia and industry. While methods and systems continue evolving, existing test collections for this task exhibit shortcomings, particularly suffering from lexical bias in pooling and limited to keyword-style queries for evaluation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we construct ACORDAR 2.0, a new test collection for this task which is also the largest to date. To reduce lexical bias in pooling, we adapt dense retrieval models to large structured data, using them to find an extended set of semantically relevant datasets to be annotated. To diversify query forms, we employ a large language model to rewrite keyword queries into high-quality question-style queries. We use the test collection to evaluate popular sparse and dense retrieval models to establish a baseline for future studies. The test collection and source code are publicly available.
