Timeline summarization is the task of automatically generating concise overviews of documents that capture the key events and their progression on timelines. While this capability is useful for quickly comprehending event sequences without reading lengthy descriptions, timeline summarization remains a relatively underexplored area in recent years when compared to traditional document summarization task and their evolution. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led some to presume summarization as a solved problem. However, timeline summarization poses unique challenges for LLMs. Our investigation is centered on evaluating the performance of LLMs, against state-of-the-art models in this field. We employed three different approaches: chunking, knowledge graph-based summarization, and TimeRanker. Each of these methods was systematically tested on three benchmark datasets for timeline summarization to assess their effectiveness in capturing and condensing key events and their evolution within timelines. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise, timeline summarization remains a complex task that is not yet fully resolved.
