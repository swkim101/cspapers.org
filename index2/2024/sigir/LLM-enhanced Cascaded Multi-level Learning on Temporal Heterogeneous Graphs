Learning on temporal heterogeneous graphs (THGs) has attracted substantial attention in applications of information retrieval. Such graphs are ubiquitous in real-world domains like recommender systems and social networks. However, the spatial heterogeneity, rich semantic information, and intricate evolution patterns of THGs make it still difficult to generate high-quality embeddings for graph nodes. In this paper, we focus on two valuable and understudied issues related to THG learning: (a) How to capture the specific evolutionary characteristics of diverse temporal heterogeneous graphs? (b) Due to the heterogeneous nature of the graph, how to capture the unique temporal patterns of different node types? We explore these questions and present our solution by proposing a new method named CasMLN (Cascaded Multi-level Learning Network) for THG learning. Through the multi-level learning structure and aggregation methods specifically designed for different levels, we obtain information of multiple levels and fuse them to improve embedding generation. Additionally, we pioneer the use of large language models (LLMs) in the THG field. By leveraging the universality and powerful capabilities of LLMs, our method introduces LLM-based external knowledge to effectively capture the implicit nature of graphs and node types, which helps to enhance type- and graph-level representations. We evaluate our method on several real-world THG datasets for different downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CasMLN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.
