Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation involves predicting users' next preferred POI and is becoming increasingly significant in location-based social networks. However, users are often reluctant to trust recommended results due to the lack of transparency in these systems. While recent work on explaining recommender systems has gained attention, prevailing methods only provide post-hoc explanations based on results or rudimentary explanations according to attention scores. Such limitations hinder reliability and applicability in risk-sensitive scenarios. Inspired by the information theory, we propose a self-explainable framework with an ante-hoc view called \M~for next POI recommendation aimed at overcoming these limitations. Specifically, we endow self-explainability to POI recommender systems through compact representation learning using a variational information bottleneck approach. The learned representation further improves accuracy by reducing redundancy behind massive spatial-temporal trajectories, which, in turn, boosts the recommendation performance. Experiments on three real-world datasets show significant improvements in both model explainability and recommendation performance.
