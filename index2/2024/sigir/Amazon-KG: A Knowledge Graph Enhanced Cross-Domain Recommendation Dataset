Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to utilize the information from relevant domains to guide the recommendation task in the target domain, and shows great potential in alleviating the data sparsity and cold-start problems of recommender systems. Most existing methods utilize the interaction information (e.g., ratings and clicks) or consider auxiliary information (e.g., tags and comments) to analyze the users' cross-domain preferences, but such kinds of information ignore the intrinsic semantic relationship of different domains. In order to effectively explore the inter-domain correlations, encyclopedic knowledge graphs (KG) involving different domains are highly desired in cross-domain recommendation tasks because they contain general information covering various domains with structured data format. However, there are few datasets containing KG information for CDR tasks, so in order to enrich the available data resource, we build a KG-enhanced cross-domain recommendation dataset, named Amazon-KG, based on the widely used Amazon dataset for CDR and the well-known KG DBpedia. In this work, we analyze the potential of KG applying in cross-domain recommendations, and describe the construction process of our dataset in detail. Finally, we perform quantitative statistical analysis on the dataset. We believe that datasets like Amazon-KG contribute to the development of knowledge-aware cross-domain recommender systems. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/WangYuhan-0520/Amazon-KG-v2.0-dataset.
