Searching for novelty-destroying prior art is an important part of patent application drafting and invalidation. The task is challenging due to the detailed information needed to determine whether a document is novelty-destroying or simply closely related, resulting in the original search results not always being fully on target. Allowing the user to provide feedback on the relevance of the initial search results and iterating on the search may thus improve the results significantly. We present a relevance feedback method based on computing the affine vector subspace spanned by the relevant document vectors. The method can be used with any dense retrieval system, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving recall in prior art searches. We compare the subspace-based method to the Rocchio algorithm and show that the method is less sensitive to changes in hyperparameters when the number of relevant documents increases.
