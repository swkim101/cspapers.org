Visual Question Answering based on external Knowledge Bases (KB-VQA) requires a model to incorporate knowledge beyond the content of given image and question for answer prediction. Most existing works made efforts on using graph neural networks or Multi-modal Large Language Models to incorporate external knowledge for answer generation. Despite the promising results, they have limited interpretability and exhibit a deficiency in handling questions with unseen answers. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable graph routing network (GRN) which explicitly conducts entity routing over a constructed scene knowledge graph step by step for KB-VQA. At each step, GRN keeps an entity score vector representing how likely of each entity to be activated as the answer, and a transition matrix representing the transition probability from one entity to another. To answer the given question, GRN will focus on certain keywords of the question at each step and correspondingly conduct entity routing by transiting the entity scores according to the transition matrix computed referring to the focused question keywords. In this way, it clearly provides the reasoning process of KB-VQA and can handle the questions with unseen answers without distinction. Experiments on the benchmark dataset KRVQA have demonstrated that GRN improves the performance of KB-VQA by a large margin, surpassing existing state-of-the art KB-VQA methods and Multi-modal Large Language Models, as well as shows competent capability in handling unseen answers and good interpretability in KB-VQA.
