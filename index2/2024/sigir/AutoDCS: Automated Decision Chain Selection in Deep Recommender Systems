Multi-behavior recommender systems (MBRS) have been commonly deployed on real-world industrial platforms for their superior advantages in understanding user preferences and mitigating data sparsity. However, the cascade graph modeling paradigm adopted in mainstream MBRS usually assumes that users will refer to all types of behavioral knowledge they have when making decisions about target behaviors, i.e., use all types of behavioral interactions indiscriminately when modeling and predicting target behaviors for each user. We call this a full decision chain constraint and argue that it may be too strict by ignoring that different types of behavioral knowledge have varying importance for different users. In this paper, we propose a novel automated decision chain selection (AutoDCS) framework to relax this constraint, which can consider each userâ€™s unique decision dependencies and select a reasonable set of behavioral knowledge to activate for the prediction of target behavior. Specifically, AutoDCS first integrates some existing MBRS methods in a base cascade module to obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings. Then, a bilateral matching gating mechanism is used to select an exclusive set of behaviors for the current user-item pair to form a decision chain, and the corresponding behavior-augmented embeddings are selectively activated. Subse-quently, AutoDCS combines the behavior-augmented and original behavior-aware embeddings to predict the target behavior. Finally, we evaluate AutoDCS and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments over four public multi-behavior benchmarks.
