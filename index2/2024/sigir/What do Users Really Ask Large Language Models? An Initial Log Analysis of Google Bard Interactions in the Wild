Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have changed information retrieval, offering users a more personalised and natural search experience with technologies like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard (Gemini), or Microsoft Copilot. Despite these advancements, research into user tasks and information needs remains scarce. This preliminary work analyses a Google Bard prompt log with 15 , 023 interactions called the Bard Intelligence and Dialogue Dataset ( BIDD ), providing an understanding akin to query log analyses. We show that Google Bard prompts are often verbose and structured, encapsulating a broader range of information needs and imperative (e.g., directive) tasks distinct from traditional search queries. We show that LLMs can support users in tasks beyond the three main types based on user intent: informational, navigational, and transactional. Our findings emphasise the versatile application of LLMs across content creation, LLM writing style preferences, and information extraction. We document diverse user interaction styles, showcasing the adaptability of users to LLM capabilities.
