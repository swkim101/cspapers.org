Cross-encoders leverage fine-grained interactions between documents and queries for effective relevance ranking. Such ranking models are typically trained to satisfy the single objective of providing relevant information to the users. However, not all information should be made available. For example, documents containing sensitive information, such as personal or confidential information, should not be returned in the search results. Sensitivity-aware search (SAS) aims to develop retrieval models that can satisfy two objectives, namely: (1) providing the user with relevant search results, while (2) ensuring that no documents that contain sensitive information are included in the ranking. In this work, we propose three novel negative sampling strategies that enable cross-encoders to be trained to satisfy the bi-objective task of SAS. Additionally, we investigate and compare with filtering sensitive documents in ranking pipelines. Our experiments on a collection labelled for sensitivity show that our proposed negative sampling strategies lead to a ~37% increase in terms of cost-sensitive nDCG (nCSDCG) for SAS.
