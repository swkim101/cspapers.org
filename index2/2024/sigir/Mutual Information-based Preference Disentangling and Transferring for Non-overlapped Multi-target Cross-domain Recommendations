Building high-quality recommender systems is challenging for new services and small companies, because of their sparse interactions. Cross-domain recommendations (CDRs) alleviate this issue by transferring knowledge from data in external domains. However, most existing CDRs leverage data from only a single external domain and serve only two domains. CDRs serving multiple domains require domain-shared entities (i.e., users and items) to transfer knowledge, which significantly limits their applications due to the hardness and privacy concerns of finding such entities. We therefore focus on a more general scenario, non-overlapped multi-target CDRs (NO-MTCDRs), which require no domain-shared entities and serve multiple domains. Existing methods require domain-shared users to learn user preferences and cannot work on NO-MTCDRs. We hence propose MITrans, a novel mutual information-based (MI-based) preference disentangling and transferring framework to improve recommendations for all domains. MITrans effectively leverages knowledge from multiple domains as well as learning both domain-shared and domain-specific preferences without using domain-shared users. In MITrans, we devise two novel MI constraints to disentangle domain-shared and domain-specific preferences. Moreover, we introduce a module that fuses domain-shared preferences in different domains and combines them with domain-specific preferences to improve recommendations. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MITrans in terms of recommendation quality and application range against state-of-the-art overlapped and non-overlapped CDRs.
