The first International Workshop on Open Web Search (WOWS) was held on Thursday, March 28th, at ECIR 2024 in Glasgow, UK. The full-day workshop had two calls for contributions: the first call aimed at scientific contributions to building, operating, and evaluating search engines cooperatively and the cooperative use of the web as a resource for researchers and innovators. The second call for implementations of retrieval components aimed to gain practical experience with joint, cooperative evaluation of search engines and their components. In total, 2~papers were accepted for the first call, and 11~software components were submitted for the second. The workshop ended with breakout sessions on how the OpenWebSearch.eu project can incorporate collaborative evaluations and a hub of search engines.
