Web search services are widely employed for various purposes. After identifying information needs, users attempt to articulate them in web queries that express their intentions. Then, they submit these queries to the chosen search engine with the hope of obtaining relevant results to meet their needs. In some cases, users may not immediately find precisely what they are seeking, prompting them to rewrite the query to obtain a greater number of relevant results or results that are perhaps more related to their intent. While significant work has been done on developing features such as query auto-completion, query suggestion, and query recommendation, the majority of these efforts were based on query co-occurrence or query similarity by clustering them or constructing query flow graphs to capture query connections. These approaches operate under the assumption that frequently observed follow-up queries are more likely to be submitted by users [1, 2, 4]. In this research, we investigate user query reformulation behavior. To achieve this, we will utilize the Trip Click dataset, a large-scale collection of user click data within the context of a health web search engine [3]. The log data from 2018 to 2020 will be considered, comprising 1,803,493 records representing the clicks that occurred across 527,749 sessions. Specifically, the focus will be on the impact of user interactions with the search result page when forming subsequent queries.
