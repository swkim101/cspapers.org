Federated Recommendation (FedRec) is popularly investigated in personalized recommenders for preserving user privacy. However, due to the distributed training paradigm, FedRec is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. In this paper, we focus on the targeted model poisoning attack against FedRec, which aims at effectively attacking the FedRec via uploading poisoned gradients to raise the exposure ratio of a multi-target item set. Previous attack methods excel with fewer target items but suffer performance decline as the amount of target items increases, which reveals two perennially neglected issues: (i) The simple promotion of prediction scores without considering intrinsic collaborations between users and items is ineffective in multi-target cases. (ii) Target items are heterogeneous, which requires discriminative attacking users and strategies for different targets. To address the issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Multi-target Transfer Attack framework named HMTA which consists of two stages, i.e., (1) diverse user agent generation and (2) optimal multi-target transport attack. The former stage leverages collaboration-aware manifold learning to extract latent associations among users and items, and develops a differentiable contrastive sorting to generate user agents from both difficulty and diversity scale. The latter stage conducts poisoning in a fine-grained and distinguishing way, which first completes distribution mapping from target items to generated user agents and then achieves a hybrid multi-target attack. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HMTA.
