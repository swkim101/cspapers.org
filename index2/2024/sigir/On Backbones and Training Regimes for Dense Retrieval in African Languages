The effectiveness of dense retrieval models trained with multi-lingual language models as backbones has been demonstrated in multilingual and cross-lingual information retrieval contexts. The optimal choice of a backbone model for a given retrieval task is dependent on the target retrieval domain as well as the pre-training domain of available language models and their generalization capabilities, the availability of relevance judgements, etc. In this work, we study the impact of these factors on retrieval effectiveness for African languages using three multilingual benchmark datasets: Mr. TyDi, MIRACL, and the newly released CIRAL dataset. We compare the effectiveness of mBERT as a backbone for dense retrieval models against multilingual language models such as AfriBERTa and AfroXLMR, which are specialized for African languages. Furthermore, we examine the impact of different training regimes on the effectiveness of dense retrieval in different domains for African languages. Our findings show that the pre-training domain of the backbone LM plays a huge role in retrieval effectiveness, especially in the absence of retrieval training data.
