Embedding tables in deep recommender systems (DRS) process categorical data, which can be memory-intensive due to the high feature cardinality. In this paper, we propose Approximate Rotary Compositional Embedding (ARCE), which intentionally trades off performance to aggressively reduce the size of the embedding tables. Specifically, ARCE uses compositional embedding to split large embedding tables into smaller compositions and replaces index look-ups with vector rotations. To regain the performance loss of this trade-off, ARCE features an input approximation where one index is mapped into multiple indices, creating a larger space for a potential increased learning capability. Experimental results show that using ARCE can reduce the memory overhead of embedding tables in DRS by more than 1000x with less than 3% performance loss, highlighting the potential of using ARCE for less memory intensive DRS designs. We open-source ARCE at https://github.com/VU-DETAIL/arce.
