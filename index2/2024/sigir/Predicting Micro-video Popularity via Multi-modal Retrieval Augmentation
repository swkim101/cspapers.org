Accurately predicting the popularity of micro-videos is crucial for real-world applications such as recommender systems and identifying viral marketing opportunities. Existing methods often focus on limited cross-modal information within individual micro-videos, overlooking the potential advantages of exploiting vast repository of past videos. We present MMRA, a multi-modal retrieval-augmented popularity prediction model that enhances prediction accuracy using relevant retrieved information. MMRA first retrieves relevant instances from a multi-modal memory bank, aligning video and text through transformation mechanisms involving a vision model and a text-based retriever. Additionally, a multi-modal interaction network is carefully designed to jointly capture cross-modal correlations within the target video and extract informative knowledge through retrieved instances, ultimately enhancing the prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world micro-video dataset demonstrate the superiority of MMRA when compared to state-of-the-art models.
