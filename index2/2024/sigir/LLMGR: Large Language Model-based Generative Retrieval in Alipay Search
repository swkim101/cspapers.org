The search system aims to help users quickly find items according to queries they enter, which includes the retrieval and ranking modules. Traditional retrieval is a multi-stage process, including indexing and sorting, which cannot be optimized end-to-end. With the real data about mini-apps in the Alipay search, we find that many complex queries fail to display the relevant mini-apps, seriously threatening users' search experience. To address the challenges, we propose a Large Language Model-based Generative Retrieval (LLMGR) approach for retrieving mini-app candidates. The information of the mini-apps is encoded into the large model, and the title of the mini-app is directly generated. Through the online A/B test in Alipay search, LLMGR as a supplementary source has statistically significant improvements in the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of the search system compared to traditional methods. In this paper, we have deployed a novel retrieval method for the Alipay search system and demonstrated that generative retrieval methods based on LLM can improve the performance of search system, particularly for complex queries, which have an average increase of 0.2% in CTR.
