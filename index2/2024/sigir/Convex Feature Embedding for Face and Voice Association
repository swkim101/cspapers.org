Face-and-voice association learning poses significant challenges in the field of deep learning. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach for cross-modal feature embedding, specifically targeting the correlation between facial and voice association. Previous studies have examined cross-modal association tasks in order to establish the relationship between voice clips and facial images. Previous studies have examined the issue of cross-modal discrimination; however, they have not adequately recognized the importance of managing the heterogeneity in inter-modal features between audio and video. As a result, there is a significant prevalence of false positives and false negatives. To address the issue, the proposed method learns the embeddings of cross-modal features by introducing an additional feature that bridges the gap between these features. This facilitates the embedding of voice and face features belonging to the same individual within a convex hull. Through the utilization of cross-modal feature learning, cross-modal attention particularly reduces inter-class variance, resulting in a notable enhancement of the clustering power. We comprehensively evaluated our approach on cross-modal verification, matching, and retrieval tasks using the large-scale VoxCeleb dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.
