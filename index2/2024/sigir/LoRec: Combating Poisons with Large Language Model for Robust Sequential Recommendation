Sequential recommender systems stand out for their ability to capture users' dynamic interests and the patterns of item transitions. However, the inherent openness of sequential recommender systems renders them vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where fraudsters are injected into the training data to manipulate learned patterns. Traditional defense methods predominantly depend on predefined assumptions or rules extracted from specific known attacks, limiting their generalizability to unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, considering the rich open-world knowledge encapsulated in Large Language Models (LLMs), we attempt to introduce LLMs into defense methods to broaden the knowledge beyond limited known attacks. We propose LoRec, an innovative framework that employs LLM-Enhanced Calibration to strengthen the robustness of sequential Recommender systems against poisoning attacks. LoRec integrates an LLM-enhanced CalibraTor (LCT) that refines the training process of sequential recommender systems with knowledge derived from LLMs, applying a user-wise reweighting to diminish the impact of attacks. Incorporating LLMs' open-world knowledge, the LCT effectively converts the limited, specific priors or rules into a more general pattern of fraudsters, offering improved defenses against poisons. Our comprehensive experiments validate that LoRec, as a general framework, significantly strengthens the robustness of sequential recommender systems.
