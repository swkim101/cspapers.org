We present LADy , a Python-based benchmark toolkit to facilitate extracting aspects of products or services in reviews toward which customers target their opinions and sentiments. While there has been a significant increase in aspect-based sentiment analysis, yet the proposed methods’ practical implications in real-world settings remain moot for their closed and irreproducible codebases, inability to accommodate datasets from various domains, and poor evaluation methodologies. LADy is an open-source benchmark toolkit with a standard pipeline and experimental details to fill the gaps. It incorporates a host of canonical models along with benchmark datasets from varying domains, including unsolicited online reviews. Leveraging an object-oriented design, LADy readily extends to new models and training datasets. The first of its kind, LADy also features review augmentation via natural language backtranslation that can be integrated into the training phase of the models to boost efficiency and improve efficacy during inference. LADy ’s codebase, along with the installation instructions and case studies on five datasets for seven methods with backtranslation augmentation over ten languages, can be obtained under cc-by-nc-sa-4.0 license at https://github.com/fani-lab/LADy .
