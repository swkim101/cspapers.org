In the field of dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (DTCDR), improving the performance in both the information sparse domain and rich domain has been a mainstream research trend. However, prior embedding-based methods are insufficient to adequately describe the dynamics of user actions and items across domains. Moreover, previous efforts frequently lacked a comprehensive investigation of the entire domain distributions. This paper proposes a novel framework entitled Wasserstein Cross-Domain Recommendation (WCDR) that captures uncertainty in Wasserstein space to address above challenges. In this framework, we abstract user/item actions as Elliptical Gaussian distributions and divide them into local-intrinsic and global-domain parts. To further model the domain diversity, we adopt shared-specific pattern for global-domain distributions and present Masked Domain-aware Sub-distribution Aggregation (MDSA) module to produce informative and diversified global-domain distributions, which incorporates attention-based aggregation method and masking strategy that alleviates negative transfer issues. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one business dataset are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of WCDR over state-of-the-art methods.
