Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a promising service that incentives workers to finish location-based tasks with high quality by providing rewards. Worker recruitment is a core issue in SC, for which most state-of-the-art algorithms focus on designing incentive mechanisms based on the existing SC worker pool. However, they may fail when the number of SC workers is not enough, especially for the new SC platforms. In recent years, social networks have been found to be helpful for worker recruitment by selecting seed workers to spread the task information so as to inspire more social users to participate, but how to select seed workers remains a challenge. Existing methods typically require numerous iterative searches leading to inefficiency in facing the big picture and failing to cope with dynamic environments. In the paper, we formulate the Effective Coverage Maximization (ECM) problem. We prove that the ECM problem is NP-hard and propose a novel worker recruitment method combined with the dual-embedding and Rainbow Deep Q-network (DQN), which is called DQNSelector. The dual-embedding extracts long-range social influence information from the social network and near-range coverage quality information from the geographic information map using the inner-product method and our proposed efficient Path Increment Iterative Calculation (PIIC) algorithm respectively. We then combine the dual embedding to design a Rainbow DQN-based reinforcement learning model so as to select seed workers. Extensive experiments and ablation studies based on real-world datasets verify the superiority of DQNSelector.
