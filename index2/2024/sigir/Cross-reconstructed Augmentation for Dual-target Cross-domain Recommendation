To alleviate the long-standing data sparsity issue in recommender systems, numerous studies in cross-domain recommendation (CDR) have been conducted to facilitate information transfer processes across domains. In recent years, dual-target CDR has been introduced to gain mutual improvements between two domains through more general bidirectional transfer rather than traditional one-way transit. Existing methods in dual-target CDR focus primarily on designing powerful encoders to learn representative cross-domain information, without tackling the fundamental issue of interaction data shortage. In this paper, we present CrossAug, a novel data augmentation approach to leverage interactions more efficiently in two domains. Specifically, we propose intra-domain and inter-domain augmentations based on cross-reconstructed representations in terms of sampled records. To reduce the harm of domain shift, we project domain-shared representations in two domains into a joint space with Householder transformations and apply center alignments. All these modules boost the utilization of interactions with little influence from negative transfer. Extensive experimental results over public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossAug and its components in dual-target CDR.
