The MANILA24 workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, governments, and NGO's to identify and discuss core research problems in information retrieval for climate impact. The workshop aims to foster collaboration by bringing communities together that have so far not been very well connected -- IR, systematic reviews, and climate change. The purpose is to help accelerate the development of IR technology that supports our understanding of climate impact publications and the articulation of recommended actions. Importantly, this includes introducing IR researchers climate impact, introducing researchers in climate to state-of-the-art IR technology, and developing a shared research agenda.
