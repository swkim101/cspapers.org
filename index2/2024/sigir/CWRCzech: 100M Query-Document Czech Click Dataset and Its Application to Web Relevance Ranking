We present CWRCzech, Click Web Ranking dataset for Czech, a 100M query-document Czech click dataset for relevance ranking with user behavior data collected from search engine logs of Seznam$.$cz. To the best of our knowledge, CWRCzech is the largest click dataset with raw text published so far. It provides document positions in the search results as well as information about user behavior: 27.6M clicked documents and 10.8M dwell times. In addition, we also publish a manually annotated Czech test for the relevance task, containing nearly 50k query-document pairs, each annotated by at least 2 annotators. Finally, we analyze how the user behavior data improve relevance ranking and show that models trained on data automatically harnessed at sufficient scale can surpass the performance of models trained on human annotated data.
