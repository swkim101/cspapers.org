 nearest neighbor search (AKNN) is a fundamental task for various applications, including information retrieval. Most existing algorithms for AKNN can be decomposed into two main components, i.e., candidate generation and distance comparison operations (DCOs). While different methods have unique ways of generating candidates, they all share the same DCO process. In this study, we focus on accelerating the process of DCOs that dominates the time cost in most existing AKNN algorithms. To achieve this, we propose an Data-Aware Distance Estimation approach, called
 DADE
 , which approximates the
 exact
 distance in a lower-dimensional space. We theoretically prove that the distance estimation in
 DADE
 is
 unbiased
 in terms of data distribution. Furthermore, we propose an optimized estimation based on the unbiased distance estimation formulation. In addition, we propose a hypothesis testing approach to adaptively determine the number of dimensions needed to estimate the
 exact
 distance with sufficient confidence. We integrate
 DADE
 into widely-used AKNN search algorithms, e.g.,
 IVF
 and
 HNSW
 , and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority.
