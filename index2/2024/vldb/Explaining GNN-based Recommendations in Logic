 This paper proposes Makex (MAKE senSE), a logic approach to explaining why a GNN-based model
 M
 (
 x, y
 ) recommends item
 y
 to user
 x.
 It proposes a class of Rules for ExPlanations, denoted as REPs and defined with a graph pattern
 Q
 and dependency X â†’
 M
 (
 x, y
 ), where
 X
 is a collection of predicates, and the model
 M
 (
 x, y
 ) is treated as the consequence of the rule. Intuitively, given
 M
 (
 x, y
 ), we discover pattern
 Q
 to identify relevant topology, and precondition
 X
 to disclose correlations, interactions and dependencies of vertex features; together they provide rationals behind prediction
 M
 (
 x, y
 ), identifying what features are decisive for
 M
 to make predictions and under what conditions the decision can be made. We (a) define REPs with 1-WL test, on which most GNN models for recommendation are based; (b) develop an algorithm for discovering REPs for
 M
 as global explanations, and (c) provide a top-
 k
 algorithm to compute top-ranked local explanations. Using real-life graphs, we empirically verify that Makex outperforms previous explanation methods in terms of fidelity, sparsity and efficiency.
