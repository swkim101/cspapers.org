With the widespread use of GPS-enabled devices and services, trajectory data fuels services in a variety of fields, such as transportation and smart cities. However, trajectory data often contains errors stemming from inaccurate GPS measurements, low sampling rates, and transmission interruptions, yielding low-quality trajectory data with negative effects on downstream services. Therefore, a crucial yet tedious endeavor is to assess the quality of trajectory data, serving as a guide for subsequent data cleaning and analyses. Despite some studies addressing general-purpose data quality assessment, no studies exist that are tailored specifically for trajectory data.
 To more effectively diagnose the quality of trajectory data, we propose T-Assess, an automated trajectory data quality assessment system. T-Assess is built on three fundamental principles: i) extensive coverage, ii) versatility, and iii) efficiency. To achieve comprehensive coverage, we propose assessment criteria spanning validity, completeness, consistency, and fairness. To provide high versatility, T-Assess supports both offline and online evaluations for full-batch trajectory datasets as well as real-time trajectory streams. In addition, we incorporate an evaluation optimization strategy to achieve assessment efficiency. Extensive experiments on four real-life benchmark datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of T-Assess at quantifying trajectory data quality beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art data quality systems.
