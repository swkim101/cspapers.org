Browsers are responsible for managing and interpreting the diverse data coming from the web. Despite the considerable e � orts of developers, however, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate potential vulnerabilities in such complicated software. While a family of fuzzing techniques has been proposed to detect � aws in web browsers, they still face the inherent challenge of generating test inputs with low semantic correctness and poor diversity. In this paper, we propose T ����� , a novel fuzzing framework tai-loredfor webbrowsers. T ����� comprises threemain modules:a semantic parser, a semantic aligner, and an input generator. By taking advantage of � ne-grained semantic alignment techniques, T ����� is capable of generating semantically correct test inputs, which signi � cantly improve the probability of a fuzzer in triggering a deep browser state. In particular, by integrating a scope-aware strategy into input generation, T ����� is able to deal with asynchronous code generation, thereby substantially increasing the diversity of the generated test inputs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate T ����� on three production-level browsers, i.e., Chromium, Safari, and Firefox. Empirical results demonstrate that T ����� outperforms state-of-the-art browser fuzzers in both achieving code coverage and detecting unique crashes. So far, T ����� has identi � ed 32 previously unknown bugs, 10 of which have been assigned CVEs. It is worth noting that T ����� unearthed two bugs in Chromium that have remained undetected for ten years.
