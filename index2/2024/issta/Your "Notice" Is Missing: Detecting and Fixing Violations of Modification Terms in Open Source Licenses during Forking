Open source software brings bene � t to the software community but also introduces legal risks caused by license violations, which result in seriousconsequences such aslawsuits and � nanciallosses. Tomit-igate legal risks, some approaches have been proposed to identify licenses, detect license incompatibilities and inconsistencies, and recommend licenses. As far as we know, however, there is no prior work to understand modi � cation terms in open source licenses or to detect and � x violations of modi � cation terms. To bridge this gap, we � rst empirically characterize modi � cation terms in 48 open source licenses. These licenses all require certain forms of “notice” to describe the modi � cations made to the original work. Inspired by our study, we then design L � V � to automatically detect and � x violations of modi � cation terms in open source licenses during forking. Our evaluation has shown the e � ectiveness and e � ciency of L � V � . 18 pull requests for � xing modi � cation term violations have received positive responses. 8 have been merged.
