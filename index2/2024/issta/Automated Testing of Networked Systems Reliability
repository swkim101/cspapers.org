The reliability of a network is a crucial requirement for systems such as IoT, client-server, or cloud-based solutions. Unfortunately, real networks cannot be assumed to be fault-free, especially when considering various hardware problems, performance issues, or malicious attacks. Testing networked systems should therefore include evaluating fault tolerance under various network conditions. The paper presents a doctoral research project on automated verification of networked systems using fault-attack injection using a derived model of network communication.
