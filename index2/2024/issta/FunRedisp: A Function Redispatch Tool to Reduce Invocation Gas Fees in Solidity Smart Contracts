FunRedisp is a function dispatch refactoring tool to reduce the overall invocation gas consumption of Solidity smart contracts. It initially extracts all external functions in a contract at the source code level. After identifying the functions which are highly likely to be invoked among these functions by a pre-trained TextCNN model, FunRedisp moves them to the front of the function dispatch at the bytecode level. FunRedisp saves about 125.17 units of gas per contract transaction on the 50 real-world smart contracts, which are randomly selected from Ethereum. The time overhead for refactoring each contract is only 0.37 seconds on average, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.
