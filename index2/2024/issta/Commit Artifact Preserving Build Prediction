In Continuous Integration (CI), accurate build prediction is crucial for minimizing development costs and enhancing efficiency. However, existing build prediction methods, typically based on predefined rules or machine learning classifiers employing feature engineering, have been constrained by their limited ability to fully capture the intricate details of commit artifacts, such as code change and commit messages. These artifacts are critical for understanding the commit under a build but have been inadequately utilized in existing approaches. To address this problem, we propose GitSense, a Transformer-based model specifically designed to incorporate the rich and complex information contained within commit artifacts for the first. GitSense employs an advanced textual encoder with built-in sliding window text samplers for textual features and a statistical feature encoder for extracted statistical features. This innovative approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of lengthy and intricate commit artifacts, surpassing the capabilities of traditional methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare GitSense with five state-of-the-art build prediction models, Longformer, and ChatGPT. The experimental results show that GitSense outperforms these models in predicting failed builds, evidenced by 32.7%-872.1.0% better on F1-score, 23.9%-437.5% better on Precision, and 40.2%-1396.0% better on Recall.
