Android is based on an event-driven model, which hides the main method, and is driven by the lifecycle methods and listeners from user interaction. FlowDroid, constructs a dummy main method statically emulating the lifecycle methods. The dummy main method has been widely used by FlowDroid and also other Android analyzers as their entry points. However, the existing dummy main method is not designed for path-sensitive analysis, whose paths may be unsatisfiable. Thus, when using original dummy main methods, path-sensitive analysis, e.g., symbolic execution, may suffer from infeasible paths. In this paper, we present DMMPP, the first dummy main method generator for Android applications with path-sensitive predicates, and the corresponding path condition is satisfiable. DMMPP constructs dummy main methods for the four types of components in an application with a more realistic simulation for the lifecycle methods. The experiment demonstrates the benefits of our tool for path-sensitive analyzers, improving 28.5 times more explored paths with a low time overhead.
