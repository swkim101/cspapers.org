In label-noise learning, accurately identifying the transition matrix is crucial for developing statistically consistent classifiers. This task is complicated by instance-dependent noise, which introduces identifiability challenges in the absence of stringent assumptions. Existing methods use neural networks to estimate the transition matrix by initially extracting confident clean instances. However, this extraction process is hindered by severe inter-class imbalance and a bias toward selecting unambiguous intra-class instances, leading to a distorted understanding of noise patterns. To tackle these challenges, our paper introduces a Class Rebalance and Geometric Regularization-based Framework (CRGR). CRGR employs a smoothed, noise-tolerant reweighting mechanism to equilibrate inter-class representation, thereby mitigating the risk of model overfitting to dominant classes. Additionally, recognizing that instances with similar characteristics often exhibit parallel noise patterns, we propose that the transition matrix should mirror the similarity of the feature space. This insight promotes the inclusion of ambiguous instances in training, serving as a form of geometric regularization. Such a strategy enhances the model's ability to navigate diverse noise patterns and strengthens its generalization capabilities. By addressing both inter-class and intra-class biases, CRGR offers a more balanced and robust classification model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate CRGR's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting classification accuracy and showcasing its effectiveness in handling instance-dependent noise.
