Over the last decades, a rapidly growing volume of spatiotemporal data has been collected from smartphones and GPS, terrestrial, seaborne, airborne, and spaceborne sensors, as well as computational simulations. Meanwhile, advances in deep learning technologies, especially the recent breakthroughs of generative AI and foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs), have achieved tremendous success in natural language processing and computer vision applications. There is growing anticipation of the same level of accomplishment of AI on spatiotemporal data in tackling grand societal challenges, such as national water resource management, monitoring coastal hazards, energy and food security, as well as mitigation and adaptation to climate change. When deep learning, especially emerging foundation models, intersects spatiotemporal data in scientific domains, it opens up new opportunities and challenges. The workshop aims to bring together academic researchers in both AI and scientific domains, government program managers, leaders from non-profit organizations, as well as industry executives to brainstorm and debate on the emerging opportunities and novel challenges of deep learning (foundation models) for spatiotemporal data inspired by real-world scientific applications.
