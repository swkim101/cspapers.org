Graph contrastive learning is a representative self-supervised graph learning that has demonstrated excellent performance in learning node representations. Despite the extensive studies on graph contrastive learning models, most existing models are tailored to static graphs, hindering their application to real-world graphs which are often dynamically evolving. Directly applying these models to dynamic graphs brings in severe efficiency issues in repetitively updating the learned embeddings. To address this challenge, we propose IDOL, a novel contrastive learning framework for dynamic graph representation learning. IDOL conducts the graph propagation process based on a specially designed Personalized PageRank algorithm which can capture the topological changes incrementally. This effectively eliminates heavy recomputation while maintaining high learning quality. Our another main design is a topology-monitorable sampling strategy which lays the foundation of graph contrastive learning. We further show that the design in IDOL achieves a desired performance guarantee. Our experimental results on multiple dynamic graphs show that IDOL outperforms the strongest baselines on node classification tasks in various performance metrics.
