Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to leverage APIs (Web Search, Charting, Calculators, Calendar, Flight Search, Hotel Search, Data Lookup, etc. ) is likely to allow us to solve a variety of new hard problems. Several research efforts have made this observation and suggested recipes for LLMs to emit API calls, and proposed mechanisms by which they can generate additional text conditioned on the output for the API call. However, in practice, the focus has been on relatively simple slot-filling tasks that make an API call rather unlocking novel capabilities by combining different tools, reasoning over the response from a tool, making multiple invocations, or complex planning. In this paper, we pose the following question: what does it mean to say that an LLM is proficient at using a set of APIs? We answer this question in the context of structured APIs by defining seven capabilities for API-use. We provide an approach for generating synthetic tasks that exercise each of these capabilities given only the description of an API. We argue that this provides practitioners with a principled way to construct a dataset to evaluate an LLM's ability to use a given set of APIs. Through human evaluations, we show that our approach produces high-quality tasks for each of the seven capabilities. We also describe how we used this approach to on-board new API and create principled evaluation sets for multiple LLM-based products.
