The next Point-of-interest recommendation has attracted extensive research interest recently, which predicts users' subsequent movements. The main challenge is how to effectively capture users' personalized sequential transitions in check-in trajectory, and various methods have been developed. However, most existing studies ignore the temporal information when conducting the next POI recommendation. To fill this gap, we investigate a time-specific next POI recommendation task, which additionally incorporates the target time information. We propose a brand new Time2Rotation technique to capture the temporal information. Different from conventional methods, we represent timeslots as rotation vectors and then perform the rotation operations. Based on the Time2Rotation technique, we propose a novel rotation-based temporal attention network, namely ROTAN, for the time-specific next POI recommendation task. The ROTAN begins by building a collaborative POI transition graph, capturing the asymmetric temporal influence in sequential transitions. After that, it incorporates temporal information into the modeling of individual check-in trajectories, extracting separate representations for user preference and POI influence to reflect their distinct temporal patterns. Lastly, the target time is integrated to generate recommendations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets, which demonstrates the advantages of the proposed Time2Rotation technique and ROTAN recommendation model.
