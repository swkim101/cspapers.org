Urbanization's rapid progress has led to many big cities, which have modernized many people's lives but also engendered big challenges, such as air pollution, increased energy consumption, and traffic congestion. Tackling these challenges was nearly impossible years ago given the complex and dynamic settings of cities. Nowadays, sensing technologies and large-scale computing infrastructures have produced a variety of big data in urban spaces, e.g., human mobility, air quality, traffic patterns, and geographical data. Motivated by the opportunities of building more intelligent cities, we came up with a vision of urban computing, which aims to unlock the power of knowledge from big and heterogeneous data collected in urban spaces and apply this powerful information to solve major issues our cities face today.
