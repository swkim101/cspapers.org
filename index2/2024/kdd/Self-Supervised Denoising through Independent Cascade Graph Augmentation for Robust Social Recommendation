Social Recommendation (SR) typically exploits neighborhood influence in the social network to enhance user preference modeling. However, users' intricate social behaviors may introduce noisy social connections for user modeling and harm the models' robustness. Existing solutions to alleviate social noise either filter out the noisy connections or generate new potential social connections. Due to the absence of labels, the former approaches may retain uncertain connections for user preference modeling while the latter methods may introduce additional social noise. Through data analysis, we discover that (1) social noise likely comes from the connected users with low preference similarity; and (2) Opinion Leaders (OLs) play a pivotal role in influence dissemination, surpassing high-similarity neighbors, regardless of their preference similarity with trusting peers. Guided by these observations, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Denoising approach through Independent Cascade Graph Augmentation, for more robust SR. Specifically, we employ the independent cascade diffusion model to generate an augmented graph view, which traverses the social graph and activates the edges in sequence to simulate the cascading influence spread. To steer the augmentation towards a denoised social graph, we (1) introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to prioritize the activation of OLs first, followed by high-similarity neighbors, while weakening the low-similarity neighbors; and (2) integrate an information bottleneck based contrastive loss, aiming to minimize mutual information between original and augmented graphs yet preserve sufficient information for improved SR. Experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art while also exhibiting higher robustness to different extents of social noise.
