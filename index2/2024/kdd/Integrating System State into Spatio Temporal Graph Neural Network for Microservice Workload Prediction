Microservice architecture has become a driving force in enhancing the modularity and scalability of web applications, as evidenced by the Alipay platform's operational success. However, a prevalent issue within such infrastructures is the suboptimal utilization of CPU resources due to inflexible resource allocation policies. This inefficiency necessitates the development of dynamic, accurate workload prediction methods to improve resource allocation. In response to this challenge, we present STAMP, a Spatio Temporal Graph Network for Microservice Workload Prediction. STAMP is designed to comprehensively address the multifaceted interdependencies between microservices, the temporal variability of workloads, and the critical role of system state in resource utilization. Through a graph-based representation, STAMP effectively maps the intricate network of microservice interactions. It employs time series analysis to capture the dynamic nature of workload changes and integrates system state insights to enhance prediction accuracy. Our empirical analysis, using three distinct real-world datasets, establishes that STAMP exceeds baselines by achieving an average boost of 5.72% in prediction precision, as measured by RMSE. Upon deployment in Alipay's microservice environment, STAMP achieves a 33.10% reduction in resource consumption, significantly outperforming existing online methods. This research solidifies STAMP as a validated framework, offering meaningful contributions to the field of resource management in microservice architecture-based applications.
