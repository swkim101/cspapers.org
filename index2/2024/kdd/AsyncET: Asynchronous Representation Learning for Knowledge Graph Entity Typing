Knowledge graph entity typing (KGET) aims to predict the missing entity types in knowledge graphs (KG). The relationship between entities and their corresponding types is often expressed using a single relation, hasType. However, hasType has a limited capability for modeling diverse entity-type relationships in the embedding space. In this paper, we first introduce multiple auxiliary relations to model the complex entity-type relationship. We propose an efficient and robust algorithm to group similar entity types together and assign a unique auxiliary relation to each group. Then, with the auxiliary relations, we propose an Asynchronous representation learning framework for KGET, named AsyncET, where entity and type embeddings are updated alternatively. Consequently, the quality of entity embeddings is gradually improved during training by infusing type information. In addition, entity types with different granularities and semantics can be properly modeled in the embedding space. Experimental results show that AsyncET can substantially improve the performance of embedding-based methods on the KGET task and has a significant advantage over state-of-the-art neural network-based methods in terms of model sizes and inference time.
