The use of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) which constitute large networks of real-world entities and their interrelationships, has grown rapidly. A substantial body of research has emerged, exploring the integration of deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs) with KGs. This workshop aims to bring together leading researchers in the field to discuss and foster collaborations on the intersection of KG and DL/LLMs.
