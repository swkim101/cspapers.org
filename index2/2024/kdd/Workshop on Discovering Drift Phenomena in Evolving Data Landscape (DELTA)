Automated systems must adapt to evolving environments, yet many struggle with drift phenomena affecting healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity domains. The DELTA workshop addresses this by distinguishing between data and concept drift, aiming to create a practical, human-centric framework for managing drift. The workshop seeks innovative drift detection, prediction, and analysis solutions by uniting researchers and practitioners. DELTA fosters collaboration to advance the understanding and management of drift in dynamic data landscapes by featuring keynotes, paper presentations, interactive sessions, and discussions.
