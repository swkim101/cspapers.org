In the Bitcoin blockchain, an entity (e.g., a gambling service) may control multiple distinct address clusters. Links (i.e., trust relationships) between these disjoint address clusters can be established when one cluster is abandoned, and a new one is formed shortly thereafter. To link the clusters across time, we have developed a deep neural network model that exploits these synchronous actions derived from unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner. This model assesses whether two clusters exhibit synchronous temporal signatures indicative of a shared entity ownership. We validated our model on 26 real-world entities identified by WalletExplorer [36]. In addition to the existing knowledge, our analysis revealed more transaction history by linking address clusters for three major services: HelixMixer, Primedice, and Bitcoin Fog, as well as 60 other services. This enables us to address questions related to the revenue and expenditures of these services and create informative aggregate statistics.
