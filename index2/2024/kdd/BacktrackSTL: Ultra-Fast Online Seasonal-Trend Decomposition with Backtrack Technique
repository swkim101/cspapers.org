Seasonal-trend decomposition (STD) is a crucial task in time series data analysis. Due to the challenges of scalability, there is a pressing need for an ultra-fast online algorithm. However, existing algorithms either fail to handle long-period time series (such as OnlineSTL), or need time-consuming iterative processes (such as OneShotSTL). Therefore, we propose BacktrackSTL, the first non-iterative online STD algorithm with period-independent O(1) update complexity. It is also robust to outlier, seasonality shift and trend jump because of the combination of outlier-resilient smoothing, non-local seasonal filtering and backtrack technique. Experimentally, BacktrackSTL decomposes a value within 1.6 Î¼s, which is 15X faster than the state-of-the-art online algorithm OneShotSTL, while maintaining comparable accuracy to the best offline algorithm RobustSTL. We have also deployed BacktrackSTL on the top of Apache Flink to decompose monitoring metrics in Alibaba Cloud for over a year. Besides, we have open-sourced the artifact of this proposal on GitHub.
