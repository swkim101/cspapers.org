Although time-series classification has many applications in healthcare and manufacturing, the high cost of data collection and labeling hinders its widespread use. To reduce data collection and labeling costs while maintaining high classification accuracy, we propose a novel problem setting, called semi-supervised learning with low-sampling-rate time series, in which the majority of time series are collected at a low sampling rate and are unlabeled whereas the minority of time series are collected at a high sampling rate and are labeled. For this novel problem scenario, we develop the SemiTSR framework equipped with the super-resolution module and the semi-supervised learning module. Here, low-sampling-rate time series are upsampled precisely, taking periodicity and trend at each timestamp into account, and both labeled and unlabeled high-sampling-rate time series are utilized for training. In particular, consistency regularization between artificially downsampled time series derived from an original high-sampling-rate time series is effective at overcoming limited sampling rates. We demonstrate that SemiTSR significantly outperforms conventional semi-supervised learning techniques by assuring high classification accuracy with low-sampling-rate time series.
