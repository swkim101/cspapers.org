More than a decade ago, CUPED (Controlled Experiments Utilizing Pre-Experiment Data) mainstreamed the idea of variance reduction leveraging pre-experiment covariates. Since its introduction, it has been implemented, extended, and modernized by major online experimentation platforms. Despite the wide adoption, it is known by practitioners that the variance reduction rate from CUPED utilizing pre-experimental data varies case by case and has a theoretical limit. In theory, CUPED can be extended to augment a treatment effect estimator utilizing in-experiment data, but practical guidance on how to construct such an augmentation is lacking. In this article, we fill this gap by proposing a new direction for sensitivity improvement via treatment effect augmentation whereby a target metric of interest is decomposed into components with high signal-to-noise disparity. Inference in the context of this decomposition is developed using both frequentist and Bayesian theory. We provide three real world applications demonstrating different flavors of metric decomposition; these applications illustrate the gain in agility metric decomposition yields relative to an un-decomposed analysis.
