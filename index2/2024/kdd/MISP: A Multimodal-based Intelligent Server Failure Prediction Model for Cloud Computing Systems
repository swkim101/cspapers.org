Traditional server failure prediction methods predominantly rely on single-modality data such as system logs or system status curves. This reliance may lead to an incomplete understanding of system health and impending issues, proving inadequate for the complex and dynamic landscape of contemporary cloud computing environments. The potential of multimodal data to provide comprehensive insights is widely acknowledged, yet the lack of a holistic dataset and the challenges inherent in integrating features from both structured and unstructured data have impeded the exploration of multimodal-based server failure prediction. Addressing these challenges, this paper presents an industrial-scale, comprehensive dataset for server failure prediction, comprising nearly 80 types of structured and unstructured data sourced from real-world industrial cloud systems 1. Building on this resource, we introduce MISP, a model that leverages multimodal fusion techniques for server failure prediction. MISP transforms multimodal data into multi-dimensional sequences, extracts and encodes features both within and across the modalities, and ultimately computes the failure probability from the synthesized features. Experiments demonstrate that MISP significantly outperforms existing methods, enhancing prediction accuracy by approximately 25% over previous state-of-the-art approaches.
