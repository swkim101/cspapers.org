Distributed databases are fundamental infrastructures of today's large-scale software systems such as cloud systems. Detecting anomalies in distributed databases is essential for maintaining software availability. Existing approaches, predominantly developed using Loghub-a comprehensive collection of log datasets from various systems-lack datasets specifically tailored to distributed databases, which exhibit unique anomalies. Additionally, there's a notable absence of datasets encompassing multi-anomaly, multi-node logs. Consequently, models built upon these datasets, primarily designed for standalone systems, are inadequate for distributed databases, and the prevalent method of deeming an entire cluster anomalous based on irregularities in a single node leads to a high false-positive rate. This paper addresses the unique anomalies and multivariate nature of logs in distributed databases. We expose the first open-sourced, comprehensive dataset with multivariate logs from distributed databases. Utilizing this dataset, we conduct an extensive study to identify multiple database anomalies and to assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art anomaly detection using multivariate log data. Our findings reveal that relying solely on logs from a single node is insufficient for accurate anomaly detection on distributed database. Leveraging these insights, we propose MultiLog, an innovative multivariate log-based anomaly detection approach tailored for distributed databases. Our experiments, based on this novel dataset, demonstrate MultiLog's superiority, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by approximately 12%.
