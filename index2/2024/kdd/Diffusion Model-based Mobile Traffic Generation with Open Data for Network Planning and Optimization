With the rapid development of the Fifth Generation Mobile Communication Technology (5G) networks, network planning and optimization have become increasingly crucial. Generating high-fidelity network traffic data can preemptively estimate the network demands of mobile users, which holds potential for network operators to improve network performance. However, the data required by existing generation methods is predominantly inaccessible to the public, resulting in a lack of reproducibility for the models and high deployment costs in practice. In this article, we propose an Open data-based Diffusion model for mobile traffic generation (OpenDiff), where a multi-positive contrastive learning algorithm is designed to construct conditional information for the diffusion model using entirely publicly available satellite remote sensing images, Point of Interest (POI), and population data. The conditional information contains relevant human activities in geographical areas, which can effectively guide the generation of network traffic data. We further design an attention-based fusion mechanism to capture the implicit correlations between network traffic and human activity features, enhancing the modelâ€™s controllable generation capability. We conduct evaluations on three different cities with varying scales, where experimental results verify that our proposed model outperforms existing methods by 14.36% and 13.05% in terms of generation fidelity and controllability. To further validate the effectiveness of the model, we leverage the generated traffic data to assist the operators with network planning on a real-world network optimization platform of China Mobile Communications Corporation.
