The Generative AI (AIGC) Day at KDD'24 is a dedicated full-day event for generative AI at KDD. This is an opportunity to bring together researchers, practitioners, and startups to share the insights about the cutting-edge advancements and to discuss the potential societal impacts of LLMs and AIGC. It is exciting that this year, we have invited speakers from both industry (e.g., Amazon, Zhipu AI) and academia (e.g., USC, UCLA). The topics cover various perspectives of generative AI including foundation models, streaming LLMs, LLM training and inference. As demonstrated, data plays a crucial role in developing cutting-edge generative AI models. For example, the Gemini Team has found that "data quality is an important factor for highly-performing models...''. To date, there is still significant room to define design principles and develop methods for improved data collection, selection, and synthetic data generation for the pre-training and alignment of language, vision, and multi-modal models. Therefore, the Day will invite the speakers and KDD audience to discuss the challenges and opportunities for data mining researchers in the era of generative AI.
