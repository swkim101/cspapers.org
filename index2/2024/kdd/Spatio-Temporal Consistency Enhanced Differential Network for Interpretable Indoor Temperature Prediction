Indoor temperature prediction is crucial for decision-making in central heating systems. Beyond accuracy, predictions shall be interpretable, i.e. conform to the laws of physics; otherwise, it may lead to system failures or unsafe conditions. However, deep learning models often face criticism regarding interpretability, which limits their application in such settings. To this end, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Consistency enhanced Differential Network (CONST) for interpretable indoor temperature prediction. Our approach mainly consists of a differential predictive module and a spatio-temporal consistency module. Modeling the influential factors, the first module solves the issue of multicollinearity through the differential operation. Considering the heterogeneity of global and local data distributions, the second module characterizes the temporal and spatial consistency to mine the universal pattern by multi-task learning, thereby improving the prediction interpretability. Besides, we propose a set of interpretability metrics to overcome the drawbacks of partial dependence plot metric, which are more practical, zero-centered, flexible, and numerical. We conclude experiments on a real-world dataset with four heating stations. The results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over various baselines, where the interpretability can be improved by more than 8 times on cRPD while maintaining high accuracy. We developed CONST on the SmartHeat system, providing hourly indoor temperature forecasts for 13 heating stations in northern China.
