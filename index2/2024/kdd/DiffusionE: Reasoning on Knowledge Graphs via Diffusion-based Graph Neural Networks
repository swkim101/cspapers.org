Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in reasoning within Knowledge Graphs (KGs), gathering increasing attention. Our idea stems from the observation that the prior work typically employs hand-designed or sample-designed paradigms in the process of message propagation, engaging a set of adjacent entities at each step of propagation. As a result, such methods struggle with the increasing number of entities involved as propagation steps extend. Moreover, they neglect the message interactions between adjacent entities and propagation relations in KG reasoning, leading to semantic inconsistency during the message aggregation phase. To address these issues, we introduce a novel knowledge graph embedding method through a diffusion process, termed DiffusionE. Specifically, we reformulate the message propagation in knowledge reasoning as a diffusion process, regarding the message semantics as the diffusion signal. In this sense, guided by semantic information, messages can be transmitted between nodes effectively and adaptively. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis suggests our method can leverage an optimal diffusivity for message propagation in the semantic interactions of KGs. It shows that DiffusionE effectively leverages message interactions between entities and propagation relations, ensuring semantic consistency in KG reasoning. Comprehensive experiments reveal that our method attains state-of-the-art performance compared to prior work on several well-established benchmarks.
