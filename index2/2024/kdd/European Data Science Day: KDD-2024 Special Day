The European Data Science Day offers a full day focused exclusively on innovative KDD-relevant research and development projects from national and regional funding programs, as well as corporate, start-up, and nonprofit channels. The idea is to bring together a diverse community of researchers in Data Science, Machine Learning, Language Technologies, and Knowledge Discovery, as well as partnerships in the social and physical sciences/arts, to showcase the state-of-the-art in research and applications.
