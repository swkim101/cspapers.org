Due to the timeliness and uncertainty of data acquisition, label shift, which assumes that the source (training) and target (test) label distributions differ, occurs with the changing environment and reduces the generalization ability of traditional models. To correct the label shift, existing methods estimate the true label distribution by prediction of target data from a source classifier, which results in high variance, especially with large label shift. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel approach termed as Label Shift Correction via Bidirectional Marginal Distribution Matching (BMDM). Our approach matchs the label and feature marginal distributions simultaneously to ensure the stability of estimated class proportions. We prove theoretically that there is a unique optimal solution, i.e., true target label distribution, for our approach under mild conditions, and an efficient optimization strategy is also proposed. On this basis, in multi-shot scenario where label distribution changes continuously, we extend BMDM by designing a new distribution matching mechanism and constructing a regularization term that constrains the direction of label distribution change. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing state-of-the-arts methods.
