Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests (aka multi-faceted preferences) based on their behaviors, aiming to accurately capture users' complex preferences. Existing methods attempt to model each interest of users through a distinct representation, but these multi-interest representations easily collapse into similar ones due to a lack of effective guidance. In this paper, we propose a generic multi-interest method for sequential recommendation, achieving disentangled representation learning of diverse interests technically and theoretically. To alleviate the collapse issue of multi-interests, we propose to conduct item partition guided by their likelihood of being co-purchased in a global view. It can encourage items in each group to focus on a discriminated interest, thus achieving effective disentangled learning of multi-interests. Specifically, we first prove the theoretical connection between item partition and spectral clustering, demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating item-level and facet-level collapse issues that hinder existing disentangled methods. To efficiently optimize this problem, we then propose a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based method that samples small-scale sub-graphs from two separate MRFs, thus it can be approximated with a cross-entropy loss and optimized through contrastive learning. Finally, we perform multi-task learning to seamlessly align item partition learning with multi-interest modeling for more accurate recommendation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can flexibly integrate with existing multi-interest models as a plugin to enhance their performances.
