Machine learning techniques are now integral to the advancement of intelligent urban services, playing a crucial role in elevating the efficiency, sustainability, and livability of urban environments. The recent emergence of foundation models such as ChatGPT marks a revolutionary shift in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Their unparalleled capabilities in contextual understanding, problem solving, and adaptability across a wide range of tasks suggest that integrating these models into urban domains could have a transformative impact on the development of smart cities. Despite growing interest in Urban Foundation Models (UFMs), this burgeoning field faces challenges such as a lack of clear definitions and systematic reviews. To this end, this paper first introduces the concept of UFMs and discusses the unique challenges involved in building them. We then propose a data-centric taxonomy that categorizes and clarifies current UFM-related works, based on urban data modalities and types. Furthermore, we explore the application landscape of UFMs, detailing their potential impact in various urban contexts.
