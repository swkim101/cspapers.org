In recommendation systems, the timely delivery of new content to their relevant audiences is critical for generating a growing and high quality collection of content for all users. The nature of this problem requires retrieval models to be able to make inferences in real time and with high relevance. There are two specific challenges for cold start contents. First, the information loss problem in a standard Two Tower model, due to the limited feature interactions between the user and item towers, is exacerbated for cold start items due to training data sparsity. Second, the huge volume of user-generated content in industry applications today poses a big bottleneck in the end-to-end latency of recommending new content. To overcome the two challenges, we propose a novel architecture, the Item History Model (IHM). IHM directly injects user-interaction information into the item tower to overcome information loss. In addition, IHM incorporates an inductive structure using attention-based pooling to eliminate the need for recurring training, a key bottleneck for the real-timeness. On both public and industry datasets, we demonstrate that IHM can not only outperform baselines in recommending cold start contents, but also achieves SoTA real-timeness in industry applications.
