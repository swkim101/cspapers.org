Accurate vehicle trajectory recovery enables providing indispensable data foundations in intelligent urban transportation. However, existing methods face two challenges: i) the inability to process city-wide vehicle trajectories, and ii) the dependence on a substantial amount of accurate GPS trajectories for model training, leading to poor generalization ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel trajectory recovery system based on vehicle snapshots captured by traffic cameras, named TrajRecovery. TrajRecovery consists of three main components: i) Preprocessor processes traffic cameras and vehicle snapshots to provide necessary data for trajectory recovery; ii) Spatial Transfer Probabilistic Model (STPM) integrates road conditions and driver behavior to compute turning probability at intersections; iii) Trajectory Generator utilizes the output probabilities from STPM to recover a continuous and most likely complete trajectory. We evaluate TrajRecovery on two real datasets from a city in China, demonstrating substantial performance gains compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our system is deployed in practical applications at Huawei Company, achieving extraordinary profits in business scenarios.
