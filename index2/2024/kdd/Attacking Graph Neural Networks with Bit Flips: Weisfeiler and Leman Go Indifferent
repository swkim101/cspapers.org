Prior attacks on graph neural networks have focused on graph poisoning and evasion, neglecting the network's weights and biases. For convolutional neural networks, however, the risk arising from bit flip attacks is well recognized. We show that the direct application of a traditional bit flip attack to graph neural networks is of limited effectivity. Hence, we discuss the Injectivity Bit Flip Attack, the first bit flip attack designed specifically for graph neural networks. Our attack targets the learnable neighborhood aggregation functions in quantized message passing neural networks, degrading their ability to distinguish graph structures and impairing the expressivity of the Weisfeiler-Leman test. We find that exploiting mathematical properties specific to certain graph neural networks significantly increases their vulnerability to bit flip attacks. The Injectivity Bit Flip Attack can degrade the maximal expressive Graph Isomorphism Networks trained on graph property prediction datasets to random output by flipping only a small fraction of the network's bits, demonstrating its higher destructive power compared to traditional bit flip attacks transferred from convolutional neural networks. Our attack is transparent, motivated by theoretical insights and confirmed by extensive empirical results.
