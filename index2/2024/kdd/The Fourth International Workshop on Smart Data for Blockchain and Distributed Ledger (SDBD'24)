With the advent of Bitcoin, a cryptographically-enabled peer-to-peer digital payment system, blockchain together with a whole package of distributed ledger technologies, which serve as the underlying foundation of all the crypto-currencies, have been gaining attention from both academia and industry in the last fifteen years. The recent years have witnessed tremendous momentum in the development of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, largely due to the impressive rise in the market capital of these digital tokens. More and more industries, from banking and insurance, to supply chain and e-commerce, are quickly realizing the great potential in blockchain technology in efficiency boost, process automation and secure data sharing across otherwise isolated data silos. Furthermore, as the recognition of the data value began to sink in, data assets has become an essential part of the development of enterprises and countries. Blockchain technology is regarded as the foundation of digital economy and provides an effective approach for data ownership, pricing and transactions, which are the core issues of data asset management. However, the potential implications of Blockchain technologies go far beyond their application as the technological backbone for cryptocurrencies. Web3.0, using blockchain as underlying technology, allow for various novel application scenarios, which are built upon distributed consensus and thus are hard to block or censor while providing public verifiability of peer-to-peer transactions without a trusted central party. Web3.0 are expected to become the main front for a plethora of highly expressive applications. To more thoroughly explore the potential of blockchain and web3.0 and promote their progress, SDBD'24 will provide a forum for the most recent blockchain and web3.0 research, innovations, and applications, bridging the gap between theory and practice in the design.
