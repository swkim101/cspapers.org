Graph dataset condensation (GDC) reduces a dataset with many graphs into a smaller dataset with fewer graphs while maintaining model training accuracy. GDC saves the storage cost and hence accelerates training. Although several GDC methods have been proposed, they are all supervised and require massive labels for the graphs, while graph labels can be scarce in many practical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a self-supervised graph dataset condensation method called SGDC, which does not require label information. Our initial design starts with the classical bilevel optimization paradigm for dataset condensation and incorporates contrastive learning techniques. But such a solution yields poor accuracy due to the biased gradient estimation caused by data augmentation. To solve this problem, we introduce representation matching, which conducts training by aligning the representations produced by the condensed graphs with the target representations generated by a pre-trained SSL model. This design eliminates the need for data augmentation and avoids biased gradient. We further propose a graph attention kernel, which not only improves accuracy but also reduces running time when combined with self-supervised kernel ridge regression (KRR). To simplify SGDC and make it more robust, we adopt a adjacency matrix reusing approach, which reuses the topology of the original graphs for the condensed graphs instead of repeatedly learning topology during training. Our evaluations on seven graph datasets find that SGDC improves model accuracy by up to 9.7% compared with 5 state-of-the-art baselines, even if they use label information. Moreover, SGDC is significantly more efficient than the baselines.
