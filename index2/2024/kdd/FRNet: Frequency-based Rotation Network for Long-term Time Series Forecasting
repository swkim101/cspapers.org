Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values for a long time based on historical data. The period term is an essential component of the time series, which is complex yet important for LTSF. Although existing studies have achieved promising results, they still have limitations in modeling dynamic complicated periods. Most studies only focus on static periods with fixed time steps, while very few studies attempt to capture dynamic periods in the time domain. In this paper, we dissect the original time series in time and frequency domains and empirically find that changes in periods are more easily captured and quantified in the frequency domain. Based on this observation, we propose to explore dynamic period features using rotation in the frequency domain. To this end, we develop the frequency-based rotation network (FRNet), a novel LTSF method to effectively capture the features of the dynamic complicated periods. FRNet decomposes the original time series into period and trend components. Based on the complex-valued linear networks, it leverages a period frequency rotation module to predict the period component and a patch frequency rotation module to predict the trend component, respectively. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FRNet over various state-of-the-art methods.
