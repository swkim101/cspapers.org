CAD assembly modeling, which refers to using CAD software to de-sign new products from a catalog of existing machine components, is important in the industrial field. The graph neural network (GNN) based recommender system for CAD assembly modeling can help designers make decisions and speed up the design process by recommending the next required component based on the existing components in CAD software. These components can be represented as a graph naturally. However, present recommender systems for CAD assembly modeling adopt fixed GNN architectures, which may be sub-optimal for different manufacturers with different data distribution. Therefore, to customize a well-suited recommender system for different manufacturers, we propose a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, dubbed CusGNN, which can design data-specific GNN automatically. Specifically, we design a search space from three dimensions (i.e., aggregation, fusion, and readout functions), which contains a wide variety of GNN architectures. Then, we develop an effective differentiable search algorithm to search high-performing GNN from the search space. Experimental results show that the customized GNNs achieve 1.5-5.1% higher top-10 accuracy compared to previous manual designed methods, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach.
