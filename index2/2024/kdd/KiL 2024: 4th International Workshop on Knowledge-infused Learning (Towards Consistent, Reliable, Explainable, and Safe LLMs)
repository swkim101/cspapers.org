The Knowledge-infused Learning Workshop is a recurring event in ACM's KDD Conference that gathers the research community on knowledge graphs and knowledge-enabled learning, grounded neurosymbolic AI, explainable and safe AI, and applications in high-stakes decision-making problems. This year, the workshop aligned with Biden's vision of Responsible AI Development.
