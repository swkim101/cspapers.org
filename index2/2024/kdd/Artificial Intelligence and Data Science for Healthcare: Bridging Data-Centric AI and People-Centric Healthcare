KDD AIDSH 2024 aims to foster discussions and developments that push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) in healthcare, enhance diagnostic accuracy and promote human-centric approaches to healthcare, thus stimulating future interdisciplinary collaborations. This year's symposium will focus on expanding the application of AI/DS in healthcare/medicine and bridging existing gaps. The workshop invites submissions of full papers as well as work-in-progress on the application of AI/DS in healthcare. The workshop will feature three invited talks from eminent speakers, spanning academia, industry, and clinical researchers. In addition, selected papers will be invited to publish in Health Data Science, a Science Partner Journal. This summary provides a brief description of the half-day workshop to be held on August 26th, 2024. The webpage for the workshop can be found at https://aimel.ai/kdd2024aidsh.
