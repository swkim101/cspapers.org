Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have proven successful for graph-related tasks. However, many GNNs methods require labeled data, which is challenging to obtain. To tackle this, graph contrastive learning (GCL) have gained attention. GCL learns by contrasting similar nodes (positives) and dissimilar nodes (negatives). Current GCL methods, using data augmentation for positive samples and random selection for negative samples, can be sub-optimal due to limited positive samples and the possibility of false-negative samples. In this study, we propose an enhanced objective addressing these issues. We first introduce an ideal objective with all positive and no false-negative samples, then transform it probabilistically based on sampling distributions. We next model these distributions with node similarity and derive an enhanced objective. Comprehensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced objective for a broad set of GCL models.
