Continual learning closely emulates human learning, which allows a model to learn from a stream of tasks sequentially without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Replay-based continual learning methods mitigate forgetting and improve performance by reintroducing data belonging to old tasks, however a replay method's performance may deteriorate when the reintroduced data does not effectively represent all experienced data. To address this concern, we propose the Sketch-based Replay Projection (SRP) method to capture and retain the original data stream's distribution within stored memory. SRP augments existing replay frameworks and introduces a two-fold approach. First, we develop a sketch-based sample selection technique to approximate feature distributions within distinct tasks, thereby capturing a wide distribution of examples for subsequent replay. Second, we propose a data compression method which projects examples into a reduced-dimensional space while preserving inter-example relationships and emphasizing inter-class disparities, encouraging diverse representations of each class while maintaining memory requirements similar to existing replay methodologies. Our experimental results demonstrate that SRP enhances replay diversity and improves the performance of existing replay models.
