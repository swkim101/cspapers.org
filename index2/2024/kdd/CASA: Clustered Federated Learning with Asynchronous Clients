Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) is an emerging paradigm to extract insights from data on IoT devices. Through iterative client clustering and model aggregation, CFL adeptly manages data heterogeneity, ensures privacy, and delivers personalized models to heterogeneous devices. Traditional CFL approaches, which operate synchronously, suffer from prolonged latency for waiting slow devices during clustering and aggregation. This paper advocates a shift to asynchronous CFL, allowing the server to process client updates as they arrive. This shift enhances training efficiency yet introduces complexities to the iterative training cycle. To this end, we present CASA, a novel CFL scheme for Clustering-Aggregation Synergy under Asynchrony. Built upon a holistic theoretical understanding of asynchrony's impact on CFL, CASA adopts a bi-level asynchronous aggregation method and a buffer-aided dynamic clustering strategy to harmonize between clustering and aggregation. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks show that CASA outperforms representative baselines in model accuracy and achieves 2.28-6.49Ã— higher convergence speed.
