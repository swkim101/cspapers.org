Operating and maintaining hyperscale data centers involving millions of service hosts has been an extremely intricate task to tackle for top Internet companies. Incessant system failures cost operators countless hours of browsing through performance metrics to diagnose the underlying root cause to prevent the recurrence. Although many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have used time-series causal discovery to construct causal relationships among anomalous metrics, they only focus on homogeneous service-level performance metrics and fail to yield useful insights on heterogeneous host-level metrics. To address the challenge, this study presents FaultInsight, a highly interpretable deep causal host fault diagnosing framework that offers diagnostic insights from various perspectives to reduce human effort in troubleshooting. We evaluate FaultInsight using dozens of incidents collected from our production environment. FaultInsight provides markedly better root cause identification accuracy than SOTA baselines in our incident dataset. It also shows outstanding advantages in terms of deployability in real production systems. Our engineers are deeply impressed by FaultInsight's ability to interpret incidents from multiple perspectives, helping them quickly understand the mechanism behind the faults.
