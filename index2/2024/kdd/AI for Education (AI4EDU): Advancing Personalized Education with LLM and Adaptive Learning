Recent advanced AI technologies, especially large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, have significantly advanced the field of data mining and led to the development of various LLM-based applications. AI for education (AI4EDU) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of data mining, machine learning, and education, with increasing importance and extraordinary potential. In this field, LLM and adaptive learning-based models can be utilized as interfaces in human-in-the-loop education systems, where the model serves as a mediator among the teacher, students, and machine capabilities, including its own. This perspective has several benefits, including the ability to personalize interactions, allow unprecedented flexibility and adaptivity for human-AI collaboration and improve the user experience. However, several challenges still exist, including the need for more robust and efficient algorithms, designing effective user interfaces, and ensuring ethical considerations are addressed. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge AI technologies for personalized education, especially the potential of LLMs and adaptive learning technologies.
