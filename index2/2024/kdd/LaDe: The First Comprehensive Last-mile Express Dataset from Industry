Real-world last-mile express datasets are crucial for research in logistics, supply chain management, and spatio-temporal data mining. Despite a plethora of algorithms developed to date, no widely accepted, publicly available last-mile express dataset exists to support research in this field. In this paper, we introduce LaDe, the first publicly available last-mile express dataset with millions of packages from the industry. LaDe has three unique characteristics: (1)Large-scale. It involves 10,677k packages of 21k couriers over 6 months of real-world operation. (2)Comprehensive information. It offers original package information, task-event information, as well as couriers' detailed trajecotries and road networks. (3)Diversity. The dataset includes data from various scenarios, including package pick-up and delivery, and from multiple cities, each with its unique spatio-temporal patterns due to their distinct characteristics such as populations. We verify LaDe on three tasks by running several classical baseline models per task. We believe that the large-scale, comprehensive, diverse feature of LaDe can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the supply chain community, data mining community, and beyond. The dataset and code is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe.
