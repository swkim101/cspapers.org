Learning path recommendation aims to provide learners with a reasonable order of items to achieve their learning goals. Intuitively, the learning process on the learning path can be metaphorically likened to walking. Despite extensive efforts in this area, most previous methods mainly focus on the relationship among items but overlook the difficulty of items, which may raise two issues from a real walking perspective: (1) The path may be rough: When learners tread the path without considering item difficulty, it's akin to walking a dark, uneven road, making learning harder and dampening interest. (2) The path may be inefficient: Allowing learners only a few attempts on very challenging items before switching, or persisting with a difficult item despite numerous attempts without mastery, can result in inefficiencies in the learning journey. To conquer the above limitations, we propose a novel method named Difficulty-constrained Learning Path Recommendation (DLPR), which is aware of item difficulty. Specifically, we first explicitly categorize items into learning items and practice items, then construct a hierarchical graph to model and leverage item difficulty adequately. Then we design a Difficulty-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (DHRL) framework to facilitate learning paths with efficiency and smoothness. Finally, extensive experiments on three different simulators demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.
