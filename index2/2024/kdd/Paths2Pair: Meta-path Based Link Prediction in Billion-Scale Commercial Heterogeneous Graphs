Link prediction, determining if a relation exists between two entities, is an essential task in the analysis of heterogeneous graphs with diverse entities and relations. Despite extensive research in link prediction, most existing works focus on predicting the relation type between given pairs of entities. However, it is almost impractical to check every entity pair when trying to find most hidden relations in a billion-scale heterogeneous graph due to the billion squared number of possible pairs. Meanwhile, most methods aggregate information at the node level, potentially leading to the loss of direct connection information between the two nodes. In this paper, we introduce Paths2Pair, a novel framework to address these limitations for link prediction in billion-scale commercial heterogeneous graphs. (i) First, it selects a subset of reliable entity pairs for prediction based on relevant meta-paths. (ii) Then, it utilizes various types of content information from the meta-paths between each selected entity pair to predict whether a target relation exists. We first evaluate our Paths2Pair based on a large-scale dataset, and results show Paths2Pair outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly. We then deploy our Paths2Pair on JD Logistics, one of the largest logistics companies in the world, for business expansion. The uncovered relations by Paths2Pair have helped JD Logistics identify 108,709 contacts to attract new company customers, resulting in an 84% increase in the success rate compared to the state-of-the-practice solution, demonstrating the practical value of our framework. We have released the code of our framework at https://github.com/JQHang/Paths2Pair.
