Inductive relation reasoning in knowledge graphs aims at predicting missing triplets involving unseen entities and/or unseen relations. While subgraph-based methods that reason about the local structure surrounding a candidate triplet have shown promise, they often fall short in accurately modeling the causal dependence between a triplet's subgraph and its ground-truth label. This limitation typically results in a susceptibility to spurious correlations caused by confounders, adversely affecting generalization capabilities. Herein, we introduce a novel front-door adjustment-based approach designed to learn the causal relationship between subgraphs and their ground-truth labels, specifically for inductive relation prediction. We conceptualize the semantic information of subgraphs as a mediator and employ a graph data augmentation mechanism to create augmented subgraphs. Furthermore, we integrate a fusion module and a decoder within the front-door adjustment framework, enabling the estimation of the mediator's combination with augmented subgraphs. We also introduce the reparameterization trick in the fusion model to enhance model robustness. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method's superiority in inductive relation prediction, particularly for tasks involving unseen entities and unseen relations. Additionally, the subgraphs reconstructed by our decoder offer valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing transparency and interpretability.
