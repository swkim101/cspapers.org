In the era of information explosion, news recommender systems are crucial for users to effectively and efficiently discover their interested news. However, most of the existing news recommender systems face two major issues, hampering recommendation quality. Firstly, they often oversimplify users' reading interests, neglecting their hierarchical nature, spanning from high-level event (e.g., US Election) related interests to low-level news article-specifc interests. Secondly, existing work often assumes a simplistic context, disregarding the prevalence of fake news and political bias under the real-world context. This oversight leads to recommendations of biased or fake news, posing risks to individuals and society. To this end, this paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel framework, the Hierarchical and Disentangling Interest learning framework (HDInt). HDInt incorporates a hierarchical interest learning module and a disentangling interest learning module. The former captures users' high- and low-level interests, enhancing next-news recommendation accuracy. The latter effectively separates polarity and veracity information from news contents and model them more specifcally, promoting fairness- and truth-aware reading interest learning for unbiased and true news recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate HDInt's superiority over state-of-the-art news recommender systems in delivering accurate, unbiased, and true news recommendations.
