The KDD workshop on Evaluation and Trustworthiness of Generative AI Models aims to address the critical need for reliable generative AI technologies by exploring comprehensive evaluation strategies. This workshop will delve into various aspects of assessing generative AI models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models, focusing on trustworthiness, safety, bias, fairness, and ethical considerations. With an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, the workshop will feature invited talks, peer-reviewed paper presentations, and panel discussions to advance the state of the art in generative AI evaluation.
