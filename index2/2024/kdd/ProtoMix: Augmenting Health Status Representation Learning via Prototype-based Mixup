With the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) data, deep learning techniques have been broadly utilized for various health prediction tasks. Nevertheless, the labeled data scarcity issue restricts the prediction power of these deep models. To enhance the generalization capability of deep learning models when faced with such situations, a common trend is to train generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models for data augmentation. However, due to limitations in sample size and potential label imbalance issues, these methods are prone to mode collapse problems. This results in the generation of new samples that fail to preserve the subtype structure within EHR data, thereby limiting their practicality in health prediction tasks that generally require detailed patient phenotyping. Aiming at the above problems, we propose a Prototype-based Mixup method, dubbed ProtoMix, which combines prior knowledge of intrinsic data features from subtype centroids (i.e., prototypes) to guide the synthesis of new samples. Specifically, ProtoMix employs a prototype-guided mixup training task to shift the decision boundary away from the subtypes. Then, ProtoMix optimizes the sampling weights in different areas of the data manifold via a prototype-guided mixup sampling strategy. Throughout the training process, ProtoMix dynamically expands the training distribution using an adaptive mixing coefficient computation method. Experimental evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ProtoMix.
