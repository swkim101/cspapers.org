An intelligent assistant shall be an agent that knows you and the world, can receive your requests or predict your needs, and provide you the right services at the right time with your permission. As smart devices such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Ray-ban Meta get popular, Intelligent Assistants are gradually playing an important role in people's lives. The Emergence of wearable devices brings more opportunities and calls for the next generation of Intelligent Assistants. In this talk, we discuss the many challenges and opportunities we face to grow intelligent assistants from voice-only to multi-modal, from context-agnostic to context-aware, from listening to the users' requests to predicting the user's needs, and from server-side to on-device. We describe our LLM-based solutions toward multi-modality, contextualization, personalization, and retrieval-augmentation, and discuss how they are enabled on devices. We expect these new challenges to open doors to new research areas and start a new chapter for providing personal assistance services
