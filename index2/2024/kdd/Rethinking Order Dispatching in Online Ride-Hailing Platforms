Achieving optimal order dispatching has been a long-standing challenge for online ride-hailing platforms. Early methods would make shortsighted matchings as they only consider order prices alone as the edge weights in the driver-order bipartite graph, thus harming the platform's revenue. To address this problem, recent works evaluate the value of the order's destination region to be the long-term income a driver could obtain in average in such region and incorporate it into the order's edge weight to influence the matching results. However, they often result in insufficient driver supplies in many regions, as the values evaluated in different regions vary greatly, mainly because the impact of one region's value on the future number of drivers and revenue in other regions is overlooked. This paper models such impact within a cooperative Markov game, which involves each value's impact over the platform's revenue with the goal to find the optimal region values for revenue maximization. To solve this game, our work proposes a novelgoal-reaching collaboration (GRC) algorithm that realizes credit assignment from a novel goal-reaching perspective, addressing the difficulty for accurate credit assignment with large-scale agents of previous methods and resolving the conflict between credit assignment and offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, during training, GRC predicts the city's future state through an environment model and utilizes a scoring model to rate the predicted states to judge their levels of profitability, where high-scoring states are regarded as the goal states. Then, the policies in the game are updated to promote the city to stay in the goal states for as long as possible. To evaluate GRC, we deploy a baseline policy online in several cities for three weeks to collect real-world dataset. Training and testing results on the collected dataset indicate that our GRC consistently outperforms the baselines in different cities and peak periods.
