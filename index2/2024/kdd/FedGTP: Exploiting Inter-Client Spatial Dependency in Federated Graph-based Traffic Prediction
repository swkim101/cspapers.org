Graph-based methods have witnessed tremendous success in traffic prediction, largely attributed to their superior ability in capturing and modeling spatial dependencies. However, urban-scale traffic data are usually distributed among various owners, limited in sharing due to privacy restrictions. This fragmentation of data severely hinders interaction across clients, impeding the utilization of inter-client spatial dependencies. Existing studies have yet to address this non-trivial issue, thereby leading to sub-optimal performance. To fill this gap, we propose FedGTP, a new federated graph-based traffic prediction framework that promotes adaptive exploitation of inter-client spatial dependencies to recover close-to-optimal performance complying with privacy regulations like GDPR. We validate FedGTP via large-scale application-driven experiments on real-world datasets. Extensive baseline comparison, ablation study and case study demonstrate that FedGTP indeed surpasses existing methods through fully recovering inter-client spatial dependencies, achieving 21.08%, 13.48%, 19.90% decrease on RMSE, MAE and MAPE, respectively.
