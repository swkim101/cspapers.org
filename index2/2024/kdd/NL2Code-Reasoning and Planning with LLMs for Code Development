There is huge value in making software development more productive with AI. An important component of this vision is the capability to translate natural language to a programming language ("NL2Code") and thus to significantly accelerate the speed at which code is written. This workshop gathers researchers, practitioners, and users from industry and academia that are working on NL2Code, specifically on the problem of using large language models to convert statements posed in a human language to a formal programming language.
