Urban public nuisance events, like garbage exposure, illegal parking, facilities damage, and etc., impair the quality of life for city residents. Predicting and controlling these nuisances is crucial but complicated due to their ties to subjective and psychological factors. In this study, we reveal a significant correlation between such nuisances and meteorological indicators, influenced by the impact of climate on people's psychological states. We employ meteorology predictions that are integrated in Hawkes processes to enhance the accuracy of predicting the category and timing of these nuisances. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Two-Tower Transformer (ST-T3), which simultaneously considers spatial data and further improves the prediction accuracy. Evaluated by about three-year data from both downtown and suburban Shanghai, our method outperforms both traditional and advanced prediction systems. We share a portion of the de-identified dataset for open research.
