Urban mobility undergoes a profound decline in the aftermath of a disaster, subsequently exhibiting a complex recovery trajectory. Effectively capturing and predicting this dynamic recovery process holds paramount importance for devising more efficient post-disaster recovery strategies, such as resource allocation to areas with protracted recovery periods. Existing models for post-disaster mobility recovery predominantly employ basic mathematical methods, which are strongly based on simplifying assumptions, and their limited parameters restrict their capacity to fully capture the mobility recovery patterns. In response to this gap, we introduce the Coupled Dynamic Graph ODE Network (CDGON) to model the intricate dynamics of post-disaster mobility recovery. Our model seamlessly integrates existing physical knowledge pertaining to post-disaster mobility recovery and incorporates the nuanced interactions between intra-regional and inter-regional population flows. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model in capturing the dynamic recovery patterns of urban population mobility in post-disaster scenarios, surpassing the capabilities of current dynamic graph prediction models.
