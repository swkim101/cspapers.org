Many failure root cause analysis (RCA) algorithms for microser-vices have been proposed with the widespread adoption of mi-croservices systems. Existing algorithms generally focus on RCA with ranking single-level ( e.g. metric-level or service-level) root cause candidates (RCCs) with comprehensive monitoring metrics. However, many heterogeneous RCCs exist with limited observability in real-world microservices systems. Further, we find that the limited observability may result in inaccurate RCA through real-world failures in eBay. In this paper, for the first time, we propose to “model RCCs as latent variables”. The core idea is to infer the status of RCCs as latent variables with related monitoring metrics instead of directly extracting features from only the observable metrics. Based on this, we propose LatentScope, an unsupervised RCA framework with heterogeneous RCCs under limited observability. A dual-space graph is proposed to model both observable and unobservable variables, with many-to-many relationships between spaces. To achieve fast inference of latent variables and RCA, we propose the LatentRegressor algorithm, which includes Regression-based Latent-space Intervention Recognition (RLIR) to achieve intervention recognition-based RCA in latent space. La-tentScope has been deployed in eBay’s production environment
