Continuous monitoring of patients in psychiatric seclusion rooms is essential yet challenging, particularly with staff shortages that can delay responses to sudden changes in patient conditions. To this end, we propose PsiMo, a remote patient state monitoring system using mmWave Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike existing vision-based or wearable systems, PsiMo captures patient movements without compromising privacy or risking potential self-harm. Our system continuously monitors patient's state of motion to alert medical staff in the event of abnormal conditions, such as agitation. Our preliminary evaluation shows PsiMo achieves 97.0% accuracy in patient state classification, demonstrating its potential for effective, non-contact monitoring.
