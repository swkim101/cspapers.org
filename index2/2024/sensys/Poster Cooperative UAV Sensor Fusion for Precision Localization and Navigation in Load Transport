Cooperative UAV transport operations in GPS-denied environments pose significant challenges in localization, coordination, and payload stability. This paper introduces a vision-based Leader-Follower drone system using MAVROS and depth cameras for real-time pose estimation and control. The leader transmits pose and velocity updates to the follower, ensuring synchronized movements. The system maintained a 50 Hz update rate, achieving 28 FPS, 12 ms latency, and 1.2 cm position error on a straight path. The 3-DEE system effectively managed payload-induced attitude variations with low vibration levels and improved speed accuracy. These results confirm the system's robustness for precise localization and stable cooperative UAV transport.
