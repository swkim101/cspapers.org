The future of networking must address the connectivity demands of billions of people and trillions of networked devices. The Intelligent Internet of Everything (IoE) is widely considered the next evolution of the Internet, yet it poses significant challenges to the current TCP/IP architecture. To overcome these challenges, the concept of the Cybertwin network has been proposed as a promising future Internet architecture. To facilitate the advancement of Cybertwin-related research, we have developed CTSim, a Cybertwin network simulator. Our demo demonstrates that the Cybertwin network could effectively enhances mobility, availability, and security in Internet of Things scenarios, making it a powerful tool for researchers in these fields.
