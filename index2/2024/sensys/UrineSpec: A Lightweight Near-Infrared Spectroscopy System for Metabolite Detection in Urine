Urine concentration levels of important biomarkers offer valuable insights for the detection of chronic diseases. However, existing detection methods are hindered by high costs or limited performance, preventing long-term monitoring of urine components in domestic settings. This paper introduces UrineSpec, a low-cost, lightweight system using near-infrared (NIR) light for precise detection of trace macromolecules in urine. It proposes a novel method that recovers accurate multi-absorption features from coarse optical responses to obtain fine-grained spectra. Based on this, we manage to extract the absorption spectrum of the substance from the complex mixed spectra and achieve accurate concentration identification. Extensive experimental results indicate that UrineSpec can monitor five concentration levels of three important biomarkers with an accuracy of uric acid, albumin and glucose over 98.4%, 98.8% and 98.6% respectively. This high level of precision underscores the potential of UrineSpec as an effective tool for non-invasive chronic disease monitoring and early intervention.
