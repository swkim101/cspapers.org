The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework sets ambitious targets for 2023, including halting human-induced species extinction. Achieving these requires comprehensive data on global biodiversity patterns, which can only be gathered through in-situ distributed sensor networks. However, these multi-device networks are constrained by battery lifetimes, must gather rich data from power-hungry sensors, and yet need to be deployed in remote environments for long periods. This note introduces a prototype multi-sensor device, and outlines how collaborative event-driven scheduling could improve network lifetime and reliability.
