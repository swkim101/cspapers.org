This paper presents OMSense, an intelligent surface solution that leverages origami-inspired metasurfaces to allow scalable and precise surface pressure sensing. People interact with various surfaces daily, and these interactions cause the surfaces to deform, a process that can be captured by sensors. This interaction can be utilized in various forms of human-computer interaction and human monitoring, enabling new use cases. However, existing surface sensing schemes are either expensive, difficult to scale, or low-precision due to signal leakage in multiplex design. To solve this problem, we propose OMSense, which adopts the multiplex matrix sensing design and incorporates a 3D metastructure to reduce the shared physical connection-induced signal leakage. In addition to this physical augmentation, OMSense adopts a circuit-guided CNN to mitigate the circuit connection-induced signal leakage (ghosting). We 3D print a circuit-integrated metastructure and evaluate the sensor unit accuracy. OMSense achieves up to 2Ã— sensor unit activation detection F1 score compared to the baselines.
