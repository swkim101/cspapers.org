Large-scale IoT sensor deployment calls for inexpensive, low-power sensor nodes that still perform long-range, large-scale networking at the system level. However, current sensor nodes are constructed according to the `one-size-fits-all' embedded design, where the processor and RF transceiver are indispensable but underutilized in low-duty cycles, resulting in overwhelmingly significant unit price and run-time power. In this paper, we propose a novel processor-sharing IoT architecture that converts the vast majority of sensor nodes from embedded computers to low-end RF peripherals. The conventional full-fledged sensor nodes are smashed into the air, and the scattered chips are scaled well with negligible overheads through a virtual I2C bus called RFBus. Specifically, the RFBus interface is designed to be backward compatible with the I2C bus interface, and thus, the RFBus network inherits versatile link layer services transparently from the well-established I2C link layer protocol. We design the RFBus with a joint consideration of system-level performance and deployment costs and evaluate the prototypes in indoor and outdoor scenarios. The result indicates that the proposed architecture achieves 6.09 x (indoor) and 6.69 x (outdoor) energy saving and reduces the unit price of sensor nodes by 23.5% (indoor) and 33.5% (outdoor).
