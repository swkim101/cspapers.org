In this work, we present the design, usage and evaluation of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) to enable the demand-driven operation of HVAC systems. We present a wireless sensor node in combination with a low-cost 3D airflow sensor, which uses differential pressure readings to calculate the airflow. We show how multi-connectivity can be used to increase the reliability of the data transmission between the sensor nodes and, therefore, create a reliable monitoring system for environmental conditions inside factories. Finally, we show how the collected data can be used to implement the automated and demand-driven operation of HVAC systems.
