This paper proposes a strategy for offloading unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tasks to electric vehicles and edge servers using a Stackelberg game model. We introduce a suitability score that considers distance, resource availability, and battery level to select the most suitable nodes for offloading UAV tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of energy consumption and utility for UAVs.
