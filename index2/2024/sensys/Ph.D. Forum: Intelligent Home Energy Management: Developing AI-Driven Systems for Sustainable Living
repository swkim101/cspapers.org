The MAI-HOME project, funded by the Interreg initiative, addresses energy poverty and CO2 emission reduction through an AI-driven framework tailored for vulnerable populations. This research spans three years of data collection from multiple sensors installed in every room of sixteen houses across the Netherlands and Belgium. It aims to predict and promote energy-saving behaviors effectively. Utilizing an innovative blend of digital twins and robust data privacy measures, this project explores four critical areas: real-time data collection, predictive AI model development, data privacy enhancement, and behavioral intervention strategies. Initial findings suggest promising avenues for technological advancements and societal benefits in sustainable energy practices.
