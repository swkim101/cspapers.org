Drowning poses a significant threat to human life, making underwater human activity monitoring necessary for pool management. However, it is challenging for existing methods to recognize the aquatic activities of diverse users continuously without privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel sonar-based pool monitoring system that localizes swimmers and recognizes pool activities. Our system is deployed and evaluated in a real-world pool, outperforming baselines in terms of activity recognition.
