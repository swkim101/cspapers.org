In this paper, we introduce a low-power wide-area cellular localization system, called LiTEfoot. The core architecture of the radio carefully applies non-linear transform of the entire cellular spectrum to obtain a systematic superimposition of the synchronization signals at the baseband. The system develops methods to simultaneously identify all the base stations that are active at any cellular band from the transformed signal. The radio front end uses a simple envelop detector to realize the non-linear transformation. We build on this low-power radio to implement a self-localization system leveraging ambient 4G-LTE signals. We show that the core system can also be extended to other cellular technologies like 5G-NR and NB-IoT. The prototype achieves a median localization error of 22 meters in urban areas and 50 meters in rural areas. It can sense a 3GHz wideband LTE spectrum in 10ms using non-linear intermodulation while consuming 0.9 mJ of energy for a PCB-based implementation and 40 Î¼J for CMOS simulation. In other words, LiTEfoot tags can last for 11 years on a coin cell while continuously estimating location every 5 seconds. We believe that LiTEfoot will have widespread implications in city-scale asset tracking and other location-based services. The radio architecture can be useful beyond low-power self-localization and can find application in synchronization and communication on battery-less platforms.
