As urban areas continue to expand and populations grow, cities increasingly face challenges related to crowd management. Dense crowds can significantly impact urban traffic, safety, and management, while also creating discomfort in overcrowded spaces. This study investigates how multimodal ubiquitous sensing can be used to create real-time crowdedness sensing and pedestrian tracking in different scenarios. This study proposes new computer vision and wireless signal-based methods for deployment, experiment, evaluation and comparison in open space, semi-open space and closed space, respectively. This research aims to offer reference and guidance for applying crowdedness sensing technologies in various scenarios, which will help in better crowd management and the data sensing of smart cities.
