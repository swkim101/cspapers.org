This paper introduces the development of a beamforming defectoscope tailored for advanced non-invasive techniques. The device employs beamforming technology to enhance the detection and characterization of defects in a range of materials. Through the use of sophisticated signal processing algorithms, the defectoscope increases both the resolution and accuracy of non-invasive inspections. The study underscores the superior performance of the beamforming method when compared to traditional approaches, demonstrating notable improvements in diagnostic capabilities. This cutting-edge tool holds promising applications across multiple industries, such as aerospace, civil engineering, and manufacturing, where accurate defect detection is essential.
