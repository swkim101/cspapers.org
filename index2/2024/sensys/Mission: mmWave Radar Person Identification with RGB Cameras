This paper presents Mission, the first-of-this-kind cross-modal reidentification (ReID) design for mmWave Radar and RGB cameras. Given a person of interest detected by Radar in camera-restricted scenarios, Mission can identify the image of the person from cameras that are ubiquitously deployed in camera-allowed areas. We envision that cross Vison-RF ReID can significantly enrich mmWave human sensing with a wide spectrum of applications in security surveillance, tracking, and personalized services. Technically, we introduce a novel method for cross-modal similarity estimation that exploits inherent synergies between fine-grained 2D images and coarse-grained 3D Radar point clouds to effectively overcome their modal discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our proposed system can achieve 85% top-1 accuracy and 90% top-5 accuracy among 58 volunteers.
