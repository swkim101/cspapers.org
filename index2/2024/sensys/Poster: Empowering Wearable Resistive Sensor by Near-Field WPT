We seek in this work to supply and conserve power for wearable resistive sensors by inductive coupling. A proof-of-concept experiment shows that through a pair of coils the core is able to deliver power and capture the resistance load at the remote sensor, achieving powering and communicating the state of the sensor simultaneously.
