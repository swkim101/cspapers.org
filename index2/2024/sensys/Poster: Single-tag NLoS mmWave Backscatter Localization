The accuracy of the current localization methods degrades significantly when the direct path between the wireless transmitter and the target is blocked. This paper considers the problem of using a single mmWave radar and a tag to facilitate localization in the non-penetrable non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario. We present mN2LoS (short for mmWave based Non-penetrable NLoS LOCalization), which accurately localizes the tag by using the multipath reflections. mN2LoS has a few novel features. First, we design HTRD for detecting reflectors and surroundings while distinguishing them from the tag, using Hybrid utilization of Tag localization code and Reflector localization code based on Direct sequence spread spectrum techniques. Second, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by exploiting the correlation features of the designed signal. Evaluation results demonstrate that the developed mN2LoS can achieve median errors (at 5m range) of 12.9cm and 3.8Â° for distance and AOA estimations for the office configuration, respectively.
