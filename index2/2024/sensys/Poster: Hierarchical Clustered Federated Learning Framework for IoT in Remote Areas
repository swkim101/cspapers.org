Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an effective solution for supporting Federated Learning (FL) in remote areas lacking infrastructure, but the non-IID nature of data affects FL efficiency. We propose a hierarchical clustering method with pipelined execution for UAV-assisted FL, clustering IoT devices based on computational capacity and data similarity to ensure balanced participation and faster convergence. Simulation results demonstrate improved learning efficiency and stability in non-IID environments, validating the method's effectiveness.
