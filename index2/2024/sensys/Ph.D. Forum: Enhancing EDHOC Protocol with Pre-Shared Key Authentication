This paper explores preliminary research on improving the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) protocol by incorporating a new pre-shared key (PSK) authentication method. The research focuses on designing this PSK-based mechanism and its potential benefits, such as enhancing session key update efficiency and reducing computational demands compared to current EDHOC authentication methods. We also outline the planned implementation and evaluation approach, which will measure key performance indicators like memory consumption, energy consumption, handshake duration, message size or number of operations. The aim is to optimize EDHOC for secure communication in resource-limited environments.
