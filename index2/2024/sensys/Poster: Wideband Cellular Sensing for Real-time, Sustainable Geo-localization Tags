This paper presents LiTEfoot, an ultra-low power, wide-area localization system leveraging ambient cellular signals to address the limitations of traditional self-localization systems in terms of power consumption and latency. LiTEfoot uses a non-linear transformation of the cellular synchronization signal to efficiently achieve self-localization by systematically superimposing signals at the baseband. A simple envelope detector is used to realize this non-linear transformation, enabling the identification of multiple active base stations across any cellular band. The system is designed to operate with low power, consuming only 40 Î¼Joules of energy per localization update, achieving a median localization error of 22 meters in urban areas.
