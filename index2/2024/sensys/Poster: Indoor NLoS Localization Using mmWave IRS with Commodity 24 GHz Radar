Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing represents a significant advancement in sensor technology. Unlike traditional sensing methods that rely on direct line-of-sight, NLoS sensing allows for the detection and localization of objects obscured from the sensor's view. In this paper, we introduce mmMirror, a novel Van Atta Array based millimetre-wave (mmWave) reconfigurable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that provides: (i) NLoS localization at a range of approximately 3 meters, (ii) seamless communication between radar and IRS using existing frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) signals, and (iii) support for multiple targets. The mmMirror system is implemented on commodity 24 GHz radars, and the IRS is prototyped on printed circuit boards (PCBs).
