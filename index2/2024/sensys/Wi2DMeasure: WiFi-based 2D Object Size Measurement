While a large range of sensing applications such as activity sensing and vital sign monitoring have been realized with WiFi sensing, using commercial WiFi devices to obtain fine-grained size information of objects remains challenging due to the narrow bandwidth of WiFi. Very recent studies attempted to measure object sizes using WiFi signals. However, these systems are still far from practical with a lot of limitations including requiring multiple transceiver pairs and can only measure one-dimensional size, hindering their real-life adoption. Also, these systems rely on Channel State Information (CSI) to work, which is only available on few commercial WiFi cards. In this work, we propose to employ a new channel data, i.e., Beamforming Feedback Information (BFI), widely available on almost all new generation WiFi cards for fine-grained size measurement. Through thoroughly analyzing the mathematical relationship between BFI and CSI, we show how to use BFI to achieve fine-grained size measurement. We propose a novel method to accurately measure the two-dimensional size of an object using a single transceiver pair by identifying the positions of singularities when the object passes through the diffraction zone of the transceiver pair. Experiment results show that Wi2DMeasure can accurately measure the two-dimensional size of objects under various conditions, achieving a small median error of only 3.7 mm.
