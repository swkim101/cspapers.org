This paper presents a system that fuses radio tomography data with RGB camera information for enhanced multi-person detection and tracking in indoor environments. Experiments were conducted in an irregularly shaped room with four subjects. Due to its limited resolution, radio tomography initially represented all individuals as a single entity. By incorporating RGB camera data, we were able to accurately identify and track each person individually. Our findings underscore the significance of integrating data from both modalities for improved detection and tracking performance in indoor surveillance and security systems.
