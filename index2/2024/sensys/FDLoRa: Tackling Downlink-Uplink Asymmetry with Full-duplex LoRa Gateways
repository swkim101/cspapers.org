Unlike traditional data collection applications (e.g., environment monitoring) that are dominated by uplink transmissions, the newly emerging applications (e.g., device actuation, firmware update, packet reception acknowledgement) also pose ever-increasing demands on downlink transmission capabilities. However, current LoRaWAN falls short in supporting such applications primarily due to downlink-uplink asymmetry. While the uplink can concurrently receive multiple packets, downlink transmission is limited to a single logical channel at a time, which fundamentally hinders the deployment of downlink-hungry applications. To tackle this practical challenge, FDLoRa develops the first-of-its-kind in-band full-duplex LoRa gateway design with novel solutions to mitigate the impact of self-interference (i.e., strong downlink interference to ultra-weak uplink reception), which unleashes the full spectrum for in-band downlink transmissions without compromising the reception of weak uplink packets. Built upon the full-duplex gateways, FDLoRa introduces a new downlink framework to support concurrent downlink transmissions over multiple logical channels of available gateways. Evaluation results demonstrate that FDLoRa boosts downlink capacity by 5.7x compared to LoRaWAN on a three-gateway testbed and achieves 2.58x higher downlink concurrency per gateway than the state-of-the-art.
