Soil moisture level sensing is essential for enabling smart irrigation, which is crucial for our food security and sustainable agriculture. Existing soil moisture sensing systems face limitations such as single-layer sensing, limited depth, power supply reliance, and complex calibration. In addition, costly and cumbersome sensor unit design hinders mass and dense deployment of passive intelligence. This paper introduces MetaSoil, a soil moisture sensing system that is calibration-free, continuous, and multi-layered, leveraging a passive 3D printable mmWave metamaterial. When soil moisture level changes, our hydrogel patched polylactic acid (PLA) metamaterial alters resonant frequency in the impinging mmWave signals due to impedance match offset. Our system eliminates in-soil power supply dependencies by utilizing the RF resonance of 3D-printed metamaterial, allowing for deeper placement, and simultaneous multi-layer sensing. We then integrate a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radar to query the metamaterial sensor. With MetaSoil's fully passive metamaterial pole, RF signal from far is redirected towards the sensor unit, bypassing soil's heavy attenuation effect. Through our extensive evaluation, MetaSoil achieves 98.9 % accuracy with ±10% moisture level precision in single-layered sensing, at depth of 1m meter. It achieves 98.8 % accuracy with ±10% in double layered sensing at same depth with 10cm sensor spacing. We further examine the robustness of our system with real-world requirements. Overall, MetaSoil represents a low-cost, durable, and easily deployable solution that supports remote and continuous soil moisture monitoring, advancing the scalability and effectiveness of smart agricultural practices.
