Low-cost and accurate indoor location information can add spatiotemporal context to information systems, enabling new location-aware applications. Time-of-Flight (ToF)-based acoustic localization using speakers and microphones allows for localization accuracy within a few tens of centimeters, outperforming RF-based techniques. However, ToF-based localization requires synchronization between the speaker and microphone, i.e. , the time offset between them must be known. Previous time offset estimation methods required custom hardware for speakers, limiting their practical use. Estimating the time offset using a single, unmodified speaker is essential for leveraging widely deployed speakers and enhancing coverage. This paper presents the first method for time offset estimation using a single speaker and a microphone, enabled by two key factors: (i) a time offset computation method that utilizes higher-order floor-ceiling reflections as multiple geometrically-constrained virtual speakers, and (ii) a signal processing pipeline that isolates these critical reflections from numerous others by leveraging the speaker‚Äôs frequency-dependent radiation pattern. Experiments show that the proposed technique can achieve time offset estimation with a 90th percentile error of 259 ùúá s at a 5 m distance. Furthermore, we implemented a ToF localization system based on SyncEcho, demonstrating a 11 . 0 cm localization accuracy with a 90th percentile error.
