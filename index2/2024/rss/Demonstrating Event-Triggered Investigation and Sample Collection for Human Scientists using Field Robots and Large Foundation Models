—In this paper, we introduce a pioneering end-to-end system demonstrated on a team of robots and sensors, designed to augment scientific exploration and discovery for human scientists in remote or inaccessible environments. We demonstrate and analyse our system’s capability in a mock-up test-bed scenario. In this futuristic hypothetical scenario human scientists located in a controlled lunar habitat, are assisted by a team of robots in investigating an unknown seismic phenomena like moon-quakes or meteor impact detected by a sensor network deployed on the lunar surface. They do so by autonomously collecting data, providing contextual semantic information and collecting scientific sample for future analysis upon the direction of humans. This work is among the earliest to present a feasible way to integrate large foundational models (LFMs) into field robotic deployment, enabling easy semantic and contextual understanding of the objects in the environment and natural language-based interactions with the robot for the scientist. In addition we bring together state-of-the-art techniques in mapping, object detection, navigation, mobile manipulation, soft grippers, event detection and present details of the integration, insights and lessons learnt from the deployment. While demonstrated in a limited setting in a mock-up environment with ground robots, the system architecture and approach presented in this paper is easily generalised with domain-specific customised components and robots for a variety of event-driven scientific discoveries e
