Intelligent vision control systems for surgical robots should adapt to unknown and diverse objects while being robust to system disturbances. Previous methods did not meet these requirements due to mainly relying on pose estimation and feature tracking. We propose a world-model-based deep reinforcement learning framework"Grasp Anything for Surgery"(GAS), that learns a pixel-level visuomotor policy for surgical grasping, enhancing both generality and robustness. In particular, a novel method is proposed to estimate the values and uncertainties of depth pixels for a rigid-link object's inaccurate region based on the empirical prior of the object's size; both depth and mask images of task objects are encoded to a single compact 3-channel image (size: 64x64x3) by dynamically zooming in the mask regions, minimizing the information loss. The learned controller's effectiveness is extensively evaluated in simulation and in a real robot. Our learned visuomotor policy handles: i) unseen objects, including 5 types of target grasping objects and a robot gripper, in unstructured real-world surgery environments, and ii) disturbances in perception and control. Note that we are the first work to achieve a unified surgical control system that grasps diverse surgical objects using different robot grippers on real robots in complex surgery scenes (average success rate: 69%). Our system also demonstrates significant robustness across 6 conditions including background variation, target disturbance, camera pose variation, kinematic control error, image noise, and re-grasping after the gripped target object drops from the gripper.
