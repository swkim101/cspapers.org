—The Lightweight Surface Manipulation System, or LSMS, is a family of scalable long-reach cable-actuated manipulators. The design of the LSMS has a high payload ratio for efﬁcient operations on planetary surfaces like the Moon or Mars. The LSMS has nonlinear, coupled, and hybrid dynamics. The engineering decisions that led to these challenging dynamics make this structure light and efﬁcient. This paper proposes a novel trajectory tracking algorithm for these cranes that facilitates precise autonomous and teleoperated operations. This algorithm enables these robots to follow complex trajectories that avoid obstacles and pickup regolith in a construction site.
