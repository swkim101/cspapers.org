Recent text-to-image diffusion models have shown surprising performance in generating high-quality images. However, concerns have arisen regarding the unauthorized usage of data during the training process. One example is when a model trainer collects a set of images created by a particular artist and attempts to train a model capable of generating similar images without obtaining permission from the artist. To address this issue, it becomes crucial to detect unauthorized data usage. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such unauthorized data usage by planting injected memorization into the text-to-image diffusion models trained on the protected dataset. Specifically, we modify the protected image dataset by adding unique contents on the images such as stealthy image wrapping functions that are imperceptible to human vision but can be captured and memorized by diffusion models. By analyzing whether the model has memorization for the injected content (i.e., whether the generated images are processed by the chosen post-processing function), we can detect models that had illegally utilized the unauthorized data. Our experiments conducted on Stable Diffusion and LoRA model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting unauthorized data usages.
