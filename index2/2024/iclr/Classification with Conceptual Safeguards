We propose a new approach to promote safety in classiﬁcation tasks with established concepts. Our approach – called a conceptual safeguard – acts as a veriﬁcation layer for models that predict a target outcome by ﬁrst predicting the presence of intermediate concepts. Given this architecture, a safeguard ensures that a model meets a minimal level of accuracy by abstaining from uncertain predictions. In contrast to a standard selective classiﬁer, a safeguard provides an avenue to improve coverage by allowing a human to conﬁrm the presence of uncertain concepts on instances on which it abstains. We develop methods to build safeguards that maximize coverage without compromising safety, namely techniques to propagate the uncertainty in concept predictions and to ﬂag salient concepts for human review. We benchmark our approach on a collection of real-world and synthetic datasets, showing that it can improve performance and coverage in deep learning tasks
