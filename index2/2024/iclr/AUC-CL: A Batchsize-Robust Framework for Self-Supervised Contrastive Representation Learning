Self-supervised learning through contrastive representations is an emergent and promising avenue, aiming at alleviating the availability of labeled data. Recent research in the field also demonstrates its viability for several downstream tasks, henceforth leading to works that implement the contrastive principle through innovative loss functions and methods. However, despite achieving impressive progress, most methods depend on prohibitively large batch sizes and compute requirements for good performance. In this work, we propose the AUC - C ontrastive L earning, a new approach to contrastive learning that demonstrates robust and competitive performance in compute-limited regimes. We propose to incorporate the contrastive objective within the AUC-maximization framework, by noting that the AUC metric is maximized upon enhancing the probability of the networkâ€™s binary prediction difference between positive and negative samples which inspires adequate embedding space arrangements in representation learning. Unlike standard contrastive methods, when performing stochastic optimization, our method maintains unbiased stochastic gradients and thus is more robust to batchsizes as opposed to standard stochastic optimization problems. Remarkably, our method with a batch size of 256, outperforms several state-of-the-art methods that may need much larger batch sizes (e.g., 4096), on ImageNet and other standard datasets. Experiments on transfer learning and few-shot learning tasks also demonstrate the downstream viability of our method. Code is available at AUC-CL
