This paper addresses PSO-FA hybrid algorithm that is constructed by heterogeneous agents (particles) in the population. We describe that particle swarm optimization and firefly algorithm have different dynamical properties each other, and share the information such the global best and the brightest intensity. Then search ability of a simple combination of them is examined. The benchmark set for CEC2015 competition of single-objective computationally expensive optimization is used for the performance evaluate, we discuss the proposed hybrid algorithm.
