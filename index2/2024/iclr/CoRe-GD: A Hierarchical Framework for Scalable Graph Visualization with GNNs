Graph Visualization, also known as Graph Drawing, aims to find geometric embeddings of graphs that optimize certain criteria. Stress is a widely used metric; stress is minimized when every pair of nodes is positioned at their shortest path distance. However, stress optimization presents computational challenges due to its inherent complexity and is usually solved using heuristics in practice. We introduce a scalable Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Graph Drawing framework with sub-quadratic runtime that can learn to optimize stress. Inspired by classical stress optimization techniques and force-directed layout algorithms, we create a coarsening hierarchy for the input graph. Beginning at the coarsest level, we iteratively refine and un-coarsen the layout, until we generate an embedding for the original graph. To enhance information propagation within the network, we propose a novel positional rewiring technique based on intermediate node positions. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining scalable.
