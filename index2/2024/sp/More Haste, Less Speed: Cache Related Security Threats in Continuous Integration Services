Continuous Integration (CI) platforms have widely adopted caching to speed up CI task executions by storing and reusing dependent packages. Unfortunately, CI cache also exposes new attack surfaces when cache objects are shared across trust boundaries. In this paper, we systematically investigate potential security threats of CI cache features in seven mainstream CI platforms (CIPs). We find that existing CIPs have isolation issues in their cache sharing and inheritance strategies, potentially raising cache poisoning and data leakage problems. By exploiting these vulnerable mechanisms, we further uncover four attack vectors enabling attackers to stealthily inject malicious code into the cache or steal sensitive data. Even worse, many CIPs provide vulnerable official cache templates that will mistakenly store and expose sensitive data in the cache by default. To understand the potential impact of our disclosed threats, we develop an analysis tool and conduct a large-scale measurement on open-source repositories. Our measurement results show that many popular repositories are potentially affected by these attacks. We also identify 78 repositories that expose their high-value secrets in cache objects and are at risk of secret leakage. We have duly reported identified vulnerabilities to corresponding stakeholders and received positive responses.
