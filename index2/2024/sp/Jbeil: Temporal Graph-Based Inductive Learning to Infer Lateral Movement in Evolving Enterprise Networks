Lateral Movement (LM) is one of the core stages of advanced persistent threats which continues to compromise the security posture of enterprise networks at large. Recent research work have employed Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to detect LM in intricate networks. Such approaches employ transductive graph learning, where fixed graphs with full nodes' visibility are employed in the training phase, along with ingesting benign data. These two assumptions in real-world setups (i) do not take into consideration the evolving nature of enterprise networks where dynamic features and connectivity prevail among hosts, users, virtualized environments, and applications, and (ii) hinder the effectiveness of detecting LM by solely training on normal data, especially given the evasive, stealthy, and benign-like behaviors of contemporary malicious maneuvers. Additionally, (iii) complex networks typically do not have the entire visibility of their run-time network processes, and if they do, they often fall short in dynamically tracking LM due to latency issues with passive data analysis.To this end, this paper proposes Jbeil, a data-driven framework for self-supervised deep learning on evolving networks represented as sequences of authentication timed events. The premise of the work lies in applying an encoder on a continuous-time evolving graph to produce the embedding of the visible graph nodes for each time epoch, and a decoder that leverages these embeddings to perform LM link prediction on unseen nodes. Additionally, we enclose a threat sample augmentation mechanism within Jbeil to ensure a well-informed notion on advanced LM attacks. We evaluate Jbeil using authentication timed events from the Los Alamos network which achieves an AUC score of 99.73% and a recall score of 99.25% in predicting LM paths, even when 30% of the nodes/edges are not present in the training phase. Additionally, we assess different realistic attack scenarios and demonstrate the potential of Jbeil in predicting LM paths with an AUC score of 99% in its inductive and transductive settings, out performing the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.
