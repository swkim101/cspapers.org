We systematically investigate the expressive power of path-based graph neural networks. While it has been shown that path-based graph neural networks can achieve strong empirical re-sults, an investigation into their expressive power is lacking. Therefore, we propose P ATH -WL, a general class of color refinement algorithms based on paths and shortest path distance information. We show that P ATH -WL is incomparable to a wide range of expressive graph neural networks, can count cycles, and achieves strong empirical re-sults on the notoriously difficult family of strongly regular graphs. Our theoretical results indicate that P ATH -WL forms a new hierarchy of highly expressive graph neural networks.
