Despite the exceptional performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), the substantial volume of key-value (KV) pairs cached during inference presents a barrier to their efficient deployment. To ameliorate this, recent works have aimed to selectively eliminate these caches, informed by the attention scores of associated to-kens. However, such cache eviction invariably leads to output perturbation, regardless of the token choice. This perturbation escalates with the compression ratio, which can precipitate a marked deterioration in LLM inference performance. This paper introduces Cache Merging (CaM) as a solution to mitigate this challenge. CaM adaptively merges to-be-evicted caches into the remaining ones, employing a novel sampling strategy governed by the prominence of attention scores within discarded locations. In this manner, CaM enables memory-efficient LLMs to preserve critical token information, even obviating the need to maintain their corresponding caches. Extensive experiments utilizing LLaMA, OPT, and GPT-NeoX across various benchmarks corroborate CaMâ€™s proficiency in bolstering the performance of memory-efficient LLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/zyxxmu/cam .
