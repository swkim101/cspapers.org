We introduce a new approach for applying sampling-based sketches to two and three mode tensors. We illustrate our technique to construct sketches for the classical problems of $\ell_0$ sampling and producing $\ell_1$ embeddings. In both settings we achieve sketches that can be applied to a rank one tensor in $(\mathbb{R}^d)^{\otimes q}$ (for $q=2,3$) in time scaling with $d$ rather than $d^2$ or $d^3$. Our main idea is a particular sampling construction based on fast convolution which allows us to quickly compute sums over sufficiently random subsets of tensor entries.
