Reconnaissance is a critical phase in many cyber attacks. Vulnerability scanning, a key component of reconnaissance, has been shown to be a widespread phenomenon on the internet and commonly targets web application/server deployments. By increasing the costs for vulnerability scanning, many of these attacks may be deterred or even prevented, especially for large-scale, internet-wide campaigns.In this paper, we propose Web-Armour, a mitigation approach to adversarial reconnaissance. Operating as a delay injection mechanism to infrequently executed code portions of a web deployment, Web-Armour significantly increases the cost for attackers to perform automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning, while introducing minimal to negligible impact for benign users. We evaluated Web-Armour in a live environment, operated by real users, and in controlled (offline) scenarios. Using Web-Armour, our results show that automated scanning tools may require up to 396 times longer in an offline setting, and up to 357 times longer in a real-world operational deployment to complete compared to unprotected installations. In many instances, scanning tools fail to complete their tasks, due to request timeouts. Furthermore, the performance overhead incurred to benign users is minimal, and can be as low as a 0.6% increase over the baseline.
