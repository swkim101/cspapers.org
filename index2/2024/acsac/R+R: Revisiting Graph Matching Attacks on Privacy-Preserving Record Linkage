Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) is a method of privately linking data records from different sources that refer to the same person. This can be achieved by applying a similarity-preserving encoding to quasi-identifiers. Linkage is then performed based on the similarities of the encoded data only, thereby protecting the identities included.The Graph Matching Attack (GMA) presented by Vidanage et al. (CIKM 2020) appears to significantly compromise the security of all PPRL schemes that rely on such similarity-preserving encodings. Their experiments demonstrate that an attacker can successfully re-identify plaintext records in the encoded database by leveraging similarity relationships.In this paper, we reproduce and replicate the work of Vidanage et al. While we were able to successfully reproduce their results using the original attack code, a replication using our own re-implementation of the attack failed. Further analysis revealed that the original attackâ€™s success depends on an undocumented preprocessing step and the choice of a random seed. In response, we present a new and improved GMA based on unsupervised machine learning. Our proposed methodology overcomes the limitations of the state-of-the-art attack and outperforms it significantly in both success rate and robustness. Even in scenarios with highly limited attacker knowledge, re-identification rates of up to 100% can be achieved.
