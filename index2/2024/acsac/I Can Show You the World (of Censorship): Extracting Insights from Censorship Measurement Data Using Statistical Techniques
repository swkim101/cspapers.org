In response to the growing sophistication of censorship methods deployed by governments worldwide, the existence of open-source censorship measurement platforms has increased. Analyzing censorship data is challenging due to the data’s large size, diversity, and variability, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the data collection process and applying established data analysis techniques for thorough information extraction. In this work, we develop a framework that is applicable across all major censorship datasets to continually identify changes in censorship data trends and reveal potentially unreported censorship. Our framework consists of control charts and the Mann-Kendall trend detection test, originating from statistical process control theory, and we implement it on Censored Planet, GFWatch, the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), and Tor data from Russia, Myanmar, China, Iran, Türkiye, and Pakistan from January 2021 through March 2023. Our study confirms results from prior studies and also identifies new events that we validate through media reports. Our correlation analysis reveals minimal similarities between censorship datasets. However, because our framework is applicable across all major censorship datasets, it significantly reduces the manual effort required to employ multiple datasets, which we further demonstrate by applying it to four additional Internet outage-related datasets. Our work thus provides a tool for continuously monitoring censorship activity and acts as a basis for developing more systematic, holistic, and in-depth analysis techniques for censorship data.
