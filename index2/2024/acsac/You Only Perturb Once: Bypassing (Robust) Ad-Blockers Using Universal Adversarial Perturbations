Extensive academic effort has been put into the development of effective machine learning models that block advertising and tracking service (ATS) content. These ATS blockers leverage various features from websites, such as structural, content, flow, and JavaScript features, to develop accurate and robust models. However, establishing the robustness of these ATS blockers to evasion attacks is largely understudied, particularly in practical scenarios in which an adversary generates a single and cost-effective universal perturbation that renders ATS detection across websites ineffective at scale.In this paper, we show that recent ATS blockers using machine learning are not robust to a universal adversarial attack. Specifically, we propose an auditing framework (YOPO) that enables one to generate a single adversarial perturbation in a cost-effective manner. Our framework casts the generation of a universal perturbation into an optimization problem in a principled way; it enables an adversary to minimize the cost of manipulating various features in HTML content and to thwart ATS classification while constraining the perturbation size for each feature. We demonstrate that YOPO is capable of generating a universal perturbation that enables bypassing four seminal ATS blockers: AdGraph, WebGraph, AdFlush, and PageGraph, attaining success rates of up to 92.27%, 71.50%, 61.91%, and 85.81%, respectively. We also propose a practical and effective countermeasure against YOPO that only requires preprocessing training instances without large performance drops in ATS blocking.
