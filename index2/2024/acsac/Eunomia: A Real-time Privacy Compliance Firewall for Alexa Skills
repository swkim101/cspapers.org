Voice assistants (VAs), such as Amazon Alexa, are integrated with numerous smart home devices to process user requests using apps called skills. With their growing popularity, VAs also pose serious privacy concerns. Sensitive user data captured by VAs may be transmitted to third-party skills without users’ consent or knowledge about how their data is handled. Privacy policies are a standard medium to inform the users of the skills’ data practices. However, privacy policy compliance verification of such skills is challenging, since the source code is controlled by the skill developers, who can make arbitrary changes to the behaviors of the skill without being audited; hence, conventional defense mechanisms using static/dynamic code analysis can be easily evaded. In this paper, we present Eunomia, the first real-time privacy compliance firewall for Alexa skills. As the skills interact with the users, Eunomia hijacks and examines their communications from the skills to the users, and validates them against the published privacy policies that are parsed using a BERT-based policy analysis module. When non-compliant skill behaviors are detected, Eunomia stops the interaction and warns the user about the non-compliance. We evaluate Eunomia with 55,898 skills on Amazon skills store to demonstrate its effectiveness and to provide a privacy compliance landscape of Alexa skills.
