Microservices have emerged as a strong architecture for large-scale, distributed systems in the context of cloud computing and containerization. However, the size and complexity of microservice systems have strained current access control mechanisms. Intricate dependency structures, such as multi-hop dependency chains, go uncaptured by existing access control mechanisms and leave microservice deployments open to adversarial actions and influence.This work introduces CloudCover, an access control mechanism and enforcement framework for microservices. CloudCover provides holistic, deployment-wide analysis of microservice operations and behaviors. It implements a verification-in-the-loop access control approach, mitigating multi-hop microservice threats through control-flow integrity checks. We evaluate these domain-relevant multi-hop threats and CloudCover under existing, real-world scenarios such as Istioâ€™s opensource microservice example and under theoretic and synthetic network loads of 10,000 requests per second. Our results show that CloudCover is appropriate for use in real deployments, requiring no microservice code changes by administrators.
