Autonomous navigation systems present a unique attack surface: their sensors. This attack surface allows for sensor spoofing attacks, where an adversary gains control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by manipulating one of its sensors to report incorrect data. Prior research has shown that many of the sensors, including those on UAVs, are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks. However, most of the work on sensor spoofing either focuses solely on the vulnerability of the sensor or considers only the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) when attacking a UAV. The impact sensor spoofing has on UAVs and the extent of control an attacker can gain with different sensors is relatively unexplored. Concretely, we show that an adversary only needs to control one of the sensors a UAV uses for state estimation to control the UAV, even if the GNSS is faithful. We further characterize the extent of control an adversary can gain with each sensor and discuss why current defenses are insufficient to stop these attacks.
