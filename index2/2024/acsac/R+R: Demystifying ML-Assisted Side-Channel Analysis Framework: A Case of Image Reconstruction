Machine-learning-assisted side-channel analysis (ML-assisted SCA) automates the procedure of analyzing side-channel activities to reconstruct secrets. Although ML-assisted SCA does produce promising results, it is hard to determine whether its machine-learning model tends to reconstruct secrets or generate new instances. In this paper, we revisit the first general ML-assisted SCA framework for media software (Yuan et al. USENIX Security 2022), which we refer to as the Manifold-SCA framework, with a case study of reconstructing images from cache activities. We show that Manifold-SCA tends to generate images more than reconstruct them. Inspired by the autoencoder implemented in the Manifold-SCA framework, we theoretically and experimentally show that an autoencoder is sufficient to reconstruct images from cache activities. Through three ablation studies, we show that an autoencoder outperforms the Manifold-SCA framework under all scenarios. In the end, we apply an autoencoder to analyze practical cache activities collected by a profiling-based Prime+Probe attack, and show that an autoencoder can reconstruct partial pixel-related activities, but these activities are insufficient to reconstruct images due to the information loss in the activities.
