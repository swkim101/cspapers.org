Emotion significantly influences human behavior and decision-making processes. We propose a labeling methodology grounded in Plutchikâ€™s Wheel of Emotions theory for emotion classification. Furthermore, we employ a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to evaluate the efficacy of this labeling approach, by identifying the specific emotions that each expert learns to classify. Experimental results reveal that our methodology improves the performance of emotion classification.
