Hallucinated translations pose significant threats and safety concerns when it comes to practical deployment of machine translation systems. Previous research works have identified that detectors exhibit complementary performance â€” different detectors excel at detecting different types of hallucinations. In this paper, we propose to address the limitations of individual detectors by combining them and introducing a straightforward method for aggregating multiple detectors. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our aggregated detector, providing a promising step towards evermore reliable machine translation systems.
