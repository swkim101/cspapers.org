We address the task of detecting abusive sentences in which identity groups are depicted as deviating from the norm (e.g. Gays sprinkle flour over their gardens for good luck). These abusive utterances need not be stereotypes or negative in sentiment. We introduce the first dataset for this task. It is created via crowdsourcing and includes 7 identity groups. We also report on classification experiments.
