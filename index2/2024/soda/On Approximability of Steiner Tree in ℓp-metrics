In the Continuous Steiner Tree problem ( CST ), we are given as input a set of points (called terminals ) in a metric space and ask for the minimum-cost tree connecting them. Additional points (called Steiner points ) from the metric space can be introduced as nodes in the solution. In the Discrete Steiner Tree problem ( DST ), we are given in addition to the terminals, a set of facilities, and any solution tree connecting the terminals can only contain the Steiner points from this set of facilities. Trevisan [SICOMP’00] showed that CST and DST are APX -hard when the input lies in the ℓ 1 -metric (and Hamming metric). Chleb´ık and Chleb´ıkov´a [TCS’08] showed that DST is NP -hard to approximate to factor of 96 / 95 ≈ 1 . 01 in the graph metric (and consequently ℓ ∞ - metric). Prior to this work, it was unclear if CST and DST are APX -hard in essentially every other popular metric! In this work, we prove that DST is APX -hard in every ℓ p -metric. We also prove that CST is APX -hard in the ℓ ∞ -metric. Finally, we relate CST and DST , by observing a gap preserving reduction from CST to DST in ℓ p -metrics.
