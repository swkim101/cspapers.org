The well-known k -disjoint paths problem involves ﬁnding pairwise vertex-disjoint paths between k speciﬁed pairs of vertices within a given graph if they exist. In the shortest k -disjoint paths problem one looks for such paths of minimum total length. Despite nearly 50 years of active research on the k -disjoint paths problem, many open problems and complexity gaps still persist. A particularly well-deﬁned scenario, inspired by VLSI design, focuses on inﬁnite rectangular grids where the terminals are placed at arbitrary grid points. While the decision problem in this context remains NP-hard, no prior research has provided any positive results for the optimization version. The main result of this paper is a ﬁxed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for this scenario. It is important to stress that this is the ﬁrst result achieving the FPT complexity of the shortest disjoint paths problem in any, even very restricted classes of graphs where we do not put any restriction on the placements of the terminals.
