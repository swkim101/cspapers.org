In recent years, hardware architectures optimized for general matrix multiplication (GEMM) have been well studied to deliver better performance and efficiency for deep neural networks. With trends towards batched, low-precision data, e.g., FP8 format in this work, we observe that there is growing untapped potential for value reuse. We propose a novel computing paradigm, value-level parallelism, whereby unique products are computed only once, and different inputs subscribe to (select) their products via temporal coding. Our architecture, Carat, employs value-level parallelism and transforms multiplication into accumulation, performing GEMMs with eefficient multiplier-free hardware. Experiments show that, on average, Carat improves iso-area throughput and energy efficiency by 1.02× and 1.06× over a systolic array and 3.2× and 4.3× when scaled up to multiple nodes.
