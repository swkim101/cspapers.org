Zoned Namespace (ZNS) is an emerging interface that shows great promise for high-density and low-cost cloud environment deployments. Modern high-density SSDs, on the other hand, typically use a hybrid SLC/QLC architecture to mitigate the deficiencies of QLC. Unfortunately, simply integrating ZNS with the mainstream host-transparent hybrid architecture would lead to substantial performance and endurance overhead, defeating the purpose of this architecture in the first place. In this paper, we examine the possibility of coupling heterogeneous flash management (i.e., SLC and QLC) into the existing zone management at the host. We present ZnH 2 , an augmented ZNS-based storage system with host-managed heterogeneous zones. ZnH 2 comprises both SSD firmware and host software designs to unleash the full potential of the hybrid architecture. We build ZnH 2 based on RocksDB, the mainstream application of ZNS, and its filesystem backend ZenFS. Evaluation on YCSB benchmark shows that, compared to the host-transparent counterpart, ZnH 2 achieves up to 28.9% higher load performance and at most 61.1% reduction on the QLC write volume. ZnH 2 also increases the throughput in YCSB macro-benchmarks by 9.5% on average.
