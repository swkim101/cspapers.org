The Arm Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol is a widely used on-chip interconnect for processors, accelerators, memories, and other IPs. Any bugs in the AXI implementations pose a security risk to the chipâ€™s correctness. Buggy or non-compliant third-party IPs can use AXI implementation bugs to bypass the security mechanisms of the whole system. Identifying AXI implementation bugs is challenging because the incomplete specifications allow room for implementation-specific behavior in performant designs. eXpect is a systematic approach for analyzing AXI implementations to detect functional and security violations. We use eXpect to test 7 implementations of varying complexity, including the ones from AMD Xilinx and RISC-V PULP. We identified 135 property violations. We sampled 10 of them to show 7 exploits demonstrating that an attacker can use these bugs to trick victim IPs. Our exploits achieve outcomes such as using stale data, skipping reads and writes, leaking intermediate data, and reading and writing attacker-controlled data to attacker-controlled addresses. We evaluated our exploits in realistic scenarios deployed on FPGA. We show that AMD Xilinx protocol checker IPs miss 5/7 of our exploits.
