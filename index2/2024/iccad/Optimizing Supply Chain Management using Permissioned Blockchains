The semiconductor supply chain has encountered unprecedented volatility in chip demand and supply, a trend expected to persist over the next decade. Fueled by increasing demands for enhanced performance and power efficiency, the semiconductor industry has undergone a paradigm shift towards heterogeneous integration, leading to the emergence of 2.5D/3D chips. These chips integrate diverse chiplets, sourced globally, into a single chip. Current blockchain solutions in hardware supply chain management focus predominantly on enhancing resiliency for end users or system integrators, providing robust mechanisms for tracking and tracing chip movements. However, these solutions often neglect the critical needs of manufacturers at earlier stages of the supply chain. Ad-dressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-enabled provenance framework that equips manufacturers with early visibility into the inventory levels of chiplet distributors and system integrators. Additionally, our framework enables any downstream member to swiftly locate any available chiplets and chips registered on the chain by manufacturers. This visibility enables manufacturers to proactively respond to market shifts, thereby helping to avert supply chain disruptions. Implemented using Tendermint, our framework extends benefits to all stakeholders in the supply chain by enhancing transparency and creating incentives for manufacturers to participate on the blockchain alongside system integrators. This strategic approach not only mitigates the effects of demand volatility but also contributes as a motivation factor for blockchain adoption in hardware supply chains.
