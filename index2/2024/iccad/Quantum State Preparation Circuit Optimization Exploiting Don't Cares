Quantum state preparation initializes the quantum registers and is essential for running quantum algorithms. Designing state preparation circuits that entangle qubits efficiently with fewer two-qubit gates enhances accuracy and alleviates coupling constraints on devices. Existing methods synthesize an initial circuit and leverage compilers to reduce the circuit's gate count while preserving the unitary equivalency. In this study, we identify numerous conditions within the quantum circuit where breaking local unitary equivalences does not alter the overall outcome of the state preparation (i.e., don't cares). We introduce a peephole optimization algorithm that identifies such unitaries for replacement in the original circuit. Exploiting these don't care conditions, our algorithm achieves a 36% reduction in the number of two-qubit gates compared to prior methods.
