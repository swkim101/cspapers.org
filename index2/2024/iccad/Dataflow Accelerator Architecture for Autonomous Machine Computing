Commercial autonomous machines is a thriving sector, one that is likely the next ubiquitous computing platform, after Personal Computers (PC), cloud computing, and mobile computing. Nevertheless, a suitable computing substrate for autonomous machines is missing, and many companies are forced to develop ad hoc computing solutions that are neither principled nor extensible. By analyzing the demands of autonomous machine computing, this article proposes Dataflow Accelerator Architecture (DAA), a modern instantiation of the classic dataflow principle, that matches the characteristics of autonomous machine software.
