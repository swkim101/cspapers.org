Augmented Reality (AR) excels at altering what we see but non-visual sensations are difficult to augment. To augment non-visual sensations in AR, we draw on the visual language of comic books. Synthesizing comic studies, we create a design space describing how to use comic elements (e.g., onomatopoeia) to depict non-visual sensations (e.g., hearing). To demonstrate this design space, we built eight demos, such as speed lines to make a user think they are faster and smell lines to make a scent seem stronger. We evaluate these elements in a qualitative user study (N=20) where participants performed everyday tasks with comic elements added as augmentations. All participants stated feeling a change in perception for at least one sensation, with perceived changes detected by between four participants (touch) and 15 participants (hearing). The elements also had positive effects on emotion and user experience, even when participants did not feel changes in perception.
