This paper examines the potential of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) solutions to support radiologists in diagnosing prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent and increasing cancers among men. The scarcity of radiologists raises concerns about their ability to address the growing demand for prostate cancer diagnosis, leading to a significant surge in the workload of radiologists. Drawing on an HCAI approach, we sought to understand the current practices concerning radiologistsâ€™ work on detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer, as well as the challenges they face. The findings from our empirical studies point toward the potential that AI has to expedite informed decision-making and enhance accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. This is particularly beneficial for collaborative prostate cancer diagnosis processes. We discuss these results and introduce design recommendations and HCAI concepts for the domain of prostate cancer diagnosis, with the aim of amplifying the professional capabilities of radiologists.
