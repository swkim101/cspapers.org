In the realm of virtual reality (VR), shape-changing controllers have emerged as a means to enhance visuo-haptic congruence during user interactions. The major emphasis has been placed on manipulating the inertia tensor of a shape-changing controller to control the perceived shape. This paper delves deeper by exploring how the material properties of the controller’s handle, distinct from the inertial information, affect the perceived shape, focusing on the perceived length. We conducted three perceptual experiments to examine the effects of the handle’s softness, thermal conductivity, and texture, respectively. Results demonstrated that a softer handle increases the perceived length, whereas a handle with higher thermal conductivity reduces it. Texture, in the form of varying bumps, also alters the length perception. These results provide more comprehensive knowledge of the intricate relationship between perceived length and controller handle properties, expanding the design alternatives for shape-changing controllers for immersive VR experiences.
