This paper reports on a research through design (RtD) inquiry into public perceptions of transparency of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors increasingly deployed within urban neighborhoods as part of smart city programs. In particular, we report on the results of three participatory design workshops during which 40 New York City residents used physical signage as a medium for materializing transparency concerns about several sensors. We found that people’s concerns went beyond making sensors more transparent but instead sought to reveal the technology’s interconnected social, political, and economic processes. Building from these findings, we highlight the opportunities to move from treating transparency as an object to treating it as an ongoing activity. We argue that this move opens opportunities for designers and policy-makers to provide meaningful and actionable transparency of smart cities.
