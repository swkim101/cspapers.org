The extensive use of computers for text entry has been linked to increased stress, depression, and sleep disturbances, adversely affecting performance. Recent trends involve using scent diffusers to counter these effects. However, the impact of scents on text entry performance is not well-studied. Our empirical study investigated the effects of self-selected pleasant scents on text composition and transcription performance. Results showed that while composing, users were slower with a scent present, potentially due to heightened focus on text quality. Scent did not alter accuracy or text length. In transcription tasks, although scent did not alter typing speed, it adversely affected accuracy, likely due to its impact on concentration levels. Despite these mixed results, users felt more effective and enjoyed the scent, indicating a preference for its continued use. This study opens avenues for further research into scentsâ€™ influence on computer-based tasks, potentially contributing to the evolving field of olfactory displays.
