Cognitive assessment games attempt to improve cognitive assessment’s experience and data quality by implementing game-like features, e.g., points and narratives. However, cognitive games maintain the repetitiveness and restricted control common in traditional cognitive assessment tasks, which thwart players’ sense of control and impair their motivation and experience. Leading to only modest improvements over traditional tasks. To demonstrate the value of designing cognitive games that facilitate a sense of control, we created and evaluated the infinite runner game Tunnel Runner. In two studies (n1=117, n2=121), we assessed the validity of the game’s cognitive measurements (inhibitory control, decision-making) against traditional cognitive tasks. Our results demonstrate Tunnel Runner’s valid and reliable cognitive measurements alongside substantial improvements to players’ experience and sense of control compared to the cognitive tasks, showcasing the feasibility and benefits of cognitive games designed to facilitate players’ sense of control.
