The pleasure that often comes with eating can be further enhanced with intelligent technology, as the field of human-food interaction suggests. However, knowledge on how to design such pleasure-supporting eating systems is limited. To begin filling this knowledge gap, we designed “GustosonicSense”, a novel gustosonic eating system that utilizes wireless earbuds for sensing different eating and drinking actions with a machine learning algorithm and trigger playful sounds as a way to facilitate pleasurable eating experiences. We present the findings from our design and a study that revealed how we can support the "stimulation", "hedonism", and "reflexivity" for playful human-food interactions. Ultimately, with our work, we aim to support interaction designers in facilitating playful experiences with food.
