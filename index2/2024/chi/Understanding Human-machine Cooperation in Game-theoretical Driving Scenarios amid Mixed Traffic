Introducing automated vehicles (AVs) on roads may challenge established norms as drivers of human-driven vehicles (HVs) interact with AVs. Our study explored drivers’ decisions in game-theoretical scenarios amid mixed traffic using an online survey study. We manipulated factors including interaction types (HV-HV vs. HV-AV), scenario types (chicken game vs. public goods game), vehicle driving styles (aggressive vs. conservative), and time constraints (high vs. low). The quantitative results showed that human drivers tended to “defect” more, that is, not cooperate, against vehicles with conservative driving styles. The effect of vehicle driving styles was pronounced when interacting with AVs and in chicken game scenarios. Drivers exhibited more “defection” in public goods game scenarios and the effect of scenario types was weakened under high time constraints. Only drivers with moderate driving styles “defected” more in HV-AV interaction. Our qualitative findings provide essential insights into how drivers perceived conditions and formulated strategies for decision-making.
