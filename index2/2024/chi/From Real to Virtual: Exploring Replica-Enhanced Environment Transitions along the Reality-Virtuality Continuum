Recent Head-Mounted Displays enable users to perceive the real environment using a video-based see-through mode and the fully virtual environment within a single display. Leveraging these advancements, we present a generic concept to seamlessly transition between the real and virtual environment, with the goal of supporting users in engaging with and disengaging from any real environment into Virtual Reality. This transition process uses a digital replica of the real environment and incorporates various stages of Milgramâ€™s Reality-Virtuality Continuum, along with visual transitions that facilitate gradual navigation between them. We implemented the overall transition concept and four object-based transition techniques. The overall transition concept and four techniques were evaluated in a qualitative user study, focusing on user experience, the use of the replica and visual coherence. The results of the user study show, that most participants stated that the replica facilitates the cognitive processing of the transition and supports spatial orientation.
