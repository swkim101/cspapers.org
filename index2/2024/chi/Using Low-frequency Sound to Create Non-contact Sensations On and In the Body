This paper proposes a method for generating non-contact sensations using low-frequency sound waves without requiring user instrumentation. This method leverages the fundamental acoustic response of a confined space to produce predictable pressure spatial distributions at low frequencies, called modes. These modes can be used to produce sensations either throughout the body, in localized areas of the body, or within the body. We first validate the location and strength of the modes simulated by acoustic modeling. Next, a perceptual study is conducted to show how different frequencies produce qualitatively different sensations across and within the participantsâ€™ bodies. The low-frequency sound offers a new way of delivering non-contact sensations throughout the body. The results indicate a high accuracy for predicting sensations at specific body locations.
