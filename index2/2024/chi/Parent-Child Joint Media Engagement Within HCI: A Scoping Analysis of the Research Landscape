Parents play essential roles in childrenâ€™s play and learning with various media, often leading to positive and productive engagement outcomes for both parties. As such, an increasing number of HCI research has focused on understanding parent-child joint media engagement (JME) and designing new technologies to foster productive joint media experiences for children and parents. However, we currently lack a systematic view of this emerging field, which hinders the research and design of new joint media experiences and technologies for families. In this work, we conduct a scoping review of parent-child JME research within HCI (N = 89) and analyze the included papers from three lenses: publication features, methodological features, and JME features. Based on these findings, we identify gaps and opportunities in parent-child JME research and further expand the theoretical framing of JME by developing a framework that captures different JME dimensions.
