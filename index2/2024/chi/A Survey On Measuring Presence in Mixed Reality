Presence is a defining element of virtual reality (VR), but it is also increasingly used when assessing mixed reality (MR) experiences. The increased interest in measuring presence in MR and recent works underpinning the specific nature of presence in MR raise the question of the current state and practice of assessing presence in MR. To address this question, we present an analysis of more than 320 studies that report on presence measurements in MR. Our analysis showed that questionnaires are the dominant measurement but also identify problematic trends that stem from the lack of a generally agreed-upon concept or measurement for presence in MR. More specifically, we show that using measurements that are not validated in MR or custom questionnaires limiting the comparability of results is commonplace and could contribute to a looming replication crisis in an increasingly relevant field.
