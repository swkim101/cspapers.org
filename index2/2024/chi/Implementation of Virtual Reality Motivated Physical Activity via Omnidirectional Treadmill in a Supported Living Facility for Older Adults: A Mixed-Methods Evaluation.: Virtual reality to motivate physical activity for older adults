Virtual reality (VR) can support healthy ageing, but few devices have been trialed with frail older adults to increase physical activity. We conducted a preliminary mixed-methods implementation evaluation of an omnidirectional VR treadmill and a static VR experience with seven older adults over a six-week period in a supported living facility. Frequency of use and pre-post physical functioning measures were collected, mainly to establish technology suitability based on person characteristics. Diary entries following technology use, resident focus group and staff interview revealed technology acceptance and perceived potential for increasing physical activity, health and wellbeing through accessing virtual environments, which motivated continued activity. Results demonstrated technology suitability for a range of older adults with various mobility and physical impairments. However, residents noted interest in a seated treadmill for physical activity without perceived risks of falls with standing treadmills. Staff raised considerations around care home implementations including usability, cost and space.
