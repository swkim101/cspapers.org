Programming assistants have reshaped the experience of programming into one where programmers spend less time writing and more time critically examining code. In this paper, we explore how programming assistants can be extended to accelerate the inspection of generated code. We introduce an extension to the programming assistant called Ivie, or instantly visible in-situ explanations. When using Ivie, a programmerâ€™s generated code is instantly accompanied by explanations positioned just adjacent to the code. Our design was optimized for low-cost invocation and dismissal. Explanations are compact and informative. They describe meaningful expressions, from individual variables to entire blocks of code. We present an implementation of Ivie that forks VS Code, applying a modern LLM for timely segmentation and explanation of generated code. In a lab study, we compared Ivie to a contemporary baseline tool for code understanding. Ivie improved understanding of generated code, and was received by programmers as a highly useful, low distraction complement to the programming assistant.
