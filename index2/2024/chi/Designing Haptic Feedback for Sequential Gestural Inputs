This work seeks to design and evaluate haptic feedback for sequential gestural inputs, where mid-air hand gestures are used to express system commands. Nine haptic patterns are first designed leveraging metaphors. To pursue efficient interaction, we examine the trade-off between pattern duration and recognition accuracy and find that durations as short as 0.3s-0.5s achieve roughly 80%-90% accuracy. We then examine the haptic design for sequential inputs, where we vary when the feedback for each gesture is provided, along with pattern duration, gesture sequence length, and age. Results show that providing haptic patterns right after detected hand gestures leads to significantly more efficient interaction compared with concatenating all haptic patterns after the gesture sequence. Moreover, the number of gestures had little impact on performance, but age is a significant predictor. Our results suggest that immediate feedback with 0.3s and 0.5s pattern duration would be recommended for younger and older users respectively.
