Fatness sits at the intersection of many systems of oppression, such as race, gender, class, and (dis)ability. Anti-fat bias happens out in the open and is prevalent in Western society, yet there has been little to no consideration for the wider impact of digital systems in exacerbating, recreating, and repurposing anti-fat bias, or any engagement with designing for fat justice. Therefore, this paper argues that there needs to be a consideration for fat dignity in the design of digital systems, and an investigation of the (un)intended consequences of the datafication of fat lives. This paper offers a scoping literature review of HCI and Fat Studies to identify research gaps and argues that both disciplines would benefit from collaboration. Specifically, the standard of design justice would be increased through radical acceptance, and new questions could be asked to critique how technologies have been leveraged to exercise control over our bodies.
