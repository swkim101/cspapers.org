The widespread adoption of menstrual tracking applications has garnered much attention with recent research focusing on inclusive design. However, existing literature has yet to explore the impact of religious practices on menstrual tracking behavior. We investigate the menstrual tracking practices of Muslim women of faith in the United States, a population whose personal reproductive health behaviors are deeply influenced by their faith, values, and religious laws We conducted a three-phase study consisting of preliminary surveys (N=133), semi-structured interviews (N=20), and a post-Roe v. Wade survey (N=77). We highlight motivations for tracking and uncover this overlooked populationâ€™s challenges as they engage with menstrual tracking technologies. We reveal an intimate connection between menstrual tracking and religious practices. We uncover challenges from engaging with existing menstrual tracking applications and contribute design recommendations for accommodating faith in the design of health tracking technologies. We amplify a call to action for the HCI community to reduce the "othering" of under-represented populations and to better support the inclusive design of technologies that center religious identities and values for individuals of faith.
