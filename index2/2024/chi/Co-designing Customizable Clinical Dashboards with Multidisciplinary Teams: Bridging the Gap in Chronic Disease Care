Providing care to individuals with chronic diseases benefits from a multidisciplinary approach and longitudinal symptom, event, and disease monitoring, in and out of clinical facilities. Technological advancements, including the ubiquitous presence of sensors and devices, present opportunities to collect large amounts of data and extract evidence-based insights about the patient and disease. Nevertheless, practical examples of clinical utility of those technologies remain sparse, and in specific focus areas (e.g, insights from a single device). This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of multidisciplinary clinical dashboards to support clinicians caring for people with chronic diseases. We report on a focus group and co-design workshops with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and HCI researchers. We offer insights into how technological outcomes and visualizations can enhance clinical practice and the intricacies of information-sharing dynamics. We discuss the potential of dashboards to trigger actions in clinical settings and emphasize the benefits of customizable dashboards.
