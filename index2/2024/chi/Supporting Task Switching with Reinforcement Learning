Attention management systems aim to mitigate the negative effects of multitasking. However, sophisticated real-time attention management is yet to be developed. We present a novel concept for attention management with reinforcement learning that automatically switches tasks. The system was trained with a user model based on principles of computational rationality. Due to this user model, the system derives a policy that schedules task switches by considering human constraints such as visual limitations and reaction times. We evaluated its capabilities in a challenging dual-task balancing game. Our results confirm our main hypothesis that an attention management system based on reinforcement learning can significantly improve human performance, compared to humansâ€™ self-determined interruption strategy. The system raised the frequency and difficulty of task switches compared to the users while still yielding a lower subjective workload. We conclude by arguing that the concept can be applied to a great variety of multitasking settings.
