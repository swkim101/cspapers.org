Artisanal supply chains play a significant role in the economy and social sustainability of many developing countries. The total value of the global artisanal and handicrafts market was $526 Billion (USD) in 2017 and is expected to reach $984 Billion (USD) by 2023 [NEST, 2018]. The sector is also the second biggest source of employment for rural women, especially for those from the under-privileged class. Unfortunately, while the artisan sector plays a crucial role, many workers in this sector struggle with low productivity and poverty, in part due to the highly distributed nature of the supply chain [Banik, 2017]. A significant fraction of artisanal production in developing countries is still conducted by artisans from their individual households that are dispersed across large geographical areas, thus posing numerous challenges including low productivity, limited access to financing, technology and quality control in the upstream of such supply chains.
