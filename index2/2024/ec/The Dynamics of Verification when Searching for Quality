An agent samples projects over time, observing a binary quality realization for each, while a principal can select at most one. The principal values quality, whereas the agent only wants a project chosen. Transfers are unavailable, but the principal can verify quality by paying a constant fixed cost. We find optimal dynamic mechanisms (i.e., project allocation and verification rules) for this problem. There are three main cases we consider: • With a low verification cost and a long horizon, the optimal mechanism involves a deterministic selection rule that initially discriminates on quality but chooses a project irrespective of it at a deadline. Verification (following a claim of high quality) occurs with an intermediate probability before the deadline, declining over time. We refer to this verification policy as increasing trust, as the declining probability of verification reflects diminishing skepticism over the agent's claims over time. • If the horizon is finite and the loss from allocating a low quality project is sufficiently large, then if the deadline is reached, in some cases principal may aim to avoid allocating low-quality projects. In that case, the verification dynamics may be flipped---as time progresses, the probability of verification increases, with the principal verifying any claim of high quality with probability 1 at the deadline. • If the cost of verification is large, then the principal optimally augments an increasing trust mechanism with a randomization phase. In this phase, the principal does not verify any claim of the agent. Instead, if the agent claims to have a high-quality project, with an intermediate probability the agent is allocated and with complementary probability outside options are selected. In particular, this randomization phase always precedes the verification phase.
