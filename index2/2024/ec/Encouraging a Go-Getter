Consider a decision maker (he) who may receive an exogenously fixed reward if he takes a costly action above an unknown threshold. The information available to the decision maker about the threshold is controlled by a designer (she), whose utility depends on the decision maker's action, in an increasing manner. The designer can commit to disclose arbitrary information about the threshold. The goal of this paper is to solve for the designer's optimal information disclosure policy. Two general properties of optimal disclosure policies are robust to the specification of the designer's preferences. First, the decision maker passes the threshold and achieves the reward exactly when he would have optimally chosen to do so if he had complete information about the threshold. Second, the decision maker remains exactly indifferent between receiving the designer's message or acting on the basis of his prior belief. Beyond these two features, an important determinant of the structure of optimal disclosure policies is the designer's attitude towards marginal increases in the decision maker's action. The paper presents explicit solutions to the designer's problem in the two cases in which her utility exhibits either increasing or diminishing returns in the decision maker's action. In each case, the actions taken by the decision maker in equilibrium are distributed on a wide support. Notably, when the designer experiences increasing returns from the decision maker's action, her optimal policy induces posterior beliefs designed to keep the decision maker confused about which action to take. Specifically, with probability one, the decision maker's posterior belief ensures he is indifferent between his chosen action and any lower equilibrium action. Conversely, when the designer's utility exhibits diminishing returns, the induced posterior beliefs provide clear guidance, allowing the decision maker to uniquely identify an optimal equilibrium action. Furthermore, upon receiving the designer's message, the decision maker always places zero probability on any other equilibrium action turning out to be ex-post optimal. A contribution of the paper is the characterization of optimal persuasion schemes in an environment in which actions and states live in a continuum.
