Pseudomarkets are useful in many market design applications without transfers, including the allocation of donations to food banks, course assignment, and school choice. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of equilibria in pseudomarkets with indivisible goods. In particular, we show that all random equilibria in a pseudomarket can be realized as lotteries over allocations if and only if competitive equilibria exist in a transferable utility economy within the same class of valuations. Our equivalence result bridges two fundamental models of competitive market designs for indivisible resources, offering new insights into equilibrium existence and maximal domain results for pseudomarkets. We extend the main equivalence result to incorporate priorities (e.g., school choice), ex-ante individual constraints (e.g., portfolios), and expost aggregate constraints (e.g., regional capacities). Our paper highlights the broad applicability of the pseudomarkets for resource allocation, even in the presence of preference complementarities and complex constraints.
