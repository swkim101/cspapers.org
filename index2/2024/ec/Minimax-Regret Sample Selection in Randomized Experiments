Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often run in settings with many subpopulations that may have differential benefits from the treatment being evaluated. We consider the problem of sample selection, i.e., whom to enroll in an RCT, such as to optimize welfare in a heterogeneous population. We formalize this problem within the minimax-regret framework, and derive optimal sample-selection schemes under a variety of conditions. We also highlight how different objectives and decisions can lead to notably different guidance regarding optimal sample allocation through a synthetic experiment leveraging historical COVID-19 trial data.
