We study how to optimally segment a monopolistic market given a redistributive objective. Optimal redistributive segmentations (i) induce the seller to price progressively, i.e., richer consumers pay higher prices than poorer ones, and (ii) may require giving a higher profit than uniform pricing if the redistributive motive is strong. We further show that optimal redistributive segmentations are implementable via price-based regulation.
