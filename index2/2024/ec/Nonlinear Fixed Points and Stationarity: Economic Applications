We consider the (cid:133)xed points of nonlinear operators that naturally arise in dynamic programming, in models of opinion dynamics in networks with stubborn agents, and in equilibrium risk evaluation of interconnected (cid:133)nancial institutions using coherent risk measures. We study limit cases that correspond to high patience, vanishing stubbornness, and high coordination motives in the applications above. Under monotonicity and continuity assumptions, we provide explicit ex-pressions for the limit (cid:133)xed-points. We show that, under di⁄erentiability, the limit (cid:133)xed point is linear in the initial conditions and characterized by the Jacobian of the operator at any constant vector with an explicit and linear rate of convergence. Without di⁄erentiability, but under additional continuity properties, the multiplicity of Jacobians is resolved by a representation of the limit (cid:133)xed point as a maxmin functional evaluated at the initial conditions. In our applications, we use these results to show the existence of the asymptotic value in a class of zero-sum stochastic games with a continuum of actions, compute a nonlinear version of the eigenvector centrality of agents in networks, and characterize the limit equilibrium evaluation of the underlying real asset.
