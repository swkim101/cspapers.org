Digital platforms that help customers find suitable service providers often monetize by selling customer leads to interested service providers. Examples of such platforms include Bark, Google Local Services, HomeAdvisor, Modernize, Porch, and Thumbtack. I analyze this platform design using a game-theoretic model and obtain insights on how the pricing of leads affects customer and provider welfare. When the platform raises the fee per lead for a customer type, providers who buy these leads quote more competitive prices to these customers, which benefits the customers whose leads are bought. However, providers may also buy fewer such leads, switch to other customer types, or exit the platform. For maximizing social welfare, the simple policy of charging a market-clearing fee-per-lead for every customer type guarantees at least 1/(e - 1) â‰ˆ 58.19% of the first-best welfare, and at least 79.15% of the welfare under the optimal fees. Higher welfare can be achieved by paying providers an additional subsidy upon each job well done, so that experienced providers with cheaper sources of leads do not exit the platform. Understanding the nuances of these welfare effects can help platforms better grow both sides of the marketplace while maintaining an adequate revenue stream.
