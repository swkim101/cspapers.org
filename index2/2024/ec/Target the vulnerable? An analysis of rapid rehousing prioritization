We model the problem facing a policymaker who must allocate rapid rehousing support to people experiencing homelessness and wishes to minimize the steady-state size of the homeless population. Typically, support is given to the most vulnerable applicants, or to applicants most likely to remain housed. We show that these approaches may result in a homeless population that is arbitrarily larger than what could be achieved by an optimal policy, and propose an alternative priority queue that is approximately optimal.
