We study Prioritized Selection Problems in which an organization is presented with a set of individuals, and must choose which subset to accept. The organization makes a selection based on a priority ranking of individuals as well as other observable characteristics. We study outcome based selection rules, which are defined by a collection of feasible selections and a greedy processing algorithm.
