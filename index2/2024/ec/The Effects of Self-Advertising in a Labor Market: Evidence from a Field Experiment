We study the introduction of advertising in an online labor market where applicants could bid to "boost" their applications. Applicants with the highest bids received a prominent position at the top of the employer's application list. The platform randomly varied whether the employer was exposed to boosted applications, and within the exposure group, whether the employer was shown a disclosure that the application was boosted. We find that boosted applications are positively selected, and that boosting an application increases the likelihood of an applicant being hired by about 40%. The experimental design allows us to estimate that about 80% of this increase was due to the ranking effect---boosted applications ranking higher---and 20.2% was due to the signaling effect---the disclosure that the application is boosted.
