In this study, we investigate two different types of duopolistic competitive assortment problems under the multinomial logit model: (1) In simultaneous assortment competition, both retailers make strategic decisions and offer assortments simultaneously. The objective is to identify an assortment strategy profile that prevents unilateral and profitable deviations by either retailer; (2) In sequential assortment competition, retailers sequentially offer assortments, with one round to each retailer. The objective is to determine the optimal strategy for the leader (first-moved retailer), with the follower (second-moved retailer) reacting optimally based on the leader's choice. We extend prior work by introducing a more general competitive model incorporating common products under the multinomial logit model, capable of capturing a variety of choice behaviors that appear in retailing scenarios, such as consumer loyalty and rarity effects. For simultaneous assortment competition, we study the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and fully characterize the structures of equilibrium outcomes. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium that always Pareto-dominates others in the settings with both common and exclusive products. This equilibrium is efficiently computed using a carefully crafted iterative best response process. However, deciding whether a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in more general settings, including those with common products and cardinality constraints, turns out to be NP-complete. For sequential assortment competition, we find that the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium leads to higher profitability for both the leader and the follower compared to the Pareto-dominant equilibrium in simultaneous assortment competition. This significant difference from general sequential games suggests that both retailers would prefer participating in a sequential assortment competition over a simultaneous counterpart. Despite its profitability advantages, computing the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for duopoly sequential assortment competition is NP-hard, even with only exclusive products. To address this hardness result, we propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for problems involving both common and exclusive products. We also extend our analysis and develop near-optimal approximation algorithms or establish inapproximability hardness results for the sequential assortment competition with capacity constraints.
