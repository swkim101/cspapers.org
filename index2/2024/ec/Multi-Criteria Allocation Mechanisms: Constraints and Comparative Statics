We study the absolute and relative structure of Pareto-optimal allocation mechanisms in settings where the planner considers more than one objective criterion. Specifically, we (i) characterize mechanisms that implement the entire Pareto frontier (which cannot be done by maximizing weighted sums of the criteria) and (ii) study how these mechanisms change along the Pareto frontier (comparative statics). To describe the core ideas, we first consider the problem of allocating a scarce public resource: a planner is distributing a fixed supply of a homogenous good among a continuum population of agents. While the individuals' valuations for the good are not known to the planner, their distribution is. The planner takes into account two criteria as objectives: allocative efficiency, defined as the sum of the agents' valuations for owned goods, and social welfare, defined as a (possibly) weighted average of the agents' payoffs. The payoff of an agent is her valuation for the good she is allocated minus the net payment she makes to the planner.
