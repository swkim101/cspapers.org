I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players endogenously decide whether to disclose signals about their past actions. I establish an-anti folk theorem, that when players are sufficiently long-lived, they will almost always play their dominant actions and will almost never cooperate. When players' expected lifespans are intermediate, they can sustain some cooperation if their actions are substitutes but cannot sustain any cooperation if their actions are complements. Therefore, the maximal level of cooperation a community can sustain is not monotone with respect to its members' expected lifespans and the complementarity of players' actions can undermine their abilities to sustain cooperation.
