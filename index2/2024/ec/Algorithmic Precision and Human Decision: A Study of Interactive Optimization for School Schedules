In collaboration with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), this paper introduces an interactive optimization framework to tackle complex school scheduling challenges. The choice of school start and end times is an optimization challenge, as schedules influence the district's transportation system, and limiting the associated costs is a computationally difficult combinatorial problem. However, it is also a policy challenge, as transportation costs are far from the only consequence of school schedule changes. Policymakers need time and knowledge to balance these considerations and reach a consensus carefully; past implementations have failed because of policy issues despite state-of-the-art optimization approaches. We first motivate our approach with a micro-foundation model of the interplay between policymakers and researchers, arguing that limiting their dependency is key. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that includes (1) a fast algorithm capable of solving the school schedule problem that compares favorably to the literature and (2) an interactive optimization approach that leverages this speed to allow policymakers to explore a variety of solutions in a transparent and efficient way, facilitating the policy decisionmaking process. The framework led to the first optimization-driven school start time changes in the US, updating the schedule of all 133 schools in SFUSD in 2021 with annual transportation savings exceeding $5 million. A comprehensive survey of approximately 27,000 parents and staff in 2022 provides evidence of the approach's effectiveness.
