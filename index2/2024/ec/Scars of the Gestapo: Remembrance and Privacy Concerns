We study how remembrance of an authoritarian regime affects privacy concerns, leveraging Germany's strong culture of Holocaust remembrance. One example of this culture of remembrance are the Stolpersteine, plaques on the sidewalk that signal that a victim of Nazi persecution lived at a given address. We use a detailed street-level dataset of Berlin to study how Stolpersteine affect privacy concerns. We develop a novel measure of privacy concerns based on requests for buildings to be blurred on an online street-level imagery provider. To isolate causality, we leverage the quasi-random variation in Stolpersteine location after controlling for victim agglomeration patterns around each address. We show that Stolpersteine cause a localized increase in blurring, with the effect concentrating within 10 meters of a Stolperstein. Furthermore, through an experimental survey we show that when Germans are primed to think about the Stolpersteine and Nazi persecution, they respond by spending more time on the experiment's final consent form, which constitutes another novel measure of privacy concerns.
