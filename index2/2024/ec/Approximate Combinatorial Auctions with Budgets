We develop sealed-bid combinatorial auction formats for indivisible goods in which bidders can express budget constraints. To do so, we analyze the extent to which the designer must adjust budgets or the supply of goods in order to guarantee the existence of competitive equilibrium. We show that large adjustments can be avoided by perturbing both the budget and supply of goods at the same time. We first give analytical results for additive, assignment and substitutes valuations and explain how budgets can be incorporated into existing auction formats. We then develop a new flexible and parsimonious bidding language---combinatorial assignment valuations---and express the adjustment tradeoff for combinatorial assignment auctions in terms of a parameter that captures the complementarity between goods.
