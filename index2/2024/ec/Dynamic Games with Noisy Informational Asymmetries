This paper extends the equilibrium concepts of trembling hand perfect and stationary Markov perfect equilibrium to a broad class of infinite dynamic games with asymmetric and imperfect information, establishing their existence. Our key innovation is the introduction of sequential absolute continuity (SAC), which generalizes Milgrom and Weber's [1985] absolute continuity condition to dynamic contexts. We show that this notion implies the existence of an equilibrium in a broad class of games with "noisy informational asymmetries," in which players' private information includes some idiosyncratic noise. We study a general class of dynamic games where a state of the world evolves stochastically, jointly determined by previous states and actions. Players receive signals providing information about realized states and past actions, which they may not directly observe. The state and signal spaces are general measure spaces, while the action set is countable. Players' payoffs satisfy two properties: the sum of an upper bound of expected payoffs at each stage is finite, and payoffs exhibit a form of continuity in actions. We first establish the existence of constrained equilibria, where players choose each available action with positive probability due to "trembles." Building on these, we define trembling hand perfect equilibria as the limit of constrained equilibria when players' trembles approach zero, following Selten [1975]. We prove that such equilibria exist and are subgame perfect. For games with Markov properties, we introduce Markov absolute continuity (MAC), a condition neither weaker nor stronger than SAC, and, under MAC, we prove the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. A key implication of our results is that adding noise that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure to players' real-valued signals, combined with specific regularity conditions, ensures equilibrium existence. Notably, the addition of even an arbitrarily small amount of such noise suffices to ensure existence in settings where the previous literature has otherwise demonstrated non-existence. Commonly used noise distributions, such as independent uniform or jointly normal, satisfy these conditions. Furthermore, these noise conditions are satisfied in a diverse array of economic applications, encompassing dynamic oligopolistic competition, sequential auctions with interdependent values, global games of regime change, and currency attacks.
