In today's financial landscape, traditional exchanges compete against online trading platforms. A critical point of competition centers around transaction costs. While traditional exchanges adhere to transparent transaction cost structures, many online trading platforms, under the guise of 'zero-commission trading,' conceal transaction costs within their bid-ask spread. In this paper, I show that hidden transaction costs induce additional volatility in the form of price cycles in markets that would be stable if transparent transaction costs were charged. To compete with the profit opportunities from price cycles on platforms with hidden transaction costs, platforms with transparent costs must reduce them below the optimal monopolist level to attract traders. In this duopoly, I show that there is a market equilibrium: more risk-averse traders prefer transparent transaction costs, while less risk-averse traders choose hidden costs. Depending on the risk attitudes of traders, transparent transaction costs can be more or less efficient than hidden transaction costs. Finally, I demonstrate that the price cycles in markets with hidden transaction costs can be exploited through strategic market entry to a point where the platform ceases to make any revenue, highlighting the necessity of uninformed traders for sustaining zero-commission models.
