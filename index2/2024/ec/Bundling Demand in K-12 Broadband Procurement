We evaluate the effects of bundling demand for broadband internet by K-12 schools. In 2014, New Jersey switched from decentralized procurements to a new procurement system that bundled schools into four regional groups. Using an event study approach, we find that, on average, prices for participants decreased by one-third, and the broadband speed purchased increased sixfold. Bounding the change in school expenditures due to the program, we find that participants saved at least as much as their total E-rate subsidy from the federal government. Furthermore, under the assumption of log-concave demand, we show that participating schools experienced large welfare gains.
