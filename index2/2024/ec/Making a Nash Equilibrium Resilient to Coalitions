Nash equilibrium is often heralded as a guiding principle for rational decision-making in strategic interactions. However, it is well-known that Nash equilibrium sometimes fails as a reliable predictor of outcomes, with two of the most notable issues being the fact that it is not resilient to collusion and that there may be multiple Nash equilibria in a single game. In this paper, we show that a game designer can get around these two issues for free by expanding the action sets of the original game. More precisely, given a normal-form or Bayesian game Γ and a Nash equilibrium [EQUATION] in Γ, a game designer can construct a new game [EQUATION] by expanding the action set of each player and defining appropriate utilities in the action profiles that were not already in the original game. We show that the designer can construct [EQUATION] in such a way that (a) [EQUATION] is a semi-strong Nash equilibrium of [EQUATION], and (b) [EQUATION] Pareto-dominates or quasi Pareto-dominates all other Nash equilibria of [EQUATION].
