The EU-funded EMPYREAN project (empyrean-horizon.eu) aims to establish a hyper-distributed computing paradigm, leveraging collaborative, heterogeneous IoT devices and federated resources. EMPYREAN focuses on developing technologies for efficient AI workload processing, secure distributed edge storage and cloud-native application development. It will offer open and standardised APIs and use open-source platforms. EMPYREAN's capabilities will be demonstrated through three use cases: advanced manufacturing, smart agriculture, and warehouse automation.
