Transformer-based large language models have recently shown remarkable performance, but their significantly large parameters require efficient training, which is commonly realized by utilizing both data- and model-parallel deep learning on a GPU cluster. To minimize the training time, the optimal degrees of data and model parallelisms and the optimal model partitioning should be searched. When heterogeneous GPU clusters are used to utilize as many GPUs as possible, it becomes more challenging. In this work, we propose a framework named FASOP that automatically and rapidly finds the (near-)optimal degrees of parallelisms and model partitioning of Transformer-based models on heterogeneous GPU clusters, with an accurate estimation of pipelining latency and communications. Moreover, it can search for optimal cluster configurations that minimize the training time while satisfying the cost of GPU clusters. The proposed model partitioning algorithm in FASOP is three orders of magnitude faster than Dynamic Programming in the state-of-the-art for GPT-2 1.5B on a mixed set of 32 GPUs with A100 and A10, leading to a few seconds instead of several hours. And, FASOP shows only 8.7% mean absolute error in training time estimation for GPT-2 1.5B. With a fast yet accurate search, FASOP achieved up to 1.37Ã— speedup compared to Megatron-LM.
