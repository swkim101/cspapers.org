This tutorial deals with the integration of data engineering with network management and orchestration in telecommunication networks. It provides participants with a comprehensive insight into the use of data engineering to improve the efficiency and performance of telecommunication systems, especially through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) technologies in network infrastructures. Practical applications are also demonstrated using relevant case studies to illustrate the implementation of these concepts.
