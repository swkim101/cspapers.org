Automated execution of computational workflows has become a critical issue in achieving high productivity in various research and development fields. Over the last few years, workflows have emerged as a significant abstraction of numerous real-world processes and phenomena, including digital twins, personalized medicine, and simulation-based science in general. k-Dispatch is a novel tool designed for the efficient offloading of biomedical workflows to remote high-performance computing clusters or cloud. In addition to data transfers, reporting, error handling and remote computations monitoring, k-Dispatch leverages a set of optimizations to dynamically determine suitable execution parameters for individual tasks within workflows, aiming to meet predefined constraints and optimization criteria. k-Dispatch has been successfully deployed within k-Plan, an advanced modelling tool for planning transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) procedures.
