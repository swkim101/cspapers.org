As the Internet of Things (IoT) gains popularity, the multitude of connected devices accessing computing facilities along the Cloud-IoT continuum has risen rapidly. This growth has prompted an increase in IoT-based applications and the data they process. These applications often carry specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, necessitating the research of strategic management for services and data, coupled with routes across the IoT and application components. Concurrently, our research explores the integration of Intent-Based Networking (IBN) principles to manage data flows and resolve conflicts among stakeholders sharing the same infrastructure. This dual-focus approach aims to support the effective placement and management of multi-service applications on Cloud-IoT resources, considering QoS, data characteristics, and resource conflict detection and resolution. This work outlines our primary objectives and shares findings from our ongoing research.
