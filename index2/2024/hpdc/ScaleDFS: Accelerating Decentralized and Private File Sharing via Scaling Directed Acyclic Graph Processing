This paper introduces a novel file system, ScaleDFS, designed to accelerate decentralized file sharing for a private network, leveraging the potential of scaling file management based on directed acyclic graph (DAG) on modern hardware. Specifically, in ScaleDFS, we first design a DAG builder that parallelizes the construction of DAG nodes for a file while preserving critical orders to speed up the uploading process. Second, we introduce a DAG reader that retrieves leaf DAG nodes in parallel without graph traversal assisted by a devised DAG cache to accelerate the downloading process. Finally, we present a DAG remover that rapidly identifies obsolete DAG nodes/data and removes them in parallel to mitigate the garbage collection overhead without compromising consistency. We implement ScaleDFS based on IPFS and demonstrate that ScaleDFS outperforms IPFS by up to 3.7×, 1.8×, and 12.6× in realistic file, private blockchain, and gateway workloads, respectively.
