The growing developments of HPC systems used in a plethora of domains (healthcare, financial services, government and defense, energy) triggers an urgent demand for simulation frameworks that can simulate, in an integrated manner, both processing and network components of an HPC system-under-design (SuD). The main problem, however, is that, currently, there is a shortage of simulation frameworks that can handle the simulation of actual HPC systems, including the hardware, complete software stack and network dynamics in an integrated manner. In this work we start from the first known, open-source, fully-distributed Cloud simulation framework, COSSIM, and, as part of the RED-SEA1 and Vitamin-V2 European projects, we extend it so as to be able to accurately simulate HPC systems. The extended simulator has been evaluated when executing the very-widely used HPCG & LAMMPS benchmarks on both ARM & RISC-V architectures; the results demonstrate that the presented approach has up to 95% accuracy in the reported SuD aspects.
