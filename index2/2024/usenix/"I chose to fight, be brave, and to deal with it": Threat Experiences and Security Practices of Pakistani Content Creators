Content creators are exposed to elevated risks compared to the general Internet user. This study explores the threat landscape that creators in Pakistan are exposed to, how they protect themselves, and which support structures they rely on. We conducted a semi-structured interview study with 23 creators from diverse backgrounds who create content on various topics. Our data suggests that online threats frequently spill over into the offline world, especially for gender minorities. Creating content on sensitive topics like politics, religion, and human rights is associated with elevated risks. We find that defensive mechanisms and external support structures are non-existent, lacking, or inadequately adjusted to the sociocultural context of Pakistan.
