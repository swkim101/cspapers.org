With the continuous development of software open-sourcing, the reuse of open-source software has led to a significant increase in the occurrence of recurring vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities often arise through the practice of copying and pasting existing vulnerabilities. Many methods have been proposed for detecting recurring vulnerabilities, but they often struggle to ensure both high efficiency and consideration of semantic information about vulnerabilities and patches. In this paper, we introduce FIRE, a scalable method for largescale recurring vulnerability detection. It utilizes multi-stage f iltering and differential taint paths to achieve precise clone vulnerability scanning at an extensive scale. In our evaluation across ten open-source software projects, FIRE demonstrates a precision of 90.0% in detecting 298 recurring vulnerabilities out of 385 ground truth instance. This surpasses the performance of existing advanced recurring vulnerability detection tools, detecting 31.4% more vulnerabilities than VUDDY and 47.0% more than MOVERY. When detecting vulnerabilities in large-scale software, FIRE outperforms MOVERY by saving about twice the time, enabling the scanning of recurring vulnerabilities on an ultra-large scale.
