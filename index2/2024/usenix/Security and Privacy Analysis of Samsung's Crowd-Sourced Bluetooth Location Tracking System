We present a detailed analysis of Samsung's Offline Finding (OF) protocol, which is part of Samsung's Find My Mobile system for locating Samsung mobile devices and Galaxy SmartTags.  The OF protocol uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to broadcast a unique beacon for a lost device. This beacon is then picked up by nearby Samsung phones or tablets (the helper devices), which then forward the beacon and the location it was detected at, to a vendor server. The owner of a lost device can then query the server to locate their device. We examine several security and privacy related properties of the OF protocol and its implementation. These include: the feasibility of tracking an OF device through its BLE data, the feasibility of unwanted tracking of a person by exploiting the OF network, the feasibility for the vendor to de-anonymise location reports to determine the locations of the owner or the helper devices, and the feasibility for an attacker to compromise the integrity of the location reports. Our findings suggest that there are privacy risks on all accounts, arising from issues in the design and the implementation of the OF protocol.
