Network-targeting volumetric DDoS attacks remain a major threat to Internet communication. Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of providing forwarding guarantees to the important class of short-lived intermediate-rate communication such as web traffic in a secure, scalable, light-weight, low-cost, and incrementally deployable fashion. To overcome those limitations we design Z-Lane, a system achieving those objectives by ensuring bandwidth isolation among authenticated traffic from (groups of) autonomous systems, thus safeguarding intermediate-rate communication against even the largest volumetric DDoS attacks. Our evaluation on a global testbed and our high-speed implementation on commodity hardware demonstrate Z-Lane's effectiveness and scalability.
