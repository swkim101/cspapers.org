LiDAR-based perception is crucial to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous driving (AD) systems. Though some adversarial attack methods against LiDAR-based detectors perception models have been proposed, deceiving such models in the physical world is still challenging. While existing robustness methods focus on transforming point clouds to embed more robust adversarial information, our research reveals how to reduce the errors during the LiDAR capturing process to improve the robustness of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present AE-Morpher, a novel approach that minimizes differences between the LiDAR-captured and original adversarial point clouds to improve the robustness of adversarial objects. It reconstructs the adversarial object using surfaces with regular shapes to fit the discrete laser beams. We evaluate AE-Morpher by conducting physical disappearance attacks that use a mounted adversarial ornament to conceal a car from models' detection results in both SVL Simulator environments and real-world LiDAR setups. In the simulated world, we successfully deceive the model up to 91.1% of the time when LiDAR moves towards the target vehicle from 20m away. On average, our method increases the ASR by 38.64% and reduces the adversarial ornament's projection area by 67.59%. For the real world, we achieve an average attack success rate of 71.4% over a 12m motion scenario. Moreover, adversarial objects reconstructed by our method can be easily physically constructed by human hands without the requirement of a 3D printer.
