Machine learning is a rapidly evolving technology with manifold benefits. At its core lies the mapping between samples and corresponding target labels (SL-Mappings). Such mappings can originate from labeled dataset samples or from prediction generated during model inference. The correctness of SL-Mappings is crucial, both during training and for model predictions, especially when considering poisoning attacks.
Existing standalone works from the dataset cleaning and prediction confidence scoring domains lack a dual-use tool offering an SL-Mappings score, which is impractical. Moreover, these works have drawbacks, e.g., dependence on specific model architectures and reliance on large datasets, which may not be accessible, or lack a meaningful confidence score.
In this paper, we introduce LabelTrust, a versatile tool designed to generate confidence scores for SL-Mappings. We propose pipelines facilitating dataset cleaning and confidence scoring, mitigating the limitations of existing standalone approaches from each domain. Thereby, LabelTrust leverages a Siamese network trained via few-shot learning, requiring minimal clean samples and is agnostic to datasets and model architectures. We demonstrate LabelTrust's efficacy in detecting poisoning attacks within samples and predictions alike, with a modest one-time training overhead of 34.56 seconds and an evaluation time of less than 1 second per SL-Mapping.
