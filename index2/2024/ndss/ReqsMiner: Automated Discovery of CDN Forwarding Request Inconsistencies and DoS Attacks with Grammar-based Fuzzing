Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are ubiquitous middleboxes designed to enhance the performance of hosted websites and shield them from various attacks. Numerous notable studies show that CDNs modify a client's request when forwarding it to the original server. Multiple inconsistencies in this forwarding operation have been found to potentially result in security vulnerabilities like DoS attacks. Nonetheless, existing research lacks a systematic approach to studying CDN forwarding request inconsistencies.
