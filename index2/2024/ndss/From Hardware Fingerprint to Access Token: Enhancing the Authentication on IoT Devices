The proliferation of consumer IoT products in our daily lives has raised the need for secure device authentication and access control.
Unfortunately, these resource-constrained devices typically use token-based authentication, which is vulnerable to token compromise attacks that allow attackers to impersonate the devices and perform malicious operations by stealing the access token.
Using hardware fingerprints to secure their authentication is a promising way to mitigate these threats.
However, once attackers have stolen some hardware fingerprints (e.g., via MitM attacks), they can bypass the hardware authentication by training a machine learning model to mimic fingerprints or reusing these fingerprints to craft forge requests.
