Generating accurate call graphs for large programs, particularly at the operating system (OS) level, poses a well-known challenge. This difficulty stems from the widespread use of indirect calls within large programs, wherein the computation of call targets is deferred until runtime to achieve program polymorphism. Consequently, compilers are unable to statically determine indirect call edges. Recent advancements have attempted to use type analysis to globally match indirect call targets in programs. However, these approaches still suffer from low precision when handling large target programs or generic types.
