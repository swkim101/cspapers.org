When multimodal AI systems increasingly utilize diverse data sources to achieve advanced understanding and interaction, they inevitably collect vast amounts of sensitive information, thus highlighting the urgent need for robust privacy safeguards, especially as these technologies expand into fields like healthcare, finance, and education. Existing research on data privacy in AI, encompassing adversarial training-based models, differential privacy-based models, and differentially private transform-based models, often neglects the inter-correlation inherent in multi-sensor data. To address this gap, we propose the differentiAl Private OnLine muLti-sensor data predictiOn model (APOLLO), which simultaneously considers intra-correlation and inter-correlation to enhance privacy protection while maintaining predictive performance. Under the proposed APOLLO frame-work, we design two implementations: APOLLO I, which ensures $\epsilon$-differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to each correlated data segment, and APOLLO II, which applies additional noise to make the concatenated multi-sensor data realize $\epsilon{-}$ differential privacy. Furthermore, we conduct the theoretical analysis to reveal the relationship between performance influence and the privacy budget, providing guidelines for noise addition with the aim of achieving certified performance. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the APOLLO model, establishing a new standard for privacy-preserving multi-sensor data prediction.
