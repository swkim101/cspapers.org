Among various disasters, fire poses one of the most widespread threats to public safety. The early stage of fire, marked by small and slow-spreading fire objects, is the ideal time for firefighting intervention. Therefore, early fire detection is crucial to prevent potential hazards and reduce loss of life and property. However, due to the variable shapes and small size, existing methods struggle to precisely locate smoke and flame in the initial stage. Compared to rigid objects, flame has unique local morphology, such as sharp tip, irregular edge and cavity. These prior knowledge could guide the model to focus on the local morphological features of the flame, thereby improving early fire detection ability. To address the current challenges, the paper proposes a Local Morphological Knowledge Matching based Early Fire Detector(LMKMFD), which accurately detects early fires and locates the multi-scale fires by exploring local flame morphology in fire images. Firstly, the local morphological features are extracted by matching the input fire image with the knowledge templates of the designed local morphological knowledge base. Secondly, fire multi-scale semantic features at four scales are mined by a Transformer-based backbone. Finally, fire local morphological features and multi-scale semantic features are aggregated by single-level depth prediction module to achieve region-level localization of fire objects. Experimental results on private and public datasets show that LMKMFD exhibits high detection precision for fires of different scales, particularly small early fires. LMKMFD outperforms baseline models, with mean Average Precision(mAP) of 88.38% and 83.12% on two datasets. Notably, due to the significance of local morphology of flame, the method performs better in detecting flame than smoke.
