Since the inception of online fake news detection, the technique of natural language processing has predominantly been leading the field by utilizing text classification to discern veracity. From the network perspective, news traveling within a social network typically exhibits non-textual correlations aligned with the network of news propagation or news-user interaction. Therefore, with the advancement of graph learning, there have been emerging approaches incorporating graphs of social contexts as auxiliary information, of which the performance still relies on learning semantics from news text. As fake news becomes more adept at employing the writing pattern of real news and the assessment of certain news contents requires domain-specific knowledge, distinguishing real news from fake ones based on the text has become increasingly challenging. This raises a question: Can we debunk fake news without going through the text? Thus, this work aims to explore the feasibility of differentiating between real and fake news by capturing its relationships with other news and people in the network. We propose a method named ComE-DeFake which extracts intricate relations beyond pairwise of news and users in social contexts to detect fake news. Experimental results reveal that our method without using news text outperforms all baseline methods. This suggests that, if high-order complicated relations are fully captured, it is achievable to debunk fake news without analyzing its text.
