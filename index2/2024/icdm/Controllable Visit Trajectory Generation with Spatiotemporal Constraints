Human mobility data, represented as sequences of visits, are crucial for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and public health. However, large-scale human mobility data is typically inaccessible to researchers due to the high cost of data collection and privacy concerns. This limitation has led to several studies proposing learned models to generate synthetic visit sequences. Despite this progress, existing approaches lack mechanisms to control the generation process, which prevents the incorporation of prior knowledge and the spatiotemporal specification of certain visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the Constraint Trajectory Generation problem and introduce Geo-CETRA (Constraint Enforced Trajectory Generation), a novel framework that operates within the continuous spatiotemporal space, enabling direct generation of geographical coordinates and durations of each visit in a trajectory. Geo-CETRA reparameterizes the sampling space for effective enforcement of various spatiotemporal constraints. Furthermore, incorporating a constraint factorization approach along with an innovative beam decoding module, Geo-CETRA facilitates the production of high-quality synthetic trajectories that realistically emulate human movement while satisfying predefined spatiotemporal constraints. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate Geo-CETRA's superior precision and contextual accuracy compared to existing approaches.
