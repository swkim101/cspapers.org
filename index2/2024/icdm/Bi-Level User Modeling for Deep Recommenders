Deep Recommender Systems (DRS) are essential for navigating the extensive data across various platforms in today's digital landscape. Current DRS models often treat all features equally and implement complex structures to enhance the capture of feature interactions. However, they may fail to recognize crucial user patterns due to not fully utilizing user-specific features for user modeling. Moreover, prevailing user modeling techniques concentrate exclusively on either the group or individual level, overlooking the potential insights from the unaddressed one. This oversight can miss shared group preferences or learn group patterns that conflict with individual preferences. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GPRec, a novel bi-level user modeling approach that substantially improves DRS. GPRec explicitly categorizes users into groups in a learnable manner and aligns them with corresponding group embeddings. We design the dual group embedding space to offer a diverse perspective on group preferences by contrasting positive and negative patterns. On the individual level, GPRec identifies personal preferences from ID-like features and refines the obtained individual representations to be independent of group ones, thereby providing a robust complement to the group-level modeling. We also present various strategies for the flexible integration of GPRec into various DRS models. Rigorous testing of GPRec on three public datasets has demonstrated significant improvements in recommendation quality. Additional experiments further explore crucial components of GPRec, its parameter sensitivity, and the group diversity.
