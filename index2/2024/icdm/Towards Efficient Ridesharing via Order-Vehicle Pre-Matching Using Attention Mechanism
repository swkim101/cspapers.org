Dynamic ridesharing has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its numerous benefits. Existing ridesharing algorithms often employ a “filter-and-refine” frame-work, where a large set of candidate vehicles is initially selected for each ride order, followed by computationally intensive route planning for each candidate. However, this process can lead to significant response delays and limit system efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose an order-vehicle pre-matching recommendation approach (PreMR) that refines the candidate set before route planning. PreMR leverages spatial-temporal intervals and a self-attention mechanism to encode diverse order and vehicle information into uniform and informative representations, enabling it to accurately identify the most suitable vehicles for each order. Extensive experiments using real-world datasets and four representative ridesharing algorithms demonstrate that PreMR significantly reduces order response time (by 46.78% on average) while maintaining high service quality, with a slight trade-off in the order completion rate.
