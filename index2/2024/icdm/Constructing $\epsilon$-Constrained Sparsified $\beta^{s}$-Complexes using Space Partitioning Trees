Persistent Homology (PH) computes the persistence of homologies in data. Unfortunately, PH suffers from exponential complexity. Two important mechanisms used to attack this complexity are: (i) using Alpha complexes; and (ii) setting an upper bound on the dimensions of homology group dimensions reported. Unfortunately Alpha complexes cannot be constructed in a bounded subspace <tex>$\mathbb{R}^{s}$</tex> of the ambient dimension <tex>$\mathbb{R}^{n}(s < n)$</tex>, so they cannot be used together. This paper explores a mechanism that uses sparsified <tex>$\beta^{s}$</tex>-complexes to build Alpha complexes in bounded subspaces. The approach leverages Space-Partitioning <tex>$(SP)$</tex> trees to manage the generation of subspace <tex>$\beta^{s}$</tex>-meshes that are sufficient to preserve <tex>$H_{s}$</tex> homology features for data in <tex>$\mathbb{R}^{n}(s < n)$</tex>. This approach constructs sparsified <tex>$\beta^{s}$</tex>-complexes significantly faster and for larger data than previously possible. The sparsified <tex>$\beta^{s}$</tex>-complexes produce a family of complexes scalable to <tex>$\beta$</tex>; members of this family approximate a Vietoris-Rips complex when <tex>$\beta=0$</tex> and an Alpha complex in when <tex>$\beta=1$</tex>. Experimental results with <tex>$\beta^{s}$</tex>-complexes at <tex>$\beta=0$</tex> and <tex>$\beta=1$</tex> produce results from PH that mirror those using conventional constructions of Vietoris-Rips and Alpha complexes.
