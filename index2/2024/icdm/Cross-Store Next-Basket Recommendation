Next-basket recommendation (NBR) infers a set of items that a user will interact with in the next basket. Existing methods often struggle with the data sparsity problem, particularly when the number of baskets is significantly large due to diverse user behaviors. Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) can effectively alleviate this problem in NBR by transferring knowledge across different domains. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on the similarities of overlapping users, which leads to the negative transfer problem and ignores the overlapping items that are general in real-world scenarios like chain stores. In this paper, we provide a clear symbolic definition of cross-store recommendation (CSR) and distinguish it from CDR. We also propose a novel CSNBR model for cross-store next-basket recommendation task. To fully model the transferable collaborative information between two stores, we learn the embeddings of users, baskets, and items by two intra-store bipartite graphs, and use an inter-store unified bipartite graph to transfer the previously learned knowledge. Furthermore, to alleviate the negative transfer problem, we propose to reconstruct the inter-store unified bipartite graph by utilizing user embeddings obtained from the transfer layer and the disentanglement layer. We also employ two sequence encoders to model the historical sequential information at basket-level and item-level. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSNBR model.
