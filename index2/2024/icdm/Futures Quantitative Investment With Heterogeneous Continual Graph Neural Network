It is challenging to predict futures prices with traditional econometric models as it necessitates a comprehensive consideration of both historical observations and correlations among various futures. Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) offer a promising approach for modeling such complex spatio-temporal data. Nevertheless, the direct application of STGNNs to high-frequency futures data remains a challenge, as traders must account for both short- and long-term characteristics when making decisions. To capture these distinct timeframes, we leverage additional label information by devising four heterogeneous tasks: price regression, price gap regression, price moving average regression, and change-point detection. To make full use of these labels, we train the model in a continual manner. Traditional continual GNNs define the gradient of losses as parameter importance to overcome the catastrophic forgetting (CF) issue, while this is unsuitable for our heterogeneous tasks with losses in distinct spaces. Therefore, we propose to calculate the parameter importance with mutual information between the original observations and the extracted features. The empirical results based on 49 varieties of commodity futures demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to the leading approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in modeling the intricate dynamics of the futures market.
