While end-to-end multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) learning approaches have shown significant promise, their applicability is often constrained in neurological diagnostics, such as intracranial EEG resources. When provided with a single-channel EEG, how can we learn representations that are robust to multi-channels and scalable across varied tasks, such as seizure prediction? In this paper, we present SplitSEE, a structurally splittable framework designed for effective temporal-frequency representation learning in single-channel EEG. The key concept of SplitSEE is a self-supervised framework incorporating a deep clustering task. Given an EEG, we argue that the time and frequency domains are two distinct perspectives, and hence, learned representations should share the same cluster assignment. To this end, we first propose two domain-specific modules that independently learn domain-specific representation and address the temporal-frequency tradeoff issue in conventional spectrogram-based methods. Then, we introduce a novel clustering loss to measure the information similarity. This encourages representations from both domains to coherently describe the same input by assigning them a consistent cluster. SplitSEE leverages a pretraining-to-fine-tuning framework within a splittable architecture and has following properties: (a) Effectiveness: it learns representations solely from single-channel EEG but has even outperformed multi-channel baselines. (b) Robustness: it shows the capacity to adapt across different channels with low performance variance. Superior performance is also achieved with our collected clinical dataset. (c) Scalability: With just one fine-tuning epoch, SplitSEE achieves high and stable performance using partial model layers.
