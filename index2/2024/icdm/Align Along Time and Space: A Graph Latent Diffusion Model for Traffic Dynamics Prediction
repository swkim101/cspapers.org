The problem of traffic dynamics prediction, aiming to capture the complicated patterns of urban dynamics and forecast short-term future traffic status, is essential for managing transportation systems, reducing congestion, enhancing safety, improving commuter efficiency, and supporting urban planning and infrastructure development. Current approaches using ma-chine learning and deep neural networks have advanced traffic prediction but often focus on individual urban dynamic aspects and rely on auto-regressive methods for consecutive predictions, which can be inaccurate and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose the Spatial- Temporal Graph LAtent DIffusion ModeL (STGAIL) to address these limitations. STGAIL views geographical regions as graphs with various traffic features, capturing their interconnections. Operating in a pre-trained latent space, STGAIL uses latent diffusion processes and inno-vative spatial-temporal graph layers for accurate and efficient multi-step predictions. Fine-tuning with temporal binary masks further enhances its performance, avoiding error accumulation and reducing computational costs. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate STGAIL's superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. We also make our code and dataset available, contributing to ongoing research in traffic dynamics prediction.
