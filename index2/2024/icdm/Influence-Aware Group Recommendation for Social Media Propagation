Group recommendation over social media streams has attracted attention due to its wide applications such as e-commerce, entertainment and online news broadcasting. However, existing stream group recommendation techniques ignore the influence of user groups, which are not effective for item propagation over social networks. To address this problem, we propose a framework for Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) over high-speed social streams. Specifically, we first propose a novel GroupGCN model to capture the dynamics of user attributes and interactions which maps groups and items to their embeddings. A Temporal GroupGCN-RNN-Autoencoder (TGGCN-RA) model is designed to extend GroupGCN for sequence-based tasks, enabling the prediction of group interests over time. Then, we adopt an Independent Cascade (IC) model to predict the influence propagation of social items over user groups. Extensive experiments prove the high effectiveness and efficiency of IGR.
