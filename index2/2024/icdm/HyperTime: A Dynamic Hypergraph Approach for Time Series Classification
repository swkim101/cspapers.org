Time Series Classification (TSC) aims to develop predictive models for discrete target variables using ordered, real-valued attributes. However, existing deep learning approaches face challenges in addressing the inherent dependencies across data dimensions and the dynamic characteristics of time series data, often resulting in insufficient feature extraction and suboptimal classification accuracy. This paper introduces HyperTime, a novel framework designed to overcome these challenges by modeling time series data as hypergraphs, where hyperedges connect arbitrary sets of nodes. HyperTime distinguishes itself by processing time series data into segmented windows, which form nodes in a hypergraph connected by hyperedges. This approach captures complex temporal relationships and dynamics within the data. The framework employs ‘hypernode embedding’, applying an attention mechanism to each time series dimension within a window, and ‘hyperedge embedding’, incorporating an LSTM layer for deeper temporal analysis. A key innovation in HyperTime is the ‘hyper convolution’ operation, which includes both hypernode and hyperedge convolutions. Nodes are convoluted using the embeddings of their associated hyperedges, enriching the learning and understanding of their role within the hypergraph. The hyperedge convolution layer integrates local and global information, aggregating node features to capture complex interactions and relationships. The effectiveness of HyperTime is validated through extensive experiments on 26 datasets from the UEA archive, the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring (PAM) datasets, and 10 datasets from the UCR archive.
