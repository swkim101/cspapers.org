Multi-behavior sequential recommendation systems, which predict users' subsequent interactions based on historical behavior sequences, play a vital role in e-commerce operations. Despite the promising results of existing state-of-the-art methods, which employ either advanced attention mechanisms or graph-based neural networks, they still face a few open challenges, including the diversity of user actions, the intricate relationships within time-evolving interactions, and the complications introduced by limited or noisy data. To address these limitations, we propose a Similarity Graph-enhanced Multi-Scale Transformer (SG-MST) for multi-behavior e-commerce product recommendation. SG-MST integrates a Similarity Augmented Multi-Behavior Hypergraph that captures complex behavior-aware dependencies among items and strengthens connections through item context similarities, producing more informative latent representations. Additionally, we introduce a Contrastively Regularized Multi-Scale Transformer, which leverages contrastive learning to capture enriched sequential patterns across both long-term and short-term dynamically sampled and augmented temporal scales, thereby improving the robustness of user behavior prediction. Extensive evaluation on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed SG-MST outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
