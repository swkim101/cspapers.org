Graph-based fraud detection has attracted increasing attention in recent years, reflecting its growing potential in mitigating sophisticated fraudulent activities. The main objective of graph-based fraud detection is to discern between fraud-sters and normal entities within graphs. As fraudsters adopt increasingly sophisticated camouflage tactics, combating them has become an urgent task. Despite the complex interactions within real-world networks involving high-order relations, ex-isting graph-based fraud detection methods often neglect non-pairwise relationships among entities in graphs. Thus, we empha-size the significance of investigating beyond pairwise relationships for building an effective fraud detection model. In this paper, we propose constructing a hypergraph from the original input graph to encapsulate comprehensive high-order relations and present TROPICAL, a novel TRansfOrmer-based hyPergraph LearnIng for detecting CAmouflaged maLicious actors in online social networks. TROPICAL learns representations by processing different hyperedge groups and incorporates positional encodings into the aggregated information to enhance their distinctiveness. Subsequently, the model feeds the learned aggregated sequential information into the transformer encoder, achieving rich rep-resentations for effective camouflaged fraudster detection. The superiority of TROPICAL is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, compared against the state-of-the-art fraud detection models.
