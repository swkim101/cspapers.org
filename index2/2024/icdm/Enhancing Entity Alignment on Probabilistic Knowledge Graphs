Probabilistic knowledge graphs (PKGs) improve traditional knowledge graphs by characterizing the inherent uncertainty of knowledge. In PKGs, each triple <tex>$(e_{1}, r,e_{2})$</tex>, representing that entity <tex>$e_{1}$</tex> has a relationship <tex>$r$</tex> with entity <tex>$e_{2}$</tex>, is associated with a probability <tex>$\phi$</tex> indicating its likelihood of being true. PKGs have gained popularity in various domains, such as ProBase [22] and NELL [13].
