Deep learning is increasingly crucial in scientific discovery, accelerating research in various fields. Exploring brain science using deep learning has garnered significant interest, particularly in the recognition of brain disorders. However, existing methods face limitations in the discriminability of learned brain graph representations and the identification of neurological biomarkers associated with brain disorders. Moreover, the lack of model explainability leads to suboptimal brain graph analysis. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-level brain graph contrastive learning framework with an interpretable learning kernel for brain disorder analysis. Our framework diverges from traditional graph contrastive learning methods by augmenting meaningful brain graphs using the counterfactual thinking-based mechanism, ensuring reliable graph generation that preserves discriminative information. Secondly, we introduce bi-level contrastive loss with intra-and inter-class contrasts to enhance the brain graph representation learning. Most importantly, we design an interpretable brain graph learning kernel to highlight critical regions and connections, thereby facilitating the discovery of potential neurological biomarkers associated with brain disorders in subsequent analysis. The effectiveness of our method11https://githuh.com/JustinGie/Cf-BCL in brain graph representation learning and discriminative substructure detection is demonstrated through the evaluation of disorder prediction and pathogenic analysis on three real-world brain disorder datasets. Moreover, our framework may provide novel insights into brain science based on the results of comparison with medical research.
