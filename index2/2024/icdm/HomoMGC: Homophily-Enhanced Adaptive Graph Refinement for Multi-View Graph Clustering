Due to the emergency of multi-view graph data, considerable attention is focused on the multi-view graph clustering. Although great efforts have been made in developing the multi-view graph clustering methods, most of them implicitly follow the homophily assumption, where the connected nodes with edges tend to be in the same category. As a matter of fact, such an ideal assumption is hard to be satisfied in the real-world graph data, and there are some heterogeneous edges connecting dissimilar nodes in graph. How to well consider the homophily and refine the noisy/heterogeneous edges in multi-view graph clustering still remains an under-explored challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Homophily-enhanced Adaptive Graph Refinement for Multi-view Graph Clustering (HomoMGC) method, where an adaptive graph refinement strategy is seamlessly designed. Specifically, a feature-oriented graph is constructed based on the shared feature, and an integrated graph is computed by averagely fusing all the input adjacent graphs. Then, the feature-oriented graph and integrated graph are stacked into a graph tensor with a low-rank tensor constraint, where a refined affinity probability matrix can be adaptively recovered from the integrated graph by considering multiple graph information as well as the semantics features. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HomoMGC compared with the state-of-the-art graph clustering methods.
