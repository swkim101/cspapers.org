With the increasing adoption of PS-PL (Processor System-Programmable Logic) platforms, also known as CPU+FPGA systems, there arises a need for efficient resource management strategies. This work explores memory bandwidth regulation in such systems, leveraging the capabilities of tightly coupled FPGAs to offer elegant, low-overhead solutions with highly flexible regulation policies. We introduce MemCoRe, a novel approach that exploits the FPGA’s interaction with cache coherence interfaces and cross-trigger signals to achieve finegrained spatiotemporal awareness of processor activity and software-free control. By comparing MemCoRe with state-of-theart software-based approaches, namely MemGuard and MemPol, we demonstrate significant improvements in regulation precision and overhead reduction. Key contributions include nanosecondscale memory bandwidth regulation, off-core memory bandwidth accounting, address-aware regulation, low-overhead token-bucket regulation, and asymmetric on-off core throttling. Our evaluation on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 CPU+FPGA platform showcases MemCoRe’s capability to regulate memory bandwidth with nanosecond-scale precision. Overall, MemCoRe presents a promising avenue for efficient memory bandwidth regulation in PS-PL platforms, with strong applicability to real-time systems.
