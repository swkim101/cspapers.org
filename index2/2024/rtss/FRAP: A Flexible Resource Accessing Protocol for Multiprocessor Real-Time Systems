Fully-partitioned fixed-priority scheduling (FP-FPS) multiprocessor systems are widely found in real-time applications, where spin-based protocols are often deployed to manage the mutually exclusive access of shared resources. Unfortunately, existing approaches either enforce rigid spin priority rules for resource accessing or carry significant pessimism in the schedulability analysis, imposing substantial blocking time regardless of task execution urgency or resource over-provisioning. This paper proposes FRAP, a spin-based flexible resource accessing protocol for FP-FPS systems. A task under FRAP can spin at any priority within a range for accessing a resource, allowing flexible and finegrained resource control with predictable worst-case behaviour. Under flexible spinning, we demonstrate that the existing analysis techniques can lead to incorrect timing bounds and present a novel MCMF (minimum cost maximum flow)-based blocking analysis, providing predictability guarantee for FRAP. A spin priority assignment is reported that fully exploits flexible spinning to reduce the blocking time of tasks with high urgency, enhancing the performance of FRAP. Experimental results show that FRAP outperforms the existing spin-based protocols in schedulability by $\mathbf{1 5. 2 0 \%} \mathbf{- 3 2. 7 3 \%}$ on average, up to $\mathbf{6 5. 8 5 \%}$.
