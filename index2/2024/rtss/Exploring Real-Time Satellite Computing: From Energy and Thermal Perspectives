Small satellites (SmallSats) are now widely used in various fields, such as real-time communication and earth observation. These increasingly complex space applications face limited support from conventional radiation-hardened processors onboard. Hence, many SmallSats are designed to utilize high performance commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computing devices to address this problem but it remains unclear how the unique energy and thermal characteristics of SmallSats impact computing efficiency onboard. This work conducts a systematic and quantitative measurement study of COTS devicesâ€™ computing efficiency on two real orbiting SmallSats. The key findings are: 1) inadequate energy management may lead to electricity wastage in sunlit zones and shortages in eclipse zones, impacting onboard computing availability and 2) the weak heat dissipation onboard may compromise COTS computing efficiency by incurring thermal throttling. To address such challenges, we design ProScale, a lightweight application-aware power management and thermal control system to improve computing efficiency under both electrical and thermal energy constraints. Evaluation shows that ProScale can improve the average task completion latency by $2.1 \times$ for computation-intensive applications compared with baselines.
