Recent efforts in learned cardinality estimation (CE) have substantially improved estimation accuracy and query plans inside query optimizers. However, achieving decent efficiency, scalability, and the support of a wide range of queries at the same time, has remained questionable. Rather than falling back to traditional approaches to trade off one criterion with another, we present a new learned approach that achieves all these. Our method, called ASM, harmonizes autoregressive models for per-table statistics estimation, sampling for merging these statistics for join queries, and multi-dimensional statistics merging that extends the sampling for estimating thousands of sub-queries, without assuming independence between join keys. Extensive experiments show that ASM significantly improves query plans under a similar or smaller overhead than the previous learned methods and supports a wider range of queries.
