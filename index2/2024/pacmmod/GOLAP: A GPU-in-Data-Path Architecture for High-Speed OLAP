In this paper, we suggest a novel GPU-in-data-path architecture that leverages a GPU to accelerate the I/O path and thus can achieve almost in-memory bandwidth using SSDs. In this architecture, the main idea is to stream data in heavy-weight compressed blocks from SSDs directly into the GPU and decompress it on-the-fly as part of the table scan to inflate data before processing it by downstream query operators. Furthermore, we employ novel GPU-optimized pruning techniques that help us further inflate the perceived read bandwidth. In our evaluation, we show that the GPU-in-data-path architecture can achieve an effective bandwidth of up to 100 GiB/s, surpassing existing in-memory systems' capabilities.
