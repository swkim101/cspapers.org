We consider the dichotomy conjecture for consistent query answering under primary key constraints. It states that, for every fixed Boolean conjunctive query q, testing whether q is certain (i.e. whether it evaluates to true over all repairs of a given inconsistent database) is either PTime or CoNP-complete. This conjecture has been verified for self-join-free and path queries. We show that it also holds for queries with two atoms.
