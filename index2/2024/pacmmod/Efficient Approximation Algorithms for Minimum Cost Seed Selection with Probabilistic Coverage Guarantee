 , a cost associated with each user, and an influence threshold η, the minimum cost seed selection problem (MCSS) aims to find a set of seeds that minimizes the total cost to reach η users. Existing works are mainly devoted to providing an expected coverage guarantee on reaching η, classified as MCSS-ECG, where their solutions either rely on an impractical influence oracle or cannot attain the expected influence threshold. More importantly, due to the expected coverage guarantee, the actual influence in a campaign may drift from the threshold evidently. Thus, the advertisers would like to request for a probability guarantee of reaching η. This motivates us to further solve the MCSS problem with a probabilistic coverage guarantee, termed MCSS-PCG.
 
 In this paper, we first propose our algorithm CLEAR to solve MCSS-ECG, which reaches the expected influence threshold without any influence oracle or influence shortfall but a practical approximation ratio. However, the ratio involves an unknown term (i.e., the optimal cost). Thus, we further devise the STAR method to derive a lower bound of the optimal cost and then obtain the first explicit approximation ratio for MCSS-ECG. In MCSS-PCG, it is necessary to estimate the probability that the current seeds reach η, to decide when to stop seed selection. To achieve this, we design a new technique named MRR, which provides efficient probability estimation with a theoretical guarantee. With MRR in hand, we propose our algorithm SCORE for MCSS-PCG, whose performance guarantee is derived by measuring the gap between MCSS-ECG and MCSS-PCG, and applying the theoretical results in MCSS-ECG. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to alternatives while meeting the requirement of MCSS-PCG with the smallest cost.
