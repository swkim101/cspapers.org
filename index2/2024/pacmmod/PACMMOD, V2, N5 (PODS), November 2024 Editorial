This editorial accompanies the second issue dedicated to the PODS research track of the Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD) journal. The journal hosts a SIGMOD and a PODS research track. The PODS research track aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. Articles for the PODS track of PACMMOD present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or conducting a rigorous analysis of industry artifacts that are widely used and/or recently developed. Articles published in this track will be invited for presentation to the ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), which is held jointly with SIGMOD each year.
