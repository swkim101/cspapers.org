Systems for Complex Event Processing (CEP) enable the detection of predefined patterns in event streams. While the evaluation of CEP queries is computationally hard, scalability may be achieved by parallelization. Yet, existing approaches for parallel CEP are driven by static query properties, such as partitioning keys and states of the evaluation model. They largely neglect the rates with which processing units may ingest and compare events for query evaluation.
 In this paper, we present an approach for parallel CEP that is based on a flexible decomposition of CEP queries. Our idea is to guide the decomposition by the sustainable throughput of each processing unit, in order to maximize the overall performance. To this end, we introduce DecoPa plans for parallel CEP, provide a cost model for them, elaborate on their correctness and optimality, and present an algorithm for their construction. Experiments using a DecoPa implementation in Flink illustrate throughput gains of up to 12 orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
