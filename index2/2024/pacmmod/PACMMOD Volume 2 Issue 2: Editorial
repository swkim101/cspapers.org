We are excited to announce the first issue dedicated to the PODS research track of the Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data, or PACMMOD, journal. In its current form, this new journal hosts a SIGMOD and a PODS research track. The PODS research track aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. Articles for the PODS track of PACMMOD present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of both widely used and recently developed industry artifacts. At a time when computer science is increasingly data centric, it is essential to promote an active exchange of tools and techniques between principles of database systems and other communities focused on data management. The PODS track thus pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science. Articles published in this track will be invited for presentation to the ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), which is held jointly with SIGMOD each year.
