We investigate an approximation algorithm for various aggregate queries on partially materialized data cubes. Data cubes are interpreted as probability distributions, and cuboids from a partial materialization populate the terms of a series expansion of the target query distribution. Unknown terms in the expansion are just assumed to be 0 in order to recover an approximate query result. We identify this method as a variant of related approaches from other fields of science, that is, the Bahadur representation and, more generally, (biased) Fourier expansions of Boolean functions. Existing literature indicates a rich but intricate theoretical landscape. Focusing on the data cube application, we start by investigating worst-case error bounds. We build upon prior work to obtain provably optimal materialization strategies with respect to query workloads. In addition, we propose a new heuristic method governing materialization decisions. Finally, we show that well-approximated queries are guaranteed to have well-approximated roll-ups.
