We present a linear preprocessing and output-linear delay enumeration algorithm for MSO-queries over trees that are compressed in the well-established grammar-based framework. Time bounds are measured with respect to the size of the compressed representation of the tree. Our result extends previous work on the enumeration of MSO-queries over uncompressed trees and on the enumeration of document spanners over compressed text documents.
