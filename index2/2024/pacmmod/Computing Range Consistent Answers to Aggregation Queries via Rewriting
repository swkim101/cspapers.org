We consider the problem of answering conjunctive queries with aggregation on database instances that may violate primary key constraints. In SQL, these queries follow the SELECT-FROM-WHERE-GROUP BY format, where the WHERE-clause involves a conjunction of equalities, and the SELECT-clause can incorporate aggregate operators like MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG, or COUNT. Repairs of a database instance are defined as inclusion-maximal subsets that satisfy all primary keys. For a given query, our primary objective is to identify repairs that yield the lowest aggregated value among all possible repairs. We particularly investigate queries for which this lowest aggregated value can be determined through a rewriting in first-order logic with aggregate operators.
