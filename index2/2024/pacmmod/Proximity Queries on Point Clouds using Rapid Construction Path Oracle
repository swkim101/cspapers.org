The prevalence of computer graphics technology boosts the developments of point clouds in recent years, which offer advantages over terrain surfaces (represented by Triangular Irregular Networks, i.e., TINs) in proximity queries, including the shortest path query, the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query and the range query. Since (1) all existing on-the-fly and oracle-based shortest path query algorithms on a TIN are very expensive, (2) all existing on-the-fly shortest path query algorithms on a point cloud are still not efficient, and (3) there are no oracle-based shortest path query algorithms on a point cloud, we propose an efficient (1+ε)-approximate shortest path oracle that answers the shortest path query for a set of Points-Of-Interests (POIs) on the point cloud, which has a good performance (in terms of the oracle construction time, oracle size and shortest path query time) due to the concise information about the pairwise shortest paths between any pair of POIs stored in the oracle. Our oracle can be easily adapted to answering the shortest path query for any points on the point cloud if POIs are not given as input, and also achieve a good performance. Then, we propose efficient algorithms for answering the (1+ε)-approximate kNN and range query with the assistance of our oracle. Our experimental results show that when POIs are given (resp. not given) as input, our oracle is up to 390 times, 30 times and 6 times (resp. 500 times, 140 times and 50 times) better than the best-known oracle on a TIN in terms of the oracle construction time, oracle size and shortest path query time, respectively. Our algorithms for the other two proximity queries are both up to 100 times faster than the best-known algorithms.
