The problem of continual observation under differential privacy has been studied extensively in the literature. However, all existing works, with the exception of [28,51], have only studied the simple counting query and its derivatives. Join queries, which are arguably the most important class of queries in relational databases, have only been considered in [28,51], but the solutions offered there have two limitations: First, they only support a few specific graph pattern queries, which are special cases of joins. Second, they require hard degree/frequency constraints on the graph/database instance, and the privatized query answers have errors proportional to these constraints.
 In this paper, we propose a new differentially private mechanism for continual observation of joins that overcomes these two limitations. Our mechanism supports arbitrary joins and predicates, and do not require any constraints to be given in advance, even over an infinite stream. More importantly, it yields an error that is proportional to the actual maximum degree/frequencies in the graph/database instance at the current time of observation. Such an instance-specific utility guarantee is much preferred for the continual observation problem, where the database size and the query answer may change significantly over time.
