In this paper, we present a novel communication scheme called zero-sided RDMA, enabling data exchange as a native network service using a programmable switch. In contrast to one- or two-sided RDMA, in zero-sided RDMA, neither the sender nor the receiver is actively involved in data exchange. Zero-sided RDMA thus enables efficient RDMA-based data shuffling between heterogeneous hardware devices in a disaggregated setup without the need to implement a complete RDMA stack on each heterogeneous device or the need for a CPU that is co-located with the accelerator to coordinate the data transfer. As such, we think that zero-sided RDMA is a major building block to make efficient use of heterogeneous accelerators in future cloud DBMSs. In our evaluation, we show that zero-sided RDMA can outperform existing one-sided RDMA-based schemes for accelerator-to-accelerator communication and thus speed up typical distributed database operations such as joins.
