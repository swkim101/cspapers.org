We study verification of reachability properties over Communicating Datalog Programs (CDPs), which are networks of relational nodes connected through unordered channels and running Datalog-like computations. Each node manipulates a local state database (DB), depending on incoming messages and additional input DBs from external services. Decidability of verification for CDPs has so far been established only under boundedness assumptions on the state and channel sizes, showing at the same time undecidability of reachability for unbounded states with only two unary relations or unbounded channels with a single binary relation. The goal of this paper is to study the open case of CDPs with bounded states and unbounded channels, under the assumption that channels carry unary relations only. We discuss the significance of the resulting model and prove the decidability of verification of variants of reachability, captured in fragments of first-order CTL. We do so through a novel reduction to coverability problems in a class of high-level Petri Nets that manipulate unordered data identifiers. We study the tightness of our results, showing that minor generalizations of the considered reachability properties yield undecidability of verification, both for CDPs and the corresponding Petri Net model.
