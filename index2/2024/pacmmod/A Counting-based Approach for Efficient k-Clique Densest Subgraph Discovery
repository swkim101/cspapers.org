Densest subgraph discovery (DSD) is a fundamental topic in graph mining. It has been extensively studied in the literature and has found many real applications in a wide range of fields, such as biology, finance, and social networks. As a typical problem of DSD, the k-clique densest subgraph (CDS) problem aims to detect a subgraph from a graph, such that the ratio of the number of k-cliques over the number of its vertices is maximized. This problem has received plenty of attention in the literature, and is widely used in identifying larger ''near-cliques''. Existing CDS solutions, either k-core or convex programming based solutions, often need to enumerate almost all the k-cliques, which is very inefficient because real-world graphs usually have a vast number of k-cliques. To improve the efficiency, in this paper, we propose a novel framework based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which only needs k-clique counting, rather than k-clique enumeration, where the former one is often much faster than the latter one. Based on the framework, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm, by employing the state-of-the-art k-clique counting algorithm and proposing some optimization techniques. We have performed extensive experimental evaluation on 14 real-world large graphs and the results demonstrate the high efficiency of our algorithms. Particularly, our algorithm is up to seven orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm with the same accuracy guarantee.
