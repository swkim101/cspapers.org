Simulink has been widely used in embedded software development, which supports simulation to validate the correctness of the constructed models. However, as the scale and complexity of models in industrial applications grow, it is time-consuming for the simulation engine of Simulink to achieve high coverage and detect potential errors, especially accumulative errors. In this paper, we propose AccMoS, an accelerating model simulation method for Simulink models via code generation. AccMoS generates simulation functionality code for Simulink models through simulation oriented instrumentation, including runtime actor information collection, coverage collection, and calculation diagnosis. The final simulation code is constructed by composing all the instrumentation code with actor code generated from a predefined template library and integrating test cases import. After compiling and executing the code, AccMoS generates simulation results including coverage and diagnostic information. We implemented AccMoS and evaluated it on several benchmark Simulink models. Compared to Simulink’s simulation engine, AccMoS shows a 215.3 × improvement in simulation efficiency, significantly reduces the time required for detecting errors. AccMoS also achieved greater coverage within equivalent time.
