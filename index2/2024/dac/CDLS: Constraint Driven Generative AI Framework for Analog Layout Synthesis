In advanced process technology nodes, analog circuit performance is intrinsically linked to layout parasitics and layout dependent effects (LDE). In contrast to digital designs, layout generation for analog mixed signal circuits remains predominantly a slow manual task, impeding rapid design convergence. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CDLS - a Constraint Driven Generative AI Framework for Analog Layout Synthesis. CDLS is fundamentally a constraint driven framework that enables analog circuit designers to auto-generate simulation-ready layout. Unlike traditional algorithmic approaches, CDLS uses generative AI and machine learning techniques to generate key design constraints that drive the quality of autogenerated placement and routing. Using CDLS, on average we reduce layout iteration time by 2-3X on industrial designs. By reducing the turn-around-time on layout iterations we estimate a 30% reduction to overall design convergence cycle. We also demonstrate that the quality of results achieved through CDLS is on par with manually drawn layout on state-of-the-art analog designs developed on an Intel sub-10nm process technology node.
