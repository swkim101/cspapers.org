Existing printed circuit board (PCB) placement often fails to address complex constraints (e.g., diverse wire widths and intricate spacing rules) arising from heterogeneous components in modern designs. Manual placement requires expertise and is time-consuming. Thus, automated PCB placement is desired for large-scale, complex designs considering irregular component shapes, clearance conditions, wire areas, power circuit flow, and routability. This paper proposes an efficient force-directed global placement followed by legalization to handle these constraints. We derive power circuit anchor points to guide global placement when considering the power circuit flow and present a simulated annealing-based pad alignment method to handle complex spacing constraints. After global placement, we perform window-based legalization to remove component overlaps considering various constraints. Experimental results show our placer's superior routability and efficiency with complex constraints.
