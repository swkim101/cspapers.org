In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to enhancing neural network-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) through the integration of model compression techniques and customized hardware architecture that focuses on micro-architectural and dataflow optimizations to improve computational efficiency and performance. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvement.
