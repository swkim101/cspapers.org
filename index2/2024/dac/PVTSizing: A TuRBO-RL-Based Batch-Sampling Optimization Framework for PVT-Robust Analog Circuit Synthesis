With the CMOS technology advancing and the complexity of circuits growing, the demand for analog/mixed-signal design automation tools is increasing quickly. Although some tools have been developed to tackle this challenge, the performance degradation caused by process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations has been less considered. This paper presents PVTSizing, an optimization framework for PVT-robust analog circuit synthesis. PVTSizing adopts trust region Bayesian optimization (TuRBO) for high-quality initial datasets and reference points. Multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) is utilized for PVT optimization. Both TuRBO and RL are batch-friendly, allowing parallel sampling of design solutions. Meanwhile, critic-assisted pruning and zoom target metrics are proposed to improve sample efficiency and reduce runtime. In addition, this framework naturally supports sizing over random mismatch. On 4 real-world circuits with TSMC 28/180nm process, PVTSizing achieves 1.9X --8.8X sample efficiency and 1.6X --9.8X time efficiency improvements compared to prior sizing tools from both industry and academia.
