In three-dimensional integrated circuits, the interconnection design among chiplets on redistribution layers (RDLs) is crucial for achieving high-performance computing systems. To optimize the inter-chip connections, most of the previous works focused on automatic signal net routing and pin assignment. The power/ground plane generation, is still a manual and time-consuming task, especially when generating the power planes of more than ten power supplies on a limited number of RDLs. This paper proposes a novel Voronoi diagram-based multiple power/ground plane generation methodology that simultaneously optimizes the power/ground planes of all power/ground nets by utilizing the white space of given RDLs, while considering the signal routing blockages, power integrity, and complex design rules. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve not only optimal area utilization but also the best cross-layer power integrity in terms of the total number of redundant vias.
