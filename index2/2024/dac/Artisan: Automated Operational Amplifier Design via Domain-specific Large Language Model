This paper presents Artisan, an automated operational amplifier design framework using large language models (LLMs). We develop a bidirectional representation to align abstract circuit topologies with their structural and functional semantics. We further employ Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts approaches to model the design process as a hierarchical question-answer sequence, implemented by a mechanism of multi-agent interaction. A high-quality opamp dataset is developed to enhance the design proficiency of the Artisan-LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that Artisan outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based methods and benchmark LLMs, in success rate, circuit performance metrics, and interpretability, while accelerating the design process by up to 50.1X. Artisan will be released for public access.
