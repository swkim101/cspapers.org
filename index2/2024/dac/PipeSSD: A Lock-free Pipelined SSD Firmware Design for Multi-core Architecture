Modern SSD firmware is continuously optimized for higher parallelism to match the growing frontend PCIe bandwidth with more backend flash channels. Although a multi-core microprocessor is typically adopted to concurrently process independent NVMe requests from multiple NVMe queues, the existing one-to-many thread-request mapping model with each thread serving one or more incoming I/O requests has poor scalability due to severe lock contention problem, especially in cache management. In this paper, we first conduct experiments on an open-channel NVMe SSD to exhibit the lock contention problem in the one-to-many thread-request mapping model when multiple threads compete for the cacheline, which occupies more than 50% of the long-tail request latency. To mitigate this, we propose PipeSSD, a lock-free pipeline-based SSD firmware design with a many-to-one thread-request mapping model that assigns multiple threads to serve different stages of each I/O request in a pipelined way. Three novel designs are introduced in PipeSSD: 1) a loop-free request processing pipeline with a postponed cache stage to reduce cacheline competition; 2) a lock-free cache management scheme to ensure consistent cache behavior; and 3) a FIFO-based inter-stage request flow for correct request dependencies. We implement PipeSSD on real hardware and evaluate its performance on a multi-core NVMe SSD prototype. The evaluation results show that PipeSSD has a significant throughput improvement compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core SSD firmware.
