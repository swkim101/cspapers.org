Low-cost and hardware-efficient design of trigonometric functions is challenging. Stochastic computing (SC), an emerging computing model processing random bit-streams, offers promising solutions for this problem. The existing implementations, however, often overlook the importance of the data converters necessary to generate the needed bit-streams. While recent advancements in SC bit-stream generators focus on basic arithmetic operations such as multiplication and addition, energy-efficient SC design of non-linear functions demands attention to both the computation circuit and the bit-stream generator. This work introduces TriSC, a novel approach for SC-based design of trigonometric functions enjoying state-of-the-art (SOTA) quasi-random bit-streams. Unlike SOTA SC designs of trigonometric functions that heavily rely on delay elements to decorrelate bit-streams, our approach avoids delay elements while improving the accuracy of the results. TriSC yields significant energy savings of up to 92% compared to SOTA. As two novel use cases studied for the first time in SC literature, we employ the proposed design for 2D image transformation and forward kinematics of a robotic arm, two computation-intensive applications demanding low-cost trigonometric designs.
