Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of applications with their strong human-like understanding and creativity. Due to the continuously growing model size and complexity, LLM training and deployment have shown significant challenges, which often results in extremely high computational and storage costs and energy consumption. In this paper, we discuss the recent advancements and research directions on (1) LLM algorithm-level acceleration, (2) LLM-hardware co-design for improved system efficiency, (3) LLM-to-accelerator compilation for customized LLM accelerators, and (4) LLM-aided design for HLS (High-Level Synthesis) functional verification. For each aspect, we present the background study, our proposed solutions, and future directions. An extended version of this work can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10903.
