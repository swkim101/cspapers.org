In semiconductor manufacturing, pinpointing nanoscale wafer defects is crucial for yield and reliability. Deep learning methods for defect segmentation rely heavily on large, labor-intensive datasets and focus mainly on macroscopic wafer defects, not nanoscale morphology. Our research introduces a hybrid weakly supervised scanning electron microscope (SEM) defect segmentation system with two sub-networks: one for accurate defect localization and image cropping, another for detailed segmentation. Validated on 1,328 SEM image defects from a real facility, our model surpasses existing weakly supervised methods and equals fully supervised models in accuracy, with 10% labeling effort, providing a novel approach for high-precision defect segmentation.
