Binary adders are a critical building block in integrated circuit (IC) design. In addition to the widely used 32/64/128-bit adders, large (1024/2048 bits) adders are important in applications such as cryptography. However, most current adder design methods target regular bitwidths, and cannot efficiently generate large adders with good performance. In practice, adders are often integrated into circuits such as a multiplier-accumulator (MAC), resulting in complex non-uniform input arrival times. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm for efficiently generating high-quality adders for non-uniform input arrival times. It is based on a novel divide-and-conquer-friendly problem formulation, and can effectively generate and maintain the most useful adder structures through dynamic programming. Experimental results show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both quality and runtime. The adders generated by our algorithm have 2.8%, 8.3%, and 10.3% reductions in delay, area, and power, respectively, compared to those generated by a commercial synthesis tool.
