The vulnerabilities of transient execution have been exploited in many side-channel attacks (SCA). We report Whisper, a novel transient execution timing (TET) side channel, which is based on the execution time difference of transient execution under different conditions. We develop TET version of SCAs including Meltdown, Zombieload, and Spectre-RSB that use Whisper as covert channel to leak information. We further propose TET-KASLR to break the kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) mechanism under the protection of KPTI and FLARE. These attacks are simple to implement and can bypass the existing mitigation methods because the TET side channel relies on execution time that can be conveniently obtained by architectural level timing analysis. We demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of these attacks on various x86-64 CPUs. The root cause of Whisper is analyzed with our toolset built on performance monitor unit (PMU) and potential defense against Whisper is also discussed.
