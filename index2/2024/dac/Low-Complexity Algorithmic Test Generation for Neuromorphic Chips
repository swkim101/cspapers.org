Neuromorphic chips are promising hardware implementations for artificial intelligence (AI) applications owing to their low power consumption. However, neuromorphic chips are difficult to test since they have many potential configurations but lack design for testability (DfT). We propose an algorithmic test generation method for neuromorphic chips without DfT, including fault activation and fault propagation. Fault activation differentiates a neuron's good output and faulty output. Fault propagation sensitizes fault effects to differentiate outputs of faulty chips and good chips. On an L-layer Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model, we achieve 100% fault coverage using O(L) test configurations and test patterns under negligible or no weight variation. Our results show that test effectiveness is maintained even with 4-bit weight quantization. We incur no test escape and overkill even under 10% weight variation. Our total test length is over 73K times shorter than previous works.
