Memory disaggregation, facilitated by Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs), has emerged as a cost-effective approach for sharing memory resources in data centers. However, current SoC-based SmartNICs face several challenges for supporting near-data processing (NDP) in disaggregated memory (DM) systems effectively, such as inefficient resource allocation for SmartNICs employed in NDP, and the lack of collaboration between SmartNICs on data nodes and CPUs on compute nodes. To address these issues, we propose TIGA, an efficient NDP framework for SmartNICs-based disaggregated memory systems. We propose an adaptive resource allocator to fully utilize the SoC cores among NDP engines automatically, and a SmartNIC-CPU cooperative computing mechanism to schedule NDP tasks among CPUs and SmartNICs. We prototype TIGA with FPGAs and evaluate it with several typical workloads. Experimental results show that TIGA significantly improves the efficiency of NDP tasks in DM systems compared with state-of-the-art SmartNIC-based co-processing schemes.
