The use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for sensing has continuously improved the precision and performance of autonomous driving. At the same time, the large number of high-precision point clouds generated by LiDAR require real-time processing, and the range search is the key part of the processing pipeline. Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) has proven its efficiency for search tasks on switches and routers, but so far, there is still a lack of exploration on its application in point cloud range search. In this work, we propose CAMPER, a CAM-centered accelerator, aiming to explore the potential of CAM for point cloud range search. We developed a ripple comparison 13T (RC-13T) CAM cell for distance comparison, designed a spatial approximation search algorithm based on Chebyshev distance, and discussed the flexibility and scalability of the architecture. The results show that in the range search task of 64k@64k points, CAMPER achieves a latency of 0.83ms and a power consumption of 114.6mW. Compared with GPU, the throughput is increased by 10.4×; compared with SOTA accelerator, the energy efficiency is increased by about 228×.
