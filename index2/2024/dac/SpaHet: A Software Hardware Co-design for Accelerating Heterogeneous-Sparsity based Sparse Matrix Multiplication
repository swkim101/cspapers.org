Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication is widely used in data mining applications. Its irregular memory access patterns limit the performance of general-purpose processors, thus motivating many FPGA-based hardware innovations in recent years. Nevertheless, existing accelerators fail to efficiently support heterogeneous input matrix sparsity, which is universal in various real-world applications. With in-depth experimental analysis, we observe that their performance is bottlenecked by their fixed tiling mechanisms, which only alleviate the irregularity of one input matrix. Based on the observation, we propose SpaHet, a software/hardware co-design to accelerate heterogeneous-sparsity based sparse matrix multiplication. SpaHet adopts a dual-adaptive sliding window mechanism to cover the reuse characteristics of both input matrices simultaneously. With a specialized exploration algorithm, the window-based mechanism can automatically find the optimal tiling strategy instead of applying a fixed one based on empirical experience. A sparsity-aware merge tree is also proposed to maximize the output matrix reuse via accumulating intermediate results thoroughly. Our results on a Xilinx Alveo U280 accelerator card show that SpaHet outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-, GPU- and FPGA-based solutions by 7.71×, 1.1×, and 2.74× in performance, respectively.
