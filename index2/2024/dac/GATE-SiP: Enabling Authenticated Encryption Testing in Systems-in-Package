A heterogeneous integrated system in package (SIP) system integrates chiplets outsourced from different vendors into the same substrate for better performance. However, during post-integration testing, the sensitive testing data designated for a specific chiplet can be blocked, tampered or sniffed by other malicious chiplets. This paper proposes GATE-SiP which is an authenticated partial encryption protocol to enable secure testing. Within GATE-SiP, the sensitive testing pattern will only be sent to the authenticated chiplet. In addition, partial encryption of the sensitive data prevents data sniff threats without causing significant penalties on timing overhead. Extensive simulation results show the GATE-SiP protocol only brings 6.74% and 14.31% on area and timing overhead, respectively.
