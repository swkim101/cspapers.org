Emerging resistive RAM (ReRAM) devices can in-situ execute vector-matrix-multiplication (VMM) and is able to achieve energy-efficient in-memory scientific computing. However, the peripheral separated S&Hs and ADCs for row buffering and sensing in conventional designs are the system bottleneck. We propose an ADC-less all-in-one processing-in-ReRAM design that enables the precharge once, readout multiple-bits (PORM) functionality for overlapping the tRCD latencies of different-significance result bits sensed out on the same bitline. Specifically, to support PORM sensing, we propose a cascaded-feedback bitline sensing architecture for VMM and a buffering-and-sensing-collocated sense amplifier elemental design with the bitline and the storage node fully decoupled for enabling conflict-free column accesses. We further propose cross-level inter-leaving mechanism for successive column VMM accesses to reduce the overall latency through improving the hardware spatiotemporal utilization. Experimental results show that our proposed design achieves 297% overall performance improvement and 85.8% energy reduction, compared with an aggressive baseline.
