With the development of chiplet technology, the architecture of Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) has become increasingly intricate. The placement of memory page significantly influences application performance in NUMA systems. We found that memory access bottlenecks occur between high-level NUMA domains consisting of multiple chiplets. In this paper, we introduce a Traffic-Aware Page Mapping Method (TAPMM) designed for multi-level NUMA systems. TAPMM conceptualizes the multi-level NUMA system as a memory access tree, utilizing hardware performance events to be aware of system traffic and identify the optimal page mapping method for bandwidth efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that TAPMM achieves a speedup of up to 2.12Ã— on a real commodity machine compared to existing optimization tools.
