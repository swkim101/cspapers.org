The attention module in vision transformers(ViTs) performs intricate spatial correlations, contributing significantly to accuracy and delay. It is thereby important to modulate the number of attentions according to the input feature complexity for optimal delay-accuracy tradeoffs. To this end, we propose PIVOT - a co-optimization framework which selectively performs attention skipping based on the input difficulty. For this, PIVOT employs a hardware-in-loop co-search to obtain optimal attention skip configurations. Evaluations on the ZCU102 MPSoC FPGA show that PIVOT achieves 2.7x lower EDP at 0.2% accuracy reduction compared to LVViT-S ViT. PIVOT also achieves 1.3% and 1.8x higher accuracy and throughput than prior works on traditional CPUs and GPUs.
