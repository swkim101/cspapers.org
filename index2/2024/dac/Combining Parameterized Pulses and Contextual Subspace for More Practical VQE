In this paper, we explore the integration of parameterized quantum pulses with the contextual subspace method. The advent of parameterized quantum pulses marks a transition from traditional quantum gates to a more flexible and efficient approach to quantum computing. Working with pulses allows us to potentially access areas of the Hilbert space that are inaccessible with a CNOT-based circuit decomposition. Compared to solving the complete Hamiltonian via the traditional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), the computation of the contextual correction generally requires fewer qubits and measurements, thus improving computational efficiency. Plus a Pauli grouping strategy, our framework, SpacePulse, can minimize the quantum resource cost for the VQE and enhance the potential for processing larger molecular structures.
