Machine Learning (ML) security practices include hiding ML model architectures to protect intellectual property and prevent attacks. We introduce a novel fingerprinting attack using frequency throttling-based Side-Channel Attack (SCA) to detect an ML model's architecture family by converting power side-channel data into timing variations. This method involves using adversary kernels and a time series ML classifier to discern the architecture from execution time patterns during model operation. We achieved up to 96% accuracy in identifying known ML models' architecture families under Ring 0 privileges and we demonstrated its effectiveness across different platforms. Moreover, our code is publicly available 1.
