Volume imaging (3D model with inner structure) is widely applied to various areas, such as medical diagnosis and archaeology. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a great demand for lung CT. However, it is quite time-consuming to generate a 3D model by reconstructing the internal structure of an object. To make things worse, due to the poor data locality of the reconstruction algorithm, researchers are pessimistic about accelerating it with ASIC. Besides the locality issue, we find that the complex synchronization is also a major obstacle for 3D reconstruction. To overcome the problems, we propose a holistic solution using software-hardware co-design. We first provide a unified programming model to cover various 3D reconstruction tasks. Then, we redesign the dataflow of the reconstruction algorithm to improve data locality. In addition, we remove unnecessary synchronizations by carefully analyzing the data dependency. After that, we propose a novel near-memory acceleration architecture, called Waffle, for further improvement. Experiment results show that Waffle in a package can achieve 3.51× ~ 3.96× speedup over a cluster of 10 GPUs with 9.35× ~ 10.97× energy efficiency.
