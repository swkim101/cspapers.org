With the prosperous development of Deep Neural Network (DNNs), numerous Process-In-Memory (PIM) designs have emerged to accelerate DNN models with exceptional throughput and energy-efficiency. PIM accelerators based on Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) or volatile memory offer distinct advantages for computational efficiency and performance. NVM based PIM accelerators, demonstrated success in DNN inference, face limitations in on-device learning due to high write energy, latency, and instability. Conversely, fast volatile memories, like SRAM, offer rapid read/write operations for DNN training, but suffer from significant leakage currents and large memory footprints. In this paper, for the first time, we present a fully-digital sparse processing in hybrid NVM-SRAM design, synergistically combines the strengths of NVM and SRAM, tailored for on-device continual learning. Our designed NVM and SRAM based PIM circuit macros could support both storage and processing of N:M structured sparsity pattern, significantly improving the storage and computing efficiency. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our hybrid system effectively reduces area and power consumption while maintaining high accuracy, offering a scalable and versatile solution for on-device continual learning.
