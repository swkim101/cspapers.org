In pursuing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), the surface code (SC) serves as a key quantum error correction protocol. The double-defect mode of the SC enables long-range two-qubit communication via braiding. However, intersecting braiding paths create communication bottlenecks, leading to increased circuit latency. In this paper, we introduce HiLight, an optimization framework designed for enhancing SC communication. HiLight integrates qubit-mapping strategies with program- and hardware-level optimizations, providing high-performance and lightweight scalable solutions. Featuring SWAP-less initial placement, HiLight utilizes qubit-proximity and pattern matching to minimize path congestion. In routing, HiLight maximizes gate parallelism and speeds up path selection through fast gate-ordering and braiding path-finding. The combined optimizations improve latency and resource utilization. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, HiLight achieves a remarkable reduction in latency and runtime by 43.5% and 91.9%, respectively, signifying its potential to advance the FTQC era.
