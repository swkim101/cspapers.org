Efficient power grid analysis is critical in modern VLSI design. It is computationally challenging because it requires solving large linear equations with millions of unknowns. Iterative solvers are more scalable, but their performance relies on preconditioners. Existing preconditioning approaches suffer from either high construction cost or slow convergence rate, both resulting in unsatisfactory total solution time. In this work, we propose an efficient power grid simulator based on fast randomized Cholesky factorization, named PowerRChol. We first propose a randomized Cholesky factorization algorithm with provable linear-time complexity. Then we propose a randomized factorization oriented matrix reordering approach. Experimental results on large-scale power grids demonstrate the superior efficiency of PowerRChol over existing iterative solvers, showing 1.51X, 1.93X and 3.64X speedups on average over the original RChol [3], feGRASS [11] and AMG [14] based PCG solvers, respectively. For instance, a power grid matrix with 60 million nodes and 260 million nonzeros can be solved (at a 1E-6 accuracy level) in 148 seconds on a single CPU core.
