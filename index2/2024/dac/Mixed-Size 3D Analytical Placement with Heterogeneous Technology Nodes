This paper proposes a mixed-size 3D analytical placement framework for face-to-face stacked integrated circuits fabricated with heterogeneous technology nodes and connected by hybrid bonding technology. The proposed framework efficiently partitions a given netlist into two dies and optimizes the positions of each macro, standard cell, and hybrid bonding terminal (HBT). A multi-technology objective function and a multi-technology density penalty calculation process are adopted to handle the heterogeneous-technology-node constraints during mixed-size 3D global placement. Furthermore, a 3D objective function is used to refine the placement result during HBT-cell co-optimization. Our placer achieves the best results for all contest test cases compared with the participating teams at the 2023 CAD Contest at ICCAD on 3D Placement with Macros.
