The use of cross-scheme fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in privacy-preserving applications present to be a new challenge to hardware accelerator design. Existing accelerator architectures with customized polynomial-level operator abstraction fail to efficiently handle hybrid FHE schemes due to the mismatch between computational demands and available hardware resources under various parameter settings. In this work, we propose a new accelerator architecture that consists of a novel finer-grained low-level operator, i.e., Meta-OP, that not only mathematically supports a diverse range of polynomial operations, but is also hardware-friendly for accelerator design without complex topological logic. We then design a new slot-based data management scheme to efficiently handle the distinct memory access patterns over the Meta-OP. With a slot-based data management approach, Alchemist can accelerate both arithmetic and logic FHE workloads with high hardware utilization rates. In the experiment, we show that Alchemist is up to 24,829X faster than CPU. For arithmetic FHE, compared with the SOTA ASIC accelerators, Alchemist achieves a 29.4X performance per area improvement on average. For logic FHE, compared with the SOTA ASIC accelerators, Alchemist achieves a 7.0X overall speed up on average.
