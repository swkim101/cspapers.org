SystemC TLM-2.0 is currently the industry standard for simulating full Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs). Although SystemC is designed to simulate the behavior of complex, parallel systems, the simulation itself is by default single-threaded. We present a technique to overcome this performance limitation by parallelizing the CPU model of a SystemC-TLM-2.0-based system-level simulator, a so-called Virtual Platform (VP). Our solution is fully compliant with the SystemC standard. To further increase the performance, we developed algorithms for asynchronous DMI pointer caching and we introduced a new tunable parameter called async_rate. This parameter controls the frequency used to annotate timing information to SystemC. Evaluation results demonstrate a significant speedup compared to sequential execution, with a maximum of 7.8 x achieved for octacore VPs on fully parallelizable workloads. For the execution of the NPB suite on the SIM-V VP, an average speedup of 6.2 x is achieved. This approach is a promising solution for accelerating VPs while adhering to the SystemC standard.
