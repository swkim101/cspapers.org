Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are on the rise in the industrial and academic communities. Since most UAVs are severely size, weight, and power (SWaP) constrained, building computing system for high-speed UAVs is challenging. Current domain-specific hardware-software (HW-SW) designs for UAVs are mainly bottom-up, focusing on optimizing a single module in the whole system, such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO), depth estimation, or planning. But this leads to underdesign for flight speed as agile navigation depends on a tight combination of multiple modules. To find the optimal HW-SW design for systematic flight performance, we propose a top-down automatic design framework. A flight model is introduced to guide the inter-module and the intra-module HW-SW optimization towards the system-level goal. For the perception algorithms, we define the representative design space. And some critical non-AI operators are accelerated and profiled on embedded GPU to achieve better hardware performance. The design framework is evaluated on a micro UAV equipped with a Nvidia Jetson Orin NX. In a specific navigation scenario, the design found by our framework achieve 40% and 65% increase on flight speed than two manual design methods respectively.
