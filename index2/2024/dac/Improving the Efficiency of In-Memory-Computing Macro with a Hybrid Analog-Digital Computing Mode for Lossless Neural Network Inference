Analog in-memory-computing (IMC) is an attractive technique with a higher energy efficiency to process machine learning workloads. However, the analog computing scheme suffers from large interface circuit overhead. In this work, we propose a macro with a hybrid analog-digital mode computation to reduce the precision requirement of the interface circuit. Considering the distribution of the multiplication and accumulation (MAC) value, we propose a nonlinear transfer function of the computing circuits by only accurately computing low MAC value in the analog domain with a digital mode to deal with the high MAC value with smaller possibility. Silicon measurement results show that the proposed macro could achieve 160 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency and 25.5 TOPS/W for 8b/8b matrix computation. The architectural-level evaluation for real workloads shows that the proposed macro can achieve up to 2.92Ã— higher energy efficiency than conventional analog IMC designs.
