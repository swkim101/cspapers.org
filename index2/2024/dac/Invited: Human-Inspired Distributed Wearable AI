The explosive surge in Human-AI interactions, fused with a soaring fascination in wearable technology, has ignited a frenzy of innovation and the emergence of a myriad of Wearable AI devices, each wielding diverse form factors, tackling tasks from health surveillance to turbocharging productivity. This paper delves into the vision for wearable AI technology, addressing the technical bottlenecks that stand in the way of its promised advancements. Embracing a paradigm shift, we introduce a Human-Inspired Distributed Network for Wearable AI, enabled by high-speed ultra-low-power secure connectivity via the emerging 'Body as a Wire' (Wi-R) technology. This breakthrough acts as the missing link: the artificial nervous system, seamlessly interconnecting all wearables and implantables, ushering in a new era of interconnected intelligence, where featherweight, perpetually operating wearable AI nodes redefine the boundaries of possibility.
