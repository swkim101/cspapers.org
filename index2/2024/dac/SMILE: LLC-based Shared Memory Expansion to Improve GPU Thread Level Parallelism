While designed for massive parallelism, GPUs are frequently suffering from low thread occupancy and limited data throughput, which are typically attributed to constrained on-chip resources, such as shared memory and register file. To alleviate the pressure, last-level cache (LLC) is being substantially enlarged to support continuously growing computation and to shrink the off-chip data traffic. Nevertheless, applications can be challenging to fully utilize the excessive LLC spaces. Towards the issue, we propose to manage partial LLC in an software way instead to expand precious shared memory (SMEM), named as SMILE , helping to alleviate the low thread occupancy. SMILE splits the monolithic LLC into normal data cache and new software region, with the latter being to extend the limited SMEM. For adapting to diverse application characteristics, SMILE enables multiple splitting grades and determines the appropriate partition via online profiling. Experimental results show that SMILE achieves average performance improvements of 14.7% and 8.4% respectively, compared to the default baseline and prior state-of-the-art.
