Memory partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce access conflicts on multi-bank memory in high-level synthesis. Previous memory partitioning methods mainly focus on a given access pattern extracted from stencil applications. Restricted by the pattern shape, these methods are prone to sub-optimal bank numbers or large overhead on address generation. In this work, we propose a pattern-morphing-based memory partitioning method, PMP, that only requires reduced hyperplane families to achieve the minimal bank number. To reduce the side effect of extra data padding, an integer linear programming problem is formulated for pattern morphing. Compared to the previous hyperplane-based memory partitioning, the experimental results show that our approach could achieve the optimal partition factor while saving 22% in LUTs, 21% in FlipFlops, 10% in DSPs, and 40% in memory overhead, on average.
