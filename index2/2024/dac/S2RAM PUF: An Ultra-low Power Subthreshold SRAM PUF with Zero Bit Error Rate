The reliability of physical unclonable function (PUF) has become the biggest challenge for key generation. Existing reliability improvement technologies incur high hardware overhead or testing costs. This paper proposes S2RAM-PUF, a novel, highly reliable and energy-efficient subthreshold SRAM PUF fabricated in 65nm process, with zero bit error rate (BER) across all voltage/temperature corners from 0.5V to 0.8V and from -40°C to 120°C. The 20480 bits generated by the fabricated 5 S2RAM PUF chips pass the NIST 800-22 randomness test and exhibit almost ideal uniqueness with a mean inter-die hamming distance of 0.5007. The total energy per bit is as low as 3.12fJ at 0.5V supply voltage. Both stabilization BER and energy outperform the two state-of-the-art SRAM-type PUFs reported in JSSC 2020 and 2021.
