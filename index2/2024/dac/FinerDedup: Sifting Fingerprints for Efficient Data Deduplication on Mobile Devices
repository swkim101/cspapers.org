Data deduplication is promised to extend the lifetime and capacity of storage on mobile devices. However, existing data deduplication works show high memory consumption and indexing costs for maintaining a fingerprint for each data block, especially when the duplicate ratio of data blocks on mobile systems is about 10% to 30%. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called FinerDedup to optimize the memory costs and retrieval efficiency of data deduplication. FinerDedup drastically reduces the number of fingerprints by screening out the duplicate data blocks via random forest and Bloom filter. We implement FinerDedup on real mobile devices with Android 10 and evaluate it with real workloads. Extensive experimental results show that FinerDedup can reduce 85% of fingerprints and 20% of I/O latency over the widely-used DmDedup.
