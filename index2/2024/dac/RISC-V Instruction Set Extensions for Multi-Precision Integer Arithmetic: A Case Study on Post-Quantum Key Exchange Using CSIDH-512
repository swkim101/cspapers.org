Multi-Precision Integer (MPI) arithmetic is a performance-critical component of many public-key cryptosystems, including besides classical ones (e.g., RSA, ECC) also isogeny-based post-quantum schemes. In this paper, we analyze and compare two widely-used MPI representations, namely full-radix and reduced-radix, for the efficient implementation of modular arithmetic operations on the 64-bit RISC-V (RV64GC) architecture. We also evaluate how the execution times of both can be further improved with Instruction Set Extensions (ISEs). The ISEs we propose are able to accelerate a CSIDH-512 class group action by a factor of 1.71 compared to a standard software implementation on a 64-bit Rocket core. This speed-up comes at the cost of a hardware overhead of about 10%.
