k-Clique counting problem plays an important role in graph mining which has seen a growing number of applications. However, current k-Clique counting accelerators cannot meet the performance requirement mainly because they struggle with high data transfer issue incurred by the intensive set intersection operations and the inability of load balancing. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem with a hybrid framework of content addressable memory (CAM) and in-memory processing (PIM). Specifically, we first utilize CAM for binary induced subgraph generation in order to reduce the search space, then we use PIM to implement in-place parallel k-Clique counting through iterative Boolean logic "AND" like operation. To take full advantage of this combined CAM and PIM framework, we develop dynamic task scheduling strategies that can achieve near optimal load balancing among the PIM arrays. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art CPU and GPU platforms, our approach achieves speedups of 167.5× and 28.8×, respectively. Meanwhile, the energy efficiency is improved by 788.3× over the GPU baseline.
