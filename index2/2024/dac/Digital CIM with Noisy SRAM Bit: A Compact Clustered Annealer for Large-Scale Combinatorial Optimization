Combinatorial optimization problems (COP) are NP-hard and intractable to solve using conventional computing. The Ising model-based annealer has gained increasing attention recently due to its efficiency and speed in finding approximate solutions. However, Ising solvers for travelling salesman problems (TSP) usually suffer from a scalability issue due to quadratically increasing number of spins. In this paper, we propose a digital computing-in-memory (CIM) based clustered annealer to solve tens of thousands of city-scale TSP with only a few mega-byte (MB) of static random access memory (SRAM), using hierarchical clustering to solve input sparsity and digital CIM flexibility to solve weight sparsity. The intrinsic process variations between SRAM devices are utilized to generate the noisy bit errors during pseudo-read under reduced supply voltage, realizing the annealing process. The design space of cluster size and programmability is explored to understand the trade-offs of solution quality and hardware cost, for TSP scale ranging from 3080 to 85900 cities. The proposed design speeds up the convergence by >109× with <25% solution quality overhead compared with the CPU baseline. The comparison with state-of-the-art scalable annealers shows a >1013× improvement on functionally normalized area and power.
