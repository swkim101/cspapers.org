Serverless computing has gained widespread attention, and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are well-suited for safeguarding user privacy. However, the additional startup procedure introduced by TEEs imposes considerable performance overhead on confidential serverless workloads. This paper introduces a novel parallelized enclave startup design, EnTurbo, which eliminates the integrity dependence of the enclave startup procedure, accelerating it while ensuring its security. Additionally, EnTurbo parallelizes the measurement procedure, enabling multi-thread measurement for acceleration with provable security. We evaluate EnTurbo by running confidential serverless workloads on SGX simulation mode. Results show that EnTurbo effectively speeds up enclave serverless by 1.42x-6.48x (SGXv1) and 1.33x-3.76x (SGXv2).
