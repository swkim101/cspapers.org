Automated analog circuit design migration significantly alleviates the burden on designers in circuit sizing under various operating conditions. Conventional methods model the migration problem as black-box optimization, requiring excessive iterations of costly simulations to converge. Reinforcement learning exhibits significant promise in transfer learning, as it enables the generation of circuits that fulfill specifications efficiently. The paper proposes a novel value decomposition-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, aiming to model complex analog circuits and eliminate the need for manually defined specifications of sub-circuits for new operating conditions. Additionally, it incorporates domain randomization techniques to efficiently generate circuits that meet unforeseen scenarios with minimal simulations. Experiment demonstrates that our algorithm can efficiently generate circuits meeting specifications under new operating conditions in few number of steps, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
