The increasing complexity of Electrical and Electronic (E/E) systems underscores the need for protective measures to ensure functional safety (FuSa) in high-assurance environments. This entails the identification and fortification of vulnerable nodes to enhance system reliability during mission-critical scenarios. Traditionally, the assessment of E/E system reliability has relied on fault injection (FI) techniques and simulations. However, FI faces challenges in coping with escalating design complexity, including resource demands and timing overheads. Furthermore, it falls short in identifying critical components that may lead to functional failures. To address these challenges, we propose a Machine Learning (ML)-based framework for predicting critical nodes in hardware designs. The process begins with constructing a graph from the design netlist, forming the foundation for training a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The GCN model utilizes graph node attributes, node labels, and edge connections to learn and predict critical nodes in the circuit. The model furnishes up to 93.7% accuracy in identifying vulnerable circuit nodes during evaluation on diverse designs such as Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) controller, OpenRISC 1200 (OR1200) modules. Furthermore, we incorporate an explainability analysis to interpret individual node predictions. This analysis discerns the critical design factors influencing fault criticality in the design. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, we, for the first time, perform a regression analysis to generate node criticality scores, quantifying the degrees of criticality, that can enable prioritizing resources towards critical nodes.
