3D ICs promise increased logic density and reduced routing congestion over conventional monolithic 2D ICs. High level synthesis (HLS) tools promise reduced design complexity by approaching the design from a higher abstraction level and allow for more optimization flexibility. We propose improving timing closure of 3D ICs by co-designing the architecture and physical design by integrating HLS and 3D IC macro placement into the same holistic loop. On average our method is able to reduce estimated total negative slack (TNS) by 62% and 92% when compared to a traditional binding and placement technique for 2D and 3D ICs respectively.
