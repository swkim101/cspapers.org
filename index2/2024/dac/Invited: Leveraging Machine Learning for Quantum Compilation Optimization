The design of quantum algorithms typically assumes the availability of an ideal quantum computer, characterized by full connectivity, noiseless operation, and unlimited coherence time. However, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices present a stark contrast, with a limited number of qubits, non-negligible quantum operation errors, and stringent constraints on the connectivity of physical qubits within a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This necessitates the dynamic remapping of logical qubits to physical qubits within the compiler to facilitate the execution of two-qubit gates in the algorithm. However, this introduces additional operations, consequently reducing the fidelity of the algorithm. Therefore, minimizing the number of added gates becomes crucial. Finding such an optimal routing problem is NP-hard, and the task is conventionally addressed using human-crafted heuristics to search for SWAP sequences, but these lack performance guarantees. In this study, we employ a Seq2Seq machine learning model for the qubit routing task, incorporating a Transformer neural network to learn the routing information in the gate and SWAP sequence. Compared to heuristic search-based algorithms, our approach significantly reduces the overhead of quantum computing resources required to adapt logical circuits to physical circuits executable on specific quantum backend hardware.
