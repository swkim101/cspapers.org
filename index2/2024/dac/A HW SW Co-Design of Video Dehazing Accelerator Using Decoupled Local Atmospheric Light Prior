In this paper, we introduce DLAPID, a novel decoupled parallel hardware-software co-design architecture for real-time video dehazing. From a software point of view, DLAPID isolates the atmospheric light operation from the initial transmission estimation to take full advantage of the hardware accelerators' parallelization features. For the hardware implementation, we deploy DLAPID both on FPGA and GPU platforms and validate its effectiveness. Using both real-world driving scenario testing sets and ground-truth datasets, we quantitatively and qualitatively assess the proposed method against several SOTA (state-of-the-art) video dehazing models. The outcomes of our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves better dehazing performance with lower power consumption and has real-time processing capabilities, thereby preventing potential accidents of autonomous vehicles.
