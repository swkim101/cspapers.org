Demands for efficient computing under memory wall have led to computation-in-memory (CIM) accelerators that leverage memory structure to perform in-situ computing. The content addressable memory (CAM) processing is a CIM paradigm that accomplishes general purpose functions, via sequences of search and update operations on CAM. However, the conventional CAM-based CIM is customized for vector-vector operation only and requires long search-update iterations for computing. To mitigate the drawbacks of prior works, this work proposes a content addressable processor (CAP), improving both functionality and performance. CAP supports general purpose inter-vector and intra-vector operations. Respectively, CAP shortens the search and update step latency. Additionally, the sequence order of the search-update pair is released by CAP to achieve parallel search-update. CAP is implemented in 22nm CMOS technology with 0.6 mm2 area. By integrating all the techniques, CAP achieves 2.68X performance improvement over the baseline and also realizes 11.37 TOPs/W energy efficiency and 1.376 TOP/mm2 area efficiency.
