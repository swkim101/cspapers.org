Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performance across various intelligent embedded scenarios towards embedded intelligence. Nonetheless, this trend also leads to degraded hardware efficiency as the network evolves deeper and deeper. In contrast, shallow networks exhibit superior hardware efficiency, which, unfortunately, suffer from inferior accuracy. To tackle this dilemma, we establish the first deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm, namely Double-Win NAS (DW-NAS), which is dedicated to automatically exploring deep-to-shallow transformable networks to marry the best of both worlds. Extensive experiments on two NVIDIA Jetson intelligent embedded systems clearly show the superiority of DW-NAS over previous state-of-the-art methods.
