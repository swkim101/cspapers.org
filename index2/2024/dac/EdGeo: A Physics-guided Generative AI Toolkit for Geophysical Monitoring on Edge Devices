Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a vital role in geoscience to explore the subsurface. It utilizes the seismic wave to image the subsurface velocity map. As the machine learning (ML) technique evolves, the data-driven approaches using ML for FWI tasks have emerged, offering enhanced accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional physics-based methods. However, a common challenge in geoscience --- the unprivileged data --- severely limits ML effectiveness. The issue becomes even worse during model pruning, a step essential in geoscience due to environmental complexities. To tackle this, we introduce the EdGeo toolkit, which employs a diffusion-based model guided by physics principles to generate high-fidelity velocity maps. The toolkit uses the acoustic wave equation to generate corresponding seismic waveform data, facilitating the fine-tuning of pruned ML models. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in SSIM scores and reduction in both MAE and MSE across various pruning ratios. Notably, the ML model fine-tuned using data generated by EdGeo yields superior quality of velocity maps, especially in representing unprivileged features, outperforming other existing methods.
