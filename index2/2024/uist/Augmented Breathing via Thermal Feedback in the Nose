We propose, engineer, and study a novel method to augment the feeling of breathing—enabling interactive applications to let users feel like they are inhaling more/less air (perceived nasal airflow). We achieve this effect by cooling or heating the nose in sync with the user’s inhalation. Our illusion builds on the physiology of breathing: we perceive our breath predominantly through the cooling of our nasal cavities during inhalation. This is why breathing in a “fresh” cold environment feels easier than in a “stuffy” hot environment, even when the inhaled volume is the same. Our psychophysical study confirmed that our in-nose temperature stimulation significantly influenced breathing perception in both directions: making it feel harder & easier to breathe. Further, we found that <Formula format="inline"><TexMath><?TeX $\sim 90 \,\%$?></TexMath><AltText>Math 1</AltText><File name="uist24-115-inline1" type="svg"/></Formula> of the trials were described as a change in perceived airflow/breathing, while only <Formula format="inline"><TexMath><?TeX $\sim 8 \,\%$?></TexMath><AltText>Math 2</AltText><File name="uist24-115-inline2" type="svg"/></Formula> as temperature. Following, we engineered a compact device worn across the septum that uses Peltier elements. We illustrate the potential of this augmented breathing in interactive contexts, such as for virtual reality (e.g., rendering ease of breathing crisp air or difficulty breathing with a deteriorated gas mask) and everyday interactions (e.g., in combination with a relaxation application or to alleviate the perceived breathing resistance when wearing a mask).
