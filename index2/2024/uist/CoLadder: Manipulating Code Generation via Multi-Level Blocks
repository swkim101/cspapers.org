This paper adopted an iterative design process to gain insights into programmers’ strategies when using LLMs for programming. We proposed CoLadder , a novel system that supports programmers by facilitating hierarchical task decomposition, direct code segment manipulation, and result evaluation during prompt authoring. A user study with 12 experienced programmers showed that CoLad-der is effective in helping programmers externalize their problem-solving intentions flexibly, improving their ability to evaluate and modify code across various abstraction levels, from their task’s goal to final code implementation.
