Smartwatches gained popularity in the mainstream, making them into today’s de-facto wearables. Despite advancements in sensing, haptics on smartwatches is still restricted to tactile feedback (e.g., vibration). Most smartwatch-sized actuators cannot render strong force-feedback. Simultaneously, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) promises compact force-feedback but, to actuate fingers requires users to wear many electrodes on their forearms. While forearm electrodes provide good accuracy, they detract EMS from being a practical force-feedback interface. To address this, we propose moving the electrodes to the wrist—conveniently packing them in the backside of a smartwatch. In our first study, we found that by cross-sectionally stimulating the wrist in 1,728 trials, we can actuate thumb extension, index extension & flexion, middle flexion, pinky flexion, and wrist flexion. Following, we engineered a compact EMS that integrates directly into a smartwatch’s wristband (with a custom stimulator, electrodes, demultiplexers, and communication). In our second study, we found that participants could calibrate our device by themselves Math 1 faster than with conventional EMS. Furthermore, all participants preferred the experience of this device, especially for its social acceptability & practicality. We believe that our approach opens new applications for smartwatch-based interactions, such as haptic assistance during everyday tasks.
