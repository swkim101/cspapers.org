In team sports like basketball, understanding and executing tactics—coordinated plans of movements among players—are crucial yet complex, requiring extensive practice. These tactics require players to develop a keen sense of spatial and situational awareness. Traditional coaching methods, which mainly rely on basketball tactic boards and video instruction, often fail to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and the real-world application of tactics, due to shifts in view perspectives and a lack of direct experience with tactical scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce VisCourt, a Mixed Reality (MR) tactic training system, in collaboration with a professional basketball team. To set up the MR training environment, we employed semi-automatic methods to simulate realistic 3D tactical scenarios and iteratively designed visual in-situ guidance. This approach enables full-body engagement in interactive training sessions on an actual basketball court and provides immediate feedback, significantly enhancing the learning experience. A user study with athletes and enthusiasts shows the effectiveness and satisfaction with VisCourt in basketball training and offers insights for the design of future SportsXR training systems.
