Extended Reality (XR) systems with hand-tracking support direct manipulation of objects with both hands. A common interaction in this context is for the non-dominant hand (NDH) to orient an object for input by the dominant hand (DH). We explore bimanual interaction with gaze through three new modes of interaction where the input of the NDH, DH, or both hands is indirect based on
