Humans physically express emotion by modulating parameters that register on mammalian skin mechanoreceptors, but are unavailable in current touch-sensing technology. Greater sensory richness combined with data on affect-expression composition is a prerequisite to estimating affect from touch, with applications including physical human-robot interaction. To examine shear alongside more easily captured normal stresses, we tailored recent capacitive technology to attain performance suitable for affective touch, creating a flexible, reconfigurable and soft 36-taxel array that detects multitouch normal and 2-dimensional shear at ranges of 1.5kPa-43kPa and ± 0.3-3.8kPa respectively, wirelessly at 43Hz (1548 taxels/s). In a deep-learning classification of 9 gestures (N=16), inclusion of shear data improved accuracy to 88%, compared to 80% with normal stress data alone, confirming shear stress’s expressive centrality. Using this rich data, we analyse the interplay of sensed-touch features, gesture attributes and individual differences, propose affective-touch sensing requirements, and share technical considerations for performance and practicality.
