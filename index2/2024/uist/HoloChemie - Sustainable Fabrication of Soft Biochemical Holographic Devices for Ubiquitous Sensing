Sustainable fabrication approaches and biomaterials are increasingly being used in HCI to fabricate interactive devices. However, the majority of the work has focused on integrating electronics. This paper takes a sustainable approach to exploring the fabrication of biochemical sensing devices. Firstly, we contribute a set of biochemical formulations for biological and environmental sensing with bio-sourced and environment-friendly substrate materials. Our formulations are based on a combination of enzymes derived from bacteria and fungi, plant extracts and commercially available chemicals to sense both liquid and gaseous analytes: glucose, lactic acid, pH levels and carbon dioxide. Our novel holographic sensing scheme allows for detecting the presence of analytes and enables quantitative estimation of the analyte levels. We present a set of application scenarios that demonstrate the versatility of our approach and discuss the sustainability aspects, its limitations, and the implications for bio-chemical systems in HCI.
