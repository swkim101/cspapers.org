Low-battery anxiety has emerged as a result of growing dependence on mobile devices, where the anxiety arises when the battery level runs low. While battery life can be extended through power-efficient hardware and software optimization techniques, low-battery anxiety will still remain a phenomenon as long as mobile devices rely on batteries. In this paper, we investigate how an accurate real-time energy consumption prediction at the application-level can improve the user experience in low-battery situations. We present Serenus, a mobile system framework specifically tailored to predict the energy consumption of each mobile application and present the prediction in a user-friendly manner. We conducted user studies using Serenus to verify that highly accurate energy consumption predictions can effectively alleviate low-battery anxiety by assisting users in planning their application usage based on the remaining battery life. We summarize requirements to mitigate usersâ€™ anxiety, guiding the design of future mobile system frameworks.
