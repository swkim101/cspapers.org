This study introduces "Flip-Pelt," a motor-driven peltier device designed to provide rapid thermal stimulation and congruent pressure feedback in virtual reality (VR) environments. Our system incorporates eight motor-driven peltier elements, allowing for the flipping of preheated or cooled elements to the opposite side. In evaluating the Flip-Pelt device, we assess user ability to distinguish between heat/cold sources by their patterns and stiffness, and its impact on enhancing haptic experiences in VR content that involves contact with various thermal sources. Our findings demonstrate that rapid thermal stimulation and congruent pressure feedback provided by Flip-Pelt enhance the recognition accuracy of thermal patterns and the stiffness of virtual objects. These features also improve haptic experiences in VR scenarios through their temporal congruency between tactile and thermal stimuli. Additionally, we discuss the scalability of the Flip-Pelt system to other body parts by proposing design prototypes.
