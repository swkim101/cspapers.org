This paper presents TouchpadAnyWear, a novel family of textile-integrated force sensors capable of multi-modal touch input, encompassing micro-gesture detection, two-dimensional (2D) continuous input, and force-sensitive strokes. This thin (<1.5 mm) and conformal device features high spatial resolution sensing and motion artifact tolerance through its unique capacitive sensor architecture. The sensor consists of a knitted textile compressive core, sandwiched by stretchable silver electrodes, and conductive textile shielding layers on both sides. With a high-density sensor pixel array (25/cm2), TouchpadAnyWear can detect touch input locations and sizes with millimeter-scale spatial resolution and a wide range of force inputs (0.05 N to 20 N). The incorporation of miniature polymer domes, referred to as “poly-islands”, onto the knitted textile locally stiffens the sensing areas, thereby reducing motion artifacts during deformation. These poly-islands also provide passive tactile feedback to users, allowing for eyes-free localization of the active sensing pixels. Design choices and sensor performance are evaluated using in-depth mechanical characterization. Demonstrations include an 8-by-8 grid sensor as a miniature high-resolution touchpad and a T-shaped sensor for thumb-to-finger micro-gesture input. User evaluations validate the effectiveness and usability of TouchpadAnyWear in daily interaction contexts, such as tapping, forceful pressing, swiping, 2D cursor control, and 2D stroke-based gestures. This paper further discusses potential applications and explorations for TouchpadAnyWear in wearable smart devices, gaming, and augmented reality devices.
