Prototyping serves as a critical phase in the industrial conceptual design process, enabling exploration of problem space and identification of solutions. Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled AI to become a co-creator in this process. However, designers often consider generative AI challenging due to the necessity to follow computer-centered interaction rules, diverging from their familiar design materials and languages. Physical prototype is a commonly used design method, offering unique benefits in prototype process, such as intuitive understanding and tangible testing. In this study, we propose ProtoDreamer, a mixed-prototype tool that synergizes generative AI with physical prototype to support conceptual design. ProtoDreamer allows designers to construct preliminary prototypes using physical materials, while AI recognizes these forms and vocal inputs to generate diverse design alternatives. This tool empowers designers to tangibly interact with prototypes, intuitively convey design intentions to AI, and continuously draw inspiration from the generated artifacts. An evaluation study confirms ProtoDreamerâ€™s utility and strengths in time efficiency, creativity support, defects exposure, and detailed thinking facilitation.
