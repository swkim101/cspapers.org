Machine embroidery is a versatile technique for creating custom and entirely fabric-based patterns on thin and conformable textile surfaces. However, existing machine-embroidered surfaces remain static, limiting the interactions they can support. We introduce Embrogami , an approach for fabricating textile structures with versatile shape-changing behaviors. Inspired by origami, we leverage
