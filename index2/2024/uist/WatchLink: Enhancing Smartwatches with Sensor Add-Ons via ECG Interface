We introduce a low-power communication method that lets smart-watches leverage existing electrocardiogram (ECG) hardware as a data communication interface. Our unique approach enables the connection of external, inexpensive, and low-power "add-on" sensors to the smartwatch, expanding its functionalities. These sensors cater to specialized user needs beyond those ofered by pre-built sensor suites, at a fraction of the cost and power of traditional communication protocols, including Bluetooth Low Energy. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we conduct a series of exploratory and evaluative tests to characterize the ECG interface as a communication channel on commercial smartwatches. We de-sign a simple transmission scheme using commodity components, demonstrating cost and power benefts. Further, we build and test a suite of add-on sensors, including UV light, body temperature, but-tons, and breath alcohol, all of which achieved testing objectives at low material cost and power usage. This research paves the way for
