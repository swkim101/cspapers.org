Non-consensual Intimate Media (NCIM) refers to the distribution of sexual or intimate content without consent. NCIM is common and causes significant emotional, financial, and reputational harm. We developed Hands-Off, an interaction technique for messaging applications that deters non-consensual screenshots. Hands-Off requires recipients to perform a hand gesture in the air, above the device, to unlock media—which makes simultaneous screenshotting difficult. A lab study shows that Hands-Off gestures are easy to perform and reduce non-consensual screenshots by 67%. We conclude by generalizing this approach and introduce the idea of Feminist Interaction Techniques (FIT), interaction techniques that encode feminist values and speak to societal problems, and reflect on FIT’s opportunities and limitations.
