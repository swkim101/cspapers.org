In this paper, we present X-Hair, a method that enables 3D-printed hair with various forms, properties, and functions. We developed a two-step suspend printing strategy to fabricate hair-like structures in different forms (e.g. fluff, bristle, barb) by adjusting parameters including Extrusion Length Ratio and Total Length. Moreover, a design tool is also established for users to customize hair-like structures with various properties (e.g. pointy, stiff, soft) on imported 3D models, which virtually shows the results for previewing and generates G-code files for 3D printing. We demonstrate the design space of X-Hair and evaluate the properties of them with different parameters. Through a series of applications with hair-like structures, we validate X-hairâ€™s practical usage of biomimicry, decoration, heat preservation, adhesion, and haptic interaction.
