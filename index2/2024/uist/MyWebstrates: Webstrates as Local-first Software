Webstrates are web substrates, a practical realization of shareable dynamic media under which distributability, shareability, and mal-leability are fundamental software principles. Webstrates blur the distinction between application and document in a way that enables users to share, repurpose, and refit software across a variety of domains, but its reliance on a central server constrains its use; it is at odds with personal and collective control of data; and limits applications to the web. We extend the fundamental principles to include interoperability and sovereignty over data and propose My-Webstrates, an implementation of Webstrates on top of a new, lower-level substrate for synchronization built around local-first software principles. MyWebstrates registers itself in the userâ€™s browser and function as a piece of local software that can selectively synchronise data over sync servers or peer-to-peer connections. We show how MyWebstrates extends Webstrates to enable offline collaborative use, interoperate between Webstrates on non-web technologies such as Unity, and maintain personal and collective sovereignty
