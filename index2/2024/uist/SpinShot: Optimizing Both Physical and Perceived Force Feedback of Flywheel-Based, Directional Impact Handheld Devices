Real-world impact, such as hitting a tennis ball and a baseball, generates instantaneous, directional impact forces. However, current ungrounded force feedback technologies, such as air jets and propellers, can only generate directional impulses that are 10x-10,000x weaker. We present SpinShot, a fywheel-based device with a solenoid-actuated stopper capable of generating directional impulse of 22 in 1 , which is more than 10x stronger than prior ungrounded directional technologies. Furthermore, we present a novel force design that reverses the fywheel immediately after the initial impact, to signifcantly increase the perceived magnitude. We
