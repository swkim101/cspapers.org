Stencil computation is one of the most universal computation motifs in scientific applications such as weather prediction. Due to the complexity of scientific simulation, the stencil computation can contain a set of complex stencil operations that form a directed acyclic graph (referred to composite stencil). Unfortunately, most existing stencil optimizations and compilers only focus on intra-stencil operation, and cannot fully explore the performance improvement potential of composite stencils in nowadays applications. To this end, we propose Moirae, a framework that explores a novel optimization space and generates high-performance code for composite stencils. We first propose a lightweight cost model with a fine-grained analysis of memory access behavior to predict the performance. Based on the cost model, we propose an evolutionary search method to find a high-performance optimization, leveraging a search space pruning method with stencil domain knowledge. Experimental results show that Moirae can outperform the state-of-the-art composite stencil compilers.
