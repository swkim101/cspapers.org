Data representation in quantum state space offers an alternative function space for machine learning tasks. However, benchmarking these algorithms at a practical scale has been limited by ineffective simulation methods. We develop a quantum kernel framework using a Matrix Product State (MPS) simulator and employ it to perform a classification task with 165 features and 6400 training data points, well beyond the scale of any prior work. We make use of a circuit ansatz on a linear chain of qubits with increasing interaction distance between qubits. We assess the MPS simulator performance on CPUs and GPUs and, by systematically increasing the qubit interaction distance, we identify a crossover point beyond which the GPU implementation runs faster. We show that quantum kernel model performance improves as the feature dimension and training data increases, which is the first evidence of quantum model performance at scale.
