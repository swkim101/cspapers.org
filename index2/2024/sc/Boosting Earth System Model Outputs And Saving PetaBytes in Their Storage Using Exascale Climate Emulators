We present the design and scalable implementation of an exascale climate emulator for addressing the escalating computational and storage requirements of high-resolution Earth System Model simulations. We utilize the spherical harmonic transform to stochastically model spatio-temporal variations in climate data. This provides tunable spatio-temporal resolution and significantly improves the fidelity and granularity of climate emulation, achieving an ultra-high spatial resolution of $0.034^{\circ}(\sim 3.5 \mathbf{~ k m})$ in space. Our emulator, trained on 318 billion hourly temperature data points from a 35 -year and 31 billion daily data points from an 83-year global simulation ensemble, generates statistically consistent climate emulations. We extend linear solver software to mixed-precision arithmetic GPUs, applying different precisions within a single solver to adapt to different correlation strengths. The PaRSEC runtime system supports efficient parallel matrix operations by optimizing the dynamic balance between computation, communication, and memory requirements. Our BLAS3-rich code is optimized for systems equipped with four different families and generations of GPUs, scaling well to achieve 0.976 EFlop/s on 9, 025 nodes (36,100 AMD MI250X multichip module (MCM) GPUs) of Frontier (nearly full system), 0.739 EFlop/s on 1,936 nodes (7,744 Grace-Hopper Superchips (GH200)) of Alps, 0.243 EFlop/s on 1,024 nodes (4,096 A100 GPUs) of Leonardo, and 0.375 EFlop/s on 3,072 nodes (18,432 V100 GPUs) of Summit.
