This paper describes the deployment and operational experience of a novel incentive-based power-control strategy on the Fugaku supercomputer. Our incentive-based program, termed Fugaku Points, provides knobs to users to apply power control functions to improve the overall power efficiency of the supercomputer toward achieving HPC sustainability in terms of its environmental implications. We also discuss new operational opportunities, challenges, and future directions.
