Among different quantum computing technologies, neutral atom quantum computers have several advantageous features, such as multi-qubit gates, application-specific topologies, movable qubits, homogenous qubits, and long-range interactions. However, existing compilation techniques for neutral atoms fall short of leveraging these advantages in a practical and scalable manner. This paper introduces PARALLAX, a zero-SWAP, scalable, and parallelizable compilation and atom movement scheduling method tailored for neutral atom systems, which reduces high-error operations by $25 \%$ and increases the success rate by $\mathbf{2 8 \%}$ on average compared to the state-of-the-art technique.
