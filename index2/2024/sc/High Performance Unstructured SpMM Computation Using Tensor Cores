High-performance sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM) multiplication is paramount for science and industry, as the ever-increasing sizes of data prohibit using dense data structures. Yet, existing hardware, such as Tensor Cores (TC), is ill-suited for SpMM, as it imposes strict constraints on data structures that cannot be met by unstructured sparsity found in many applications. To address this, we introduce (S)parse (Ma)trix Matrix (T)ensor Core-accelerated (SMaT): a novel SpMM library that utilizes TCs for unstructured sparse matrices. Our block-sparse library leverages the low-level CUDA MMA (matrix-matrix-accumulate) API, maximizing the performance offered by modern GPUs. Algorithmic optimizations such as sparse matrix permutation, further improve performance by minimizing the number of non-zero blocks. The evaluation on NVIDIA A100 shows that SMaT outperforms SotA libraries (DASP, cuSPARSE, and Magicube) by up to 125x (on average 2.6x). SMaT can be used to accelerate many workloads in scientific computing, large model training, inference, and others.
