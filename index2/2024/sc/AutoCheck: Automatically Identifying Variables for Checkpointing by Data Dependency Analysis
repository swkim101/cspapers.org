Checkpoint/Restart (C/R) has been widely deployed in numerous HPC systems, Clouds, and industrial data centers, which are typically operated by system engineers. Nevertheless, there is no existing approach that helps system engineers without domain expertise, and domain scientists without system fault tolerance knowledge identify those critical variables accounted for correct application execution restoration in a failure for C/R. To address this problem, we propose an analytical model and a tool (AutoCheck) that can automatically identify critical variables to checkpoint for C/R. AutoCheck relies on first, analytically tracking and optimizing data dependency between variables and other application execution state, and second, a set of heuristics that identify critical variables for checkpointing from the refined data dependency graph (DDG). AutoCheck allows programmers to pinpoint critical variables to checkpoint quickly within a few minutes. We evaluate AutoCheck on 14 representative HPC benchmarks, demonstrating that AutoCheck can efficiently identify correct critical variables to checkpoint.
