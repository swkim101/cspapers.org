This work introduces ECOLIFE, the first carbon-aware serverless function scheduler to co-optimize carbon footprint and performance. ECOLIFE builds on the key insight of intelligently exploiting multi-generation hardware to achieve high performance and lower carbon footprint. ECOLIFE designs multiple novel extensions to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the context of serverless execution environment to achieve high performance while effectively reducing the carbon footprint.
