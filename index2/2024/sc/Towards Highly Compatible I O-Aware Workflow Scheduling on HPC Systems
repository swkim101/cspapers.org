Scientific workflows on High-Performance Computing (HPC) consist of multiple data processing and computing tasks with dependencies. Efficiently scheduling computing resources and multi-tier storage across workflow tasks is crucial for optimizing performance. Existing solutions often fall short in achieving the co-scheduling of computing and 1/O resources and lack compatibility with HPC system software. In this paper, we introduce a performance model for scheduling workflows on HPC systems to enhance the understanding of workflow scheduling and facilitate the testing of the scheduling algorithm. Additionally, we propose THman, an open-source scientific workflow scheduler featuring our heuristic scheduling algorithm, Highest Contribution First (HCF). THman achieves online co-scheduling of computing and I/O resources for workflows and is designed to work with traditional HPC batch schedulers for high compatibility. We evaluate THman using simulated workloads and real-world workflow applications. Experimental results show that THman reduces workflow makespan by up to 30.9% compared to alternative methods.
