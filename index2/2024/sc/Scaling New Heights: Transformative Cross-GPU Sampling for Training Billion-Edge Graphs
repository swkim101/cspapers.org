Efficient training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on billion-edge graphs poses significant challenges due to memory constraints and data transfer bottlenecks, particularly affecting GPU-based sampling. Traditional methods either face severe CPU-GPU data transfer bottlenecks or encounter excessive data shuffling and synchronization overheads in multi-GPU setups. To overcome these challenges in GNN training on large-scale graphs, we introduce HyDRA, a pioneering framework that elevates mini-batch, sampling-based training. HyDRA innovates in multi-GPU memory sharing and multi-node feature retrieval, transforming cross-GPU sampling by seamlessly integrating sampling and data transfer into a single kernel operation. It develops a hybrid pointer-driven data placement technique to enhance neighbor retrieval efficiency, designs a targeted replication strategy for high-degree vertices to reduce communication overhead, and leverages dynamic cross-batch data orchestration with pipelining to minimize redundant data transfers. Evaluated on systems equipped with up to 64 A100 GPUs, HyDRA significantly outperforms current leading methods, achieving $1.4 x$ to 5.3x faster training speeds compared to DSP and DGL-UVA and demonstrating up to a 42x improvement in multi-GPU scalability. HyDRA sets a new benchmark for high-performance GNN training at large scales.
