Mixed-precision quantization has shown to be a promising method for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs. This technique boosts computational efficiency by processing most values with low-precision, high-throughput compute units and maintains accuracy by processing outliers in high-precision. However, due to the dynamic, irregular, and sparse nature of outliers, this approach is far from using hardware efficiently. In this work, we propose MixQ, an efficient mixed-precision quantization system. Through our in-depth analysis of outlier distribution, we introduce a locality-based outlier prediction algorithm that can predict all outliers of 95.8% of tokens. Based on this accurate prediction, we propose a quantization ahead of detection (QAD) technique that can verify the correctness of prediction. A new data structure is proposed for efficient outlier processing. Evaluation shows that MixQ achieves $1.52 \times$ and $1.78 \times$ speedup over FP16 and Bitsandbytes on 8-bit quantization; plus $1.48 \times 1.93 \times$ and $6 \times$ speedup over QUIK, FP16, and AWQ on 4-bit quantization. 11Our code is available on:https://github.com/Qcompiler/MIXQ
