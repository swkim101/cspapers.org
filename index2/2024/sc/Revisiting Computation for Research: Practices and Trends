In the field of computational science, effectively supporting researchers necessitates a deep understanding of how they utilize computational resources. Building upon a decade-old survey that explored the practices and challenges of research computation, this study aims to bridge the understanding gap between providers of computational resources and researchers who rely on them. This study revisits key survey questions and gathers feedback on open-ended topics from over a hundred interviews. Quantitative analyses of present and past results illuminate the landscape of research computation. Qualitative analyses, including careful use of large language models, highlight trends and challenges with concrete evidence. Given the rapid evolution of computational science, this paper offers a toolkit with methodologies and insights to simplify future research and ensure ongoing examination of the landscape. This study, with its findings and toolkit, guides enhancements to computational systems, deepens understanding of user needs, and streamlines reassessment of the computational landscape.
