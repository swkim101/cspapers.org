Online traffic classification enables critical applications such as network intrusion detection and prevention, providing Quality-of-Service, and real-time IoT analytics. However, with increasing network speeds, it has become extremely challenging to analyze and classify traffic online. In this paper, we present Leo , a system for online traffic classification at multi-terabit line rates. At its core, Leo implements an on-line machine learning (ML) model for traffic classification, namely the decision tree, in the network switch’s data plane. Leo ’s design is fast (can classify packets at switch’s line rate), scalable (can automatically select a resource-efficient design for the class of decision tree models a user wants to support), and runtime programmable (the model can be updated on-the-fly without switch downtime), while achieving high model accuracy. We implement Leo on top of Intel Tofino switches. Our evaluations show that Leo is able to classify traffic at line rate with nominal latency overhead, can scale to model sizes more than twice as large as state-of-the-art data plane ML classification systems, while achieving classification accuracy on-par with an offline traffic classifier.
