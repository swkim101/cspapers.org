In search, autocomplete (AC) is an essential tool that provides suggestions for each keystroke, functioning well with token-based queries. However, it is challenging to handle at scale when input queries are conversational and semantically rich. Identifying relevant queries for sub-tokens requires efficient lookup strategies, real-time ranking, and relevance in the results. This work integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI safety, and relevance ranking to produce autocomplete suggestions for conversational queries in a production system. RAG-based responses ensure a high hit ratio for popular AC inputs and maintain a very low risk category by not triggering any critical AI safety concerns.
