Anomalies in graphs involve attributes and structures and may occur at different levels (e.g., node or community). Existing GNN-based detection methods often merely focus on anomalies of single nodes or neighborhoods, making it hard to cope with complex and organized networks. Towards this, we propose SI-HGAD, a novel Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) approach that utilizes hierarchical information to detect anomalies. Powered by structural information, SI-HGAD can mine an optimal graph abstraction while enabling hierarchical substructural modeling. Also, we design a Graph Transformer to mine multi-range structural and attribute patterns for nodes. The decoders reconstruct both the node attributes and the multi-level subgraphs in a bottom-up manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SI-HGAD.
