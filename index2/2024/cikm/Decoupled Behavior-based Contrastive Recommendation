Recommender systems are crucial tools in online applications, assisting users in discovering relevant content efficiently. Recent studies demonstrate that contrastive learning (CL) based methods yield significant results in collaborative filtering (CF) recommendations, due to their ability to address the issue of data sparsity. However, two inherent limitations remain unexplored in these methods. a) Since the datasets commonly used are binary (0: no interaction; 1: interaction), current methods only provide rudimentary modeling of user behaviors in binary form, which fails to model complex user-item interactions and relationships in real-world recommendation scenarios. b) Existing CL-based methods mostly construct contrastive views through heuristic-based embedding or structure perturbation, which are prone to introduce noise or discard important information, leading to a decreased representation quality. To address these issues, we propose a Decoupled Behavior-based Contrastive Recommendation model (DBCR) that effectively decouples user behaviors from binary datasets for better user-item interaction modeling. The core idea is to decouple latent user behaviors from unlabelled user-item interactions (binary datasets) and utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to optimize CF-based recommendation jointly. Specifically, we introduce latent behavior variables and embed them into user-item interaction modeling within the generalized expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Moreover, we design a contrastive learning task by constructing a preference view instead of unreasonable perturbation to further improve the learned representation. Experimental results and analyses on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DBCR and its high efficiency, with an average improvement of 16.9% over state-of-the-art methods.
