The Text-to-SQL problem aims at developing natural language query interfaces for relational database systems by converting the text input into executable SQL queries. Recently, using Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as a new paradigm for the Text-to-SQL problem. To this end, the LLM needs to understand not only user input but also information from the database. In this demo, we present multi-agent SQL (MageSQL), an LLM based Text-to-SQL approach that tackles the task by orchestrating multiple agents in a pipeline. We will showcase a user-friendly interface to demonstrate the inner workings of our approach that allows users to add and modify the agents with different functionalities, customize prompts, and see their impact on specific examples. Through several use cases, we will demonstrate how to (i) construct a Text-to-SQL pipeline with multiple agents; (ii) generate prompts for LLM with various templates and strategies; and (iii) monitor the results of natural language queries and perform debugging.
