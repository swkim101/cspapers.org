Traffic speed prediction is a crucial task for optimizing navigation systems and reducing traffic congestion. Although there have been efforts to improve the accuracy of speed prediction by incorporating auxiliary features, such as traffic flow, weather, and time, types of auxiliary features are limited and their detailed relationships with speed have not been explored yet. In our study, we present the individual spatio-temporal (IST) dependencies on flow and speed, and characterize three types of IST-dependencies with the flow-to-flow, speed-to-speed, and flow-to-speed graphs. Then, we propose Auxiliary feature-aided Attention Network (ARIAN), a novel approach to judiciously learning the degrees of IST-dependencies with the three graphs and predicting the future speed by leveraging various auxiliary features. Through comprehensive experiments using 3 real-world datasets, we validate the superiority of ARIAN over 10 state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of each auxiliary feature and each dependency learner in ARIAN.
