Zero-Shot Relational Learning (ZSRL), strives to predict relations that have not been observed during training, presenting a considerable challenge in terms of model generalization. Existing ZSRL methods usually utilize the prior knowledge of labels (e.g., text description, ontological schema) to enable knowledge transfer by learned features. Nonetheless, these methods remain limited to calculating the surface features exhibited by relations, failing to fully explore their underlying driving factors. This leads to insufficient discrimination between the shared and distinctive inherent components among relations, which consequently impedes the cognitive understanding required for advanced reasoning. In our study, we aim to identify and utilize shared factors that widely exist in the prior knowledge of classes to learn enhanced semantic representations via shared factors composition, and develop our Factor-based ZSRL framework (FZR) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to bridge inequality between seen and unseen classes. FZR is designed to restructure the semantic space in such a way that it captures the essence of relation formation, thereby
