Network embedding is a commonly used technique in graph mining and plays an important role in a variety of applications. Most network embedding works can be categorized into positional node embedding methods and target at capturing the proximity/relative position of node pairs. Recently, structural node embedding has attracted tremendous research interest, which is intended to perceive the local structural information of node, i.e., nodes can share similar local structures in different positions of graphs. Although numerous structural node embedding methods are designed to encode such structural information, most, if not all, of these methods cannot simultaneously achieve the following three desired properties: (1) bijective mapping between embedding and local structure of node; (2) inductive capability; and (3) good interpretability of node embedding. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel structural node embedding algorithm named topological anonymous walk embedding (TAWE). Specifically, TAWE creatively integrates anonymous walk and breadth-first search (BFS) to construct the bijective mapping between node embedding and local structure of node. In addition, TAWE possesses inductive capability and good interpretability of node embedding. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TAWE algorithm in both structural node classification task and structural node clustering task.
