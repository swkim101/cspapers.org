Mining dense subgraphs from a big graph is important in applications such as community (or module) detection in social (or biological) networks. While most dense structures are defined on undirected graphs, recent efforts have generalized these notions to directed graphs. In this demonstration paper, we present DirDense, an interactive tool that makes it easy for end-users to mine dense structures from a big directed graph. DirDense currently supports the mining of maximal (γ1, γ2)-quasi-cliques, maximal (k 1,k 1)-plexes, and the directed densest subgraph. DirDense facilitates parameter tuning for each type of the structure-mining tasks, and provides intuitive interfaces to visualize and examine the dense directed structures. Using real-world data, we showcase how users can mine dense directed structures by parameter tuning in DirDense, and how they can conveniently examine these structures and cascade the mining tasks to find progressively larger dense subgraphs more quickly.
