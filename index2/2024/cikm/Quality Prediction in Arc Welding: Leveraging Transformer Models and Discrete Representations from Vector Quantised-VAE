Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including gas metal arc welding (GMAW), which efficiently converts electrical energy into thermal energy to join metals. Despite decades of research and extensive application in the automotive and aerospace sectors, weld quality assessment in the GMAW process remains a major challenge. This paper presents a novel learning-based approach relying on a vector quantised variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) for data representation. In addition, we are the first to provide a time series dataset to the research community that combines labeled and unlabeled time series data from the GMAW domain, thereby enabling further research. The core idea of our approach consists of two stages: In the first stage, we use a learned automatic extraction of local features of the input signal using a VQ-VAE architecture. Based on this, in the second stage, we use a transformer model that processes the discretized features and performs weld quality prediction and classification. Our approach addresses real-world scenarios and improves the prediction of quality and fill existing data gaps by providing a reliable approach for quality assessment during manufacturing based on sensor data.
