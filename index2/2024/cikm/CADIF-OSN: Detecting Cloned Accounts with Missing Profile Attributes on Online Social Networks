The growth of online social networks (OSNs) has become increasingly significant. Potential cloned accounts on these platforms raise serious concerns due to the risks they pose to user privacy and security. Previous works in the detection of cloned accounts on OSNs do not yield satisfactory results and lack consideration of the impact of missing attributes on the detection process. We propose cloned account detection with imputation framework for online social networks (CADIF-OSN) to accurately find potential cloned accounts on OSNs. This framework enables the accurate identification of potential cloned accounts on OSNs by leveraging their public profile information, even in cases where some of the information may not be accessible. The framework comprises four key components: 1) Fuzzy string matching with Levenshtein Distance that quickly generates suspicious account pairs by matching all the accounts' usernames and screennames; 2) An embedded method Doc2Vec that transforms all existing profile information of accounts into estimable vectors; 3) A HyperImpute model that imputes the missing information; and 4) A deep-forest model that is trained to detect cloned accounts. We evaluated our framework using a Twitter dataset consisting of 3,826 pairs of cloned accounts and 70,000 normal accounts. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework significantly surpasses existing approaches in terms of Precision and F1-score.
