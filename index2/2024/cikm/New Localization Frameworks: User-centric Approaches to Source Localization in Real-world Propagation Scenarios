Source localization in social platforms is critical for managing and controlling the misinformation spreading. Despite all the recent advancements, existing methods do not consider the dynamic and heterogeneous propagation behaviors of users and are developed based on simulated data with strong model assumptions, limiting the application in real-world scenarios. This research addresses this limitation by presenting a novel framework for source localization, grounded in real-world propagation cascades from platforms like Weibo and Twitter. What's more, recognizing the user-driven nature of users in information spread, we systematically crawl and integrate user-specific profiles, offering a realistic understanding of user-driven propagation dynamics. In summary, by developing datasets derived from real-world propagation cascades, we set a precedent in enhancing the authenticity and practice of source identification for social media. Our comprehensive experiments not only validate the feasibility and rationale of our novel user-centric localization approaches but also emphasize the significance of considering user profiles in real-world propagation scenarios.
