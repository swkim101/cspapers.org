Despite the growing volume of time series data across various domains, detecting anomalies remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of the data. Traditional monitoring systems are inefficient in capturing contextual and temporal anomalies that are only viable through time and handling high-dimensional data. From implementation to deployment, this paper presents an anomaly detection system on a cyber-physical system by integrating Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), forming a hybrid VAE-LSTM-OCSVM model. The proposed architecture positions itself as a zero-day anomaly detector, by learning the nominal functioning of systems, enabling it to identify deviations from normal operations without prior knowledge of specific anomalies. This capability significantly enhances the model's utility in online monitoring, making it adept at detecting unforeseen operational disruptions. We propose an Adaptive Loss Weight Adjustment Algorithm (ALWAA) to account for Domain incremental learning in our system, as required by the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 and ISO/IEC 23053:2022 standards. The model is evaluated on a dataset including 2 types of anomalies, comparing and demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. The findings suggest that the hybrid VAE-LSTM-OCSVM model offers a promising direction for more effective and efficient anomaly detection in time series data, with its ability to safeguard against known and unknown anomalies.
