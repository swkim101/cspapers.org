Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in fundamental tasks such as node classification and link prediction, as well as in specialized domains like recommendation systems, fraud detection, and drug discovery. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns about their reliability in security-critical areas. To address this issue, researchers are exploring various defense methods, including specific attack countermeasures and certifiable robustness approaches. Nevertheless, these strategies are often effective only against limited attack scenarios, and prevailing certification methods prove inadequate when confronted with injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a method named CERT_UIA to enhance the robustness of GNN models against worst-case attacks, specifically targeting the scenario of Universal node Injection Attacks (UIA), thereby filling a gap in the existing literature on certified robustness in this context. Our approach involves a two-stage attack process that replaces the transformations of the topology and feature spaces with equivalent unified feature transformations, unifying the optimization of worst-case perturbations into a single feature space. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and compare it with existing certified methods.
