For the sentence-level sentiment classification task, learning Contrastive Discourse Relations (CDRs) like a-but-b is difficult for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) via purely data-driven training. Several methods exist in the literature for dissemination of CDR information with DNNs, but there is no dedicated dataset available to effectively test their dissemination performance. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale dataset for this purpose called Covid19-twitter, which contains around 100k tweets symmetrically divided into various categories. Instead of manual annotation, we used a combination of an Emoji analysis and a lexicon-based tool called Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) to perform automatic labelling of the tweets, while also ensuring high accuracy of the annotation process through some quality checks. We also provide benchmark performances of several baselines on our dataset for both the sentiment classification and CDR dissemination tasks. We believe that this dataset will be valuable for discourse analysis research in sentiment classification.
