Modern search systems offer multiple ways for expressing information needs, including image, voice, and text. Consequently, an increasing number of users seamlessly transition between these modalities to convey their intents. This emerging trend presents new opportunities for utilizing queries in different modalities to help users complete their search journeys efficiently. In this proposal, we introduce an approach to segmenting a multimodal query stream into missions, demonstrate how these in-mission queries can enhance search ranking, and outline key areas for future research.
