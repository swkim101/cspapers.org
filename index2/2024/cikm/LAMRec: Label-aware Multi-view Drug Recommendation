The drug recommendation task aims to predict safe and effective drug prescriptions based on the patients' historical electronic health records (EHRs). However, existing drug recommendation models generally have two limitations. First, they neglect the inherent characteristics of multiple views existing in patients' clinical data (e.g., diagnoses and procedures), leading to fragmented and inconsistent patient representations. Second, they do not fully exploit drug label information. Most models do not explicitly establish a mapping relationship between drug labels and patients' historical visits. To address these two problems, we proposed a label-aware multi-view drug recommendation model named LAMRec. In particular, LAMRec uses a cross-attention module to fuse information from the diagnosis and procedure views, and increases the mutual information of patient multi-view representations through multi-view contrastive loss; the label-wise attention mechanism fully explores drug label information by constructing an adaptive mapping of drug-visit to generate personalized representations that are aware of the drug-related visit information. Experiments on three real world medical datasets demonstrated the superiority of LAMRec, with a relative reduction of 5.25% in DDI compared to the optimal baseline, a relative improvement of 4.20% in Jaccard similarity scores, and a relative improvement of 3.10% in F1 scores.
