Current adversarial defense methods for GNNs exhibit critical limitations obstructing real-world application: 1) inadequate adaptability to graph heterophily, 2) absent generalizability to early GNNs like GraphSAGE used downstream, and 3) low inference scalability unacceptable for resource-constrained scenarios. To simultaneously address these challenges, we propose the first online GNN-MLP distillation framework PROSPECT, which merges the complementary knowledge of MLP and GNN and can thus learn GNN and MLP robust against adversarial structure attacks on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. PROSPECT integrates seamlessly into GraphSAGE and achieves inference scalability exponentially higher than conventional GNNs. To mitigate potential convergence failure caused by inductive bias conflicts between the heterogeneous MLP and GNN, we propose the Quasi-Alternating Cosine Annealing (QACA) learning rate scheduler, inspired by our convergence analysis of the involved MLP. Experiments on homophilic and het-erophilic graphs demonstrate the advantages of PROSPECT over current defenses and offline GNN-MLP distillation methods in terms of adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, the inference scalability of PROSPECT orders of magnitude higher than existing defenses, and the effectiveness of QACA.
