Understanding the skills and proficiency levels required for various roles is crucial for effective workforce planning, learning and development. In this paper, we propose a robust skill proficiency modeling framework that offers a structured method to help describe, assess and develop proficiency in key skills, facilitating individuals' career pathways and aiding organizations in talent management and adaptability. We first design a skill proficiency description pipeline, which generates statements describing the requirements at each proficiency level of a skill. Following this, we build a skill proficiency by occupation model using large-scale job ad data to help organizations and individuals understand the skill proficiency requirements for different roles. Finally,we design a visual analytics system, based on a real-world career pathway scenario, to demonstrate the practical usefulness and effectiveness of our framework.
