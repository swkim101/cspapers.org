Advancements in sensor technology are leading to massive collection of tracking data in sports. There is an increasing interest in analyzing the tracking data to gain competitive advantage. Analyzing and labeling key game moments can provide deep insights into player performance, team dynamics, as well as game strategy. However, the process of manually labeling and analyzing these moments is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a visual interface for user-friendly and efficient labeling of key moments in basketball games aided by neural networks. We report results of a user study evaluating the labeling interface.
