Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools and APIs is essential for fields such as information retrieval and knowledge management. While LLMs have made significant strides, their effective integration with external APIs-essential for real-world applications-remains challenging. This paper introduces RESTful-Llama, a novel method designed to empower open-source LLMs to accurately convert natural language instructions into well-formed RESTful API calls. Moreover, RESTful-Llama utilizes DOC-Prompt, a newly proposed technique for generating fine-tuning datasets from publicly available API documentation. Initial experiments demonstrate that RESTful-Llama significantly enhances the accuracy of generated REST API requests.
