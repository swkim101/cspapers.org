Web-scale search systems typically tackle the scalability challenge with a two-step paradigm: retrieval and ranking. The retrieval step, also known as candidate selection, often involves extracting entities, creating an inverted index, and performing term matching for retrieval. Such traditional methods require manual and time-consuming development of retrieval models. In this paper, we propose a framework for constructing a graph that integrates human knowledge with user activity data analysis. The learned links are utilized for retrieval purposes. The model is easy to explain, debug, and tune. The system implementation is straightforward and can directly leverage existing inverted index systems. We applied this retrieval framework to enhance the job search and recommendation systems on a large professional networking portal, resulting in significant performance improvements.
