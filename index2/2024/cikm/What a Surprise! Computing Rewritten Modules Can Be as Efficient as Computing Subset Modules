Uniform Interpolation (UI) is an advanced non-standard reasoning service that seeks to refine ontologies by creating rewritten modules. These modules, known as uniform interpolants, retain only "relevant names" while preserving their meanings in the absence of other names. UI holds significant potential across various domains where tailored ontology modules are required. However, realizing its full potential demands highly optimized techniques for generating such modules. Previous studies have identified notable challenges in generating uniform interpolants for EL-ontologies, where their computation is substantially more complex and computationally demanding than standard subset modules. Despite these obstacles, this paper introduces an advanced "forgetting" method tailored for computing uniform interpolants of ELIO-ontologies with ABoxes. We show that with effective normalization and inference strategies, these uniform interpolants can be computed efficiently, matching the speed of standard module computation. A comprehensive evaluation using a prototype implementation of this method achieved a 100% success rate on two major benchmark datasets, Oxford-ISG and BioPortal, with results delivered within seconds. The efficiency of our approach is attributed to our novel linear strategy for introducing definers, in sharp contrast to existing strategies that lead to an exponential increase in definers and computational inefficiency. Our method is unique in its ability to create signature-restricted modules for large-scale ontologies, making it a vital addition to the community's toolkit.
