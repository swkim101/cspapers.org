Retrieval-augmented Generation has been used to augment Language Models by retrieving texts from external databases. Since real-world texts are often connected in the graph (e.g., papers in citation networks), we use these relations to guide the retrieval process of RAG. Concretely, we investigate proximity and role-based relations, where the former considers topologically close nodes and the latter considers structurally similar nodes. We empirically verify their correlation to text relations, which motivates us to propose the framework of Topology-aware Retrieval-augmented Generation for text generation, which consists of a retrieval module to retrieve texts by their topological relations and an aggregation module to compose retrieved texts into prompts triggering LLMs for text generation. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of this framework, signifying the potential of equipping RAG with topological awareness.
