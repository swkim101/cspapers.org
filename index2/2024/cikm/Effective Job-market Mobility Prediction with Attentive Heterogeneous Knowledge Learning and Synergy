Job-market mobility prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing human capital usage for both employees and employers. Most conventional methods primarily focus on learning sequential career sequences while ignoring the sufficient information extraction of mutual entity correlations in the job market. In this work, we push forward to exploit the heterogeneous relational knowledge among the job market structures by proposing a model namely Attentive Heterogeneous Knowledge Learning and Synergy (AHKLS). Equipped with the subsequent module of time-aware perception, AHKLS achieves effective career trajectory encoding for job-market mobility prediction. To evaluate the AHKLS performance, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with different sizes. The empirical analyses demonstrate not only the performance superiority of AHKLS over several competing methods, but also the module effectiveness and model compatibility with other methods in enhancing the mobility prediction tasks accordingly.
