Multi-behavior recommendation (MBR) aims at predicting the items that the user will interact with at the next moment through the target behavior. Most existing MBR models are devoted to designing novel graph convolutional networks to combine multi-behavioral information. However, they ignore the negative impact of auxiliary behaviours, and also fail to take into account the effects of item characteristics. These limitations can lead to model performance degradation and affect user satisfaction. To address these issues, we propose a Knowledge-enhanced Dynamic Modeling framework for Multi-Behavior Recommendation (KDMBR). The algorithm utilises a multi-behavioral interaction module and a knowledge graph module to capture the user's overall interest and feature information respectively. The former designs a behavior-aware attention to distinguish contributions between behaviors. The latter introduces KG to enrich item characteristics and proposes a graph reconstruction strategy to enrich user information. Experiments on two large datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of KDMBR.
