Recent studies highlight the potential of large language models (LLMs) to enhance content integration in recommender systems by leveraging their semantic understanding capabilities. However, directly incorporating LLMs into an online inference pipeline significantly increases computation costs for large-scale deployment, posing a practical challenge in balancing their benefits and costs. In this work, we propose the EASE framework, which enriches and aligns semantic feature embeddings using LLMs during the training phase while establishing a lightweight inference pipeline that does not directly involve LLMs. Specifically, we train a semantic adapter to align item features with LLMs and simultaneously enrich semantic embeddings through reconstruction tasks from LLMs. During inference, we retain only the item feature encoder and lightweight semantic adapter, thereby eliminating the computation overhead of resource-intensive LLMs. Our EASE framework is flexible, supporting not only text and visual features but also other pre-processed embedding features. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate that enriching semantic feature embeddings with our EASE framework yields consistent improvements in downstream click-through rate prediction tasks.
