In real-time bidding systems, ad exchanges and supply-side platforms (SSP) are switching from the second-price auction (SPA) to the first-price auction (FPA), where the advertisers should pay what they bid if they win the auction. To avoid overpaying, advertisers are motivated to conceal their truthful evaluations of impression opportunities through bid shading methods. However, advertisers are consistently facing a trade-off between the probability and cost-saving of winning, due to the information asymmetry, where advertisers lack knowledge about their competitors' bids in the market. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayes ian Multi-Armed Bandit (BayesMAB) algorithm for bid shading when the winning price is unknown to advertisers who lose the impression opportunity. BayesMAB incorporates the mechanism of FPA to infer each price interval's winning rate by progressively updating the market price hidden by SSP. In this way, BayesMAB better approximates the winning rates of price intervals and thus is able to derive the optimal shaded bid that balances the trade-off between the probability and cost-saving of winning the impression opportunity. We conducted large-scale A/B tests on Tencent's online display advertising platform. The cost-per-mile (CPM) and cost-per-action (CPA) decreased by 13.06% and 11.90%, respectively, whereas the return on investment (ROI) increased by 12.31% with only 2.7% sacrifice of the winning rate. We also validated BayesMAB's superior performance in an offline semi-simulated experiment with SPA data sets. BayesMAB has been deployed online and is impacting billions of traffic every day.
