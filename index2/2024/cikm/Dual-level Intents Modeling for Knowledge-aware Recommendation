Previous user-item interaction graphs have typically focused on simple interaction between users and items, failing to identify the important effects of user's intents in the interaction. While recent studies have ventured into exploring intent relationships between users and items for modeling, they predominantly emphasize user preferences manifesting in the interaction, overlooking knowledge-driven insight, thereby limiting the interpretability of intent. In this paper, we utilize the rich interpretable knowledge information in the knowledge graph to design a novel dual-level intents modeling framework called DIM. DIM aims to mine user's true intents, which usually include user popularity preference and personalized preference. Therefore, we extract both the popular and personalized user preferences from attribute tuples within the knowledge graph at the global and local levels, respectively. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of DIM over various state-of-the-art approaches.
