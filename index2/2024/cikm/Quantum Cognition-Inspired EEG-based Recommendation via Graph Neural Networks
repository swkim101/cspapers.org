Current recommendation systems recommend goods by considering users' historical behaviors, social relations, ratings, and other multi-modals. Although outdated user information presents the trends of a user's interests, no recommendation system can know the users' real-time thoughts indeed. With the development of brain-computer interfaces, it is time to explore next-generation recommenders that show users' real-time thoughts without delay. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising method of collecting brain signals because of its convenience and mobility. Currently, there is only few research on EEG-based recommendations due to the complexity of learning human brain activity. To explore the utility of EEG-based recommendation, we propose a novel neural network model, QUARK, combining Quantum Cognition Theory and Graph Convolutional Networks for accurate item recommendations. Compared with the state-of-the-art recommendation models, the superiority of QUARK is confirmed via extensive experiments.
