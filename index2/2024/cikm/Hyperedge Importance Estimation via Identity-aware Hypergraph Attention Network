Hypergraphs provide a more flexible representation for group interactions in complex systems compared to ordinary graphs, where each hyperedge can connect any number of nodes. In practice, data modeled as hypergraphs often contain hyperedge importance values, which indicate the influence or popularity of the group collaborations. For example, in a co-authorship hypergraph, a paper (hyperedge) is co-authored by multiple authors (nodes). The number of citations a paper receives can be regarded as the importance value of its corresponding hyperedge, reflecting its academic influence and significance. In this work, we introduce hyperedge importance estimation as a new problem in hypergraph learning. The flexibility of hyperedges enables hypergraph modeling to capture high-order relationships between entities, which has attracted widespread attention. The importance value of hyperedge has also been proven to be highly valuable in many applications. To address this problem, we propose the Identity-aware Hypergraph Attention Network (ID-HAN) for efficient hyperedge importance estimation. ID-HAN~employs a special attention mechanism to model the importance contribution of each node within the hyperedge, which injects identity information according to the hyperedge-dependent node labels. Additionally, a centrality-aware positional encoding module generates learnable positional embeddings of nodes and hyperedges based on the relative order of degree centrality and identity information, thereby enhancing the consistency between message passing and importance propagation. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ID-HAN~significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks on the hyperedge importance estimation task.
