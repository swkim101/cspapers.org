The prevalence of check fraud, particularly with stolen checks sold on platforms such as Telegram, creates significant challenges for both individuals and financial institutions. This underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions to detecting and preventing such fraud on social media platforms. While deep learning techniques show great promise in detecting objects and extracting information from images, their effectiveness in addressing check fraud is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, open-source, large training datasets specifically for check information extraction. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces "CheckGuard," a large labeled image-to-text cross-modal dataset designed for check information extraction. CheckGuard comprises over 7,000 real-world stolen check image segments from more than 15 financial institutions, featuring a variety of check styles and layouts. These segments have been manually labeled, resulting in over 50,000 samples across seven key elements: Drawer, Payee, Amount, Date, Drawee, Routing Number, and Check Number. This dataset supports various tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) on checks and check image captioning. Our paper details the rigorous data collecting, cleaning, and annotation processes that make CheckGuard a valuable resource for researchers in check fraud detection, machine learning, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We not only benchmark state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on this dataset to assess their performance but also explore potential enhancements. Our application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques on the SOTA MLLMs demonstrates significant performance improvements, providing valuable insights and practical approaches for enhancing model efficacy on this task. As an evolving project, CheckGuard will continue to be updated with new data, enhancing its utility and driving further advancements in the field.
