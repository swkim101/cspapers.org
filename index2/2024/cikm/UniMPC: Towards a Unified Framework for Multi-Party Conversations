The Multi-Party Conversation (MPC) system has gained attention for its relevance in modern communication. Recent work has focused on developing specialized models for different MPC subtasks, improving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, since MPC demands often arise collaboratively, managing multiple specialized models is impractical. Additionally, dialogue evolves through diverse meta-information, where knowledge from specific subtasks can influence others. To address this, we propose UniMPC, a unified framework that consolidates common MPC subtasks. UniMPC uses a graph network with utterance nodes, a global node for combined local and global information, and two adaptable free nodes. It also incorporates discourse parsing to enhance model updates. We introduce MPCEval, a new benchmark for evaluating MPC systems. Experiments show UniMPC achieves over 95% of SOTA performance across all subtasks, with some surpassing existing SOTA, highlighting the effectiveness of the global node, free nodes, and dynamic discourse-aware graphs.
