With the rapid development of the mobile internet, there is an increasing demand for quick access to effective data. Consequently, more research is focusing on data processing and optimization of recommendation systems in edge computing environments. However, in traditional edge computing environments, recommendation systems typically depend on frequent data query interactions among all edge servers to obtain results, which increases time delays. This issue is further exacerbated by the need to process large amounts of data within edge storage systems. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient recommendation method based on data allocation. Specifically, during the data allocation process, we first extract similar features of users, ensuring that the characteristics of some user data align as closely as possible with the overall user feature distribution. Then, using an improved consistent hashing algorithm, we achieve a uniform data layout, allowing the recommendation system to efficiently and accurately provide recommendations by querying data from the nearest edge server to the user. Finally, extensive experiments on real datasets show that our method significantly reduces time delays and improves the accuracy of recommendation results.
