The way research and business manage and utilize knowledge is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Deep learning and machine learning are emerging as powerful tools for optimizing knowledge management systems, leading to more informed and productive development. AI offers unique solutions for organizations struggling with information overload and inefficient knowledge transfer. These AI models can significantly improve data management and utilization. Imagine an AI-powered system that streamlines onboarding processes, provides precise answers to various queries, and even captures the valuable tacit knowledge (implicit skills and expertise) often residing within individuals. AI bridges the gap between explicit knowledge (easily documented information) and tacit knowledge, fostering a more comprehensive and accessible knowledge base. However, such AI systems solicit trustworthy and responsible approaches to mitigate potential misuse and malfunction. In this workshop, we aim to gather researchers and engineers from academia and industry to discuss the latest advances in trustworthy and responsible AI solutions for information and knowledge management systems.
