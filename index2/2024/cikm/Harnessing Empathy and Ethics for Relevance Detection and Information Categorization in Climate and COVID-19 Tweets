In this work, we aim to understand the general public perception of societal issues related to the current climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter (X). Social media discussions on such matters often lead to misleading information, resulting in delays in initiatives proposed by governments or policymakers. Hence, we focus on extracting relevant information from the conversations on climate change and COVID that could be useful for authorities to curb the spread of potentially biased information by proposing the classification tasks of relevance detection (RD) and information categorization (IC). We first curate the datasets for the RD and IC tasks for the climate domain and extend the COVID-19 benchmark attention-worthy Twitter dataset for the IC task through manual annotation. We initially conduct experiments with LLMs and observe that LLMs can extract the relevant information in zero and few-shot settings based on multi-perspective reasoning in the form of cognitive empathy and ethical standards, but still perform worse than fine-tuned small language models. Based on the initial findings, we conclude that LLMs may not be the best extractor of relevant information, but induce cognitive empathy and ethical reasonings that can intuitively guide supervised models. To achieve this idea, we develop a cognitive empathy and ethical reasoning-based multi-tasking pipelined network for RD and IC tasks. Our proposed approach provides valuable insights that could be useful in real-world scenarios for governments, policymakers, and other researchers to decode the overall public outlook on societal issues.
