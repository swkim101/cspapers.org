Graph-based Recommendation Systems (GRSs) have gained prominence for their ability to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of recommender systems by exploiting structural relationships in user-item interaction data. Despite their advanced capabilities, we find GRSs are susceptible to feedback-loop phenomena that disproportionately diminish the visibility of new and long-tail items, leading to a homogenization of recommendations and the potential emergence of echo chambers. To mitigate this feedback-loop issue, exploration and exploitation (E&E) strategies have been extensively researched. However, conventional E&E methods rest on the assumption that recommendations are independent and identically distributed-an assumption that is not valid for GRSs. To forge an effective E&E approach tailored to GRSs, we introduce a novel framework, the GRADient-informed Exploration and Exploitation (GRADE), designed to adaptively seek out underrepresented or new items with promising rewards. Our method evaluates the potential benefit of exploring an item by assessing the change in the system's empirical risk error pre- and post-exposure. For practical implementation, we approximate this measure using the gradients of potential edges and model parameters, alongside their associated uncertainties. We then orchestrate the balance between exploration and exploitation utilizing Thompson sampling and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy. Empirical tests on datasets from two industrial environments demonstrate that GRADE consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our approach has been successfully integrated into actual industrial systems.
