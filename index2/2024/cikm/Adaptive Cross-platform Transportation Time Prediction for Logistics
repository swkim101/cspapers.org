Accurate prediction of order transportation time is essential for customer satisfaction in logistics. Existing methods based on origin-destination (OD) pairs do not consider the diversity of road segments, while route-based methods may fail to account for real-time traffic conditions due to the infrequent dispatch schedules of logistics vehicles. In reality, e-commerce platforms have collaborated with multiple logistics companies for parcel delivery, providing a richer dataset that offers a more comprehensive view of real-time transportation conditions. The key insight is that data from one company can serve as internal capability detectors and data from others can act as external environment detectors. However, a significant challenge arises in inferring travel-time-correlated station pairs across different companies, especially without full disclosure of station information. To address this, we design an Adaptive cross-platform Transportation time prediction framework built upon a hypergraph structure, named AdaTrans, comprising: i) A spatial-temporal routing graph learner employs node-centric and edge-centric hyperedges to address the complex, non-pairwise correlations among stations and station pairs within and across companies; ii) A spatial-temporal graph-based transportation time predictor that utilizes multi-task learning to enhance overall transportation time prediction by leveraging the correlations between interconnected sub-tasks (i.e., dwell and travel times prediction) Extensive evaluation with real-world data collected from JD.com, a leading e-commerce platform in China, demonstrates that consolidating records from other companies reduces RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 12.63%, 5.18%, and 16.67%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.
