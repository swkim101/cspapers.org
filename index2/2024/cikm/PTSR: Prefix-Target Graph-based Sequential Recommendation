Sequential recommendation approaches predict the next items (targets) by analyzing prefix subsequences. These methods primarily model the correlations between prefixes and targets but often neglect the inherent correlations among prefixes and items. In this paper, we propose a Prefix-Target Graph-based Sequential Recommendation Approach (PTSR), which constructs a prefix-target graph (PTG) to collect observed correlations among prefixes and targets. It utilizes a graph neural network to model these inherent correlations, thus improving the item representations used in the predictive model. Specifically, prefixes linked to the same target reflect similar intents, while targets linked to the same prefix indicate available choices. This allows the graph neural network to effectively capture high-level correlations among prefixes and items, enhancing recommendation accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of PTSR compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequential recommendation methods.
