Vertical partitioning is a crucial physical design strategy in databases that enhances data management and retrieval through optimal data placement. However, current research often overlooks the use of query predicates for effective data block allocation, resulting in potential performance bottlenecks. Moreover, selecting an appropriate partitioning technique based solely on historical experimental results from research articles is challenging due to variability in storage devices, evaluation metrics, and database schemas. We propose PARS to address these issues by offering end-to-end input/output, customizable database configurations, and prioritized optimization objectives to aid database administrators (DBAs) in making informed partitioning decisions. Additionally, PARS introduces a novel algorithm that leverages both numeric and non-numeric query predicates to partition the tablespace into finer data blocks, reducing query latency by 36.1% when benchmarked against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.
