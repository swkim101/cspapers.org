Human beings aspire for a better life. Financial well-being enables this. However, lack of financial literacy, ever-growing wealth inequality, and persuading illicit information floating in social media inhibit one's progress towards a good fortune. In this paper, we discuss four pillars where Natural Language Processing can help improve financial literacy, reduce wealth disparity, ensure a sustainable future, and economic prosperity. These pillars are: Inclusive investing, Improved investing, Impactful (green) investing, and Informed investing. Additionally, we focus to specifically cater to the Indian market (Indic investing) and present several resources to enhance comprehensibility of financial texts. Inclusive investing deals with enhancing the readability and reachability of financial texts. Improved investing addresses the need to simplify investors' journey by providing them with hypernyms and relations between entities. Impactful investing is associated with focusing on sustainable pathways. Improved investing is about eradicating finance related misinformation from social media, like evaluating trustworthiness of posts by executives, detecting in-claim and exaggerated numerals, etc. In most cases, we are able to demonstrate the efficacies of our approaches by benchmarking them with existing state-of-the-art methods.
