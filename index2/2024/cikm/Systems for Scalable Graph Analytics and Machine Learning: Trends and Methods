Graph-theoretic algorithms and graph machine learning models are essential tools for addressing many real-life problems, such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. To support large-scale graph analytics, graph-parallel systems have been actively developed for over one decade, such as Google’s Pregel and Spark’s GraphX, which (i) promote a think-like-a-vertex computing model and target (ii) iterative algorithms and (iii) those problems that output a value for each vertex. However, this model is too restricted for supporting the rich set of heterogeneous operations for graph analytics and machine learning that many real applications demand.
