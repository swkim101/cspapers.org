Molecular property prediction stands as a cornerstone task in AI-driven drug design and discovery, wherein the atoms within a molecule serve as nodes, collectively forming a graph with bonds acting as edges. Given the crucial role of geometric structures in molecular property prediction, the integration of 3D information with various graph learning methods has been explored to enhance prediction performance. Despite the increasing adoption of the â€œGraph pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm to refine molecular representations, a significant challenge persists due to the mis-alignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from prompt tuning techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), several graph prompt-based methods have emerged. However, existing approaches tend to overlook the unique properties inherent in molecular graphs. To address this gap, our paper introduces a novel approach named 3D MO lecul A rpromp T ( MOAT ) designed specifically for geometric molecules. Specifically, we propose atom-level prompts to capture atom distribution, geometry-level prompts tailored for molecular conformers, where different conformations have distinct chemical properties, and task-level prompts to leverage functional group properties. Results on both 3D and 2D downstream tasks demonstrate its ability to successfully bridge the data gap across diverse settings. To the best of our
