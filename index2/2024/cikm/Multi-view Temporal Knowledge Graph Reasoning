Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning is a crucial task that aims to predict future facts based on historical information. In the process of reasoning over TKGs, we identify two types of facts that need to be predicted: 1) recurring facts and 2) unknown facts. While existing models emphasize reasoning about recurring facts, they inadvertently overlook the importance of unknown facts. To make better predictions on both facts, we introduce a novel TKG reasoning model, named Multi-view Recurrent Network (MV-NET), which generates different views to capture reasoning patterns for both recurring and unknown facts. Specifically, MV-NET comprises three views: a recurring history view that captures repetitive features, an exploring history view that focuses on exploring new information for unknown facts, and a full history view that assimilates historical information comprehensively. Then, the historical information of each view is encoded by a multi-view recurrent network. To better integrate the embeddings of three views, we employ an adaptive scoring module, which consists of a query-aware attentive fusion mechanism to incorporate the predicted scores from three views, thus obtaining fused scores for prediction. Extensive experiments on three commonly used datasets demonstrate the superiority of MV-NET compared to many state-of-the-art baselines.
