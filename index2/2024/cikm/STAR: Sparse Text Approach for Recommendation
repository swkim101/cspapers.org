In this work we propose to adapt Learned Sparse Retrieval, an emerging approach in IR, to text-centric content-based recommendations, leveraging the strengths of transformer models for an efficient and interpretable user-item matching. We conduct extensive experiments, showing that our LSR-based recommender, dubbed STAR, outperforms existing dense bi-encoder baselines on three recommendation domains. The obtained word-level representations of users and items are easy to examine and result in over 10x more compact indexes.
