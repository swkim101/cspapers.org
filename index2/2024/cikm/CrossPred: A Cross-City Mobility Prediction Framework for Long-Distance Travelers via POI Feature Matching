Current studies mainly rely on overlapping users (who leave trajectories in both cities) as a medium to learn travelers' preference in the target city, however it is unrealistic to find overlapping users when two cities are far apart, thus a severe data scarcity issue exists for this problem. Besides, due to the mixture of mobility pattern from both cities, directly applying the model trained in the source city may lead to negative transfer in the target city. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we conceive and implement a novel framework called CrossPred to predict the cross-city mobility of long-distance travelers in the target city. Specifically, POI features including popularity, textual description, spatial distribution as well as sequential pattern are considered for cross-city POI matching, which further acts as a vital link for jointly modeling native user mobility preference in both source and target cities. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is adopted to strengthen the shared POI features among cities and weaken the unique POI features, thereby promoting cross-city POI feature matching. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.
