Trajectory data is a valuable asset for service management and spatio-temporal mining in transportation and logistics systems. However, due to equipment failure, network delay, and energy constraints, some trajectory point may be missed, which makes it difficult for trajectory-based management. Some researchers have focused on recovering sparse trajectories from road networks and historical trajectory data, but these methods are ineffective when the road network is incomplete. Recent research works have explored learning-based methods to recover trajectories in free space but lack user movement behavior modeling and efficient feature extraction on sparse long-range trajectories. Our work exploits the periodic behavior of couriers and fine-grained Area of Interest (AOI) data for sparse trajectory recovery in last-mile delivery. However, we face challenges with AOI access sequence deviations due to GPS inaccuracies and abnormal courier behaviors, as well as the complex, dynamic relationships within and between courier routes due to uncertain pick-up demands. To address these challenges, we design a graph-based multi-task learning framework, focusing on multi-scale attention fusion for end-to-end free space trajectory recovery. Our approach starts with a behavior-aware graph network that generates detailed spatial features. Following this, we propose a multi-scale attention fusion mechanism to extract intra- and inter-trajectory features. Finally, we design a multi-task learning module that predicts both coarse-grained spatial access sequences and fine-grained trajectory points. We evaluate the model with six-month data involved with more than 360,000 trajectory segments and more than 7.2 million waybills collected from one of the largest logistic companies in China. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts in multiple metrics.
