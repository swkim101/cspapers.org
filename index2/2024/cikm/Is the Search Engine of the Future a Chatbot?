The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a huge impact on the interaction of users with information. Many people argue that the age of search engines as we know them has ended, while other people argue that retrieval technology is more relevant than ever before, because we need information to be grounded in sources. In my talk I will argue that both statements are true. I will discuss the multiple relations between LLMs and Information Retrieval: how can they strengthen each other, what are the challenges we face, and what directions should we go in our research?
