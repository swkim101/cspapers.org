Autonomous vehicles make decisions and controls based on various object recognition results. The driving environment is characterized by the coexistence of a multitude of objects of varying shapes and sizes. Therefore, the ability to accurately recognise fine-grained objects is essential for accurate object recognition in a variety of changing situations. For object detection, the autonomous vehicle performs bounding box and segmentation to provide the detected object information. However, bounding box and segmentation based object detection has difficulties in identifying objects with complex shapes, small or distant objects, and it is hard to distinguish and detect objects with similar colors to the background or similar colors and textures to surrounding objects. This has limitations for reliable object identification in autonomous driving environments containing a variety of objects, which is a challenge for clear criteria-based object avoidance and collision protection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Edge-Adaptive Depth Estimation(EADE). EADE, the combination of edge extraction and depth estimation, enables detailed edge extraction and partial distance estimation of objects even in environments where object shape and size, surrounding objects, and backgrounds make it difficult to recognise distinct objects, which allows for reliable autonomous decision-making and control based on detailed object collision and avoidance criteria. To validate EADE, experiments were conducted with real-world driving environment image data. The results of EADE demonstrate that detailed object recognition is possible with clear edge recognition and estimation of object distance, even for complex shaped objects such as trees with branches in multiple directions, distant objects, and objects that are difficult to distinguish from the background such as curbs.
