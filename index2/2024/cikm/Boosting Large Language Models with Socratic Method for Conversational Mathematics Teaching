With the introduction of large language models (LLMs), automatic math reasoning has seen tremendous success. However, current methods primarily focus on providing solutions or using techniques like Chain-of-Thought to enhance problem-solving accuracy. In this paper, we focus on improving the capability of mathematics teaching via a Socratic teaching-based LLM (\texttt{SocraticLLM}), which guides learners toward profound thinking with clarity and self-discovery via conversation. We collect and release a high-quality mathematical teaching dataset, named \texttt{SocraticMATH}, which provides Socratic-style conversations of problems with extra knowledge. Also, we propose a knowledge-enhanced LLM as a strong baseline to generate reliable responses with review, guidance/heuristic, rectification, and summarization. Experimental results show the great advantages of \texttt{SocraticLLM} by comparing it with several strong generative models.
