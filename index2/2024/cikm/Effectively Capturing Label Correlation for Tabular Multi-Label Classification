Multi-label data is prevalent across various applications, where instances can be annotated with a set of classes. Although multi-label data can take various forms, such as images and text, tabular multi-label data stands out as the predominant data type in many real-world scenarios. Over the past decades, numerous methods have been proposed for tabular multi-label classification. Effectively addressing challenges like class imbalance, correlation among labels and features, and scalability is crucial for a high-performance multi-label classifier. However, many existing methods fall short of fully considering the correlation between labels and features. In cases where attempts are made, they often encounter high computational costs, rendering them impractical for large datasets. This paper in- troduces an innovative classification method for tabular multi-label data, utilizing a fusion of transformers and graph convolutional networks (GCN). The central concept of the proposed approach involves transforming tabular data into images, leveraging state-of-the-art methods in image processing, including image-based transformers and pre-trained models to capture correlation among labels effectively. Our approach jointly learns the representation of feature space and the correlation among labels within a unified network. To substantiate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted a rigorous series of experiments across diverse multi-label datasets1. The results underscore the superior performance and scalability of our approach compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods. This work not only contributes a novel perspective to the field of tabular multi-label classification but also showcases advancements in both accuracy and scalability.
