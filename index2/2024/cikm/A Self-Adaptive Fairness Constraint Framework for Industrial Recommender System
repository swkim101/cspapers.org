Achieving fairness among different individuals or groups is an essential task for industrial recommender systems. Due to the group's personalized selection tendencies and the non-uniform population distributions, existing industrial recommenders tend to make unfair predictions towards the preferences of minority groups. To alleviate this unfairness, we propose a model-agnostic self-adaptive fairness constraint framework (SaFair) based on the posterior preferences of different groups. We construct group-level and individual-level fairness constraints. The former measures consistency between group-level posterior preferences and predicted interests, and the latter relies on the degree of consistency in interests between a user and their associated group to perform self-adaptive constraints. In particular, to balance effectiveness and fairness, we utilize uncertainty estimation to adjust the intensity of constraints according to the model's learning status called self-adaptive constraints. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B Testing are conducted and the results validate the superiority of our proposed method over the baselines. SaFair has been successfully deployed in Kuaishou, one of China's most popular short-video streaming platforms with hundreds of millions of active users.
