Recommender systems (RSs) are susceptible to Interaction-level Membership Inference Attacks (IMIAs), which aim to determine whether specific user-item interactions are present in the training data of the target RS. However, existing IMIAs struggle with inferring the membership of tail interactions, i.e., the interactions involving tail items, due to the limited information available about these items. This paper introduces MINER, a new IMIA designed to enhance attack performance against RSs with long-tailed item distribution. MINER addresses the information scarcity of tail items at both the feature and sample levels. At the feature level, MINER leverages the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to obtain the auxiliary knowledge of tail items. At the sample level, MINER designs a Bilateral-Branch Network (BBN) as the attack model. The BBN trains two branches independently, with one branch trained on interaction samples with the original long-tailed item distribution and the other on interaction samples with a more balanced item distribution. The outputs of the two branches are aggregated using a cumulative learning component. Our experimental results demonstrate that MINER significantly enhances the attack accuracy of IMIA, especially for tail interactions. Beyond attack design, we design a defense mechanism named RGL to defend against MINER. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RGL effectively mitigates the privacy risks posed by MINER while preserving recommendation accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/dzhong2/MINER.
