This paper introduces Mastodoner, a command-line tool and Python library aimed at simplifying access to public data on Mastodon, a prominent player in the Fediverse --- a decentralized network of interconnected social media platforms. Mastodoner addresses the challenges posed by Mastodon's decentralized nature by providing a unified interface for data collection, instance discovery, and secure data sharing. Through examples and demonstrations, this paper illustrates Mastodoner's capabilities in facilitating researchers' access to and analysis of public Mastodon data, thus advancing research in decentralized social media analytics.
