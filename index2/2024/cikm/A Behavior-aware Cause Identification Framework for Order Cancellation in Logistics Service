Logistics platforms provide real-time door-to-door order pickup services to enhance customer convenience. However, a high volume of unexpected order cancellations negatively impacts both customer satisfaction and logistics profitability. Identifying whether these cancellations are due to customers' decisions or couriers' behaviors is crucial for implementing targeted operational improvements. While traditional methods directly interpret customer-courier dialogues, incorporating situational context (e.g., couriers' historical performance and current workloads) helps us to accurately understand the hidden content. The main challenges lie in dynamically correlating couriers' varying behaviors with dialogue content. To tackle this challenge, we develop COCO, a cause identification framework for order cancellation in logistics, which includes: i) Multi-modal features exploration, which analyzes dialogues and couriers' behaviors (both historical and current); ii) Multi-modal features aggregation, which uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively capture the dynamic correlations within dialogues and behaviors; iii) LLM-enhanced refinement, which leverages Large Language Models to accurately process a large number of unlabeled dialogues, significantly enhancing COCO's generalization and performance. Our extensive evaluation with JD Logistics demonstrates COCO's exceptional performance, achieving an 12.2% increase in precision and a 9.1% improvement in recall over existing methods. Furthermore, after deploying COCO at JD Logistics, it has achieved an accuracy of 89.5%, further demonstrating its practical utility.
