Federated recommender systems are used to address privacy issues in recommendations. Among them, FedVAE extends the representative non-linear recommendation method MultVAE. However, the bottleneck of FedVAE lies in its communication load during training, as the parameter volume of its first and last layers is correlated with the number of items. This leads to significant communication cost during the model's transmission phases (distribution and upload), making FedVAE's implementation extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Federated Variational AutoEncoder for collaborative filtering, EFVAE, which core is the Federated Collaborative Importance Sampling (FCIS) method. FCIS reduces communication costs through a client-to-server collaborative sampling mechanism and provides satisfactory recommendation performance through dynamic multi-stage approximation of the decoding distribution. Extensive experiments and analyses on real-world datasets confirm that EFVAE significantly reduces communication costs by up to 94.51% while maintaining the recommendation performance. Moreover, its recommendation performance is better on sparse datasets, with improvements reaching up to 13.79%.
