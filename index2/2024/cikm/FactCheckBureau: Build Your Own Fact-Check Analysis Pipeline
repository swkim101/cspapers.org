Fact-checkers are overwhelmed by the volume of claims they need to pay attention to fight misinformation. Even once debunked, a claim may still be spread by people unaware that it is false, or it may be recycled as a source of inspiration by malicious users. Hence, the importance of fact-check (FC) retrieval as a research problem: given a claim and a database of previous checks, find the checks relevant to the claim. Existing solutions addressing this problem rely on the strategy of retrieve and re-rank relevant documents. We have built FactCheckBureau , an end-to-end solution that enables researchers to easily and interactively design and evaluate FC retrieval pipelines. We also present a corpus 1 we have built, which can be used in further research to test fact-check retrieval tools. The source code of our tool is available at this link 2 .
