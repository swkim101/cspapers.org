The surge in merchant fraud poses a significant threat to market order and consumer security. Effective security monitoring for merchants is crucial in safeguarding the digital life ecosystem and users' financial well-being. Detecting daily fraudulent payment transactions, a challenging task for current methods, requires efficient transformation of transactions into embeddings, especially in representing merchants based on their behavioral transactions. To address this, we propose the Grouping Sampling-based Sequence Generation (GSSG) method to generate meaningful sequences, enabling interactions among correlated transactions. We introduce Hierarchical Embedding Learning (HEL) and Hierarchical Masking pre-training (HMP) for the effective representation of hierarchical structures within flat transaction sequences. Pretrained on WeChat Pay data, our model, PTP, demonstrates superior performance in downstream fraud transaction detection, especially in few-shot learning scenarios, showcasing great potential in payment transaction scenarios.
