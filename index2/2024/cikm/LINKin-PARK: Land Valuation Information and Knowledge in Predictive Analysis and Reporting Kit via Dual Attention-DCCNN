We present LINKin-PARK, an innovative system that seamlessly merges geographic visualization with an advanced Dual Attention Double Channel Convolutional Neural Network with Multilayer Perceptron (Dual Attention-DCCNN+MLP) to facilitate the efficient analysis of land valuation. LINKin-PARK provides robust visualization capabilities for intuitive comprehension. Our model outperforms traditional methods, e.g., linear regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the combination of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with MLP. An ablation study further evaluates the influence of specific components within the model, revealing that spatial and channel-wise attention mechanisms and the integration of DCCNN and skip connections are crucial for capturing spatial details and improving prediction accuracy. Users have the flexibility to explore and predict developable land valuation based on their specific requirements and provide their feedback to minimize errors in model prediction. For instance, this system can forecast future development potential and market demand for everywhere in an urban space, enabling users to make informed decisions before purchasing a property. Similarly, retailers can anticipate future revenues to aid in strategic decisions, such as selecting optimal locations for establishing new retail outlets. In summary, LINKin-PARK effectively combines geographic visualization and Dual Attention-DCCNN+MLP to assist users in analyzing and predicting land valuation and other scenarios.
