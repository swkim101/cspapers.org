Knowledge Graph Question Generation (KGQG) is the task of generating natural language questions based on the given knowledge graph (KG). Although extensively explored in recent years, prevailing models predominantly depend on labelled data for training deep learning models or employ large parametric frameworks, e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs), which can incur significant deployment costs and pose practical implementation challenges. To address these issues, in this work, we put forward a zero-shot, multi-agent KGQG framework. This framework integrates the capabilities of LLMs with small models to facilitate cost-effective, high-quality question generation. In specific, we develop a professional editorial team architecture accompanied by two workflow optimization tools to reduce unproductive collaboration among LLMs-based agents and enhance the robustness of the system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework derives the new state-of-the-art performance on the zero-shot KGQG tasks, with relative gains of 20.24% and 13.57% on two KGQG datasets, respectively, which rival fully supervised state-of-the-art models.
