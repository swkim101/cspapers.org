As the capabilities of smart sensing and mobile technologies continue to evolve and expand, storing diverse sensor data on smartphones and cloud servers becomes increasingly challenging. Effective data compression is crucial to alleviate these storage pressures. Compressed sensing (CS) offers a promising approach, but traditional CS methods often struggle with the unique characteristics of sensor data-like variability, dynamic changes, and different sampling rates-leading to slow processing and poor reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we developed Mob-ISTA-1DNet, an innovative CS framework that integrates deep learning with the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to adaptively compress and reconstruct smartphone sensor data. This framework is designed to manage the complexities of smartphone sensor data, ensuring high-quality reconstruction across diverse conditions. We developed a mobile application to collect data from 30 volunteers over one month, including accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, and other sensor measurements. Comparative analysis reveals that Mob-ISTA-1DNet not only enhances reconstruction accuracy but also significantly reduces processing time, consistently outperforming other methods in various scenarios.
