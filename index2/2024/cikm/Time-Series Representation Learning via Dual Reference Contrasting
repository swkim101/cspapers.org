The inherent complexity of real-world time series data, combined with the cost and infeasibility of manual labeling, presents considerable challenges to time series representation learning. Most existing studies tend to utilize data augmentation techniques to construct positive and negative samples and leverage a comparative learning framework to generate time series representations. However, they typically employ simple data augmentation techniques, such as jitter and cropping, to construct positive samples while randomly selecting irrelevant samples as negative ones, which are easily distinguished and unable to guide comparative learning to capture subtle discriminative features. Furthermore, they usually employ only a single positive sample for comparative learning, which is insufficient to model the diversity and hurts the robustness. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Time Series representation learning framework via Dual Reference Contrasting (TS-DRC). Specifically, we first utilize Markov transition field or Gramian angular field to transform the anchor sample of time series into image representations, which are adopted as positive samples. Then, we incorporate two positive samples (dual references) and one negative sample into the comparative learning framework, and devise a novel optimization objective to guide the model to capture more discriminate features, mitigate overfitting, and enhance the robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on four public real-world datasets demonstrate that our TS-DRC outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.Our code is available at: https://github.com/yurui12138/TS-DRC.
