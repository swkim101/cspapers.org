P-Rank (Penetrating-Rank) is a charming measure of structural similarity between objects based on graph topology. It recursively follows the principle that "two objects are considered similar if (a) they are referenced by similar objects and (b) they reference similar objects''. The best-known algorithm for computing P-Rank employs two repeated Singular Value Decompositions (SVDs) coupled with the Woodbury matrix identity. However, this method does not scale well on billion-sized graphs. Worse yet, this algorithm only provides a linear approximation of the P-Rank model and cannot deliver accurate P-Rank values. In this paper, we propose P-Rank+, a fast and efficient algorithm for computing P-Rank similarities, which scales well on large graphs with billions of edges. P-Rank+ leverages dimensionality reduction techniques by performing only one SVD of the graph integrated with Hadamard products in the reduced subspace. Moreover, we provide provable error guarantees for P-Rank+ computation. Experiments on various datasets validate that P-Rank+ is 1--3 orders of magnitude faster than the best-known competitor while achieving excellent scalability on massive graphs.
