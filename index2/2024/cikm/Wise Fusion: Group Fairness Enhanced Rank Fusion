Rank fusion is a technique for combining multiple rankings into a single aggregated ranking, commonly used in high-stakes applications. For hiring decisions, a fused ranking might combine evaluations of different candidates from various job boards into one list. Ideally, such fused rankings are fair. Meaning they do not withhold opportunities or resources from marginalized groups of candidates, even if such biases may be present in the to-be-fused rankings. Prior work fairly aggregating rankings is limited to ensuring proportional (not addressing equality) fairness when combining ranked lists containing the same candidate items. Yet, real-world fusion tasks often combine rankings of varying candidate sets, may also contain relevance scores, or are better suited to equal representation. To address fairness in these settings, we present a new plug-and-play fairness-aware fusion strategy: WISE fusion. WISE works in fusion settings where we have closed-box access to a score-powered rank fusion (SRF) method, making it possible to fairness-enhance existing fusion pipelines with little added cost. WISE uses existing evaluations of candidates from an as-is SRF method to achieve proportional or equal rank fairness in the final fused ranking. Our experimental study demonstrates that WISE beats the fairness and utility performance of state-of-the-art methods applied to these new fair rank fusion settings.
