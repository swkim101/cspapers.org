The field of information retrieval has significantly transformed with the integration of AI technologies. AI agents, especially those leveraging LLMs and vast computational power, have revolutionized information retrieval, processing, and presentation. LLM agents, with advanced memory, reasoning, and planning capabilities, can perform complex tasks, engage in coherent conversations, and provide personalized responses. Despite these advancements, challenges such as ensuring relevance and accuracy, mitigating biases, providing real-time responses, and maintaining data security remain. This workshop aims to explore these challenges, share innovative solutions, and discuss future directions. It will provide a platform to bring together researchers, practitioners to discuss the latest theoretical advancements and practical implementations of AI agents in information retrieval. Topics include AI in search, recommendation, and personalization systems. By gathering a diverse group of experts, the workshop seeks to deepen the understanding of AI agents in information retrieval, advance the field, and enhance its societal impact. Participants will gain insights into cutting-edge research, emerging trends, and foster knowledge exchange and collaboration within the community.
