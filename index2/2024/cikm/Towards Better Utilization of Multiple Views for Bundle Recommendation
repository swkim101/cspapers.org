Bundle recommender systems aim to recommend suitable collections (i.e., bundles) of items to each user, meeting their diverse needs with all-in-one convenience. Typically, they utilize three distinct types of information: user-bundle purchase interactions (U-B view), user-item purchase interactions (U-I view), and bundle-item affiliations (B-I view). Our focus is on better integrating these three perspectives (i.e., views) to deliver more accurate bundle recommendations. Our examination of different role (main or sub-views) combinations of the views reveals two key observations: (1) the best combination varies across target users (i.e., who receive recommendations), and (2) the U-I view is relatively weak as the main role. Driven by these observations, we propose PET, which synergizes the three views through (1) personalized view weighting, (2) U-I view enhancement, and (3) two-pronged contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PET significantly outperforms existing methods in all popular benchmark datasets. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/K-Kyungho/PET.
