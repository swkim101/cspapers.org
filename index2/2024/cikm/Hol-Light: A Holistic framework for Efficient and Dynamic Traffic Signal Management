Numerous reinforcement learning-based traffic control methods have been proposed to enhance transportation efficiency and alleviate traffic congestion. However, the existing solutions predominantly address only specific facets of the challenge. For instance, some focus on enhancing control performance, while others aim to address control issues within heterogeneous road networks, explore model generalizability, or consider model compression for practical deployment scenarios. The question arises: Can a single approach effectively tackle all these issues concurrently? We propose a holistic framework, Hol-Light, that can effectively solve all these issues. It delves deeply into the feature representations of traffic phase considering the interplay between phase relationships and traffic flow dynamics, and meticulously captures the interphase relationships through an elegantly designed model that is both parameter-efficient and minimal. To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing two well-established traffic simulators: CityFlow and SUMO. The experiment results indicate that our method excels in terms of high performance, rapid training speed, robust generalization capabilities, and adaptability to diverse road network configurations.
