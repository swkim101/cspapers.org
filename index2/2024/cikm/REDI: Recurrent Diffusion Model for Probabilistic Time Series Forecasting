Time series forecasting (TSF) consists of point prediction and probabilistic forecasting. Unlike point forecasting which predicts an expected value of a future target, probabilistic time series forecasting models the uncertainty in data by predicting the distribution of future values, which enhances decision-making flexibility and improves risk management. Traditional probabilistic forecasting methods usually assume a fixed distribution of data, which is not always true for time series. Recently, there have been efforts to adapt diffusion models for time series owing to their exceptional ability to model the distribution of data without prior assumptions. However, how to apply advantages of diffusion models to time series forecasting remains a substantial challenge due to specific issues in time series such as distribution drift and complex dynamic temporal patterns. In this paper, we focus on the adaptation of diffusion models for time series forecasting. We propose REDI, a recurrent diffusion model that achieves effective probabilistic time series prediction with recurrent forward diffusion process and step-aware guidance in backward denoising process. The recurrent forward diffusion process enables the model to pay more attention to the impact of recent history on future values during the diffusion process, while the step-aware guidance facilitates precise guidance based on historical information during the denoising process. We conduct experiments on 5 real-world datasets and achieve average rankings of 1.8 for deterministic metrics and 1.5 for probabilistic metrics across 12 baselines, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of REDI.
