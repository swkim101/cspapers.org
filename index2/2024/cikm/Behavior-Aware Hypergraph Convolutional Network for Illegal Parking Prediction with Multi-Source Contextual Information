Illegal parking prediction is a crucial problem to help stakeholders with better urban planning and management. Existing works advance the field by capturing complex traffic correlations from spatial and temporal perspectives using deep learning models, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, current works do not consider the unique perspective from the illegal parking data collection process carried out by patrol officers, which can reflect a wealth of knowledge gained from each officer's on-the-ground experiences for more effective patrol. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-aware hypergraph convolutional network named BHIPP for city-wide illegal parking prediction. To better represent the correlations of illegal parking events from patrol officers' perspective, we construct a new patrol hypergraph integrating patrol officers' experience alongsie multi-source contextual information. Additionally, we design a behavior-aware hypergraph convolutional network, which captures the complex and high-order illegal parking event correlations with officers' patrol behaviors explicitly considered. Further, we introduce a spatial-temporal illegal parking approximation module to estimate parking violations in under-patrolled regions using both historical and multi-source contextual data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BHIPP compared with a broad range of state-of-the-art baseline models across varying spatial-temporal granularities, from both regression and ranking aspects.
