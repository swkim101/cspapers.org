Item popularity in real-world data follows a long-tail distribution, where a few items attract most of the attention, while the majority receive much less. This disparity results in high-quality embeddings for popular (head) items, but lower-quality embeddings for unpop-ular (tail) items, leading to less accurate recommendations for the latter. Our observations confirm that embeddings of tail items often exhibit (1) magnitudes (i.e., norms) that are less reflective of actual popularity and (2) directions that are less effective in capturing user preferences, compared to those of head items. To address this issue, we propose EDGE, a post-training embedding enhancement method for long-tail recommendations. EDGE employs two key strategies: (1) refining embedding magnitudes to better reflect item popularity and (2) adjusting embedding directions by leveraging knowledge from head items. Importantly, EDGE is model-agnostic and can be applied to embeddings learned from any trained recommender system. Experimental results show that EDGE significantly improves tail item recommendation performance and overall system performance, achieving up to an improvement of 211.23% in NDCG@20 over the state-of-the-art method.
