This paper focuses on the generation of spatiotemporal data from real-world observations to represent the evolution of phenomena of interest as moving regions. The case study is the creation of a dataset to represent the spread of a controlled forest fire from aerial images captured using a drone. We present an overview of the data acquisition and preparation steps and describe the optimization strategy implemented to establish a vertex correspondence between the regions that delimit the burned region at discrete time instants. The resulting dataset is used to create a continuous representation of the evolution of the burned region over time.
