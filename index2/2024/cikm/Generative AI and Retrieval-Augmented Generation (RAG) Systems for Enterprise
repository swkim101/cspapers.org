This workshop introduces generative AI applications for enterprise, with a focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Generative AI is a field of artificial intelligence that can create new content and solve complex problems. RAG systems are a novel generative AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to generate rich and diverse responses. RAG systems can leverage enterprise data, which is often specific, structured, and dynamic, to provide customized solutions for various domains. However, enterprise data also poses challenges such as scalability, security, and data quality. This workshop convenes researchers and practitioners to explore RAG and other generative AI systems in real-world enterprise scenarios, fostering knowledge exchange, collaboration, and identification of future directions. Relevant to the CIKM community, the workshop intersects with core areas of data science and machine learning, offering potential benefits across various domains.
