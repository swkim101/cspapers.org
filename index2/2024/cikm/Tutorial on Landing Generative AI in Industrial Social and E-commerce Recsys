Over the past two years, GAI has evolved rapidly, influencing various fields including social and e-commerce Recsys. Despite exciting advances, landing these innovations in real-world Recsys remains challenging due to the sophistication of modern industrial product and systems. Our tutorial begins with a brief overview of building industrial Recsys and GAI fundamentals, followed by the ongoing efforts and opportunities to enhance personalized recommendations with foundation models. We then explore the integration of curation capabilities into Recsys, such as repurposing raw content, incorporating external knowledge, and generating personalized insights/explanations to foster transparency and trust. Next, the tutorial illustrates how AI agents can transform Recsys through interactive reasoning and action loops, shifting away from traditional passive feedback models. Finally, we shed insights on real-world solutions for human-AI alignment and responsible GAI practices. A critical component of the tutorial is detailing the AI, Infrastructure, LLMOps, and Product roadmap (including the evaluation and responsible AI practices) derived from the production solutions in LinkedIn, Amazon, TikTok, and Microsoft. While GAI in Recsys is still in its early stages, this tutorial provides valuable insights and practical solutions for the Recsys and GAI communities.
