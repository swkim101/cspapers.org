Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses potentially critical health issues for human and animal populations in the near future. To meet this challenge, we need to adopt a "One Health" strategy, which involves studying and linking information from human and animal populations, as well as from the environment. In this demonstration, we present an early prototype of Promise platform, which we are developing for One Health data management and analytics, to enable experts from different fields to gain insights into AMR. It is designed to handle data from 25 academic networks and 42 partners. Our demonstration illustrate the capabilities of our methodology for analyzing these data. The user is freed from considerations related to data heterogeneity, as inter-operability issues are managed by the platform. Additionally, each data provider will be able to stay within his/her own vocabulary, whatever the taxonomy used by other data providers.
