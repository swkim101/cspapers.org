Trajectory similarity computation is a fundamental problem in various applications (e.g., transportation optimization, behavioral study). Recent researches learn trajectory representations instead of point matching to realize more accurate and efficient trajectory similarity computation. However, these methods can still not be scaled to large datasets due to high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel hash learning method to encode the trajectories into binary hash codes and compute trajectory similarities by Hamming distances which is much more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conduct hash learning for trajectory similarity computation. Furthermore, unlike the Word2Vec model based on random walk strategy, we utilize hypergraph neural networks for the first time to learn the representations for the grids by constructing the hyperedges according to the real-life trajectories, resulting in more representative grid embeddings. In addition, we design a residual network into the multi-layer GRU to learn more discriminative trajectory representations. The proposed Hypergraph Hash Learning for Trajectory similarity commutation is an end-to-end framework and named HHL-Traj. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets (i.e., Porto and Beijing) demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 6.23% and 15.42% accuracy gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines in unhashed and hashed cases, respectively. The efficiency of trajectory similarity computation based on hash codes is also verified. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoyuan57/HHL-Traj.
