Identifying disinformation from online social media is crucial for maintaining a credible cyberspace. Although features from the content and propagation topology are widely exploited by existing studies to distinguish disinformation from normal ones, they are becoming less effective as content can be intentionally written to mislead readers and topological features are difficult to be extracted due to the high variance and diversity of reposting trees. Moreover, related works mainly focus on modeling the complete information propagation event, ignoring the staged evolution patterns along with propagation, which may also degrade the detection performance. In this paper, we conceive and implement a novel framework called DMPS for identifying disinformation, which Dynamically Models diverse topological structures of reposting trees as well as the textual content streams across different Propagation Stages. In particular, DMPS learns expressive representations of the structural features via meta-trees and extracts sequential features of the content for intra-stage modeling, then it captures temporal dependencies for inter-stage modeling. The whole framework is optimized in a binary classification manner. Experiments based on multilingual social media datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DMPS over state-of-the-art models. We believe that this study can provide insights for crisis management in response to disinformation in social network campaigns.
