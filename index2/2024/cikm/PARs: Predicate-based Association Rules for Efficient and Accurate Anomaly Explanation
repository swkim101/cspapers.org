While new and effective methods for anomaly detection are frequently introduced, many studies prioritize the detection task without considering the need for explainability. Yet, in real-world applications, anomaly explanation, which aims to provide explanation of why specific data instances are identified as anomalies, is an equally important task. In this work, we present a novel approach for efficient and accurate model-agnostic anomaly explanation for tabular data using Predicate-based Association Rules (PARs). PARs can provide intuitive explanations not only about which features of the anomaly instance are abnormal, but also the reasons behind their abnormality. Our user study indicates that the anomaly explanation form of PARs is better comprehended and preferred by regular users of anomaly detection systems as compared to existing model-agnostic explanation options. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating that PARs compare favorably to state-of-the-art model-agnostic methods in terms of computing efficiency and explanation accuracy on anomaly explanation tasks.
