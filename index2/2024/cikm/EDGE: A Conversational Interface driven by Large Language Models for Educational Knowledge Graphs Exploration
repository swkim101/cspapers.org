As education adopts digital platforms, the vast amount of information from various sources, such as learning management systems and learning object repositories, presents challenges in navigation and elaboration. Traditional interfaces involve a steep learning curve, limited user accessibility, and lack flexibility. Language models alone cannot address these issues as they do not have access to structured information specific to the educational organization. In this paper, we propose EDGE (EDucational knowledge Graph Explorer), a natural language interface that uses knowledge graphs to organize educational information. EDGE translates natural language requests into queries and converts the results back into natural language responses. We show EDGE's versatility using knowledge graphs built from public datasets, providing example interactions of different stakeholders. Demo video: https://u.garr.it/eYq63.
