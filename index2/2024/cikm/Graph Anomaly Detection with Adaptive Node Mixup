Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to find network elements (e.g., nodes, edges) with significantly atypical patterns and has a profound impact in a variety of application domains, including social network analysis, security, Web, finance, and many more. Most of the existing methods have been developed in an unsupervised manner or with extremely limited supervision, due to the high cost of acquiring ground-truth information. Consequently, the identified anomalies may turn out to be noises or uneventful instances because of the lack of prior knowledge on graph anomalies. To address the data scarcity issue in GAD, in this paper, we propose, gADAM, a novel graph neural network-based GAD framework, which consolidates (1) an innovative mixup approach to augment the original training data by adaptively interpolating data instances in the embedding space, and (2) an efficacious sampling method to obtain high-quality negative samples for model training. Additionally, to advance the representation learning for GAD, we further equip the proposed framework with a generic prototype-based learning module. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we corroborate the superiority of the proposed gADAM framework on graph anomaly detection w.r.t. various metrics.
