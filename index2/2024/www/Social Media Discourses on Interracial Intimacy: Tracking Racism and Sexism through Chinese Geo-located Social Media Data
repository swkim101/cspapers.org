We examine the social media discourse surrounding interracial relationships in China, specifically on the popular platform Douyin. By analyzing comments on short video posts, the study focuses on four types of interracial relationships: Black men and Chinese women, Black women and Chinese men, White men and Chinese women, and White women and Chinese men. The study also explores potential regional differences in these discourses, using IP geolocation data made available to the public since April 2022. Our content analysis revealed that the Black men and Chinese women couples attracted the most negative comments and the White women and Chinese men couples received the least negative comments. We also observed substantial regional differences in the discourses towards these interracial relationships. We investigated several regional socioeconomic development indicators and noted that local GDP, population sizes, and the level of openness to Western cultures explained the variation in the negative sentiment level. This work advances our understanding of the interplay of race, gender, and immigration in constructing public discourses on social media and offers important insights into how these discourses evolve along with socioeconomic development.
