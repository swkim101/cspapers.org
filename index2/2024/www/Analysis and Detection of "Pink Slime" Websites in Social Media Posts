Local news outlets play a vital role in providing trusted and relevant information to communities and addressing their specific needs and concerns. The emergence of news outlets posing as local sources and their spread on social media present a significant challenge in the digital information landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive study investigating posts featuring "pink slime'' news, which is a term that has been used to refer to these news outlets due to its deceptive nature. By analyzing a large dataset of posts, we gain valuable insights into the patterns of these posts and the origin of these posts. We show in this work that extracting syntactical features proves valuable in developing a classification approach for detecting such posts and that the approach achieves 92.5% accuracy. We also show that our approach achieves near-perfect detection when grouping the posts by URL.
