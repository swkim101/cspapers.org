Real-world graphs exhibit diverse structures, including homophilic and heterophilic patterns, necessitating the development of a universal Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) framework. Nonetheless, the existing GCLs, especially those with a local focus, lack universality due to the mismatch between the input graph structure and the homophily assumption for two primary components of GCLs. Firstly, the encoder, commonly Graph Convolution Network (GCN), operates as a low-pass filter, which assumes the input graph to be homophilic. This makes it challenging to aggregate features from neighbor nodes of the same class on heterophilic graphs. Secondly, the local positive sampling regards neighbor nodes as positive samples, which is inspired by the homophily assumption. This results in feature similarity amplification for the samples from the different classes (i.e., FALSE positive samples). Therefore, it is crucial to feed the encoder and positive sampling of GCLs with homophilic graph structures. This paper presents a novel GCL framework, named gRaph cOntraStive Exploring uNiversality (ROSEN), designed to achieve this objective. Specifically, ROSEN equips a local graph structure inference module, utilizing the Block Diagonal Property (BDP) of the affinity matrix extracted from node ego networks. This module can generate the homophilic graph structure by selectively removing disassortative edges. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness and universality of ROSEN across node classification and node clustering tasks.
