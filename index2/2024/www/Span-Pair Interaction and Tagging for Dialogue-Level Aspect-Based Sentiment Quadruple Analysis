The Dialogue-level Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple analysis (DiaASQ) task has recently received attention in the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) field. It aims to extract(target, aspect, opinion, sentiment) quadruples from multi-turn and multi-party dialogues. Compared to previous ABSA tasks focusing on text such as sentences, the DiaASQ task involves more complex contextual information and corresponding relations between terms, as well as longer sequences. These characteristics challenge existing methods that struggle to model explicit span-level interactions or have high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a span-pair interaction and tagging method to solve these issues, which includes a novel Span-pair Tagging Scheme (STS) and a simple and efficient Multi-level Representation Model (MRM). STS simplifies the DiaASQ task to a span-pair tagging task and explicitly captures complete span-level semantics by tagging span pairs. MRM efficiently models the dialogue structure information and span-level interactions by constructing multi-level contextual representation. Besides, we train a span ranker to improve the running efficiency of MRM. Extensive experiments on multilingual datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
