In the rapidly evolving landscape of information retrieval, search engines strive to provide more personalized and relevant results to users. Query suggestion systems play a crucial role in achieving this goal by assisting users in formulating effective queries. However, existing query suggestion systems mainly rely on textual inputs, potentially limiting user search experiences for querying images. In this paper, we introduce a novel Multimodal Query Suggestion (MMQS) task, which aims to generate query suggestions based on user query images to improve the intentionality and diversity of search results. We present the RL4Sugg framework, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to optimize the generation process. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL4Sugg, demonstrating a 18% improvement compared to the best existing approach. Moreover, the MMQS has been transferred into real-world search engine products, which yield enhanced user engagement. Our research advances query suggestion systems and provides a new perspective on multimodal information retrieval.
