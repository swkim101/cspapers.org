Link prediction models assign scores to predict new, plausible edges to complete knowledge graphs. In link prediction evaluation, the score of an existing edge (positive) is ranked w.r.t. the scores of its synthetically corrupted counterparts (negatives). An accurate model ranks positives higher than negatives, assuming ascending order. Since the number of negatives are typically large for a single positive, link prediction evaluation is computationally expensive. As far as we know, only one approach has proposed to replace rank aggregations by a distance between sample positives and negatives. Unfortunately, the distance does not consider individual ranks, so edges in isolation cannot be assessed. In this paper, we propose an alternative protocol based on posterior probabilities of positives rather than ranks. A calibration function assigns posterior probabilities to edges that measure their plausibility. We propose to assess our alternative protocol in various ways, including whether expected semantics are captured when using different strategies to synthetically generate negatives. Our experiments show that posterior probabilities and ranks are highly correlated. Also, the time reduction of our alternative protocol is quite significant: more than 77% compared to rank-based evaluation. We conclude that link prediction evaluation based on posterior probabilities is viable and significantly reduces computational costs.
