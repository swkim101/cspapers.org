Large language models have substantially advanced the state of the art in various AI tasks, such as natural language understanding and text generation, and image processing, and multimodal modeling. In this talk, we will first introduce the development of AI in the past decades, in particular from the angle of China. We will also talk about the opportunities, challenges, and risks of AGI in the future, and its impact on the Web. In the second part of the talk, we will use ChatGLM, an alternative but open sourced model to ChatGPT, as an example to explain our understandings and insights derived during the implementation of the model.
