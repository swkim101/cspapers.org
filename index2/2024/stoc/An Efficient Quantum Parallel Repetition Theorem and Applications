We prove a tight parallel repetition theorem for 3-message computationally-secure quantum interactive protocols between an efficient challenger and an efficient adversary. We also prove under plausible assumptions that the security of 4-message computationally secure protocols does not generally decrease under parallel repetition. These mirror the classical results of Bellare, Impagliazzo, and Naor. Finally, we prove that all quantum argument systems can be generically compiled to an equivalent 3-message argument system, mirroring the transformation for quantum proof systems. As immediate applications, we show how to derive hardness amplification theorems for quantum bit commitment schemes (answering a question of Yan), EFI pairs (answering a question of Brakerski, Canetti, and Qian), public-key quantum money schemes (answering a question of Aaronson and Christiano), and quantum zero-knowledge argument systems. We also derive an XOR lemma for quantum predicates as a corollary.
