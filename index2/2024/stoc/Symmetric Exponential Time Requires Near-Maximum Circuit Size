We show that there is a language in S2E/1 (symmetric exponential time with one bit of advice) with circuit complexity at least 2n/n. In particular, the above also implies the same near-maximum circuit lower bounds for the classes Σ2E, (Σ2E∩Π2E)/1, and ZPENP/1. Previously, only ”half-exponential” circuit lower bounds for these complexity classes were known, and the smallest complexity class known to require exponential circuit complexity was Δ3E = EΣ2P (Miltersen, Vinodchandran, and Watanabe COCOON’99). Our circuit lower bounds are corollaries of an unconditional zero-error pseudodeterministic algorithm with an NP oracle and one bit of advice (FZPPNP/1) that solves the range avoidance problem infinitely often. This algorithm also implies unconditional infinitely-often pseudodeterministic FZPPNP/1 constructions for Ramsey graphs, rigid matrices, two-source extractors, linear codes, and Kpoly-random strings with nearly optimal parameters. Our proofs relativize. The two main technical ingredients are (1) Korten’s PNP reduction from the range avoidance problem to constructing hard truth tables (FOCS’21), which was in turn inspired by a result of Jeřábek on provability in Bounded Arithmetic (Ann. Pure Appl. Log. 2004); and (2) the recent iterative win-win paradigm of Chen, Lu, Oliveira, Ren, and Santhanam (FOCS’23).
