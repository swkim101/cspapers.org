Sensors enable us to digitally capture stimuli like moisture, light, and force. Despite their low cost, reliability, and scalability, the lack of widespread adoption of IoT has hindered the realization of true ubiquitous sensing. A likely reason is that the current sensor platforms are bulky due to the batteries and complex electronics needed to interface sensors communication systems. In this work, we present a fully-passive, miniaturized, flexible form factor sensor interface titled ZenseTag that uses minimal electronics to read and communicate analog sensor data, directly at radio frequencies (RF). We exploit the fundamental principle of resonance, where a sensor's terminal impedance becomes most sensitive to the measured stimulus at its resonant frequency. This enables ZenseTag to read out the sensor variation using only energy harvested from wireless signals. We demonstrate its implementation with a 15x10mm flexible PCB that connects sensors to a printed antenna and passive RFID ICs, enabling near real-time readout through a performant GUI-enabled software. We showcase ZenseTag's versatility by interfacing commercial force, soil moisture and photodiode sensors [1--3]. Further, we motivate dedicated application studies for these sensors.
