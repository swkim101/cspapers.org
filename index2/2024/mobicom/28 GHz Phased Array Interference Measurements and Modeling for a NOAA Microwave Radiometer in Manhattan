A microwave radiometer (MWR) at NOAA-CESSRST in Man-hattan, NYC has experienced interference from nearby sources operating in the 5G FR2 n257 band (26.50–29.50 GHz). In this poster, we produce interference using a mobile 28 GHz IBM Phased Array Antenna Module (PAAM). The mobile PAAM leverages a software-defined radio which offers flexibility in varying center frequency, modulation, gain, bandwidth, time schedule, and more. In this poster, we show preliminary experiments which successfully created controlled interference to a MWR’s 28 GHz channel which lead to distortion in some of the MWR final products, such as water vapor profile. We transmitted a 10 MHz bandwidth OFDM signal with varying amplitude, observing the highly sensitive MWR voltage response to fractional dB increments of the transmitter gain. The mobile PAAM is characterized in an anechoic chamber and MWR measurements are taken at various azimuth angles to help estimate the MWR antenna pattern. Future work will develop a Spectrum Consumption Model to help enable coexistence of MWRs and Beyond-5G networks.
