The emerging nature of low-earth-orbiting satellite constellations has brought forth an era of global connectivity. Star-link has the potential to offer a truly global, high-performant service. An obvious question arising from this is whether Starlink can replace existing terrestrial services. In this work we describe the key findings from a detailed study of the performance of Starlink, investigating both its potential and shortcomings to act as a "global ISP".
