The advent of 5G deployments and the anticipation of 6G have initiated a concerted effort to define new network and application services that leverage these technologies. A key focus of this effort is deterministic networking, which provides the reliability, time sensitivity, and predictability essential for supporting critical services and applications. This article presents a solution to support multi-domain deterministic communications, integrating various technology-specific deterministic networking solutions---namely IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.1 TSN, and 3GPP 5G domains---over an IETF DetNet data plane. Our goal is to create a realistic infrastructure for developing the next generation of deterministic services. Key contributions include the design, deployment, and performance characterization of the multi-domain data plane, as well as its integration into a real-life use case such as the remote control of a robotic dog.
