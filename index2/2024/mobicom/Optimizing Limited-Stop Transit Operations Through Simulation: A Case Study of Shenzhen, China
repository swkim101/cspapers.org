Limited-stop service represents a paradigm for enhancing efficiency in transportation systems, with applications spanning public transit, logistics, and supply chain management. This service model operates along a designated route featuring a reduced number of stops in comparison to standard services, thereby facilitating expedited transportation. In this research, we utilize accumulated data from Intelligent Transportation Systems for the development and deployment of a simulation-driven framework tailored towards augmenting the operational efficiency of limited-stop services. To illustrate the practical application of this framework, we focus on the paradigm of limited-stop bus services, elucidating the intricate technical facets of the proposed system. The efficacy and viability of this framework have been validated through a series of empirical investigations conducted within the urban bus transit network of Shenzhen, a prominent metropolis situated in China.
