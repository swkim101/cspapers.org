Pico-satellite (picosat) constellations aim to become the de facto connectivity solution for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These constellations rely on a large number of small picosats and offer global plug-and-play connectivity at low data rates, without the need for Earth-based gateways. As picosat constellations scale, they run into new bottlenecks due to their traditional medium access designs optimized for single (or few) satellite operations. We present CosMAC - a new constellation-scale medium access and scheduling system for picosat networks. CosMAC includes a new overlap-aware medium access approach for uplink from IoT to picosats and a new network layer that schedules downlink traffic from satellites. We empirically evaluate CosMAC using measurements from three picosats and large-scale trace-driven simulations for a 173 picosat network supporting 100k devices. Our results demonstrate that CosMAC can improve the overall network throughput by up to 6.5X over prior state-of-the-art satellite medium access schemes.
