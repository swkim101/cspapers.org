Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), as a promising component in 6G, however, is faced with security challenges that the critical communication information will be leaked to the sensing targets. This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided bi-static ISAC system. The objective is to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) with security and other constraints. A joint beamforming, reflection and receiving filter design is proposed. Alternating optimization (AO) based iterative algorithm leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), Dinkelbach's transform, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques is utilized to solve the non-convex problem. It is found that the proposed scheme provides significantly better sensing performance with security constraint.
