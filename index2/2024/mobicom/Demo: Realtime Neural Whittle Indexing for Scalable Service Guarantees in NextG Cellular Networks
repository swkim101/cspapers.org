This work presents Windex, a novel light weight whittle index network-driven realtime scheduler for scalable service guarantees in NextG cellular networks. Windex addresses the resource allocation challenge in NextG cellular radio access networks (RAN), where resources must be shared among diverse user applications, each requiring guarantees on throughput and service regularity, taking into account service guarantees, channel quality, and system load. Implemented in a real time intelligent controller (RIC), and evaluating across standardized 3GPP service classes, we demonstrate the least service violations compared to state-of-the-art systems using over-the-air channel traces on a 5G testbed.
