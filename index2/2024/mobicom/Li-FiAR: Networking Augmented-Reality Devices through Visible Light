We have seen rapid deployment of augmented reality devices. However, these devices currently suffer from limited battery life. They require frequent recharge, especially when capturing and streaming information wirelessly. In particular, these devices stream information over the radio spectrum using transceivers that are power-hungry, and wireless communication dominates the energy budget of these devices. We present our ongoing work to design a system called Li-FiAR, which proposes integrating Li-Fi with augmented reality devices. Specifically, we implement a transmitter and receiver and integrate them with an augmented reality device. We argue that Li-Fi receivers may consume less power than their radio counterparts while benefiting from the spatial nature of light propagation. This enables novel application scenarios for augmented reality. We demonstrate the transmission of images and audio through Li-Fi, presented on an augmented reality device in this work.
