In order to enable the simultaneous transmission and re-ception of wireless signals on the same frequency, a full-duplex (FD) radio must be capable of suppressing the powerful self-interference (SI) signal emitted from the transmitter and picked up by the receiver. Critically, a major bottleneck in wideband FD deployments is the need for adaptive SI cancellation (SIC) that would allow the FD wireless system to achieve strong cancellation across different settings with distinct electromagnetic environments. In this work, we evaluate the performance of an adaptive wideband FD radio in three different locations and demonstrate that it achieves strong SIC in every location across different bandwidths
