Measuring the glucose concentration in liquids is crucial for ensuring the safety of products for individuals with diabetes. This process not only aids in diabetes management but also highlights the importance of taking additional precautions after a diabetes diagnosis. Currently, glucose test strips are widely used to measure the glucose concentration of liquids. It's safe, effective, easy to use, and a cheap alternative to other complex technology with the same use. However, it has sevral setbacks, such as its inability to accurately measure the glucose concentration of cold liquids (0°C - 10°C). This lack of variability can lead to more inconvenience for individuals than benefits. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the usage of millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing as a contactless, versatile, and easy method to measure glucose levels in cold liquids accurately.
