The rapid expansion of wireless technologies demands effective management of complex RAN for MIMO in 5G systems. Current architectures and RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) lack critical real-time data processing and physical layer functionalities, hindering MIMO advancements. We introduce BeamArmor5G, an open-source MIMO App development framework that addresses these gaps with comprehensive PHY layer capabilities, enabling detailed wireless channel measurement streaming from RAN to the controller. BeamArmor5G is implemented with srsRAN to empower open-source community researchers to advance beamforming, localization, and interference management, significantly enhancing network performance and enabling new 5G applications.
