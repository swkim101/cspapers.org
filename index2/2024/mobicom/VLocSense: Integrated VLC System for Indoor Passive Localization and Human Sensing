The demand for accurate and real-time indoor localization and human sensing is rising with the development of smart environments, with applications in security and smart homes. Effective systems enhance safety, energy efficiency, and user experience by leveraging existing infrastructure, reducing deployment costs, and integrating seamlessly. Traditional methods rely on dedicated hardware, while communication or lighting infrastructure can provide dual-purpose solutions. This research focuses on Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology, which uses visible light for data transmission. Our VLC system utilizes existing lighting infrastructure to transmit data, providing localization and human sensing functionalities. The system design strategically incorporates specific VLC transmitters and receivers to enhance sensing performance. The collected data is processed using advanced algorithms and machine learning models, ensuring robust, real-time, and cost-effective localization with an accuracy of 96.6% and human activity recognition with an accuracy of 98.3%. This multi-functionality system demonstrates the potential for VLC in healthcare monitoring and home automation applications.
