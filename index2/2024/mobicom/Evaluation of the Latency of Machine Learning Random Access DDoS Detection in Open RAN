A testbed with open-source tools and commercial equipment is designed to investigate the timing of ML-based xApp operations in DDoS attack detection during the Random Access procedure. Re-sults show high-precision and high-recall ML classifiers operating faster than the Medium Access Control (MAC) layerâ€™s Contention Resolution timer. For classifiers with over 97% precision and recall, XGBoost has the fastest execution time and the narrowest estimated run time probability density function
