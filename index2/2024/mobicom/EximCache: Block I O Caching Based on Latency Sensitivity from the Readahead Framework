Efficient use of caching space is crucial in block I/O caching schemes due to the high cost of caching media. This paper introduces EximCache, a novel scheme that prioritizes blocks not promptly managed by the OS readahead framework, addressing the performance criticality of block I/Os. Experimental results demonstrate that EximCache reduces caching space usage significantly while imposing minimal performance overhead during application launches and Linux boot.
