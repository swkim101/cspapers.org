As a key feature that has the potential to enable many advanced applications, the integration of sensing functionality is considered essential in the 6G network, which motivates the design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, traditional ISAC systems based on non-overlapped resource allocation face the challenge of poor energy and spectral efficiency. In this paper, we implement an ISAC system named Horus based on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, which provides an energy-efficient solution to sense objects in a wide range of blind areas. With a carefully designed ISAC protocol, Horus can transmit sensing information to the receiver with high spectral efficiency. We have verified the ability of the proposed system in two case studies of multi-modal sensing and around-corner radar early warning, respectively. Our demonstration video can be found in [11].
