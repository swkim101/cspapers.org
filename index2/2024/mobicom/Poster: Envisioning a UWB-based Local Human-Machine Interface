In this work, we present a secure Internet-of-Things framework enabled by UWB, which allows users to wirelessly interact with any public and home appliances in a more secure, seamless and efficient manner. we envision an ecosystem of appliances and mobile devices equipped with UWB transceivers, where the appliances are capable of imposing location-based access control in precise and configurable zones and ensuring security against eavesdropping and hi-jacking by malicious attackers. We propose a location-based access control algorithm that is robust against range spoofing. Further, we propose the network and application layer protocols that enable one generic user-end application to access the control interface of any appliances and adapt to context
