A crucial task in autonomous driving is to continuously detect nearby vehicles. Problems thus arise when a vehicle is occluded and becomes "unseeable", which may lead to accidents. In this study, we develop mmOVD, a system that can detect fully occluded vehicles by involving millimeter-wave radars to capture the ground-reflected signals passing beneath the blocking vehicle's chassis. The foremost challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by frequent multi-path reflections, which highly resemble the true points. We devise a set of features that can efficiently distinguish the ghost points by exploiting the neighbor points' spatial and velocity distributions. We also design a cumulative clustering algorithm to effectively aggregate the unstable ground-reflected radar points over consecutive frames to derive the bounding boxes of the vehicles. We have evaluated mmOVD in both controlled environments and real-world environments. In an underground garage and two campus roads, we conducted controlled experiments in 56 scenes with 8 vehicles, including a minibus and a motorcycle. Our system accurately detects occluded vehicles for the first time, with a 91.1% F1 score for occluded vehicle detection and a 100% success rate for occlusion event detection. More importantly, we drove 324km on crowded roads at a speed up to 70km per hour and show we could achieve an occlusion detection success rate of 92% and a low false alarm rate of 4% with only 10% of the training data in complex real-world environments.
