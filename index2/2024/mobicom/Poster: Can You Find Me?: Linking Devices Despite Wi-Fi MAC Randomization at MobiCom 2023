We present results for exposing vulnerabilities in MAC address randomization using Wi-Fi network discovery traffic collected at MobiCom 2023. By analyzing probe request sequence numbers and vendor-specific information elements, we successfully link randomized MAC addresses, reducing the observed MAC addresses to linked groups by over 45%. This demonstrates current MAC randomization protocols inadequately protect device privacy during network discovery.
