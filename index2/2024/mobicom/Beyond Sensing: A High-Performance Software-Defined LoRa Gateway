LoRa is about to become the standard for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), being well suited for many Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network applications. The success of the technology sparked interest to adopt LoRa for other, more challenging use-cases in industrial automation or control of cyber-physical systems. Regular LoRa gateways are, however, limited in their number of parallel demodulation paths and restricted to a single network. To overcome this limitation, we implement a software-defined, multichannel LoRa receiver that is able to receive all common spreading factors and uplink channel combinations of the LoRaWAN EU868 frequency plan. In addition, our receiver does not rely on hard-coded sync words, enabling a mechanism similar to monitor mode in WLAN networks. Experimental evaluation using Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) confirms superior performance compared to commercial LoRa gateways.
