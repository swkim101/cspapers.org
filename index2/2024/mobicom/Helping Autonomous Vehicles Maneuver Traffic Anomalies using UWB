This paper proposes a UWB beacon to be installed on trucks carrying unusual loads to warn approaching autonomous vehicles (AVs) of unconventional cargo. We propose several approaches, including one where the AV only receives UWB messages. We plan to use a QR code to provide secure communication between the AV and the cargo. The proposed system generalizes to static and dynamic traffic anomalies.
