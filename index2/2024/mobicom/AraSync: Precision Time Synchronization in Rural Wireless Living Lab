Time synchronization is a critical component in network operation and management, and it is also required by Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in next-generation wireless systems such as those of 5G, 6G, and Open RAN. In this context, we design and implement AraSync as an end-to-end time synchronization system in the ARA wireless living lab to enable advanced wireless experiments and applications involving stringent time constraints. We make use of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at different levels to achieve synchronization accuracy in the order of nanoseconds. Along with fiber networks, AraSync enables time synchronization across the AraHaul wireless x-haul network consisting of long-range, high-capacity mmWave and microwave links. In this paper, we present the detailed design and implementation of AraSync, including its hardware and software components and the PTP network topology. Further, we experimentally characterize the performance of AraSync from spatial and temporal dimensions. Our measurement and analysis of the clock offset and mean path delay show the impact of the wireless channel and weather conditions on the PTP synchronization accuracy.
