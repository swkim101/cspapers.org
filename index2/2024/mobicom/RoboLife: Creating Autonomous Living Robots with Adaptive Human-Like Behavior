Interactive robots have gained popularity, yet most are limited to motion, conversation, and recognition, lacking the ability to autonomously live and adapt like humans. This paper presents RoboLife, a novel system that empowers robots to perceive and learn from their environment, engage in human-like interactions with users and other robots, and autonomously plan activities. RoboLife introduces an adaptive framework with three core components: perception, human-life simulation, and dynamic learning. These enable robots to adapt, perform tasks, and engage meaningfully with their surroundings. Its key innovation lies in integrating environmental influences, human interactions, and inter-robot communication, allowing robots to form opinions, remember experiences, and autonomously execute activities---effectively living their own lives.
