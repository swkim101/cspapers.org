Cloud-based live video analytics with tight latency bound is gaining importance to support emerging applications such as UAVs and augmented reality. However, existing systems often struggle to meet stringent latency constraints under fluctuating network conditions with packet losses and late-arriving packets. We propose a loss-tolerant live video analytics system called Logan, which effectively accepts packet losses while maintaining high accuracy by utilizing the inherent resilience in DNNs. We design i) Codec-aware Inpainting, which accurately recovers the frame error from packet losses ii) Fast-Forward Recovery that prevents the remaining un-recovered error from propagating over future frames indefinitely. Our results show a 3× improvement (33.2%→99.9%) in SLO satisfaction rate compared to the reliable transmission scheme with <1% accuracy drop under a 5% packet loss rate.
