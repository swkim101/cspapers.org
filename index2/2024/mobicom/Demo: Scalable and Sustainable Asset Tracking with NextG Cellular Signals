This demonstration presents LiTEfoot, an ultra-low power localization system leveraging ambient cellular signals. To address the limitations of traditional GPS-based tracking systems in terms of power consumption and latency, LiTEfoot employs a non-linear transformation of the cellular spectrum to achieve efficient self-localization. Our design uses a simple envelope detector to realize spectrum folding, enabling the identification of multiple active base stations. The LiTEfoot prototype shows a median localization error of 22 meters in urban areas and 50 meters in rural areas, consuming only 40 Î¼Joules of energy per localization update.
