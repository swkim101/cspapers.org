Leveraging the public cloud for the Core Network (CN) remains uncommon amongst mobile network operators despite the economical and operational benefits. In this paper, we present a holistic feasibility analysis for various methods to deploy a cloud-native CN to AWS. Our findings confirm the economical and technical feasibility, and present a suitable deployment method for further adoption of the public cloud.
