We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of RFlect, a mmWave imaging system capable of producing around-the-corner high-resolution images in practical environments. RFlect leverages signals reflected off complex surfaces (e.g., poles, concave surfaces, or composition of multiple surfaces) to image objects that are not in the RF line-of-sight. RFlect models the reflections and introduces reconstruction algorithms for different types of surfaces. It also leverages a novel method for precisely mapping the location and geometry of the reflecting surface. We also derive the theoretical resolution and coverage for different reflecting surface geometries. We built a prototype of RFlect and performed extensive evaluations to demonstrate its ability to reconstruct the shape of objects around the corner, with an average Chamfer Distance of 2cm and 3D F-Score of 88.6%.
