Wireless sensing is gaining increasing attention from both academia and industry. Various wireless signals, such as Wi-Fi, UWB, and acoustic signals, have been leveraged for sensing. While promising in many aspects, two critical limitations still exist: a) limited sensing coverage; and b) the requirement for dedicated sensing signals, which may interfere with the original function of the wireless technology. To address these issues, we propose to utilize GPS signals for sensing, as GPS signals are already pervasive and emitted from satellites 24/7 at pre-allocated frequency bands, causing no interference. To make GPS sensing possible, we reconstruct signals with amplitude and phase information which is critical for sensing using the raw measurements reported by commercial GPS receiver module. We also develop sensing models to tailor the unique properties of GPS signals such as extremely long transmission distance. Finally, we introduce the concept of distributed sensing and design signal processing methods to fuse signals from multiple satellites to improve sensing performance. With all these designs, we prototype the first GPS wireless sensing system on commercial GPS receiver modules. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system can realize meaningful sensing applications such as human activity sensing, passive trajectory tracking, and respiration monitoring.
