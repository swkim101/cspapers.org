In medical procedures such as surgery and diagnosis, it is crucial to provide doctors and nurses with up-to-date patient information. In this paper, we propose Health-MR, a portable Mixed-Reality (MR) system that helps medical staff monitor patient conditions. Health-MR consists of three components: (1) Patient Identification Recognition using face detection, (2) Medical Cloud Database for patient information retrieval, and (3) Non-invasive Heart Rate Measurement via image processing and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our evaluation demonstrates that Health-MR significantly reduces the time needed to query patient information and provides remote, accurate, and real-time heart rate monitoring.
