We demonstrate RadCloud, a real-time framework for obtaining high-resolution lidar-like 2D point clouds from low-resolution millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar data on resource-constrained platforms commonly found on unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs). Such point clouds can then be used for mapping key features of the environment, route planning and navigation, and other robotics tasks. Rad-Cloud is specifically optimized for UAVs and UGVs by using a radar configuration with 1/4th the range resolution, using a model with 2.25× fewer parameters, and reducing total sensing time by a factor of 250×. The real-time ROS framework will be demonstrated on a UGV and UAV equipped with CPU-only compute platforms in diverse environments.
