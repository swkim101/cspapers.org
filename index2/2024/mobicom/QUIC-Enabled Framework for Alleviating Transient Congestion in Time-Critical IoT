The real-time control capability of IoT devices is contingent upon the transmission of packets. However, due to the influence of multiple devices accessing the network, the bandwidth available to IoT devices from access points may decline significantly, which causes a surge in the queuing latency and interrupts the transmission. This phenomenon is referred to as transient congestion. To achieve stable high-quality network service, this paper designs RushWay, a QUIC-enabled framework for alleviating transient congestion. RushWay employs stream multiplexing to compress the original packet into the stream frame, thereby reducing the bandwidth required for transmission. Furthermore, RushWay employs an adaptive decision-making algorithm to assess uplink queue conditions and packet latency requirements, thereby alleviating transient congestion. The simulation results demonstrate that RushWay can improve key performance by 13% to 94%.
