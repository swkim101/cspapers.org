Passive IoT localization technology offers significant advantages across various applications due to its self-sustaining, maintenance-free, and low-cost nature. However, existing systems cannot effectively address the multipath problem in real-world deployments, leading to unreliable localization results in the severe multipath scenario. We propose to fill the gap with UWB2, the first ultra-wideband backscatter passive IoT system that can achieve centimeter-level 99th percentile accuracy even under severe multipath environments. The demo will illustrate UWB2's performance in localization accuracy, latency, operating range, and power consumption in severe multipath scenarios.
