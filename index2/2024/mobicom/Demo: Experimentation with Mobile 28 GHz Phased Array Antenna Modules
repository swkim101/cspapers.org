We present experiments using mobile 28 GHz Phased Array Antenna Modules (PAAMs), demonstrating their ability to perform beam steering with high granularity. The mobile node contains a 64-element IBM 28 GHz PAAM along with a USRP software defined radio, allowing for configuration of the transmit/receive (TX/RX) parameters. These parameters include beam shape, beam steering, and duty cycling. We demonstrate the capabilities of the mobile PAAMs by forming a wireless OFDM link between two mobile PAAMs. We then showcase the beam steering capabilities of the PAAM by performing beam sweeping on the RX PAAM to find the angle of arrival from the TX PAAM. A simple graphical user interface is presented for configuring the PAAMs. A tutorial is available online for users interested in experimentation with 28 GHz PAAMs âˆ— .
