5G enables diverse services through network slicing, allowing multiple virtual networks to share physical infrastructure. However, efficiently managing resources across slices is challenging. This demo presents SliceGuard, a two-level scheduling system that leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) to allow slice owners to run customized schedulers in a secure, platform-independent environment, while the network operator manages inter-slice resource allocation. We demonstrate dynamic slicing for cloud gaming over 5G and show how Wasm enables real-time scheduler updates and fault isolation. This approach enhances flexibility, security, and customization for private 5G networks.
