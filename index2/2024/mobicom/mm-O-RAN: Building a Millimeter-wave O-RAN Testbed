This demo showcases the mm-O-RAN testbed, integrating mmWave arrays with USRP and the OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G stack. Our system integrates the mmWave array with synchronized Time Division Duplex (TDD) switching and fast beamforming capabilities, using GPIO triggers from the OAI stack. As the first full integration of a mmWave testbed with an OAI 5G stack, mm-O-RAN addresses key challenges in design and implementation, providing a versatile platform for research and experimentation for AI and signal processing algorithms to optimize end-end network performance.
