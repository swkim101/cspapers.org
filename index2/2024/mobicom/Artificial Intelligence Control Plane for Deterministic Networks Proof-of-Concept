This paper presents the design and implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Control Plane (AICP) for deterministic networks, emphasizing the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration. The AICP framework integrates AI, digital twin technology, and real-time telemetry to manage complex network environments, ensuring reliable and low-latency communication. The PoC showcases the practical viability of the AICP by dynamically adapting to varying network demands and maintaining stringent to the Key Performance Indicator (KPI)s of the service. Extensive testing and real-world simulations highlight the frameworkâ€™s potential to enhance the efficiency and resilience of industrial communication networks.
