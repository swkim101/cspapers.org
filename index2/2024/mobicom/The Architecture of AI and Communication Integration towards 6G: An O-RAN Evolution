The evolution of communication architecture shifts towards virtualization and cloud-native network functions, setting the stage for the flexibility and integration of emerging technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as intrinsic elements in network design are some of the crucial visions and requirements for 6G. This paper, from the perspective of O-RAN, explores how current network architectures should evolve towards the integration of communication and intelligence in 6G. It begins with a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the AI-related work conducted by various standard organizations. Building on this, an end-to-end AI integration framework is proposed, which leverages AI technologies, data services, and digital twin (DT) technologies to achieve an integrated intelligent 6G communication system. After that, the key enabling technologies for cross-domain AI, service-based RAN, programmable RAN and digital twins are discussed. At last, the paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities for O-RAN evolution.
