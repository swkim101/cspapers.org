We demonstrate FlexLink, a novel frequency-dependent multi-beamforming system designed to optimize spectral efficiency in millimeter-wave networks. Traditional phased arrays offer limited support for simultaneous control and data signals, leading to inefficiencies. FlexLink addresses this by using a delay-phase antenna array to produce high-gain beams for both control and data, nearly doubling spectral efficiency for data signals. Experiments demonstrate FlexLink's ability to utilize the entire frequency spectrum effectively, by radiating different frequencies corresponding to control and data signals to different directions concurrently.
