The advent of 5G promises high bandwidth with the introduction of mmWave technology recently, paving the way for throughput-sensitive applications. However, our measurements in commercial 5G networks show that frequent handovers in 5G, due to physical limitations of mmWave cells, introduce significant under-utilization of the available bandwidth. By analyzing 5G link-layer and TCP traces, we uncover that improper interactions between these two layers causes multiple inefficiencies during handovers. To mitigate these, we propose M2HO , a novel device-centric solution that can predict and recognize different stages of a handover and perform state-dependent mitigation to markedly improve throughput. M2HO is transparent to the firmware, base stations, servers, and applications. We implement M2HO and our extensive evaluations validate that it yields significant improvements in TCP throughput with frequent handovers.
