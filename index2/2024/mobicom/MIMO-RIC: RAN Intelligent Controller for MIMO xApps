The adoption of MIMO technology in wireless networks enhances spectral efficiency and enables novel functionalities such as wireless sensing and localization. These functionalities can be enabled by Open-RAN architecture to provide high computation, memory, and data-driven inference through a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). However, existing RICs focus mainly on higher network layers and lack essential PHY layer functionalities for MIMO. We present MIMO-RIC, an open-source RAN intelligent controller tailored for MIMO applications. We enable the streaming of extensive 3D wireless channel measurements across antennas, subcarriers, and time, from RAN to MIMO-RIC to develop various MIMO apps like beamforming and localization. We implemented MIMO-RIC on the srsRAN open-source platform using ZeroMQ messaging system for efficient, low-latency communication. Our over-the-air experiment setup consisting of USRP radios and commercial user equipment demonstrates effective jammer monitoring, nulling, and user localization applications.
