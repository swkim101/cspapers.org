We propose a millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signal-based sleep monitoring system aimed at providing information about a person's sleep by detecting sleep events, such as bed entry and exit times, as well as the duration of bed stay. It overcomes the limitations of existing vision-based systems by operating in low-light conditions without invading privacy. It uses spatial-temporal information and signal processing techniques to determine the duration, and our preliminary results indicate that our system can accurately detect bed events.
