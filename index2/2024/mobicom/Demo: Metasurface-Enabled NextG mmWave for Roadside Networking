We present Wall-Street, a smart surface designed for vehicles to boost 5G mmWave connectivity for passengers. It improves mmWave connections in three ways: (1) it steers outdoor mmWave signals into the vehicle, ensuring all users have coverage; (2) it enables the vehicle to receive data from the current cell while measuring signals from potential handover cells, allowing smooth transitions without interrupting service; (3) during handovers, it combines/splits signals from/to both the current and new cells, creating a make-before-break connection. Our demonstration shows Wall-Street's versatile signal manipulation abilities. These include steering single beams, simultaneously reflecting and transmitting beams for neighboring cell measurements with concurrent communication, and combining or splitting beams for seamless cell transitions.
