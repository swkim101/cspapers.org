A crucial step for reducing emissions in the transport sector is the shift towards public transportation and bicycling. However, due to the lack of perceived safety, people are reluctant to commute by bicycle. A potential solution to this problem could be group cycling, allowing cyclists to form a group with others in order to ride together. Depending on local traffic laws, such groups allow for cycling next to each other and for special rights for intersection crossing. In this paper, we outline how group cycling commutes may be coordinated using communication capabilities of contemporary smartphones. We showcase how group cycling can reduce waiting times and, thus, improve ride comfort and safety in a simulation-based case study.
