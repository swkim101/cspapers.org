Event cameras excel in high-speed and high-dynamic-range scenarios but are highly sensitive to rain, which introduces significant noise while also revealing detailed rain features. This paper introduces a novel Event-based Rain-Background Decomposition Network that integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By "Distilling Rain," we reconstruct a rain-free background for downstream tasks
