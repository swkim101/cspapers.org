Accurate tracking of hand and object poses is essential for immersive XR applications. However, existing methods often struggle with the stringent requirements of XR environments. We present XRMan, a real-time hand-object pose tracking system designed for in-the-wild scenarios. XRMan uses a drift monitoring module for consistent accuracy, while farthest-point sampling and collider-based optimization streamline iterative optimization and reduce latency. Our system reduces end-to-end latency by 38.9% compared to the baseline, with further improvements expected from the collider-based post-optimization module.
