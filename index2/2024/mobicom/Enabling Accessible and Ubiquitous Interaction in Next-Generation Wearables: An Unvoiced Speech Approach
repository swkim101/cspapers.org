As wearable devices increase, there's a growing need for intuitive, private, and accessible interaction methods. This position paper builds on the research on unvoiced speech interaction and authentication to propose a vision for interaction in next-generation wearables. This paper draws upon our previous work on unvoiced speech interfaces that leverage jaw movements and facial vibrations for command recognition and user authentication. We argue that unvoiced speech interaction can provide a robust, privacy-preserving, and noise-resistant alternative to traditional interfaces, enhancing accessibility and offering discrete interaction in public spaces. We discuss the potential integration of these systems into commercial devices and explore gesture-based interactions as an alternative to touch. Additionally, we discuss the future direction of unvoiced speech interfaces. This paper sets the stage for implementing unvoiced speech and gesture-based interaction in mainstream wearables in our daily interactions with technology.
