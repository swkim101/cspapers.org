This study examines how an airborne device can intercept underwater acoustic signals exchanged between submerged nodes. It challenges the conventional belief that acoustic communications under the water are safe against eavesdropping since acoustics do not cross the water-air boundary. We show that an airborne mmWave radar can detect and decode underwater acoustic signals by picking up minute surface vibrations induced by these signals. The proof-of-concept was tested in controlled (pool) and uncontrolled (lake) environments, proving that an airborne adversary can identify modulation type, bitrate, and decode symbols from an uncooperative underwater transmitter using its radar sensing capabilities. We demonstrate that the secrecy of underwater links depends on modulation type, providing insights into countermeasures to enhance the security of underwater acoustic communications.
