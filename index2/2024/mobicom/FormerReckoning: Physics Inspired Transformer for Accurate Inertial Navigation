Although modern localization methods have achieved remarkable accuracy with various sensors, there are still some circumstances whereonlyproprioceptivesensingworks(InertialNavigation). However, localization and navigation using only IMU sensors (costing less than $1000) still face significant challenges such as low accuracy and large cumulative errors when using traditional filter methods. Furthermore, AI-based approaches, while promising, of-tenyieldunpredictableandunreliableoutputs.Thispaperproposes FormerReckoning , an inertial localization estimation framework forwheeledroboticsthatincorporatesphysicalpromptsintoaTrans-formerframeworktoenhancetranslationestimationaccuracy.Our testsshowthatFormerReckoningnotonlyreducesmeantransla-tionerrorsto 0 . 72% but also surpasses all baseline models in performance, demonstrating its potential to provide reliable and precise localization in a cost-effective manner.
