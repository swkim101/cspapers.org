Gas sensing plays a key role in detecting explosive/toxic gases and monitoring environmental pollution. Existing approaches usually require expensive hardware or high maintenance cost, and are thus ill-suited for large-scale long-term deployment. In this paper, we propose Gastag, a gas sensing paradigm based on passive tags. The heart of Gastag design is embedding a small piece of gas-sensitive material to a cheap RFID tag. When gas concentration varies, the conductivity of gas-sensitive materials changes, impacting the impedance of the tag and accordingly the received signal. To increase the sensing sensitivity and gas concentration range capable of sensing, we carefully select multiple materials and synthesize a new material that exhibits high sensitivity and high surface-to-weight ratio. To enable a long working range, we redesigned the tag antenna and carefully determined the location to place the gas-sensitive material in order to achieve impedance matching. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Gastag can achieve a median error of 6.7 ppm for CH4 concentration measurements, 12.6 ppm for CO2 concentration measurements, and 3 ppm for CO concentration measurements, outperforming a lot of commodity gas sensors on the market. The working range is successfully increased to 8.5 m, enabling the coverage of many tags with a single reader, laying the foundation for large-scale deployment.
