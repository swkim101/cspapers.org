Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is extensively utilized for outdoor positioning and navigation. However, achieving high-precision indoor positioning is challenging due to the significant attenuation of GNSS signals indoors. To address this issue, we propose an innovative indoor GNSS positioning system called GPMS, which uses passive metasur-face technology to redirect GNSS signals from outdoors into indoor spaces. These passive metasurfaces are strategically optimized for indoor coverage by steering and scattering the GNSS signals across a wide range of incident angles. We further develop a novel localization algorithm that can determine which metasurface the signal goes through and localize the user using the set of metasurfaces as anchor points. A distinct advantage of our localization algorithm is that it can be implemented on existing mobile devices without any hardware modifications. We implement the prototype of GPMS, and deploy six metasurfaces in two indoor environments, a
