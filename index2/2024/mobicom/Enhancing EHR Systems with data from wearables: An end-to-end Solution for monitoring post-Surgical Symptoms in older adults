Mobile health (mHealth) apps have gained popularity over the past decade for patient health monitoring, yet their potential for timely intervention is underutilized due to limited integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems. Current EHR systems lack real-time monitoring capabilities for symptoms, medication adherence, physical and social functions, and community integration. Existing systems typically rely on static, in-clinic measures rather than dynamic, real-time patient data. This highlights the need for automated, scalable, and human-centered platforms to integrate patient-generated health data (PGHD) within EHR. Incorporating PGHD in a user-friendly format can enhance patient symptom surveillance, ultimately improving care management and post-surgical outcomes. To address this barrier, we have developed an mHealth platform, ROAMM-EHR, to capture real-time sensor data and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a smartwatch. The ROAMM-EHR platform can capture data from a consumer smartwatch, send captured data to a secure server, and display information within the Epic EHR system using a user-friendly interface, thus enabling healthcare providers to monitor post-surgical symptoms effectively.
