Significant efforts to address the energy challenges of embedded systems have resulted in the design of new low-power transmitter architectures. These transmitters utilize backscatter or tunnel diode-based mechanisms to enable low-power transmissions by delegating energy-intensive tasks to external infrastructure. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the need for specialized deployment setups, such as the precise placement of carrier-emitting devices. To overcome this, we are developing GateHaul-a low-cost gateway architecture that provides the required carrier signal, coordinates with other gateways, collects sensor data, and backhauls the information. Notably, GateHaul can backhaul sensor data without conventional networks utilizing emerging opportunistic backhaul networks. We demonstrate an early prototype of GateHaul that collects information from backscatter and conventional devices and backhauls the collected information using Apple's FindMy network.
