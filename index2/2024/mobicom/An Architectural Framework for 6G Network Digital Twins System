In the context of 6G, Digital Twin technology has the potential to play a crucial role by offering a sophisticated, dynamic model that mirrors the physical world in real-time. Integrating digital twins into 6G enables precise orchestration and optimization of network resources, meeting the diverse and stringent demands of next-generation applications. Furthermore, digital twins provide a platform for continuous learning and AI-driven analysis. Research on the architecture of Network Digital Twins (NDTs) for 5G/6G is still limited, often focusing on partial implementations rather than comprehensive, full-stack approaches. This paper proposes a high-level architectural framework for 6G NDTs system, structured across three layers: the Physical Twin Layer, Digital Twin Layer, and Application and Service Layer. We discuss the challenges of deploying these systems and the importance of selecting appropriate tools, presenting an experimental case study that demonstrates the impact of different tool choices on system performance. Our findings underscore the need for flexible, scalable solutions to fully realize the benefits of NDTs in 6G networks.
