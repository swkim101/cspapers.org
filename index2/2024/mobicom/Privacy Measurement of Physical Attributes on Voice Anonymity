Various methods have been proposed for protecting the speakerâ€™s identity while preserving speech intelligibility. However, existing studies fail to consider the overall tradeoff between speech utility, speaker verification, and inference of voice physical attributes, such as emotion, age, accent, and gender. we propose a tradeoff metric to encapsulate voice biometrics as well as different voice attributes, to study the feasibility of applying cutting-edge voice anonymization solutions to achieve the optimum tradeoff between privacy protection and speech utility.
