Sub-6GHz radio sensing offers several compelling advantages, such as resilience to poor lighting conditions, privacy preservation, and the ability to see through walls. However, in indoor environments, the sub-6GHz ISM spectrum is heavily occupied by WiFi devices, leaving little available spectrum for sensing purposes. In this paper, we introduce SiWiS, a new approach to integrate radio sensing capabilities into individual WiFi devices for fine-grained human activity detection. SiWiS comprises two main components: (i) a new hardware component that can be easily installed on an off-the-shelf WiFi device, and (ii) a dual-branch deep neural network (DNN) optimized for concurrent human mask segmentation and pose estimation. We have built a prototype of SiWiS and installed it on a commercial WiFi router for evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate a significant performance improvement over WiFi channel state information (CSI) based sensing methods. More importantly, zero-shot experiments confirm that SiWiS can be directly transferred to unseen real-world environments.
