Matrix computation units have been equipped in current architectures to accelerate AI and high performance computing applications. The matrix multiplication and vector outer product are two basic instruction types. The latter one is lighter since the inputs are vectors. Thus it provides more opportunities to develop flexible algorithms for problems other than dense linear algebra computing and more possibilities to optimize the implementation. Stencil computations represent a common class of nested loops in scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes a novel stencil algorithm using vector outer products. Unlike previous work, the new algorithm arises from the stencil definition in the scatter mode and is initially expressed with formulas of vector outer products. The implementation incorporates a set of optimizations to improve the memory reference pattern, execution pipeline and data reuse by considering various algorithmic options and the data sharing between input vectors. Evaluation on a simulator shows that our design achieves a substantial speedup compared with vectorized stencil algorithms.
