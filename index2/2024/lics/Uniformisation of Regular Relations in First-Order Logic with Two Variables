A uniformisation of a binary relation is a functional relation contained in it, with the same domain. The uniformisation problem asks whether such a uniformisation can be defined in a given formalism. We solve this problem in the context of regular relations over finite words, for the fragment FO2[<] of First-Order Logic with two variables: we provide an algorithm that decides if a given regular relation over finite words admits a uniformisation definable in FO2[<]. The paper provides a new representation of languages definable in FO2[<], which can be used for the decidability of other problems involving this formalism, e.g. the problem of separability of two regular languages by a language definable in FO2[<].
