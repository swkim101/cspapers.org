We show that the problem of whether a given PCTL formula has a finite model is undecidable. The undecidability result holds even for formulae of the form [EQUATION] where the validity of ϕ1, ϕ2 depends only on the states reachable in at most two transitions. Consequently, the problem of whether a given PCTL formula is valid in all finite-state Markov chains is not even semi-decidable.
