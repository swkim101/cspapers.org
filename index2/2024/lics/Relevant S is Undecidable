Since the introduction of the semilattice relevant logic S by [Urquhart 1972, 1973], its decision problem has persisted as an open problem. [Urquhart 1984] showed that many relevant logics are undecidable, yet S eluded these techniques. Eventually, this led experts, including [Urquhart 2016], to conjecture that S is decidable. Contrary to this conjecture, by interpreting a tiling problem, we show that S is undecidable.
