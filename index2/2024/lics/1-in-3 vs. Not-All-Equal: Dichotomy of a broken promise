The 1-in-3 and Not-All-Eqal satisfiability problems for Boolean CNF formulas are two well-known NP-hard problems. In contrast, the promise 1-in-3 vs. Not-All-Eqal problem can be solved in polynomial time. In the present work, we investigate this constraint satisfaction problem in a regime where the promise is weakened from either side by a rainbow-free structure, and establish a complexity dichotomy for the resulting class of computational problems.
