Interpretability research has shown that self-supervised Spoken LanguageModels (SLMs) encode a wide variety of features in human speech from theacoustic, phonetic, phonological, syntactic and semantic levels, to speakercharacteristics. The bulk of prior research on representations of phonologyhas focused on segmental features such as phonemes; the encoding ofsuprasegmental phonology (such as tone and stress patterns) in SLMs is not yetwell understood. Tone is a suprasegmental feature that is present in more thanhalf of the worldâ€™s languages. This paper aims to analyze the tone encodingcapabilities of SLMs, using Mandarin and Vietnamese as case studies. We showthat SLMs encode lexical tone to a significant degree even when they aretrained on data from non-tonal languages. We further find that SLMs behavesimilarly to native and non-native human participants in tone and consonantperception studies, but they do not follow the same developmental trajectory.
