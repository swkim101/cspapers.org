As sharing images in an instant message is a crucial factor, there has been active research on learning an image-text multi-modal dialogue models.However, training a well-generalized multi-modal dialogue model remains challenging due to the low quality and limited diversity of images per dialogue in existing multi-modal dialogue datasets.In this paper, we propose an automated pipeline to construct a multi-modal dialogue dataset, ensuring both dialogue quality and image diversity without requiring minimum human effort. In our pipeline, to guarantee the coherence between images and dialogue, we prompt GPT-4 to infer potential image-sharing moments - specifically, the utterance, speaker, rationale, and image description. Furthermore, we leverage CLIP similarity to maintain consistency between aligned multiple images to the utterance.Through this pipeline, we introduce DialogCC, a high-quality and diverse multi-modal dialogue dataset that surpasses existing datasets in terms of quality and diversity in human evaluation.Our comprehensive experiments highlight that when multi-modal dialogue models are trained using our dataset, their generalization performance on unseen dialogue datasets is significantly enhanced. We make our source code and dataset publicly available (https://dialogcc.github.io/).
