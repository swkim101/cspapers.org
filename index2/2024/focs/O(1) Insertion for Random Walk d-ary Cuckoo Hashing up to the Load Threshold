The random walk d-ary cuckoo hashing algorithm was defined by Fotakis, Pagh, Sanders, and Spirakis to generalize and improve upon the standard cuckoo hashing algorithm of Pagh and Rodler. Random walk d-ary cuckoo hashing has low space overhead, guaranteed fast access, and fast in practice insertion time. In this paper, we give a theoretical insertion time bound for this algorithm. More precisely, for every <tex>$d\geq 3$</tex> hashes, let <tex>$c_{d}^{*}$</tex> be the sharp threshold for the load factor at which a valid assignment of <tex>$cm$</tex> objects to a hash table of size <tex>$m$</tex> likely exists. We show that for any <tex>$d\geq 4$</tex> hashes and load factor <tex>$c < c_{d}^{*}$</tex>, the expectation of the random walk insertion time is <tex>$O(1)$</tex>, that is, a constant depending only on <tex>$d$</tex> and <tex>$c$</tex> but not <tex>$m$</tex>.
