Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$ (i.e., the maximum frequency of the measurements). In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit $\epsilon=\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ given by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.
