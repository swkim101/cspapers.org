We give an algorithm that, given graphs <tex>$G$</tex> and <tex>$H$</tex>, tests whether <tex>$H$</tex> is a minor of <tex>$G$</tex> in time <tex>$\mathcal{O}_{H}(\overline{n}^{1+o(1)})$</tex>; here, <tex>$n$</tex> is the number of vertices of <tex>$G$</tex> and the <tex>$\mathrm{O}_{H}(.)$</tex> -notation hides factors that depend on <tex>$H$</tex> and are computable. By the Graph Minor Theorem, this implies the existence of an <tex>$n^{1+o(1)}$</tex> -time membership test for every minor-closed class of graphs. More generally, we give an <tex>$\mathcal{O}_{H,\vert X\vert} (m^{1+o(1)})$</tex> -time algorithm for the rooted version of the problem, in which <tex>$G$</tex> comes with a set of roots <tex>$X\subseteq V(G)$</tex> and some of the branch sets of the sought minor model of <tex>$H$</tex> are required to contain prescribed subsets of <tex>$X$</tex>; here, <tex>$m$</tex> is the total number of vertices and edges of <tex>$G$</tex>. This captures the Disjoint Pathsproblem, for which we obtain an <tex>$\mathcal{O}_{k}(m^{1+o(1)\backslash }$</tex> -time algorithm, where <tex>$k$</tex> is the number of terminal pairs. For all the mentioned problems, the fastest algorithms known before are due to Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed [JCTB 2012], and have a time complexity that is quadratic in the number of vertices of <tex>$G$</tex>. Our algorithm has two main ingredients: First, we show that by using the dynamic treewidth data structure of Korhonen, Majewski, Nadara, Pilipczuk, and Sokolowski [FOCS 2023], the irrelevant vertex technique of Robertson and Seymour can be implemented in almost-linear time on apex-minor-free graphs. Then, we apply the recent advances in almost-linear time flow/cut algorithms to give an almost-linear time implementation of the recursive understanding technique, which effectively reduces the problem to apex-minor-free graphs.
