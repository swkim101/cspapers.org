We prove that a binary linear code of block length $n$ that is locally correctable with 3 queries against a fraction $\delta > 0$ of adversarial errors must have dimension at most $o_{\delta} ( >\log^{2}n$. log log $n$ ). This is almost tight in view of quadratic Reed-Muller codes being a 3-query locally correctable code (LCC) with dimension $\Theta^{-}(\log^{2}n)$. Our result improves, for the binary field case, the $O_{\delta}(\text{lo}\overline{\mathrm{g}}^{8}n)$ bound obtained in the recent breakthrough of [1] (and the more recent improvement to $O_{\delta}(\log^{4}n)$ for binary linear codes announced in [2]). Previous bounds for 3-query linear LCCs proceed by constructing a 2-query locally decodable code (LDC) from the 3-query linear LCC/LDC and applying the strong bounds known for the former. Our approach is more direct and proceeds by bounding the covering radius of the dual code, borrowing inspiration from [3]. That is, we show that if $x\rightarrow(v_{1}\cdot x,\ v_{2}\cdot x,\ \ldots,\ v_{n}\cdot x)$ is an arbitrary encoding map $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{k}\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_{\underline{2}}^{n}$ for the 3-query LCC, then all vectors in $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{k}$ can be written as a $O_{\delta}(\log n)$ -sparse linear com-bination of the $v_{i}{\prime}s$, which immediately implies $\overline{k}\leq\overline{O}_{\delta}((\log n)^{2})$. The proof of this fact proceeds by iterativelyâˆ¼ reducing the size of any arbitrary linear combination of at least $\Omega_{\delta}(\log n)$ of the $v_{i}{\prime}s$. We achieve this using the recent breakthrough result of [4] on the existence of rainbow cycles in properly edge-colored graphs, applied to graphs capturing the linear dependencies underlying the local correction property.
