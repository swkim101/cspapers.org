Vizing's theorem states that any n-vertex m-edge graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be edge colored using at most $\Delta+1$ different colors [Diskret. Analiz, '64]. Vizing's original proof is algorithmic and shows that such an edge coloring can be found in $\tilde{O}(mn)$ time. This was subsequently improved to $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$, independently by Arjomandi [1982] and by Gabow et al. [1985]. In this paper we present an algorithm that computes such an edge coloring in $\tilde{O}(mn^{1/3})$, time, giving the first polynomial improvement for this fundamental problem in over 40 years.
