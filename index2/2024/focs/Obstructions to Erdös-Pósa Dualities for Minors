Let <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex> and <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex> be minor-closed graph classes. We say that the pair <tex>$(\mathcal{H},\ \mathcal{G})$</tex> is an Erdös-Pósa pair (EP-pair) if there exists a function <tex>$f$</tex> such that for every <tex>$k$</tex> and every graph <tex>$G\in \mathcal{G}$</tex>, either <tex>$G$</tex> has <tex>$k$</tex> pairwise vertex-disjoint sub graphs which do not belong to <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex>, or there exists a set <tex>$S\subseteq V(G)$</tex> of size at most <tex>$f(k)$</tex> for which <tex>$G-S\in \mathcal{H}$</tex>. The classic result of Erdös and Pósa says that if <tex>$\mathcal{F}$</tex> is the class of forests, then <tex>$(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G})$</tex> is an EP-pair for all graph classes <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex>. A minor-closed graph class <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex> is an EP-counterexample for <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex> if <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex> is minimal with the property that <tex>$(\mathcal{H},\ \mathcal{G})$</tex> is not an EP-pair. In this paper, we prove that for every minor-closed graph class <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex> the set <tex>$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathcal{H}}$</tex> of all EP-counterexamples for <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex> is finite. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of <tex>$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathcal{H}}$</tex> for every <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex> and give a constructive upper bound on its size. We show that each class <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex> in <tex>$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathcal{H}}$</tex> can be described as the set of all minors of some, suitably defined, sequence of grid-like graphs <tex>$\langle{W}_{k}\rangle_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$</tex>. Moreover, each <tex>$\mathrm{W}_{k}$</tex> admits a half-integral packing, i.e., <tex>$k$</tex> copies of some <tex>$H\not\in \mathcal{H}$</tex> where no vertex is used more than twice. This implies a complete delineation of the half-integrality threshold of the Erdös-Pósa property for minors and as a corollary, we obtain a constructive proof of Thomas' conjecture on the half-integral Erdös-Pósa property for minors which was recently confirmed by Liu. Our results are algorithmic. Let <tex>$h=h(\mathcal{H})$</tex> denote the maximum size of an obstruction to <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex>. For every minor-closed graph class <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex>, we construct an algorithm that, given a graph <tex>$G$</tex> and an integer <tex>$k$</tex>, either outputs a half-integral packing of <tex>$k$</tex> copies of some <tex>$H\not\in \mathcal{H}$</tex> or outputs a set of at most <tex>$2^{k^{\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{h}(1)}}$</tex> vertices whose deletion creates a graph in <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex> in time <tex>$2^{2^{k^{\mathcal{O}_{h}(1)}}}\cdot\vert G\vert ^{4}\log\vert G\vert$</tex>. Moreover, as a consequence of our results, for every minor-closed class <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex>, we obtain min-max-dualities, which may be seen as analogues of the celebrated Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour, for the recently introduced parameters <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex>-treewidth and elimination distance to <tex>$\mathcal{H}$</tex>.
