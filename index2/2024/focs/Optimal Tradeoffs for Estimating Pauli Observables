We revisit the problem of Pauli shadow tomography: given copies of an unknown n-qubit quantum state <tex>$\rho$</tex>, estimate Tr <tex>$(P\rho)$</tex> for some set of Pauli operators <tex>$F$</tex> to within additive error <tex>$\epsilon$</tex>. This has been a popular testbed for exploring the advantage of protocols with quantum memory over those without: with enough memory to measure two copies at a time, one can use Bell sampling to estimate <tex>$\vert \text{Tr}(P\rho)$</tex> for all <tex>$P$</tex> using <tex>$O(n/\epsilon^{4})$</tex> copies, but with <tex>$k\leq n$</tex> qubits of memory, <tex>$\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$</tex> copies are needed. These results leave open several natural questions. How does this picture change in the physically relevant setting where one only needs to estimate a certain subset of Paulis? What is the optimal dependence on <tex>$\epsilon ?$</tex> What is the optimal tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity? We answer all of these questions: •For any subset <tex>$A$</tex> of Paulis and any family of measurement strategies, we completely characterize the optimal sample complexity, up to <tex>$\log\vert A\vert$</tex> factors. •We show any protocol that makes poly <tex>$(n)$</tex> -copy measure-ments must make <tex>$\Omega(1/\epsilon^{4})$</tex> measurements. •For any protocol that makes poly <tex>$(n)$</tex> -copy measurements and only has <tex>$k < n$</tex> qubits of memory, we show that <tex>$\tilde{\Theta}(\min\{2^{n}/\epsilon^{2},2^{n-k}/\epsilon^{4}\})$</tex> copies are necessary and sufficient. The protocols we propose can also estimate the actual values <tex>$\text{Tr}(P\rho)$</tex>, rather than just their absolute values as in prior work. Additionally, as a byproduct of our techniques, we establish tight bounds for the task of purity testing and show that it exhibits an intriguing phase transition not present in the memory-sample tradeoff for Pauli shadow tomography.
