We study the communication complexity of multiplying <tex>$k\times t$</tex> elements from the group <tex>$H$</tex> = SL <tex>$(2, q)$</tex> in the number-on-forehead model with <tex>$k$</tex> parties. We prove a lower bound of <tex>$(t\log H)/c^{k}$</tex>. This is an exponential improvement over previous work, and matches the state-of-the-art in the area. Relatedly, we show that the convolution of <tex>$k^{c}$</tex> independent copies of a 3-uniform distribution over <tex>$H^{m}$</tex> is close to a <tex>$k$</tex>- uniform distribution. This is again an exponential improvement over previous work which needed <tex>$c^{k}$</tex> copies. The proofs are remarkably simple; the results extend to other quasirandom groups. We also show that for any group <tex>$LI$</tex>, any distribution over <tex>$H^{m}$</tex> whose weight-k Fourier coefficients are small is close to a k-uniform distribution. This generalizes previous work in the abelian setting, and the proof is simpler.
