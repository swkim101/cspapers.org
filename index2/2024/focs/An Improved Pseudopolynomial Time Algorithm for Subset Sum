We investigate pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for Subset Sum. Given a multi-set <tex>$X$</tex> of <tex>$n$</tex> positive integers and a target <tex>$t$</tex>, Subset Sum asks whether some subset of <tex>$X$</tex> sums to <tex>$t$</tex>. Bringmann proposes an <tex>$\tilde{O}(n+t)$</tex> -time algorithm [Bringmann SODA'17], and an open question has naturally arisen: can Subset Sum be solved in <tex>$O(n+w)$</tex> time? Here <tex>$w$</tex> is the maximum integer in <tex>$X$</tex>. We make a progress towards resolving the open question by proposing an <tex>$\tilde{O}(n+\sqrt{wt})$</tex> -time algorithm.
