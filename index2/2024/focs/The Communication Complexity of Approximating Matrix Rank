We fully determine the communication complexity of approximating matrix rank, over any finite field F. We study the most general version of this problem, where <tex>$0\leqslant r < R\leqslant n$</tex> are given integers and Alice and Bob need to determine whether their respective matrices <tex>$A, B\in \mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$</tex> satisfy rk <tex>$(A+B)=r$</tex> versus rk <tex>$(A+B)=R$</tex>. We show that this problem has commu-nication cost <tex>$\Omega(r^{2}\log\vert \mathbb{F}\vert)$</tex>, which is optimal. Our lower bound holds even for quantum protocols and even for error probability <tex>$\frac{1}{2}(1-\vert \mathbb{F}\vert ^{-r/3})$</tex>, which too is optimal because this problem has a two-bit classical protocol with error <tex>$\frac{1}{2}(1-\vert \mathbb{F}\vert ^{-\Theta(r)})$</tex>. Prior to our work, lower bounds were known only for constant-error protocols and only for consecutive integers <tex>$r$</tex> and <tex>$R$</tex>, with no implication for the approximation of matrix rank. We also settle an analogous question for subspaces, where Alice has a subspace <tex>$S$</tex>, Bob has a subspace <tex>$T$</tex>) and they need to approximate the dimension of the subspace <tex>$S+T$</tex> generated by <tex>$S$</tex> and <tex>$T$</tex> (equivalently, approximate the dimension of <tex>$S\cap T$</tex>). As an application, we obtain an <tex>$\Omega(n^{2}\log\vert \mathbb{F}\vert)/k$</tex> memory lower bound for any streaming algorithm with <tex>$k$</tex> passes that approximates the rank of an input matrix <tex>$M\in \mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$</tex> within a factor of <tex>$\sqrt{2}-\delta$</tex>, for any <tex>$\delta > 0$</tex>. Our result is an exponential improvement in <tex>$k$</tex> over previous work.
