A unitary k-design is an ensemble of unitaries that matches the first $k$ moments of the Haar measure. In this work, we provide two efficient constructions of k-designs on n-qubits using new random matrix theory techniques. Our first construction is based on exponentiating sums of random i.i.d. Hermitian matrices and uses O(k2n2)-many gates. In the spirit of central limit theorems, we show that this random sum approximates the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We then show that the product of just two exponentiated GUE matrices is already approximately Haar random. Our second construction is based on products of exponentiated sums of random permutations and uses Ã•($k$ poly ($n$)) many gates. The $k$ dependence is optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) and is inherited from the efficiency of existing k-wise independent permutations. Furthermore, replacing random permutations with quantum-secure pseudorandom permutations (PRPs), we also obtain a pseudorandom unitary (PRU) ensemble that is secure under nonadaptive queries. A central feature of both proofs is a new connection between the polynomial method in quantum query complexity and the large-dimension ($N$) expansion in random matrix theory. In particular, the first construction uses the polynomial method to control high moments of certain random matrix ensembles without requiring delicate Weingarten calculations. In doing so, we define and solve a moment problem on the unit circle, asking whether a finite number of equally weighted points can reproduce a given set of moments. In our second construction, the key step is to exhibit an orthonormal basis for irreducible representations of the partition algebra that has a low-degree large-$N$ expansion. This allows us to show that the distinguishing probability is a low-degree rational polynomial of the dimension $N$.
