The random oracle model (ROM) allows us to opti-mistically reason about security properties of cryptographic hash functions, and has been hugely influential in designing practical cryptosystems. But it is overly optimistic against non-uniform adversaries, and often suggests security properties and security levels unachievable by any real hash function. To reconcile with this discrepancy, Unruh [CRYPTO '07] proposed the auxiliary-input random oracle model (AI-ROM), where a non-uniform attacker additionally gets a bounded amount of advice about the random oracle. Proving security in the AI-ROM is often much more difficult, but a series of works starting with Unruh provided useful technical tools to do so. Although these tools lead to good results in the information-theoretic setting, they are unsatisfactory in the computational setting, where the random oracle is used alongside other computational hardness assumptions. At the most basic level, we did not even know whether it is possible to efficiently simulate random oracle queries given auxiliary input, which has remained as an explicit open problem since the work of Unruh. In this work, we resolve the above open problem and show how to efficiently simulate auxiliary-input random oracles. Moreover, the simulation has low concrete overhead, leading to small losses in exact security. We use it to prove the security of a broad class of computational schemes in the AI-ROM, including the first non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) scheme in the AI-ROM. As a tool of independent interest, we develop a new notion of ultra-secure pseudorandom functions with fast RAM evaluation, which can achieve $2^{\lambda}$ security while having sublinear $\mathrm{o}(\lambda)$ evaluation time.
