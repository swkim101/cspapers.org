For every <tex>$n > 0$</tex>, we show the existence of a CNF tautology over <tex>$O(n^{2})$</tex> variables of width <tex>$O(\log {\it n})$</tex> such that it has a Polynomial Calculus Resolution refutation over <tex>$\{0,1\}$</tex> variables of size <tex>$O(n^{3} \text{polylog} (n))$</tex> but any Polynomial Calculus refutation over <tex>$\{+1, -1\}$</tex> variables requires size <tex>$2^{\Omega(n)}$</tex>. This shows that Polynomial Calculus sizes over the {0, 1} and <tex>$\{+1,\ -1\}$</tex> bases are incomparable (since Tseitin tautologies show a separation in the other direction) and answers an open problem posed by Sokolov [1] and Razborov [2].
