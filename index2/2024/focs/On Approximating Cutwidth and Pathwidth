We study graph ordering problems with a min-max objective. A classical problem of this type is cutwidth, where given a graph we want to order its vertices such that the number of edges crossing any point is minimized. We give a $\log^{1+o(1)}(n)$ approximation for the problem, substantially improving upon the previous poly-logarithmic guarantees based on the standard recursive balanced partitioning approach of Leighton and Rao (FOCS'88). Our key idea is a new metric decomposition procedure that is suitable for handling min-max objectives, which could be of independent interest. We also use this to show other results, including an improved $\log^{1+o(1)}(n)$ approximation for computing the pathwidth of a graph.
