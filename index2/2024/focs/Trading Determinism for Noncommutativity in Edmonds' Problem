Let $X=X_{1} \sqcup X_{2} \sqcup \ldots \sqcup X_{k}$ be a partitioned set of variables such that the variables in each part $X_{i}$ are noncommuting but for any $i\neq j$, the variables $x\in X_{i}$ commute with the variables $x^{\prime}\in X_{j}$. Given as input a square matrix $T$ whose entries are linear forms over $\mathbb{Q}\langle X\rangle$ 〉, we consider the problem of checking if $T$ is invertible or not over the universal skew field of fractions of the partially commutative polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}\langle X\rangle$ [1]. In this paper, we design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem for constant $k$. The special case $k=1$ is the noncommutative Edmonds' problem (NSINGULAR) which has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm by recent results [2]–[4]. En-route, we obtain the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the equivalence testing problem of $k$-tape weighted automata (for constant $k$) resolving a longstanding open problem [5], [6]. Algebraically, the equivalence problem reduces to testing whether a partially commutative rational series over the partitioned set $X$ is zero or not [6]. Decidability of this problem was established by Harju and Karhumäki [5]. Prior to this work, a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was given by Worrell [6] and, subsequently, a deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithm was also developed [7].
