We prove a lower bound on the communication complexity of computing the <tex>$n$</tex> -fold xor of an arbitrary function <tex>$f$</tex>, in terms of the communication complexity and rank of <tex>$f$</tex>. We prove that <tex>$D(f^{\oplus n}) \geq n\cdot(\frac{\Omega(D(f))}{\log \mathrm{r}\mathrm{k}(t)}-\log \text{rk}(f))$</tex>, where here <tex>$D(f), D(f^{\oplus n})$</tex> represent the deterministic communication complexity, and <tex>$\text{rk}(f)$</tex> is the rank of <tex>$f$</tex>. Our methods involve a new way to use information theory to reason about deterministic communication complexity.
