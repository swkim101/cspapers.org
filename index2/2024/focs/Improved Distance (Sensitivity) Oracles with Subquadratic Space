A distance oracle (DO) for a graph <tex>$G$</tex> is a data structure that, when queried with vertices <tex>$s,t$</tex>, returns an estimate <tex>$\widehat{d}(s,t)$</tex> of their distance in <tex>$G$</tex>. The oracle has stretch <tex>$(\alpha, \beta)$</tex> if the estimate satisfies <tex>$d(s,t)\leqslant \widehat{d}(s,t)\leqslant \alpha\cdot d(s,t)+\beta$</tex>. An <tex>$f-\mathbf{edge}$</tex> fault-tolerant distance sensitivity oracle <tex>$(f-\mathbf{DSO})$</tex> additionally receives a set <tex>$F$</tex> of up to <tex>$f$</tex> edges and estimates the distance in <tex>$G-F$</tex>. Our first contribution is the design of new distance oracles with subquadratic space for undirected graphs. We show that introducing a small additive stretch <tex>$\beta > 0$</tex> allows one to make the multiplicative stretch <tex>$\alpha$</tex> arbitrarily small. This sidesteps a known lower bound of <tex>$\alpha\geqslant 3$</tex> (for <tex>$\beta=0$</tex> and subquadratic space) [Thorup & Zwick, JACM 2005]. We present a DO for graphs with edge weights in <tex>$[0, W]$</tex> that, for any positive integer <tex>$\ell$</tex> and any <tex>$c\in(0,\ell/2]$</tex>, has stretch <tex>$(1+\frac{1}{\ell},2W)$</tex>, space <tex>$\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\frac{c}{\ell}})$</tex>, and query time <tex>$O(n^{c})$</tex>, generalizing results by Agarwal and Godfrey [SODA 2013] to arbitrarily dense graphs. Our second contribution is a framework that turns an <tex>$(\alpha,\beta)- \mathbf{stretch}$</tex> DO for unweighted graphs into an <tex>$(\alpha(1+\varepsilon),\beta)-\mathbf{stretch}. f-\mathbf{DSO}$</tex> with sensitivity <tex>$f=o(\log(n)/\log\log n)$</tex> retaining sub-quadratic space. This generalizes a result by Bil√≤, Chechik, Choudhary, Cohen, Friedrich, Krogmann, and Schirneck [TheoretiCS 2024]. Combining the framework with our new DO gives an <tex>$f-\mathbf{DSO}$</tex> that, for any <tex>$\gamma\in(0, (\ell+1)/2]$</tex>, has stretch <tex>$((1+\frac{1}{\ell})(1+\varepsilon), 2)$</tex>, space <tex>$n^{2-\frac{\gamma}{(t+1)(f+1)}+o(1)}/\varepsilon^{f+2}$</tex>, and query time <tex>$\widetilde{O}(n^{\gamma}/\varepsilon^{2})$</tex>. This is the first <tex>$f-\mathbf{DSO}$</tex> with subquadratic space, near-additive stretch, and sublinear query time.
