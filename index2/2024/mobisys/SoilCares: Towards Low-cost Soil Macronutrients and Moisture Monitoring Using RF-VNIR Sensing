Accurate measurements of soil macronutrients (i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and moisture play a key role in smart agriculture. However, existing commodity soil sensors are often expensive and the achieved accuracy is unsatisfactory. To address these issues, we present SoilCares, a low-cost soil sensing system enabling accurate and simultaneous monitoring of the concentration levels of soil moisture and macronutrients. SoilCares overcomes key challenges of accommodating diverse soil types and soil textures by introducing a novel membrane-based scheme. For moisture sensing, SoilCares leverages the multi-modal fusion of RF and NIR signals to significantly increase the sensing accuracy. Through delicate hardware design, we enable negligible-cost sensor data transmission using the existing sensing hardware, building up a complete end-to-end soil sensing system. SoilCares is cost-effective ($63.5), portable (0.5 kg), and low-power (236 Î¼W), making it suitable for insitu deployment. On-site experimental results show that SoilCares achieves high macronutrient sensing accuracy with a low RMSE of 0.138, and extremely low moisture estimation error of 1%, outperforming the state-of-the-art research and expensive commodity moisture sensors on the market.
