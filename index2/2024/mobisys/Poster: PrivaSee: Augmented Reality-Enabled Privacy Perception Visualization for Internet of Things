Internet of Things (IoT) provides a wide range of services to improve convenience and comfort in our daily lives. However, various sensors equipped on IoT devices often raise privacy concerns. Prior works on privacy focus on passive protection from the data and device perspective, such as data encryption and communication protocol design. In this work, we introduce PrivaSee, an augmented reality (AR)-enabled privacy visualization platform to empower users with proactive privacy protection by enhancing their understanding of privacy perception for multimodal sensors.
