Acoustic metasurface was recently proposed to enhance the performance of acoustic communication and sensing. While promising, there are two issues hindering the adoption of acoustic metasurface for real-life usage. The first issue is that configurable metasurface is still expensive and unscalable. The second issue is that it is difficult for an acoustic metasurface to work in a large frequency range. In this paper, we present a wideband and configurable acoustic metasurface for the first time. We show that with a large number of metasurface elements, a cheap and simple two-state element design can achieve performance very close to that achieved by expensive continuous-state elements. We also fine-tune the geometric parameter of the element structure to support similar phase changes across a large frequency range, laying the foundation to enable wideband acoustic metasurface. Extensive experiments show that our system can achieve an average signal strength improvement of 7.5 dB and 10.5 dB in LoS and NLoS scenarios respectively with the help of a metasurface with a size of 17.6 Ã— 17.6 cm. Two representative sensing applications (i.e., respiration sensing and gesture recognition) and one communication case study are employed to show the effectiveness of the metasurface.
