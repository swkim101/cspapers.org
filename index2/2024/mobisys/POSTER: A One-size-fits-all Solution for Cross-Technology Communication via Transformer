Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technology that enables physical-layer direct communication from a WiFi sender to other Internet of Things (IoT) receivers via waveform emulation. Previous research has primarily relied on the reverse engineering to identify the suitable WiFi payloads capable of emulating waveforms similar to desired IoT packets (e.g., ZigBee). However, this approach has several limitations, including irreversibility, scalability challenges, symbol misalignment, and an over-reliance on empirical methods. In this work, we present XiTuXi, a one-size-fits-all solution to automatically achieve the CTC by taking advantage of the neural machine translation (NMT). Inspired by the task comparability between CTC and homophony-based cross-linguistic communication, we employ a well-known NMT model called Transformer to learn the rationale behind translating bit sequences for CTC without human intervention. Specifically, we introduce forward engineering as a solution to tackle the challenge of acquiring training datasets. By utilizing XiTuXi, we effortlessly achieved CTC across 30 protocol combinations (including 802.11b, g, n, ax, ah â†’ Zig-Bee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and Sigfox), ultimately freeing experts from the tedious tasks they faced previously.
