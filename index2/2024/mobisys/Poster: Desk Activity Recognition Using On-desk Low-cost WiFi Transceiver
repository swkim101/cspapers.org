Since office work has become large-scale and diversified in companies or organizations, work engagement and efficiency have been always an important index of a team's or group's evaluation because it is directly connected to their outcomes. In order to identify the group work context, we first need to recognize for what and how long the individual members are spending their time at their desks, but without privacy concerns and underestimation of their actual work. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the base system of personal desk activity recognition by using a low-cost compact WiFi node and its WiFi channel state information (CSI), which can lead to a lightweight group work context identification system. As a result, we achieved 94.2% desk activity recognition accuracy using the on-desk receiver, in recognizing five different classes.
