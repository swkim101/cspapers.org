Spatio-temporal data is utilized in various fields, but its scale is continuously growing, leading to significant labor and costs in storage and processing. Therefore, the value that can be derived from spatio-temporal data is diluted due to management costs. We propose a new data management flow using various metadata and common programs for spatio-temporal data utilization. Traditionally, various spatio-temporal data processing have been implemented and processed according to each spatio-temporal data. We defined spatio-temporal data structure metadata and performed data processing based on metadata using a common data processing program. Furthermore, we automated the generation of data structure metadata by combining our data skeleton recognition method and generative AI model. Using this flow, we expect to improve the sustainability of utilizing spatio-temporal data.
