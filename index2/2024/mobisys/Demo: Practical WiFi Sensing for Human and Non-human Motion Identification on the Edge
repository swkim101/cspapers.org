Addressing the pivotal challenge of discerning human and nonhuman activities in smart environments, in this demo, we present a system utilizing commercial WiFi transceivers for precise human and non-human motion differentiation through the walls. This system effectively filters non-human interference in smart home systems by extracting physically and statistically explainable features from ubiquitous WiFi signals. It passively recognizes moving subjects in real time without constraining their movement, even in complex environments. Tailored for edge computing, it ensures minimal resource consumption and generalizes well across various settings. Our long-term field tests confirm a high accuracy rate of 97.34% and a low false alarm rate of 1.75%, underscoring its robustness and readiness for practical deployment.
