Indoor activity recognition using WiFi sensing is expected to have a wide range of applications, such as monitoring the elderly and home security. The state of radio wave propagation is called Channel State Information (CSI) and can be obtained using specific devices. By collecting CSI and applying machine learning, it is possible to recognize activities. However, CSI is sensitive to changes in the environment, so whenever the arrangement of furniture or the layout of the room changes, it is necessary to re-collect sample data and retrain the model. Retraining a model requires annotation work, which is costly in terms of time and effort. To address this issue, this paper proposes an annotation system that uses backscatter tags to reduce the cost of data collection and model training. In this system, a backscatter tag that generates a frequency shift depending on its angle is attached to a person during data collection, and activity recognition is performed by detecting the presence of the frequency shift. The backscatter tag-based recognition results are then used as pseudo-ground truth for model update.
