Monitoring and controlling the exposure of an individual to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is crucial for personal health. The use of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals received by a personal off-the-shelf smartphone has been studied as a novel estimation method. In the existing method, satellites are grouped based on their positions and the signal information is represented by group statistics, leading to a coarse estimation. We propose a new UV index estimation method that directly utilizes satellite-wise information and their spatial relationships with a point-cloud neural network, considering the similarity between GNSS signals and point clouds. We collected GNSS signals and UV index data from two locations within the same area and demonstrated that the proposed method enhances the estimation accuracy and smoothness.
