Oral diseases affect an estimated 3.5 billion people globally, posing significant health challenges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adopting self-care practices and maintaining personal oral hygiene can substantially mitigate the prevalence of dental caries. While smartwatches have previously been utilized to track activities of daily living (ADL), their widespread availability has yet to be harnessed for accurately identifying tooth brushing activity among other common ADL. In this Work in Progress (WIP), we demonstrate how motion sensors integrated into smartwatches can effectively distinguish tooth brushing from seven other very similar ADL. We present our initial results that show a promising 94% accuracy with 84% sensitivity.
