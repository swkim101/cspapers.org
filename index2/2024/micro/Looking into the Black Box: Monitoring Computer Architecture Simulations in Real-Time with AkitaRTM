Computer architecture simulators are essential for validating novel chip designs. However, they often provide little transparency during execution. This opaqueness limits the ability of users to identify issues during the simulation, leading to both wasted computational and human time. We address these issues by providing an intuitive user experience during simulation execution. Particularly, we reveal the status of executions and allow users to control the execution of a computer architecture simulator through AkitaRTM, an interactive web-based tool for real-time monitoring of computer architecture simulations. We based its design on the design workflow inefficiencies experienced by computer architects when using simulations. We demonstrate AkitaRTM's utility through two case studies, the second leading to a patch in the simulator. Additionally, we conducted a user study with computer architects, aiming to validate AkitaRTM. We found that, in addition to solving the observed problems, AkitaRTM also provided an educational benefit by making simulators more transparent to users. Based on these findings, we reflect upon the design of AkitaRTM and provide guidance for future human-centered tools in this space.
