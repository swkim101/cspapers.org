With the emergence of GPUs as first-class compute engines, more concentrated focus has been put into covert and side channel discovery in these architectures. However, most of the covert and side channels uncovered on GPUs to date are rooted in “GPU cores”, which include computational cores, cache and core interconnects, but they do not consider “GPU uncore”, which include non-computational engines, GPU DRAM, host-G PU links and inter-GPulinks. In this paper, we delve into the less-explored domains of GPU uncore, unveiling four novel leakage sources for covert and side channel exploitation: (1) GPU DRAM frequency scaling; (2) NVENC utilization; (3) NVDEC utilization; (4) NVJPEG utilization. What makes these covert and side channels interesting is that they all take effect under the GPU MPS mode - which fractionalizes GPU cores and GPU memory on both desktop-scale and server-scale GPUs. Furthermore, our study reevaluates PCI-e bandwidth allocation on GPUs. Notably, we have engineered covert and side channel capable of bypassing GPU MIG isolation - a mechanism implemented by NVIDIA to physically segregate hardware resources on server-scale GPUs. Our research showcases concrete examples of these covert and side channels, highlighting their potency in breaching system security, all achieved without necessitating root privileges. This underscores the practical implications and urgency of addressing these vulnerabilities in GPU architectures.
