Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) architectures have been deployed in various commercial processors to provide secure environments for confidential programs and data. However, as a relatively new feature against security threats, existing designs still face a number of problems. Exploiting the management vulnerabilities, attackers can disclose secrets via controlled-channel or micro-architecture side-channel attacks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel TEE architecture, named HyperTEE. In our architecture, enclave management tasks are decoupled from the original computing subsystem to a dedicated, physically isolated Enclave Manage-ment Subsystem (EMS). A properly architected EMS prevents current management vulnerabilities and offers more secure enclave communication. We implemented the HyperTEE prototype on the FPGA platform. Experiments show that HyperTEE only introduces less than 1% area overhead, and 2.0 % and 1.9 % performance overhead on average for enclaves and non-enclave workloads, respectively.
