Large multi-socket machines are mission-critical high-performance systems for workloads requiring massive memory shared by hundreds of processors. Beyond eight sockets, such systems typically feature multi-hop inter-socket networks, exacerbating the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) challenge. NUMA effects stem from major disparity in latency and bandwidth characteristics of local and remote memory, often in the 4–10× range. While judicious data placement across the distributed memory's fragments can ameliorate NUMA effects, we observe that in challenging workloads with irregular access patterns, a large fraction of accessed pages are “vagabond”: being actively shared by multiple sockets, they lack a fitting home socket location. On 16-socket systems, such pages incur up to 75% remote memory accesses, which encounter significant latency overheads and bandwidth bottlenecks. StarNUMA introduces a new architectural block for multi-socket architectures to ameliorate the challenge posed by vagabond pages. By leveraging the capabilities of the emerging CXL interconnect, StarNUMA augments a typical NUMA architecture with a memory pool that is directly accessible by every socket in a single high-bandwidth interconnect hop. We show that placement of vagabond pages in StarNUMA's memory pool effectively curbs the latency overheads and queuing delays of the bandwidth-constrained multi-hop inter-socket network, reducing the average memory access time of 16-socket systems by 48%. In turn, faster memory access yields performance improvements of 1.54× on average, and up to 2.17×.
