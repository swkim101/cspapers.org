Recent breakthroughs in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based 3D reconstruction and rendering have spurred the possibility of immersive experiences in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). However, current NeRF acceleration techniques are still inadequate for real-world AR/VR applications due to: 1) the lack of end-to-end pipeline acceleration support, which causes impractical off-chip bandwidth demands for edge devices, and 2) limited scalability in handling large-scale scenes. To tackle these limitations, we have developed an end-to-end, scalable 3D acceleration framework called Fusion-3D, capable of instant scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Fusion-3D achieves these goals through two key innovations: 1) an optimized end-to-end processor for all three stages of the NeRF pipeline, featuring dynamic scheduling and hardware-aware sampling in the first stage, and a shared, reconfigurable pipeline with mixed-precision arithmetic in the second and third stages; 2) a multi-chip architecture for handling large-scale scenes, integrating a three-level hierarchical tiling scheme that minimizes inter-chip communication and balances workloads across chips. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Fusion-3D in facilitating real-time, energy-efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering. Specifically, we tape out a prototype chip in 28nm CMOS to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed end-to-end processor. Extensive simulation based on the on-silicon measurements demonstrates a $\mathbf{2.5}\times$ and $\mathbf{6}\times$ throughput improvement in training and inference, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, to assess the multi-chip architecture, we integrate four chips into a single PCB as a prototype. Further simulation results show that the multi-chip system achieves a $\mathbf{7.3}\times$ and $\mathbf{6.5}\times$ throughput improvement in training and inference, respectively, over the Nvidia 2080Ti GPU. To the best of our knowledge, Fusion-3D is the first to achieve both instant (≤ 2 seconds) 3D reconstruction and real-time (≥ 30 FPS) rendering, while only requiring the bandwidth of the most commonly used USB port (0.625 GB/s, 5 Gbps) in edge devices for off-chip communication.
