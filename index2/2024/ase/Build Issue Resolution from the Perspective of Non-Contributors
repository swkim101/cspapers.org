Open-source software (OSS) often needs to be built by roles who are not contributors. Despite the prevalence of build issues experienced by non-contributors, there is a lack of studies on this topic. This paper presents a study aimed at understanding the symptoms and causes of build issues experienced by non-contributors. The findings highlight certain build issues that are challenging to resolve and underscore the importance of understanding non-contributors’ behavior. This work lays the foundation for further research aimed at enhancing the non-contributors’ experience in dealing with build issues.CCS Concepts• Information systems → Open source software; • Software and its engineering → Application specific development environments.
