Mutation testing is a potentially effective method to assess test suite adequacy. Researchers have made mutation testing more computationally efficient, and new frameworks are regularly emerging. However, there is still limited adoption of mutation testing in industry. We hypothesize that such adoption is hindered by a lack of guidance on how to effectively and efficiently utilize mutation testing in a development workflow. To that end, we have conducted an industrial case study exploring the technical challenges of implementing mutation testing in continuous integration, what information from mutation testing is of use to developers, and how that information should be presented (in textual and visual form). Our results reveal five technical challenges of integrating mutation testing and nine key findings regarding how the results of mutation testing are used and presented. We also offer a dashboard to visualize mutation testing results, as well as 16 recommendations for making effective use of mutation testing in practice1.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software verification and validation; Collaboration in software development; Software configuration management and version control systems.
