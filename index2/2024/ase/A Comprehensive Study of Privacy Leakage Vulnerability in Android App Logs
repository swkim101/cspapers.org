Android is the most popular mobile operating system, which attracts countless users. However, Android app logs, which record Android runtime information, are often overlooked in privacy leakage vulnerability research. Existing studies on privacy leakage vulnerabilities in Android apps primarily focus on static and dynamic analysis, with a lack of comprehensive studies specifically addressing privacy leakage vulnerabilities in Android app logs. In this paper, we propose to conduct a comprehensive study to fill this research gap. Our study includes two aspects: (1) gathering real-world developers’ views on privacy leakage vulnerabilities in Android app logs and (2) exploring the status of privacy leakage vulnerabilities in the latest Android app logs. Our preliminary results indicate the potential of this study.CCS CONCEPTS• Security and privacy → Software security engineering.
