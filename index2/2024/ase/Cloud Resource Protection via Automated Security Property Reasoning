As cloud computing gains widespread adoption across various industries, securing cloud resources has become a top priority for cloud providers. However, ensuring configuration security among highly interconnected cloud resources is challenging due to the complexities of resource modeling, correlation analysis, and large-scale security checks. To tackle those practical challenges, we propose Security Invariants (SI), a precise, effective, and scalable tool that proactively protects cloud resources by automated security reasoning. We have integrated SI into the rigorous Amazon Web Services (AWS) security review process. Partnered with security engineers and other security scanners, SI periodically scans billions of cloud resources in pre-launch services for potential security risks, maximizing the security guarantees of cloud applications. The continuous assessment of evolving resources not only brings a deep understanding of cloud security risks but also introduces a generalized solution from the holistic security analysis perspective.
