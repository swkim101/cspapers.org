Regression testing is important but costly due to the large number of tests to run over frequent changes. Techniques to speed up regression testing such as regression test selection run fewer tests, but they risk missing to run some key tests that detect true faults.In this work, we investigate the effect of running tests in different test-orders on overall test runtime in Java projects. Variance in runtime across different test-orders can be due to various reasons, such as due to dependencies between tests. In our evaluation, we run tests in different, random test-orders, and we find on average that the slowest test-order per project can be slower than the fastest test-order by 31.17%. We also develop a technique for guiding a search for the fastest test-orders by clustering test-orders based on their runtimes and generating test-orders based on observed in-common relations between tests in the fastest test-orders.
