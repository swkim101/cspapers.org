Since its major release in 2006, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) has become the industry standard for interfacing a computer’s hardware and operating system, replacing BIOS. UEFI has higher privileged security access to system resources than any other software component, including the system kernel. Hence, identifying and characterizing vulnerabilities in UEFI is extremely important for computer security. However, automated detection and characterization of UEFI vulnerabilities is a challenging problem. Static vulnerability analysis techniques are scalable but lack precision (reporting many false positives), whereas symbolic analysis techniques are precise but are hampered by scalability issues due to path explosion and the cost of constraint solving. In this paper, we introduce a technique called STatic Analysis guided Symbolic Execution (STASE), which integrates both analysis approaches to leverage their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. We begin with a rule-based static vulnerability analysis on LLVM bitcode to identify potential vulnerability targets for symbolic execution. We then focus symbolic execution on each target to achieve precise vulnerability detection and signature generation. STASE relies on the manual specification of reusable vulnerability rules and attacker-controlled inputs. However, it automates the generation of harnesses that guide the symbolic execution process, addressing the usability and scalability of symbolic execution, which typically requires manual harness generation to reduce the state space. We implemented and applied STASE to the implementations of UEFI code base. STASE detects and generates vulnerability signatures for 5 out of 9 recently reported PixieFail vulnerabilities and 13 new vulnerabilities in Tianocore’s EDKII codebase.
