In recent years, automatic program repair has gained much attention in the research community. Generally, program repair approaches consider a faulty program and a test suite that captures the program’s intended behavior. The goal is automatically generating a patch that corrects the fault by identifying the faulty code locations, suggesting a candidate fix, and validating it against the provided tests. However, most existing program repair tools focus on Java or C programs, while Python, one of the most popular programming languages, lacks approaches that work on it.We present FixKit, a collection of five program repair approaches for Python programs. Moreover, our framework allows for easy integration of new repair approaches and swapping individual components, such as fault localization. Our framework enables researchers to compare and investigate various repair, fault localization effortlessly, and validation approaches on a common set of techniques.CCS Concepts• Software and its engineering → Software testing and debugging; Search-based software engineering; Genetic programming; Software libraries and repositories.
