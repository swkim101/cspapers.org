This research explores the transformative potential of generative AI in software development. Generative AI is revolutionizing the field by offering capabilities to automatically generate, refactor, and test code. Through the use of action research, new methods and tools based on generative AI models are studied and developed. The initial focus is on the models’ ability to comprehend high-level design concepts. Subsequently, the research moves into the augmented generation of software artifacts. Finally, organization-specific or task-specific methods are introduced to enhance software developers’ productivity and experience.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software development process management; Software development methods;
