Since Google introduced Kotlin as an official programming language for developing Android apps in 2017, Kotlin has gained widespread adoption in Android development. However, compared to Java, there is limited support for Kotlin code dependency analysis, which is the foundation to software analysis. To bridge this gap, we develop Depends-Kotlin to extract entities and their dependencies in Kotlin source code. Not only does Depends-Kotlin support extracting entitiesâ€™ dependencies in Kotlin code, but it can also extract dependency relations between Kotlin and Java. Using three open-source Kotlin-Java mixing projects as our subjects, Depends-Kotlin demonstrates high accuracy and performance in resolving Kotlin-Kotlin and Kotlin-Java dependencies relations. The source code of Depends-Kotlin and the dataset used have been made available at https://github.com/XYZboom/depends-kotlin. We also provide a screen-cast presenting Depends-Kotlin at https://youtu.be/ZPq8SRhgXzM.
