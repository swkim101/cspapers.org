In this paper, we present MADE-WIC, a large dataset of functions and their comments with multiple annotations for technical debt and code weaknesses leveraging different state-of-the-art approaches. It contains about 860K code functions and more than 2.7M related comments from 12 open-source projects. To the best of our knowledge, no such dataset is publicly available. MADE-WIC aims to provide researchers with a curated dataset on which to test and compare tools designed for the detection of code weaknesses and technical debt. As we have fused existing datasets, researchers have the possibility to evaluate the performance of their tools by also controlling the bias related to the annotation definition and dataset construction.
