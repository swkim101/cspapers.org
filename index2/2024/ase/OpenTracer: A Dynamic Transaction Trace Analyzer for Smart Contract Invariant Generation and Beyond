Smart contracts, self-executing programs on the blockchain, facilitate reliable value exchanges without centralized oversight. Despite the recent focus on dynamic analysis of their transaction histories in both industry and academia, no open-source tool currently offers comprehensive tracking of complete transaction information to extract user-desired data such as invariant-related data. This paper introduces OpenTracer, designed to address this gap. OpenTracer guarantees comprehensive tracking of every execution step, providing complete transaction information. OpenTracer has been employed to analyze 350,800 Ethereum transactions, successfully inferring 23 different types of invariant from predefined templates. The tool is fully open-sourced, serving as a valuable resource for developers and researchers aiming to extract or validate new invariants from transaction traces. A demonstration video of OpenTracer is available at https://youtu.be/vTdmjWdYd30.
