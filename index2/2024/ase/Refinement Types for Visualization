Visualizations have become crucial in the contemporary data-driven world as they aid in exploring, verifying, and sharing insights obtained from data. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of visu-alization synthesis based on refinement types. Besides input-output examples, users can optionally use refinement-type annotations to constrain the range of valid values in the example visualization or to express complex interactions between different visual components. Our systemâ€™s outputs include both data transformation and visualization programs that are consistent with refinement-type specifications. To mitigate the scalability challenge during the synthesis process, we introduce a new visualization synthesis algorithm that uses lightweight bidirectional type checking to prune the search space. As we demonstrate experimentally, this new synthesis algorithm results in significant speed-up compared to prior work.We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called Calico and evaluated it on 40 visualization tasks collected from online forums and tutorials. Our experiments show that Calico can solve 98% of these benchmarks and, among those benchmarks that can be solved, the desired visualization is among the top-1 output generated by Calico. Furthermore, Calico takes an average of 1.56 seconds to generate the visualization, which is 50 times faster than Viser, a state-of-the-art synthesizer for data visualization.
