Workflows are pervasive in software systems where business processes and scientific methods are implemented as workflow models to achieve automated process execution. However, despite the benefit of no/low-code workflow automation, creating workflow models requires in-depth domain knowledge and nontrivial workflow modeling skills, which becomes a hurdle for the proliferation of workflow applications. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied in software code generation given their outstanding ability to understand complex instructions and generate accurate, context-aware code. Inspired by the success of LLMs in code generation, this paper aims to investigate how to use LLMs to automate workflow model generation. We present LLM4Workflow, an LLM-based automated workflow model generation tool. Using workflow descriptions as the input, LLM4Workflow can automatically embed relevant API knowledge and leverage LLMâ€™s powerful contextual learning abilities to generate correct and executable workflow models. Its effectiveness was validated through functional verification and simulation tests on a real-world workflow system. LLM4Workflow is open sourced at https://github.com/ISEC-AHU/LLM4Workflow, and the demo video is provided at https://youtu.be/XRQ0saKkuxY.
