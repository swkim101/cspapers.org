The success of language models in code assistance has spurred the proposal of repository-level code completion as a means to enhance prediction accuracy, utilizing the context from the entire codebase. However, this comprehensive context comes at a cost: while it enhances model performance, it also increases inference latency. This balance between improved accuracy and computational efficiency poses a significant challenge in real-world applications. We present RepoGenix, a solution that enhances repository-level code completion without increased latency. RepoGenix combines analogous context and relevant context, using Context-Aware Selection technology to efficiently compress these contexts into limited-size prompts. Our experiments on CrossCodeEval demonstrate that RepoGenix not only achieves a substantial 48.41% reduction in inference time, but also yields improvement in performance compared to baseline methods. We have successfully implemented and tested RepoGenix within AntGroup’s development environments. This approach is being extended to multiple programming languages and will be open-sourced, aiming to enhance code completion efficiency for the broader developer community.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Automatic programming.
