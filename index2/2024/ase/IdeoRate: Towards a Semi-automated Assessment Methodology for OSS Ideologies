Open source software (OSS) development, as any social movement, is driven by its ideologies, namely OSS ideologies [6] . Understanding OSS ideologies could provide significant insights into open source development, since OSS ideologies determine and influence the dynamics and outcomes of open source development [1] , [2] . Assessing OSS ideologies within open source projects could bring various benefits to OSS practitioners, e.g., the owners and the maintainers of open source projects could identify important ideological elements that were previously ignored, and could improve open source development accordingly. Therefore, with such an assessment of OSS ideologies, institutional and individual stakeholders who are interested in open source development could make informed decisions when interacting with open source projects.
