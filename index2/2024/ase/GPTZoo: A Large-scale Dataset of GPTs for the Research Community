The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, with GPTs, customized versions of ChatGPT available on the GPT Store, emerging as a prominent technology for specific domains and tasks. To support academic research on GPTs, we introduce GPTZoo, a large-scale dataset comprising 730,420 GPT instances. Each instance includes rich metadata with 21 attributes describing its characteristics, as well as instructions, knowledge files, and third-party services utilized during its development. GPTZoo aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive and readily available resource to study the real-world applications, performance, and potential of GPTs. To facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis of GPTs, we also developed an automated command-line interface (CLI) that supports keyword-based searching of the dataset. To promote open research and innovation, the GPTZoo dataset will undergo continuous updates, and we are granting researchers public access to GPTZoo and its associated tools.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software libraries and repositories.
