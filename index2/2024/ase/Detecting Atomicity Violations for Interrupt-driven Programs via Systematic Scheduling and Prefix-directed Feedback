Interrupt-driven programs are widely used in safety-critical fields like aerospace and embedded systems. However, the unpredictable interleaving of Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) can lead to concurrency bugs, particularly atomicity violations when ISRs preempt atomic sequences of instructions. To address this, we propose a dynamic approach for detecting atomicity violations in interrupt-driven programs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is more precise and efficient than related approaches.
