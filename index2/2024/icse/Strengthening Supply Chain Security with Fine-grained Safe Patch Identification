Enhancing supply chain security is crucial, often involving the detection of patches in upstream software. However, current security patch analysis works yield relatively low recall rates (i.e., many security patches are missed). In this work, we offer a new solution to detect safe patches and assist downstream developers in patch propagation. Specifically, we develop SPATCH to detect fine-grained safe patches. SPATCH leverages fine-grained patch analysis and a new differential symbolic execution technique to analyze the functional impacts of code changes. We evaluated SPATCH on various software, including the Linux kernel and OpenSSL, and demonstrated that it outperformed existing methods in detecting safe patches, resulting in observable security benefits. In our case studies, we updated hundreds of functions in modern software using safe patches detected by SPATCH without causing any regression issues. Our detected safe security patches have been merged into the latest version of downstream software like ProtonVpn.
