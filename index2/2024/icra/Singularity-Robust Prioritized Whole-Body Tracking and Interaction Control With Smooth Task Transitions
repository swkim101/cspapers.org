In this work, we propose a singularity-robust whole-body control framework that ensures smooth task transitions while maintaining strict priorities. The weighted generalized inverse is adopted to derive a hierarchical control law compatible with singular and redundant tasks. Moreover, a smooth activation matrix is proposed to continuously shape both null-space projectors and task-level control actions. Validation has been conducted in MATLAB/Simulink and MuJoCo simulations with Rollinâ€™ Justin.
