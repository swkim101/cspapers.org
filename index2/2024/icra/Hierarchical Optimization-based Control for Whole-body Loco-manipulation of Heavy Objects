In recent years, the field of legged robotics has seen growing interest in enhancing the capabilities of these robots through the integration of articulated robotic arms. However, achieving successful loco-manipulation, especially involving interaction with heavy objects, is far from straightforward, as object manipulation can introduce substantial disturbances that impact the robot’s locomotion. This paper presents a novel framework for legged loco-manipulation that considers whole-body coordination through a hierarchical optimization-based control framework. First, an online manipulation planner computes the manipulation forces and manipulated object task-based reference trajectory. Then, pose optimization aligns the robot’s trajectory with kinematic constraints. The resultant robot reference trajectory is executed via a linear MPC controller incorporating the desired manipulation forces into its prediction model. Our approach has been validated in simulation and hardware experiments, highlighting the necessity of whole-body optimization compared to the baseline locomotion MPC when interacting with heavy objects. Experimental results with Unitree Aliengo, equipped with a custom-made robotic arm, showcase its ability to lift and carry an 8kg payload and manipulate doors.
