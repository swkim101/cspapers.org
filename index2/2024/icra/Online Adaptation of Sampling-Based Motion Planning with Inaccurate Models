Robotic manipulation relies on analytical or learned models to simulate the system dynamics. These models are often inaccurate and based on offline information, so that the robot planner is unable to cope with mismatches between the expected and the actual behavior of the system (e.g., the presence of an unexpected obstacle). In these situations, the robot should use information gathered online to correct its planning strategy and adapt to the actual system response. We propose a sampling-based motion planning approach that uses an estimate of the model error and online observations to correct the planning strategy at each new replanning. Our approach adapts the cost function and the sampling bias of a kinodynamic motion planner when the outcome of the executed transitions is different from the expected one (e.g., when the robot unexpectedly collides with an obstacle) so that future trajectories will avoid unreliable motions. To infer the properties of a new transition, we introduce the notion of context-awareness, i.e., we store local environment information for each executed transition and avoid new transitions with context similar to previous unreliable ones. This is helpful for leveraging online information even if the simulated transitions are far (in the state-and-action space) from the executed ones. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed approach increases the success rate in execution and reduces the number of replannings needed to reach the goal.
