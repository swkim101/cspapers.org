This paper addresses the problem of the communication of optimally compressed information for mobile robot path-planning. In this context, mobile robots compress their current local maps to assist another robot in reaching a target in an unknown environment. We propose a framework that sequentially selects the optimal level of compression, guided by the robotâ€™s path, by balancing map resolution and communication cost. Our approach is tractable in close-to-real scenarios and does not necessitate prior environment knowledge. We design a novel decoder that leverages compressed information to estimate the unknown environment via convex optimization with linear constraints and an encoder that utilizes the decoder to select the optimal compression. Numerical simulations are conducted both in a large close-to-real map and a maze map and compared with two alternative approaches. The results confirm the effectiveness of our framework in assisting the robot reach its target by reducing transmitted information, on average, by approximately 50%, while maintaining satisfactory performance.
