Capsule endoscopes, predominantly serving diagnostic functions, provide lucid internal imagery but are devoid of surgical or therapeutic capabilities. Consequently, despite lesion detection, physicians frequently resort to traditional endoscopic or open surgical procedures for treatment, resulting in more complex, potentially risky interventions. To surmount these limitations, this study introduces a chained flexible capsule endoscope (FCE) design concept, specifically conceived to navigate the inherent volume constraints of capsule endoscopes whilst augmenting their therapeutic functionalities. The FCEâ€™s distinctive flexibility originates from a conventional rotating joint design and the incision pattern in the flexible material. In vitro experiments validated the passive navigation ability of the FCE in rugged intestinal tracts. Further, the FCE demonstrates consistent reptile-like peristalsis under the influence of an external magnetic field, and possesses the capability for film expansion and disintegration under high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation. These findings illuminate a promising path toward amplifying the therapeutic capacities of capsule endoscopes without necessitating a size compromise.
