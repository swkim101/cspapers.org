RGB-D cameras are crucial in robotic perception, given their ability to produce images augmented with depth data. However, their limited field of view (FOV) often requires multiple cameras to cover a broader area. In multi-camera RGB-D setups, the goal is typically to reduce camera overlap, optimizing spatial coverage with as few cameras as possible. The extrinsic calibration of these systems introduces additional complexities. Existing methods for extrinsic calibration either necessitate specific tools or highly depend on the accuracy of camera motion estimation. To address these issues, we present PeLiCal, a novel line-based calibration approach for RGB-D camera systems exhibiting limited overlap. Our method leverages long line features from surroundings, and filters out outliers with a novel convergence voting algorithm, achieving targetless, real-time, and outlier-robust performance compared to existing methods. We open source our implementation on https://github.com/joomeok/PeLiCal.git.
