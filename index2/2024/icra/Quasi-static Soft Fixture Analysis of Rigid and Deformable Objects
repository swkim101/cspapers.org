â€”We present a sampling-based approach and initial experiments to reasoning about the manipulation of both rigid and a simplified class of deformable objects, modeled as articulated rigid bodies with gravitational and elastic potential energy in 3D. We extend earlier work generalizing the notion of caging to include energy function constraints to allow for a quasi-static analysis and the inclusion of elastic potential energy of deformable objects. While past works on caging have predominantly focused on provably correct algorithms applicable to restricted simple classes of rigid objects such as polygons in 2D or simple meshes in 3D, our approach only provides upper bounds to escape energies, but in return allows for the analysis of such soft fixtures in much higher-dimensional configuration spaces. In this workshop contribution, we present initial demonstrations of simulation scenarios indicating that our approach can be applied to the analysis of escape energy for quasi-static manipulation scenarios involving rigid and articulated objects. Simulation results indicate that a variation of a BIT*-based motion planner outperforms an incremental search-based RRT planner as a baseline for this application in particular.
