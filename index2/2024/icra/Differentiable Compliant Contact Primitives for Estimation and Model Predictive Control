Control techniques like MPC can realize contact-rich manipulation which exploits dynamic information, maintaining friction limits and safety constraints. However, contact geometry and dynamics are required to be known. This information is often extracted from CAD, limiting scalability and the ability to handle tasks with varying geometry. To reduce the need for a priori models, we propose a framework for estimating contact models online based on torque and position measurements. To do this, compliant contact models are used, connected in parallel to model multi-point contact and constraints such as a hinge. They are parameterized to be differentiable with respect to all of their parameters (rest position, stiffness, contact location), allowing the coupled robot/environment dynamics to be linearized or efficiently used in gradient-based optimization. These models are then applied for: offline gradient-based parameter fitting, online estimation via an extended Kalman filter, and online gradient-based MPC. The proposed approach is validated on two robots, showing the efficacy of sensorless contact estimation and the effects of online estimation on MPC performance.
