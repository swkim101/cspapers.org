Safe corridor-based Trajectory Optimization (TO) presents an appealing approach for collision-free path planning of autonomous robots, because its convex formulation can guarantee global optimality. The safe corridor is constructed based on the obstacle map, however, the non-ideal perception induces uncertainty, which is rarely considered in the context of trajectory generation. In this paper, we propose Distributionally Robust Safe Corridor Constraints (DRSCCs) to consider the uncertainty of the safe corridor. Then, we integrate DRSCCs into the trajectory optimization framework using Bernstein basis polynomials. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the proposed trajectory optimization problem is equivalent to a convex quadratic program, which is computationally efficient to deploy onto real robots. The simulation results show that our method enhances navigation safety by significantly reducing the infeasible motions compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed approach is validated through two robotic applications, a micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a quadruped robot Unitree A1.
