In the field of space exploration, floating platforms play a crucial role in scientific investigations and technological advancements. However, controlling these platforms in zerogravity environments presents unique challenges, including uncertainties and disturbances. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Model Predictive Control (MPC) in the zero-gravity laboratory (Zero-G Lab) at the University of Luxembourg. This approach leverages PPO’s reinforcement learning power and MPC’s precision to navigate the complex control dynamics of floating platforms. Unlike traditional control methods, this PPO-MPC approach learns from MPC predictions, adapting to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances, resulting in a resilient control framework tailored to the zerogravity environment. Simulations and experiments in the Zero-G Lab validate this approach, showcasing the adaptability of the PPO agent. This research opens new possibilities for controlling floating platforms in zero-gravity settings, promising advancements in space exploration.
