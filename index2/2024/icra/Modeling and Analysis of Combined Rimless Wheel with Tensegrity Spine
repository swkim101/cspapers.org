In the natural world, benefited from the advantages of the spine, quadrupeds exhibiting extraordinary flexibility which allowing them to move efficiently on variable terrains. The previous researches have indicated the legged robots which efficiently utilizing their spine can achieve rapid and stable locomotion. However, within the field of legged robot dynamics, the design of the spine and understanding how it positively influences locomotion is unclear, which is significant for quadruped robot to achieve efficient and stable walking. In this study, we proposed a model formed by tensegrity spine and rimless wheel to represent quadrupeds, using passive dynamic walking as a method, which has been well-demonstrated for observing the inherent characteristics, exhibited the locomotion characteristic of the model proposed. By numerical simulation, we observed change trend of locomotion performance with the configurations of spineâ€™s shape, and found direction of spine design that have a positive impact on walking. These findings contribute to the design of spine structures in quadruped robots.
