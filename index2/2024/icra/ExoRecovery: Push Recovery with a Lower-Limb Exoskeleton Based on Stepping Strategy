Balance loss is a significant challenge in lower-limb exoskeleton applications, as it can lead to potential falls, thereby impacting user safety and confidence. We introduce a control framework for omnidirectional recovery step planning by online optimization of step duration and position in response to external forces. We map the step duration and position to a human-like foot trajectory, which is then translated into joint trajectories using inverse kinematics. These trajectories are executed via an impedance controller, promoting cooperation between the exoskeleton and the user. Moreover, our framework is based on the concept of the divergent component of motion, also known as the Extrapolated Center of Mass, which has been established as a consistent dynamic for describing human movement. This real-time online optimization framework enhances the adaptability of exoskeleton users under unforeseen forces thereby improving the overall user stability and safety. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, simulations, and experiments were conducted. Our push recovery experiments employing the exoskeleton in zero-torque mode (without assistance) exhibit an alignment with the exoskeletonâ€™s recovery assistance mode, that shows the consistency of the control framework with human intention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cooperative push recovery framework for the lower-limb human exoskeleton that relies on the simultaneous adaptation of intra-stride parameters in both frontal and sagittal directions. The proposed control scheme has been validated with human subject experiments.
