Several robotic systems have emerged in the recent past to enhance the precision of micro-surgeries such as retinal procedures. Significant advancements have recently been achieved to increase the precision of such systems beyond surgeon capabilities. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of non-predicted and sudden movements of the patient and the environment. Therefore, analyzing environmental motion and vibrations is crucial to ensuring the optimal performance and reliability of medical systems that require micron-level precision, especially in real-life scenarios.To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel environmental motion analysis system that employs a grid layout with distributed sensing nodes throughout the environment. This system effectively tracks undesired movements (motions) at designated locations and predicts upcoming motions using neural network-based approaches. The outcomes of our experiments exhibit promising prospects for real-time motion monitoring and prediction, which has the potential to form a solid basis for enhancing the automation, safety, integration, and overall efficiency of robot-assisted micro-surgeries.
