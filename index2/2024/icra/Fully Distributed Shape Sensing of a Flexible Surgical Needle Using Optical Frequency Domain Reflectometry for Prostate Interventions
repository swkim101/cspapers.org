In minimally invasive procedures such as biopsies and prostate cancer brachytherapy, accurate needle placement remains challenging due to limitations in current tracking methods related to interference, reliability, resolution or image contrast. This often leads to frequent needle adjustments and reinsertions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an optimized needle shape-sensing method using a fully distributed grating-based sensor. The proposed method uses simple trigonometric and geometric modeling of the fiber using optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR), without requiring prior knowledge of tissue properties or needle deflection shape and amplitude. Our optimization process includes a reproducible calibration process and a novel tip curvature compensation method. We validate our approach through experiments in artificial isotropic and inhomogeneous animal tissues, establishing ground truth using 3D stereo vision and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisitions, respectively. Our results yield an average RMSE ranging from 0.58 ± 0.21 mm to 0.66 ± 0.20 mm depending on the chosen spatial resolution, achieving the submillimeter accuracy required for interventional procedures.
