Robots that operate in agricultural environments need a robust perception system that can deal with occlusions, which are naturally present in agricultural scenarios. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating 3D shapes of fruits when only partial observations are available. Generally speaking, such a shape completion can be realized by exploiting prior knowledge about the geometry of the fruit. This is typically done by template matching using traditional optimization algorithms, which are slow but accurate, or by encoding such knowledge into the weights of a neural network, leading to faster but often less accurate estimates. Our approach combines the best of both worlds. It exploits the benefit of having a template representing our object of interest with the advantages of using a neural network to learn how to deform a template. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach yields accurate estimation at a competitively low inference time in challenging greenhouse environments.
