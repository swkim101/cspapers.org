This article introduces an experimental emulation of a novel chunk-based flexible multi-DoF aerial 3D printing framework. The experimental demonstration of the overall autonomy focuses on precise motion planning and task allocation for a UAV, traversing through a series of planned space-filling paths involved in the aerial 3D printing process without physically depositing the overlaying material. The flexible multi-DoF aerial 3D printing is a newly developed framework and has the potential to strategically distribute the envisioned 3D model to be printed into small, manageable chunks suitable for distributed 3D printing. Moreover, by harnessing the dexterous flexibility due to the 6 DoF motion of UAV, the framework enables the provision of integrating the overall autonomy stack, potentially opening up an entirely new frontier in additive manufacturing. However, itâ€™s essential to note that the feasibility of this pioneering concept is still in its very early stage of development, which yet needs to be experimentally verified. Towards this direction, experimental emulation serves as the crucial stepping stone, providing a pseudo mockup scenario by virtual material deposition, helping to identify technological gaps from simulation to reality. Experimental emulation results, supported by critical analysis and discussion, lay the foundation for addressing the technological and research challenges to significantly push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art 3D printing mechanism. - Full mission video available at https://youtu.be/gfZuYCA8jAw
