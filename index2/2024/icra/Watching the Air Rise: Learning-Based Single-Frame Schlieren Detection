Detecting air flows caused by phenomena such as heat convection is valuable in multiple scenarios, including leak identification and locating thermal updrafts for extending UAV flight duration. Unfortunately, the heat signature of these flows is often too subtle to be seen by a thermal camera. While convection also leads to fluctuations in air density and hence causes so-called schlieren – intensity and color variations in images – existing techniques such as Background-oriented schlieren (BOS) allow detecting them only against a known background and from a static camera, making these approaches unsuitable for moving vehicles. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of visualizing air movement by predicting the corresponding schlieren-induced optical flow from a single greyscale image captured by a moving camera against an unfamiliar background. We first record and label a set of optical flows in an indoor setup using standard BOS techniques. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN) by applying the previously collected optical flow distortions to a dataset containing a mixture of real and synthetically generated images to predict the two-dimensional optical flow from a single image. Finally, we evaluate our approach on the task of extracting the optical flow caused by schlieren from both a static and moving camera on previously unseen flow patterns and background images.
