Food handling is a challenging task for robotic grippers, as it requires to manipulate highly deformable and fragile items, that can be easily damaged. Moreover, ingredients for the preparation of the different dishes are usually stored in small containers that are often not easily accessible. This paper introduces an innovative soft-rigid, tendon-driven gripper: the Double-Scoop Gripper (DSG). Its two-fingered design exploits a specialized structure to cope with constrained spaces (e.g., containers in narrow shelves). The DSG can delicately grasp objects of various shapes by employing two scoop-shaped fingertips that can form a single plate when fingers are flexed. Data obtained from an on-board camera are used to detect the food item features and plan the grasping strategy that better exploits the possible environmental constraints regulating the opening of the two fingers and the approaching direction of the gripper. DSG capabilities are verified with experiments conducted using real food ingredients within a pick-and-place setup to evaluate both the grasping and the releasing capability of the gripper. Obtained results are promising and suggest that this approach could be particularly advantageous in the context of automated food serving.
