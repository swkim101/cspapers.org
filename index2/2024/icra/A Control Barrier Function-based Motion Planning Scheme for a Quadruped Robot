A Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based motion planning algorithm is proposed. The algorithm explores an unknown environment to reach a target point, providing velocity commands to the robot controller module. CBFs, along with a circulation inequality are used to generate safe paths toward the goal while preventing collisions with obstacles. The proposed global navigation scheme is experimentally verified on a quadruped platform to demonstrate safe, collision-free exploration over long distances.
