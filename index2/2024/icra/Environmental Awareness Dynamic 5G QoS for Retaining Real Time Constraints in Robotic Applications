The fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology is mature and increasingly utilized in many industrial and robotics applications, while an important functionality is the advanced Quality of Service (QoS) features. Despite the prevalence of 5G QoS discussions in the related literature, there is a notable absence of real-life implementations and studies concerning their application in time-critical robotics scenarios. This article considers the operation of time-critical applications for 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and how their operation can be improved by the possibility to dynamically switch between QoS data flows with different priorities. As such, we introduce a robotics oriented analysis on the impact of the 5G QoS functionality on the performance of 5G-enabled UAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel framework for the dynamic selection of distinct 5G QoS data flows that is autonomously managed by the 5G-enabled UAV. This problem is addressed in a novel feedback loop fashion utilizing a probabilistic finite state machine (PFSM). Finally, the efficacy of the proposed scheme is experimentally validated with a 5G-enabled UAV in a real-world 5G stand-alone (SA) network. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWtMOlVMEFI&t=1s
