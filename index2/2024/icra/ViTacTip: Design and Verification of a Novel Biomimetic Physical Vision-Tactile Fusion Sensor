Tactile sensing is significant for robotics since it can obtain physical contact information during manipulation. To capture multimodal contact information within a compact framework, we designed a novel sensor called ViTacTip, which seamlessly integrates both tactile and visual perception capabilities into a single, integrated sensor unit. ViTacTip features a transparent skin to capture fine features of objects during contact, which can be known as the see-through-skin mechanism. In the meantime, the biomimetic tips embedded in ViTacTip can amplify touch motions during tactile perception. For comparative analysis, we also fabricated a ViTac sensor devoid of biomimetic tips, as well as a TacTip sensor with opaque skin. Furthermore, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach for modality switching between different perception modes, effectively alternating the emphasis between vision and tactile perception modes. We conducted a performance evaluation of the proposed sensor across three distinct tasks: i) grating identification, ii) pose regression, iii) contact localization and force estimation. In the grating identification task, ViTacTip demonstrated an accuracy of 99.72%, surpassing TacTip, which achieved 94.60%. It also exhibited superior performance in both pose and force estimation tasks with the minimum error of 0.08 mm and 0.03N, respectively, in contrast to ViTacâ€™s 0.12 mm and 0.15N. Results indicate that ViTacTip outperforms single-modality sensors.
