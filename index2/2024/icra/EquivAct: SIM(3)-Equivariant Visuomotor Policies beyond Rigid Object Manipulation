If a robot masters folding a kitchen towel, we would expect it to master folding a large beach towel. However, existing policy learning methods that rely on data augmentation still donâ€™t guarantee such generalization. Our insight is to add equivariance to both the visual object representation and policy architecture. We propose EquivAct which utilizes SIM(3)-equivariant network structures that guarantee generalization across all possible object translations, 3D rotations, and scales by construction. EquivAct is trained in two phases. We first pre-train a SIM(3)-equivariant visual representation on simulated scene point clouds. Then, we learn a SIM(3)-equivariant visuomotor policy using a small amount of source task demonstrations. We show that the learned policy directly transfers to objects that substantially differ from demonstrations in scale, position, and orientation. We evaluate our method in three manipulation tasks involving deformable and articulated objects, going beyond typical rigid object manipulation tasks considered in prior work. We conduct experiments both in simulation and in reality. For real robot experiments, our method uses 20 human demonstrations of a tabletop task and transfers zero-shot to a mobile manipulation task in a much larger setup. Experiments confirm that our contrastive pre-training procedure and equivariant architecture offer significant improvements over prior work. Project website: equivact.github.io
