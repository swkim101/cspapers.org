The trade-off between computation time and path optimality is a key consideration in motion planning algorithms. While classical sampling based algorithms fall short of computational efficiency in high dimensional planning, learning based methods have shown great potential in achieving time efficient and optimal motion planning. The SOTA learning based motion planning algorithms utilize paths generated by sampling based methods as expert supervision data and train networks via regression techniques. However, these methods often overlook the important multimodal property of the optimal paths in the training set, making them incapable of finding good paths in some scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Neuron Planner (MNP) based on the mixture density networks that explicitly takes into account the multimodality of the training data and simultaneously achieves time efficiency and path optimality. For environments represented by point clouds, MNP first efficiently compresses point clouds into a latent vector by encoding networks that are suitable for processing point clouds. We then design multimodal planning networks which enables MNP to learn and predict multiple optimal solutions. Simulation results show that our method outperforms SOTA learning based method MPNet and advanced sampling based methods IRRT* and BIT*.
