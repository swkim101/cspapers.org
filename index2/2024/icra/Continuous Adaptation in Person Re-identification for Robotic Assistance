In scenarios of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), it is often assumed that the robot should cooperate with the closest individual or that only one person is present. However, in real-life situations, such as shop floor operations, this assumption may not hold. Thus, it becomes necessary for a robot to recognize a specific target in a crowded environment. To address this problem, we propose a person re-identification module that uses continuous visual adaptation techniques. This module ensures that the robot can seamlessly cooperate with the appropriate individual despite its appearance changes or partial or total occlusions. We used both a laboratory environment and an HRI scenario where the robot followed a person to test our framework. During the test, the targets were asked to change their appearance and disappear from the camera’s field of view to test the module’s ability to handle challenging cases of occlusion and outfit variations. We compared our framework with a state-of-the-art Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) method, and the results showed that our module, shortly named CARPE-ID, accurately tracked each selected target throughout the experiments in all cases except for two cases. In contrast, the MOT had an average of 4 tracking errors for each video.
