Aquatic organisms, due to soft body structure and high agility, have inspired many biomimetic robots. However, considering the issues of insulation and waterproofing, as well as the driving module of soft materials, their control systems are usually larger and heavier. Therefore, small underwater robots often tethered, i.e., it cannot integrate energy and control systems onto the body, which greatly limited in its working range and activity mode. This paper presents a small untethered bionic manta ray. The robotic fish is driven by dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA), which controls the double wing structure on both sides by the central muscle part to simulate the process of the manta rayâ€™s lateral fins fanning to propel itself forward. And the flexible printed circuit board (FPC) constitutes the body of the fish and is also an independent energy control system. The electronic components are evenly distributed on the double-wing structure of the robotic fish to realize the integration of the energy control system. This circuit system can be powered by a small lithium battery and output a periodic voltage to drive the motion of the robotic fish. The masses of our tethered and untethered fish are 1.9g and 5.1g respectively. The swimming speed of these two types of fish can reach 42.5mm/s and 17.0 mm/s. And this design principle can be extended to the research and design of various flexible devices and soft robots.
