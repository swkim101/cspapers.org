External and internal convertible (EIC) form-based motion control (i.e., EIC-based control) is one of the effective approaches for underactuated balance robots. By sequentially controller design, trajectory tracking of the actuated subsystem and balance of the unactuated subsystem can be achieved simultaneously. However, with certain conditions, there exists uncontrolled robot motion under the EIC-based control. We first identify these conditions and then propose an enhanced EIC-based control with a Gaussian process data-driven robot dynamic model. Under the new enhanced EIC-based control, the stability and performance of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. We demonstrate the GP-enhanced control experimentally using two examples of underactuated balance robots.
