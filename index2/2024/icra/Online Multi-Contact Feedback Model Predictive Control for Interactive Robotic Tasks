In this paper, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) that accomplishes interactive robotic tasks, in which multiple contacts may occur at unknown locations. To address such scenarios, we made an explicit contact feedback loop in the MPC framework. An algorithm called Multi-Contact Particle Filter with Exploration Particle (MCP-EP) is employed to establish real-time feedback of multi-contact information. Then the interaction locations and forces are accommodated in the MPC framework via a spring contact model. Moreover, we achieved real-time control for a 7 degrees of freedom robot without any simplifying assumptions by employing a Differential-Dynamic-Programming algorithm. We achieved 6.8kHz, 1.9kHz, and 1.8kHz update rates of the MPC for 0, 1, and 2 contacts, respectively. This allows the robot to handle unexpected contacts in real time. Real-world experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in various scenarios.
