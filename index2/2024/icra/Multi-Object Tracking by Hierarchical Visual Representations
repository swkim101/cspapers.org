We propose a new visual hierarchical representation paradigm for multi-object tracking. It is more effective to discriminate between objects by attending to objectsâ€™ compositional visual regions and contrasting with the background contextual information instead of sticking to only the semantic visual cue such as bounding boxes. This compositional-semantic-contextual hierarchy is flexible to be integrated in different appearance-based multi-object tracking methods. We also propose an attention-based visual feature module to fuse the hierarchical visual representations. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and time efficiency among query-based methods on multiple multi-object tracking benchmarks.
