To enable the computation of effective randomized patrol routes for single- or multi-robot teams, we present RoSSO, a Python package designed for solving Markov chain optimization problems. We exploit machine-learning techniques such as reverse-mode automatic differentiation and constraint parametrization to achieve superior efficiency compared to general-purpose nonlinear programming solvers. Additionally, we supplement a game-theoretic stochastic surveillance formulation in the literature with a novel greedy algorithm and multi-robot extension. We close with numerical results for a police district in downtown San Francisco that demonstrate RoSSOâ€™s capabilities on our new formulations and the prior work.
