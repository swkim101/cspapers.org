To date, commercial industrial robots only provide multi-robot coordination for their own fleet of robots and treat robots from other vendors as general obstacles. The ability to enable robots from different vendors to co-exist in the same space is crucial to prevent vendor lock-in. We present the first decentralized system that achieves coordination between a heterogeneous fleet of black box robots for which the internals of the navigation stack are presumed unmodifiable. Our system, which we call CODAK, achieves the coordination by relying on minimum set of interfaces that are commonly available on most industrial and service robots. For each robot, CODAK uses a trained recurrent neural network to anticipate collisions from externally observable metrics. Anticipated collisions are avoided using a simple, but yet effective, concurrency control scheme. We run a series of experiments in simulation and with real robots to demonstrate CODAKâ€™s ability to enable safe navigation in different environments. We also experimentally compare CODAK with previously published white-box solutions to evaluate the penalty of black-box constraint.
