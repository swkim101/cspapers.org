It is difficult for robots to retrieve objects in densely cluttered lateral access scenes with movable objects as jamming against adjacent objects and walls can inhibit progress. We propose the use of two action primitives— burrowing and excavating—that can fluidize the scene to unjam obstacles and enable continued progress. Even when these primitives are implemented in an open loop manner at clockdriven intervals, we observe a decrease in the final distance to the target location. Furthermore, we combine the primitives into a closed loop hybrid control strategy using tactile and proprioceptive information to leverage the advantages of both primitives without being overly disruptive. In doing so, we achieve a 10-fold increase in success rate above the baseline control strategy and significantly improve completion times as compared to the primitives alone or a naive combination of them.
