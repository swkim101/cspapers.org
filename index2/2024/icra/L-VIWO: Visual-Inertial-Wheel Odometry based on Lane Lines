To achieve precise localization for autonomous vehicles and mitigate the problem of accumulated drift error in odometry, this paper proposes L-VIWO, a Visual-Inertial-Wheel Odometry based on lane lines. This method effectively utilizes the lateral constraints provided by lane lines to eliminate and relieve the incrementally accumulated pose errors. Firstly, we introduce a lane line tracking method that enables multi-frame tracking of the same lane line, thereby obtaining multi-frame data of a lane line. Then, we utilize multi-frame data of the lane lines and the curvature characteristics of adjacent lane lines to optimize the positions of the lane line sample points, thus building a reliable lane line map. Finally, we use the built local lane line map to correct the position of the vehicle. Based on the corrected position and prior pose from the odometry, we build a graph optimization model to optimize the pose of the vehicle. Through localization experiments on the KAIST dataset, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method effectively enhances the localization accuracy of odometry, thus confirming the effectiveness of the method.
