Grasping motion planning aims to find a feasible grasping trajectory in the configuration space given an input target grasp. While optimizing grasp motion with two or three-fingered grippers has been well studied, the study on natural grasp motion planning with a dexterous hand remains a very challenging problem due to the high dimensional working space. In this work, we propose a novel temporal-parametric grasp prior (TPGP) optimization method to simplify the difficulty of grasping trajectory optimization for the dexterous hand while maintaining smooth and natural properties of the grasping motion. Specifically, we formulate the discrete trajectory parameters into a temporal-based parameterization, where the prior constraint provided by a hand poser network, is introduced to ensure that hand pose is natural and reasonable throughout the trajectory. Finally, we present a joint target optimization strategy to enhance the target pose for more feasible trajectories. Extensive validations on two public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding grasp motion on various metrics.
