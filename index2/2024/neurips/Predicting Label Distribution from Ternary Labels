Label distribution learning is a powerful learning paradigm to deal with label polysemy and has been widely applied in many practical tasks. A significant obstacle to the effective utilization of label distribution is the substantial expenses of accurate quantifying the label distributions. To tackle this challenge, label enhancement methods automatically infer label distributions from more easily accessible multi-label data based on binary annotations. However, the binary annotation of multi-label data requires experts to accurately assess whether each label can describe the instance, which may diminish the annotating efficiency and heighten the risk of erroneous annotation since the relationship between the label and the instance is unclear in many practical scenarios. Therefore, we propose to predict label distribution from ternary labels, allowing experts to annotate labels in a three-way annotation scheme. They can annotate the label as “ 0 ” indicating “uncertain relevant” if it is difficult to definitively determine whether the label can describe the instance, in addition to the binary annotation of “ 1 ” indicating “definitely relevant” and “ − 1 ” indicating “definitely irrelevant”. Both the theoretical and methodological studies are conducted for the proposed learning paradigm. In the theoretical part, we conduct a quantitative comparison of approximation error between ternary and binary labels to elucidate the superiority of ternary labels over binary labels. In the methodological part, we propose a Categorical distribution with monotonicity and orderliness to model the mapping from label description degrees to ternary labels, which can serve as a loss function or as a probability distribution, allowing most existing label enhancement methods to be adapted to our task. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.
