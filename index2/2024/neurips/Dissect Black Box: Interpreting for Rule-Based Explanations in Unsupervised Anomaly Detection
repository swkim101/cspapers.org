In high-stakes sectors such as network security, IoT security, accurately distinguishing between normal and anomalous data is critical due to the significant implications for operational success and safety in decision-making. The complexity is exacerbated by the presence of unlabeled data and the opaque nature of black-box anomaly detection models, which obscure the rationale behind their predictions. In this paper, we present a novel method to interpret the decision-making processes of these models, which are essential for detecting malicious activities without labeled attack data. We put forward the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree), designed to dissect and understand the structure of normal data distributions. The SCD-Tree integrates predictions from the anomaly detection model into its splitting criteria, enhancing the clustering process with the modelâ€™s insights into anomalies. To further refine these segments, the Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm is employed to define boundaries within each segmented distribution, effectively delineating normal from anomalous data points. At this point, this approach addresses the curse of dimensionality by segmenting high-dimensional data and ensures resilience to data variability and perturbations
