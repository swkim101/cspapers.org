Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than ecologically relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNN's latent space, we found that: (1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; (2) The latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, but highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; (3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object features are less orthogonalized relative to the perceptual space; (4) The transformation of working memory encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans, enabling testable predictions with neural data.
