This research investigates learners' preferences for the timing of feedback provided to multiple-choice questions within technology-based instruction, hitherto an area of little empirical attention. Digital materials are undergoing a period of renewed prominence within online learning and multiple-choice questions remain a common component. There is evidence that a delay in the provision of feedback following a learner's response to multiple-choice questions leads to an increase in subsequent performance. However, the learner's perspective on delayed feedback is yet to be explored. Learner preferences are pertinent as learning designs that run contrary to preferred learning behaviours can have a negative affect on motivation and therefore engagement. During a series of formative tests, subjects were presented with a choice of viewing either immediate or delayed feedback and their choices were recorded. Over a 2-year period data were collected relating to 599 subjects. Qualitative interviews were also conducted to investigate why subjects made their choices. In this research, subjects expressed a marked preference for immediate feedback, 95.33% chose to view feedback immediately following their response to a question. The reasons for this preference are explored and the implications for learning design are considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
