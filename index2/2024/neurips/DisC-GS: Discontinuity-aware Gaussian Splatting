Recently, Gaussian Splatting, a method that represents a 3D scene as a collection of Gaussian distributions, has gained significant attention in addressing the task of novel view synthesis. In this paper, we highlight a fundamental limitation of Gaussian Splatting: its inability to accurately render discontinuities and boundaries in images due to the continuous nature of Gaussian distributions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework enabling Gaussian Splatting to perform discontinuity-aware image rendering. Additionally, we introduce a B\'ezier-boundary gradient approximation strategy within our framework to keep the"differentiability"of the proposed discontinuity-aware rendering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.
