Continual learning on graphs tackles the problem of training a graph neural network (GNN) where graph data arrive in a streaming fashion and the model tends to forget knowledge from previous tasks when updating with new data. Traditional continual learning strategies such as Experience Replay can be adapted to streaming graphs, however, these methods often face challenges such as inefficiency in preserving graph topology and incapability of capturing the correlation between old and new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TA$\mathbb{CO}$, a (t)opology-(a)ware graph (co)arsening and (co)ntinual learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced graph. At each time period, this reduced graph expands by combining with a new graph and aligning shared nodes, and then it undergoes a"zoom out"process by reduction to maintain a stable size. We design a graph coarsening algorithm based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph and preserve topological information. We empirically demonstrate the learning process on the reduced graph can approximate that of the original graph. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three real-world datasets using different backbone GNN models.
