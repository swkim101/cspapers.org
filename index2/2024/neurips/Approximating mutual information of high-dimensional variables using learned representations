Mutual information (MI) is a general measure of statistical dependence with widespread application across the sciences. However, estimating MI between multi-dimensional variables is challenging because the number of samples necessary to converge to an accurate estimate scales unfavorably with dimensionality. In practice, existing techniques can reliably estimate MI in up to tens of dimensions, but fail in higher dimensions, where sufficient sample sizes are infeasible. Here, we explore the idea that underlying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data can be exploited to faithfully approximate MI in high-dimensional settings with realistic sample sizes. We develop a method that we call latent MI (LMI) approximation, which applies a nonparametric MI estimator to low-dimensional representations learned by a simple, theoretically-motivated model architecture. Using several benchmarks, we show that unlike existing techniques, LMI can approximate MI well for variables with $> 10^3$ dimensions if their dependence structure has low intrinsic dimensionality. Finally, we showcase LMI on two open problems in biology. First, we approximate MI between protein language model (pLM) representations of interacting proteins, and find that pLMs encode non-trivial information about protein-protein interactions. Second, we quantify cell fate information contained in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) measurements of hematopoietic stem cells, and find a sharp transition during neutrophil differentiation when fate information captured by scRNA-seq increases dramatically.
