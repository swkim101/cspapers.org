To reduce the communication cost of differential privacy mechanisms, we introduce a novel construction, called Poisson private representation (PPR), designed to compress and simulate any local randomizer while ensuring local differential privacy. Unlike previous simulation-based local differential privacy mechanisms, PPR exactly preserves the joint distribution of the data and the output of the original local randomizer. Hence, the PPR-compressed privacy mechanism retains all desirable statistical properties of the original privacy mechanism such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity. Moreover, PPR achieves a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound. Using the PPR, we give a new order-wise trade-off between communication, accuracy, central and local differential privacy for distributed mean estimation. Experiment results on distributed mean estimation show that PPR consistently gives a better trade-off between communication, accuracy and central differential privacy compared to the coordinate subsampled Gaussian mechanism, while also providing local differential privacy.
