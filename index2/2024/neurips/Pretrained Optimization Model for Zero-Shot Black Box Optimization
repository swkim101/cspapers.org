Zero-shot optimization involves optimizing a target task that was not seen during training, aiming to provide the optimal solution without or with minimal adjustments to the optimizer. It is crucial to ensure reliable and robust performance in various applications. Current optimizers often struggle with zero-shot optimization and require intricate hyperparameter tuning to adapt to new tasks. To address this, we propose a Pretrained Optimization Model (POM) that leverages knowledge gained from optimizing diverse tasks, offering efficient solutions to zero-shot optimization through direct application or fine-tuning with few-shot samples. Evaluation on the BBOB benchmark and two robot control tasks demonstrates that POM outperforms state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods, especially for high-dimensional tasks. Fine-tuning POM with a small number of samples and budget yields significant performance improvements. Moreover, POM demonstrates robust generalization across diverse task distributions, dimensions, population sizes, and optimization horizons.
