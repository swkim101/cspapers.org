We study the classic problem of prediction with expert advice under bandit feedback. Our model assumes that one action, corresponding to the learner's abstention from play, has no reward or loss on every trial. We propose the CBA algorithm, which exploits this assumption to obtain reward bounds that can significantly improve those of the classical Exp4 algorithm. We can view our problem as the aggregation of confidence-rated predictors when the learner has the option of abstention from play. Importantly, we are the first to achieve bounds on the expected cumulative reward for general confidence-rated predictors. In the special case of specialists we achieve a novel reward bound, significantly improving previous bounds of SpecialistExp (treating abstention as another action). As an example application, we discuss learning unions of balls in a finite metric space. In this contextual setting, we devise an efficient implementation of CBA, reducing the runtime from quadratic to almost linear in the number of contexts. Preliminary experiments show that CBA improves over existing bandit algorithms.
