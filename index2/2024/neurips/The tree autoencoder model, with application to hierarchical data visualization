We propose a new model for dimensionality reduction, the PCA tree, which works like a regular autoencoder, having explicit projection and reconstruction mappings. The projection is effected by a sparse oblique tree, having hard, hyperplane splits using few features and linear leaves. The reconstruction mapping is a set of lo-cal linear mappings. Thus, rather than producing a global map as in t-SNE and other methods, which often leads to distortions, it produces a hierarchical set of local PCAs. The use of a sparse oblique tree and of PCA in its leaves makes the overall model interpretable and very fast to project or reconstruct new points. Joint optimization of all the parameters in the tree is a nonconvex nondifferen-tiable problem. We propose an algorithm that is guaranteed to decrease the error monotonically and which scales to large datasets without any approximation. In experiments, we show PCA trees are able to identify a wealth of low-dimensional and cluster structure in image and document datasets.
