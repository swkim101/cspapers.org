Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has been extensively studied in IID data applications such as computer vision, thanks to its more generic setting over single-label and multi-label classification. This paper advances LDL into graph domains and aims to tackle a novel and fundamental heterogeneous graph label distribution learning ( HGDL ) problem. We argue that the graph heterogeneity reflected on node types, node attributes, and neighborhood structures can impose significant challenges for generalizing LDL onto graphs. To address the challenges, we propose a new learning framework with two key components: 1) proactive graph topology homogenization, and 2) topology and content consistency-aware graph transformer. Specifically, the former learns optimal information aggregation between meta-paths, so that the node heterogeneity can be proactively addressed prior to the succeeding embedding learning; the latter leverages an attention mechanism to learn consistency between meta-path and node attributes, allowing network topology and nodal attributes to be equally emphasized during the label distribution learning. By using KL-divergence and additional constraints, HGDL delivers an end-to-end solution for learning and predicting label distribution for nodes. Both theoretical and empirical studies substantiate the effectiveness of our HGDL approach. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Listener-Watcher/HGDL .
