Polarimetric imaging is a challenging problem in the field of polarization-based vision, since setting a short exposure time reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, making the degree of polarization (DoP) and the angle of polarization (AoP) severely de-generated, while if setting a relatively long exposure time, the DoP and AoP would tend to be over-smoothed due to the frequently-occurring motion blur. This work proposes a polarimetric imaging framework that can produce clean and clear polarized snapshots by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry ones. By adopting a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme with specially-designed modules tailored to each phase, our framework can not only improve the image quality but also preserve the polarization properties. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.
