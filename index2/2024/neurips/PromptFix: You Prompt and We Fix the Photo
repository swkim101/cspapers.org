Diffusion models equipped with language models demonstrate excellent controllability in image generation tasks, allowing image processing to adhere to human instructions. However, the lack of diverse instruction-following data hampers the development of models that effectively recognize and execute user-customized instructions, particularly in low-level tasks. Moreover, the stochastic nature of the diffusion process leads to deficiencies in image generation or editing tasks that require the detailed preservation of the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose PromptFix, a comprehensive framework that enables diffusion models to follow human instructions to perform a wide variety of image-processing tasks. First, we construct a large-scale instruction-following dataset that covers comprehensive image-processing tasks, including low-level tasks, image editing, and object creation. Next, we propose a high-frequency guidance sampling method to explicitly control the denoising process and preserve high-frequency details in unprocessed areas. Finally, we design an auxiliary prompting adapter, utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance text prompts and improve the model's task generalization. Experimental results show that PromptFix outperforms previous methods in various image-processing tasks. Our proposed model also achieves comparable inference efficiency with these baseline models and exhibits superior zero-shot capabilities in blind restoration and combination tasks.
