Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, achieving impressive results on diverse data types, including images, videos, and texts. However, DNNs still lag behind Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) on tabular data, a format extensively utilized across various domains. In this paper, we propose DOFEN, short for \textbf{D}eep \textbf{O}blivious \textbf{F}orest \textbf{EN}semble, a novel DNN architecture inspired by oblivious decision trees. DOFEN constructs relaxed oblivious decision trees (rODTs) by randomly combining conditions for each column and further enhances performance with a two-level rODT forest ensembling process. By employing this approach, DOFEN achieves state-of-the-art results among DNNs and further narrows the gap between DNNs and tree-based models on the well-recognized benchmark: Tabular Benchmark \citep{grinsztajn2022tree}, which includes 73 total datasets spanning a wide array of domains.
