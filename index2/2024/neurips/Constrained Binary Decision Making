Binary statistical decision making involves choosing between two states based on statistical evidence. The optimal decision strategy is typically formulated through a constrained optimization problem, where both the objective and constraints are expressed as integrals involving two Lebesgue measurable functions, one of which represents the strategy being optimized. In this work, we present a comprehensive formulation of the binary decision making problem and provide a detailed characterization of the optimal solution. Our framework encompasses a wide range of well-known and recently proposed decision making problems as specific cases. We demonstrate how our generic approach can be used to derive the optimal decision strategies for these diverse instances. Our results offer a robust mathematical tool that simplifies the process of solving both existing and novel formulations of binary decision making problems which are in the core of many Machine Learning algorithms.
