Transformers are slow to train on videos due to extremely large numbers of input tokens, even though many video tokens are repeated over time. Existing methods to remove such uninformative tokens either have significant overhead, negating any speedup, or require tuning for different datasets and examples. We present Run-Length Tokenization (RLT), a simple approach to speed up video transformers inspired by run-length encoding for data compression. RLT efficiently finds and removes runs of patches that are repeated over time prior to model inference, then replaces them with a single patch and a positional encoding to represent the resulting token's new length. Our method is content-aware, requiring no tuning for different datasets, and fast, incurring negligible overhead. RLT yields a large speedup in training, reducing the wall-clock time to fine-tune a video transformer by 30% while matching baseline model performance. RLT also works without any training, increasing model throughput by 35% with only 0.1% drop in accuracy. RLT speeds up training at 30 FPS by more than 100%, and on longer video datasets, can reduce the token count by up to 80%. Our project page is at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/projects/rlt/.
