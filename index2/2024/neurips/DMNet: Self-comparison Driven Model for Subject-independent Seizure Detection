Automated seizure detection (ASD) using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is critical for effective epilepsy treatment. However, the significant domain shift of iEEG signals across subjects poses a major challenge, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the primary cause behind the failure of existing iEEG models for subject-independent seizure detection, and identify a critical universal seizure pattern: seizure events consistently exhibit higher average amplitude compared to adjacent normal events. To mitigate the domain shifts and preserve the universal seizure patterns, we propose a novel self-comparison mechanism. This mechanism effectively aligns iEEG signals across subjects and time intervals. Based on these findings, we propose Difference Matrix-based Neural Network (DMNet), a subject-independent seizure detection model, which leverages self-comparison based on two constructed ( contextual , channel-level ) references to mitigate shifts of iEEG, and utilize a simple yet effective difference matrix to encode the universal seizure patterns. Extensive experiments show that DMNet significantly outperforms previous SOTAs while maintaining high efficiency on a real-world clinical dataset that we collected, as well as two public datasets for subject-independent seizure detection. Moreover, the visualization results demonstrate that the generated difference matrix can effectively capture the seizure activity changes throughout the seizure evolution process. Additionally, we deploy our method in an online diagnosis system to illustrate its effectiveness in real clinical applications.
