Evaluating the performance of deep models in new scenarios has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, while it is possible to collect data from new scenarios, the annotations are not always available. Existing DAOD methods often rely on validation or test sets on the target domain for model selection, which is impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised model selection approach for domain adaptive object detection, which is able to select almost the optimal model for the target domain without using any target labels. Our approach is based on the flat minima principle, i,e., models located in the flat minima region in the parameter space usually exhibit excellent generalization ability. However, traditional methods require labeled data to evaluate how well a model is located in the flat minima region, which is unrealistic for the DAOD task. Therefore, we design a Detection Adaptation Score (DAS) approach to approximately measure the flat minima without using target labels. We show via a generalization bound that the flatness can be deemed as model variance, while the minima depend on the domain distribution distance for the DAOD task. Accordingly, we propose a Flatness Index Score (FIS) to assess the flatness by measuring the classification and localization fluctuation before and after perturbations of model parameters and a Prototypical Distance Ratio (PDR) score to seek the minima by measuring the transferability and discriminability of the models. In this way, the proposed DAS approach can effectively evaluate the model generalization ability on the target domain. We have conducted extensive experiments on various DAOD benchmarks and approaches, and the experimental results show that the proposed DAS correlates well with the performance of DAOD models and can be used as an effective tool for model selection after training.
