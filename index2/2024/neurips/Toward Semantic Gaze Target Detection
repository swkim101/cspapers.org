From the onset of infanthood, humans naturally develop the ability to closely observe and interpret the visual gaze of others. This skill, known as gaze following, holds signiﬁcance in developmental theory as it enables us to grasp another person’s mental state, emotions, intentions, and more [6]. In computer vision, gaze following is deﬁned as the prediction of the pixel coordinates where a person in the image is focusing their attention. Existing methods in this research area have predominantly centered on pinpointing the gaze target by predicting a gaze heatmap or gaze point. However, a notable drawback of this approach is its limited practical value in gaze applications, as mere localization may not fully capture our primary interest — understanding the underlying semantics, such as the nature of the gaze target, rather than just its 2D pixel location. To address this gap, we extend the gaze following task, and introduce a novel architecture that simultaneously predicts the localization and semantic label of the gaze target. We devise a pseudo-annotation pipeline for the GazeFollow dataset, propose a new benchmark, develop an experimental protocol and design a suitable baseline for comparison. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the main GazeFollow benchmark for localization and achieves competitive results in the recognition task on both datasets compared to the baseline, with 40% fewer parameters.
