Existing neural operator architectures face challenges when solving multiphysics problems with coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) due to complex geometries, interactions between physical variables, and the limited amounts of high-resolution training data. To address these issues, we propose Codomain Attention Neural Operator (CoDA-NO), which tokenizes functions along the codomain or channel space, enabling self-supervised learning or pretraining of multiple PDE systems. Specifically, we extend positional encoding, self-attention, and normalization layers to function spaces. CoDA-NO can learn representations of different PDE systems with a single model. We evaluate CoDA-NO's potential as a backbone for learning multiphysics PDEs over multiple systems by considering few-shot learning settings. On complex downstream tasks with limited data, such as fluid flow simulations, fluid-structure interactions, and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, we found CoDA-NO to outperform existing methods by over 36%.
