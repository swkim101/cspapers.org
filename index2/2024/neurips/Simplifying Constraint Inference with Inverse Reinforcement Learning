Learning safe policies has presented a longstanding challenge for the reinforcement learning (RL) community. Various formulations of safe RL have been proposed; However, fundamentally, tabula rasa RL must learn safety constraints through experience, which is problematic for real-world applications. Imitation learning is often preferred in real-world settings because the expertsâ€™ safety preferences are embedded in the data the agent imitates. However, imitation learning is limited in its extensibility to new tasks, which can only be learned by providing the agent with expert trajectories. For safety-critical applications with sub-optimal or inexact expert data, it would be preferable to learn only the safety aspects of the policy through imitation, while still allowing for task learning with RL. The field of inverse constrained RL, which seeks to infer constraints from expert data, is a promising step in this direction. However, prior work in this area has relied on complex tri-level optimizations in order to infer safe behavior (constraints). This challenging optimization landscape leads to sub-optimal performance on several benchmark tasks. In this work, we present a simplified version of constraint inference that performs as well or better than prior work across a collection of continuous-control benchmarks. Moreover, besides improving performance, this simplified framework is easier to implement, tune, and more readily lends itself to various extensions, such as offline constraint inference.
