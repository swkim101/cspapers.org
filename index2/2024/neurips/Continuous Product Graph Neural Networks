Processing multidomain data defined on multiple graphs holds significant potential in various practical applications in computer science. However, current methods are mostly limited to discrete graph filtering operations. Tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (TPDEGs) provide a principled framework for modeling structured data across multiple interacting graphs, addressing the limitations of the existing discrete methodologies. In this paper, we introduce Continuous Product Graph Neural Networks (CITRUS) that emerge as a natural solution to the TPDEG. CITRUS leverages the separability of continuous heat kernels from Cartesian graph products to efficiently implement graph spectral decomposition. We conduct thorough theoretical analyses of the stability and over-smoothing properties of CITRUS in response to domain-specific graph perturbations and graph spectra effects on the performance. We evaluate CITRUS on well-known traffic and weather spatiotemporal forecasting datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.
