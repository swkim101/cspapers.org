Multi-label active learning is a crucial yet challenging area in contemporary machine learning, often complicated by a large and sparse label space. This challenge is further exacerbated in active learning scenarios where labeling resources are constrained. Drawing inspiration from existing mixture of Bernoulli models, which efficiently compress the label space into a more manageable weight coefficient space by learning correlated Bernoulli components, we propose a novel model called Evidential Mixture Machines (EMM). Our model leverages mixture components derived from unsupervised learning in the label space and improves prediction accuracy by predicting weight coefficients following the evidential learning paradigm. These coefficients are aggregated as proxy pseudo counts to enhance component offset predictions. The evidential learning approach provides an uncertainty-aware connection between input features and the predicted coefficients and components. Additionally, our method combines evidential uncertainty with predicted label embedding covariances for active sample selection, creating a richer, multi-source uncertainty metric beyond traditional uncertainty scores. Experiments on synthetic datasets show the effectiveness of evidential uncertainty prediction and EMMâ€™s capability to capture label correlations through predicted components. Further testing on real-world datasets demonstrates improved performance compared to existing multi-label active learning methods.
