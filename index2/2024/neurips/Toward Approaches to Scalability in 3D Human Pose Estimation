In the field of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), scalability and generalization across diverse real-world scenarios remain significant challenges. This paper addresses two key bottlenecks to scalability: limited data diversity caused by ‘popularity bias’ and increased ‘one-to-many’ depth ambiguity arising from greater pose diversity. We introduce the Biomechanical Pose Generator (BPG), which leverages biomechanical principles, specifically the normal range of motion, to autonomously generate a wide array of plausible 3D poses without relying on a source dataset, thus overcoming the restrictions of popularity bias. To address depth ambiguity, we propose the Binary Depth Coordinates (BDC), which simplifies depth estimation into a binary classification of joint positions (front or back). This method decomposes a 3D pose into three core elements—2D pose, bone length, and binary depth decision—substantially reducing depth ambiguity and enhancing model robustness and accuracy, particularly in complex poses. Our results demonstrate that these approaches increase the diversity and volume of pose data while consistently achieving performance gains, even amid the complexities introduced by increased pose diversity.
