Transformer models excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, but lack explicit mechanisms to leverage structural patterns inherent in fixed-length input sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence structure learning and modulation approach that endows Transformers with the ability to model and utilize such fixed-sequence structural properties for improved performance on inertial pose estimation tasks. Specifically, our method introduces a Sequence Structure Module (SSM) that utilizes structural information of fixed-length inertial sensor readings to adjust the input features of transformers. Such structural information can either be acquired by learning or specified based on usersâ€™ prior knowledge. To justify the prospect of our approach, we show that i) injecting spatial structural information of IMUs/joints learned from data improves accuracy, while ii) injecting temporal structural information based on smooth priors reduces jitter (i.e., improves steadiness), in a spatial-temporal transformer solution for inertial pose estimation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance the design of the transformer architecture for fixed-length sequences.
