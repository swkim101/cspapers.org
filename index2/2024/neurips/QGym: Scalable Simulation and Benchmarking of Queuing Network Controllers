Queuing network control determines the allocation of scarce resources to manage congestion, a fundamental problem in manufacturing, communications, and healthcare. Compared to standard RL problems, queueing problems are distinguished by unique challenges: i) a system operating in continuous time, ii) high stochasticity, and iii) long horizons over which the system can become unstable (exploding delays). To spur methodological progress tackling these challenges, we present an open-sourced queueing simulation framework, QGym, that benchmark queueing policies across realistic problem instances. Our modular framework allows the researchers to build on our initial instances, which provide a wide range of environments including parallel servers, criss-cross, tandem, and re-entrant networks, as well as a realistically calibrated hospital queuing system. QGym makes it easy to compare multiple policies, including both model-free RL methods and classical queuing policies. Our testbed complements the traditional focus on evaluating algorithms based on mathematical guarantees in idealized settings, and significantly expands the scope of empirical benchmarking in prior work.
