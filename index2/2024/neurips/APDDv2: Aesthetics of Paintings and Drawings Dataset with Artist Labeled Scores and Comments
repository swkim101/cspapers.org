Datasets play a pivotal role in training visual models, facilitating the development of abstract understandings of visual features through diverse image samples and multidimensional attributes. However, in the realm of aesthetic evaluation of artistic images, datasets remain relatively scarce. Existing painting datasets are often characterized by limited scoring dimensions and insufficient annotations, thereby constraining the advancement and application of automatic aesthetic evaluation methods in the domain of painting. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Aesthetics Paintings and Drawings Dataset (APDD), the first comprehensive collection of paintings encompassing 24 distinct artistic categories and 10 aesthetic attributes. Building upon the initial release of APDDv1, our ongoing research has identified opportunities for enhancement in data scale and annotation precision. Consequently, APDDv2 boasts an expanded image corpus and improved annotation quality, featuring detailed language comments to better cater to the needs of both researchers and practitioners seeking high-quality painting datasets. Furthermore, we present an updated version of the Art Assessment Network for Specific Painting Styles, denoted as ArtCLIP. Experimental validation demonstrates the superior performance of this revised model in the realm of aesthetic evaluation, surpassing its predecessor in accuracy and efficacy. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/BestiVictory/APDDv2.git.
