Model generalization ability upon incrementally acquiring dynamically updating knowledge from sequentially arriving tasks is crucial to tackle the sensitivity-stability dilemma in Continual Learning (CL). Weight loss landscape sharpness minimization seeking for flat minima lying in neighborhoods with uniform low loss or smooth gradient is proven to be a strong training regime improving model generalization compared with loss minimization based optimizer like SGD. Yet only a few works have discussed this training regime for CL, proving that dedicated designed zeroth-order sharpness optimizer can improve CL performance. In this work, we propose a Continual Flatness (C-Flat) method featuring a flatter loss landscape tailored for CL. C-Flat could be easily called with only one line of code and is plug-and-play to any CL methods. A general framework of C-Flat applied to all CL categories and a thorough comparison with loss minima optimizer and flat minima based CL approaches is presented in this paper, showing that our method can boost CL performance in almost all cases.
