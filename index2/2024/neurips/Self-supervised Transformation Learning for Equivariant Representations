Unsupervised representation learning has significantly advanced various machine learning tasks. In the computer vision domain, state-of-the-art approaches utilize transformations like random crop and color jitter to achieve invariant representations, embedding semantically the same inputs despite transformations. However, this can degrade performance in tasks requiring precise features, such as localization or flower classification. To address this, recent research incorporates equivariant representation learning, which captures transformation-sensitive information. However, current methods depend on transformation labels and thus struggle with interdependency and complex transformations. We propose Self-supervised Transformation Learning (STL), replacing transformation labels with transformation representations derived from image pairs. The proposed method ensures transformation representation is image-invariant and learns corresponding equivariant transformations, enhancing performance without increased batch complexity. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness across diverse classification and detection tasks, outperforming existing methods in 7 out of 11 benchmarks and excelling in detection. By integrating complex transformations like AugMix, unusable by prior equivariant methods, this approach enhances performance across tasks, underscoring its adaptability and resilience. Additionally, its compatibility with various base models highlights its flexibility and broad applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/jaemyung-u/stl.
