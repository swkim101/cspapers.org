We introduce a new task called Adaptable Error Detection (AED), which aims to identify behavior errors in few-shot imitation (FSI) policies based on visual observations in novel environments. The potential to cause serious damage to surrounding areas limits the application of FSI policies in real-world scenarios. Thus, a robust system is necessary to notify operators when FSI policies are inconsistent with the intent of demonstrations. This task introduces three challenges: (1) detecting behavior errors in novel environments, (2) identifying behavior errors that occur without revealing notable changes, and (3) lacking complete temporal information of the rollout due to the necessity of online detection. However, the existing benchmarks cannot support the development of AED because their tasks do not present all these challenges. To this end, we develop a cross-domain AED benchmark, consisting of 322 base and 153 novel environments. Additionally, we propose Pattern Observer (PrObe) to address these challenges. PrObe is equipped with a powerful pattern extractor and guided by novel learning objectives to parse discernible patterns in the policy feature representations of normal or error states. Through our comprehensive evaluation, PrObe demonstrates superior capability to detect errors arising from a wide range of FSI policies, consistently surpassing strong baselines. Moreover, we conduct detailed ablations and a pilot study on error correction to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture design and the practicality of the AED task, respectively.
