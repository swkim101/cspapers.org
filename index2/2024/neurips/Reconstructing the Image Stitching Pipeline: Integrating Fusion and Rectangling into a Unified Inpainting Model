Deep learning-based image stitching pipelines are typically divided into three cascading stages: registration, fusion, and rectangling. Each stage requires its own network training and is tightly coupled to the others, leading to error propagation and posing significant challenges to parameter tuning and system stability. This paper proposes the Simple and Robust Stitcher (SRStitcher), which revolutionizes the image stitching pipeline by simplifying the fusion and rectangling stages into a unified inpainting model, requiring no model training or fine-tuning. We reformulate the problem definitions of the fusion and rectangling stages and demonstrate that they can be effectively integrated into an inpainting task. Furthermore, we design the weighted masks to guide the reverse process in a pre-trained largescale diffusion model, implementing this integrated inpainting task in a single inference. Through extensive experimentation, we verify the interpretability and generalization capabilities of this unified model, demonstrating that SRStitcher outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and stability.
