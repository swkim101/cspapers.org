Point Cloud Interpolation confronts challenges from point sparsity, complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and the difficulty of deriving complete 3D point clouds from sparse temporal information. This paper presents NeuroGauss4D-PCI, which excels at modeling complex non-rigid deformations across varied dynamic scenes. The method begins with an iterative Gaussian cloud soft clustering module, offering structured temporal point cloud representations. The proposed temporal radial basis function Gaussian residual utilizes Gaussian parameter interpolation over time, enabling smooth parameter transitions and capturing temporal residuals of Gaussian distributions. Additionally, a 4D Gaussian deformation field tracks the evolution of these parameters, creating continuous spatiotemporal deformation fields. A 4D neural field transforms low-dimensional spatiotemporal coordinates ($x,y,z,t$) into a high-dimensional latent space. Finally, we adaptively and efficiently fuse the latent features from neural fields and the geometric features from Gaussian deformation fields. NeuroGauss4D-PCI outperforms existing methods in point cloud frame interpolation, delivering leading performance on both object-level (DHB) and large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NL-Drive), with scalability to auto-labeling and point cloud densification tasks.
