Few-shot fine-tuning of text-to-image (T2I) generation models enables people to create unique images in their own style using natural languages without requiring extensive prompt engineering. However, fine-tuning with only a handful, as little as one, of image-text paired data prevents fine-grained control of style attributes at generation. In this paper, we present FineStyle, a few-shot fine-tuning method that allows enhanced controllability for style personalized text-to-image generation. To overcome the lack of training data for fine-tuning, we propose a novel concept-oriented data scaling that amplifies the number of image-text pair, each of which focuses on different concepts (e.g., objects) in the style reference image. We also identify the benefit of parameter-efficient adapter tuning of key and value kernels of âˆ— Work
