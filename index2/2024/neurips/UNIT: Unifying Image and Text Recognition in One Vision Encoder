Currently, vision encoder models like Vision Transformers (ViTs) typically excel at image recognition tasks but cannot simultaneously support text recognition like human visual recognition. To address this limitation, we propose UNIT, a novel training framework aimed at UNifying Image and Text recognition within a single model. Starting with a vision encoder pre-trained with image recognition tasks, UNIT introduces a lightweight language decoder for predicting text outputs and a lightweight vision decoder to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the original image encoding capabilities. The training process comprises two stages: intra-scale pretraining and inter-scale finetuning. During intra-scale pretraining, UNIT learns unified representations from multi-scale inputs, where images and documents are at their commonly used resolution, to enable fundamental recognition capability. In the inter-scale finetuning stage, the model introduces scale-exchanged data, featuring images and documents at resolutions different from the most commonly used ones, to enhance its scale robustness. Notably, UNIT retains the original vision encoder architecture, making it cost-free in terms of inference and deployment. Experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing methods on document-related tasks (e.g., OCR and DocQA) while maintaining the performances on natural images, demonstrating its ability to substantially enhance text recognition without compromising its core image recognition capabilities.
