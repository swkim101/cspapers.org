Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.
