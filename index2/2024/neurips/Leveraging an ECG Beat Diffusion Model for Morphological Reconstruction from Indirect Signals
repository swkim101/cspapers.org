Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide essential information about the heartâ€™s condition and are widely used for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The morphology of a single heartbeat over the available leads is a primary biosignal for monitoring cardiac conditions. However, analyzing heartbeat morphology can be challenging due to noise and artifacts, missing leads, and a lack of annotated data. Generative models, such as denoising diffusion generative models (DDMs), have proven successful in generating complex data. We introduce BeatDiff , a light-weight DDM tailored for the morphology of multiple leads heartbeats. We then show that many important ECG downstream tasks can be formulated as conditional generation methods in a Bayesian inverse problem framework using BeatDiff as priors. We propose EM-BeatDiff , an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to solve this conditional generation tasks without fine-tuning. We illustrate our results with several tasks, such as removal of ECG noise and artifacts (baseline wander, electrode motion), reconstruction of a 12-lead ECG from a single lead (useful for ECG reconstruction of smartwatch experiments), and unsupervised explainable anomaly detection. Experiments show that the combination of BeatDiff and EM-BeatDiff outperforms SOTA methods for the problems considered in this work.
