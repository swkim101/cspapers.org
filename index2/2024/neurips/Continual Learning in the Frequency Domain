Continual learning (CL) is designed to learn new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an effective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. However, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based methods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems in resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying sensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient elimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to enhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the input features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map the original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively reducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the feature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct classes for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference of output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes across various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the feature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various rehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge environments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency. Specifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to 6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6$\times$.
