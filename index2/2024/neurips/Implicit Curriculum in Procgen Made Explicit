Procedurally generated environments such as Procgen Benchmark provide a testbed for evaluating the agentâ€™s ability to robustly learn a relevant skill, by situating the agent in ever-changing levels. The diverse levels associated with varying contexts are naturally connected to curriculum learning. Existing works mainly focus on arranging the levels to explicitly form a curriculum. In this work, we take a close look at the learning process itself under the multi-level training in Procgen. Interestingly, the learning process exhibits a gradual shift from easy contexts to hard contexts, suggesting an implicit curriculum in multi-level training. Our analysis is made possible through C-Procgen , a benchmark we build upon Procgen that enables explicit control of the contexts. We believe our findings will foster a deeper understanding of learning in diverse contexts, and our benchmark will benefit future research in curriculum reinforcement learning.
