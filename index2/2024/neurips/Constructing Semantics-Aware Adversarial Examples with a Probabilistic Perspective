We propose a probabilistic perspective on adversarial examples. This perspective allows us to view geometric restrictions on adversarial examples as distributions, enabling a seamless shift towards data-driven, semantic constraints. Building on this foundation, we present a method for creating semantics-aware adversarial examples in a principle way. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of contemporary probabilistic generative models, our method produces adversarial perturbations that maintain the original imageâ€™s semantics. Moreover, it offers users the flexibility to inject their own understanding of semantics into the adversarial examples. Our empirical findings indicate that the proposed methods achieve enhanced transferability and higher success rates in circumventing adversarial defense mechanisms, while maintaining a low detection rate by human observers.
