Symmetries have proven useful in machine learning models, improving generalisation and overall performance. At the same time, recent advancements in learning dynamical systems rely on modelling the underlying Hamiltonian to guarantee the conservation of energy. These approaches can be connected via a seminal result in mathematical physics: Noether's theorem, which states that symmetries in a dynamical system correspond to conserved quantities. This work uses Noether's theorem to parameterise symmetries as learnable conserved quantities. We then allow conserved quantities and associated symmetries to be learned directly from train data through approximate Bayesian model selection, jointly with the regular training procedure. As training objective, we derive a variational lower bound to the marginal likelihood. The objective automatically embodies an Occam's Razor effect that avoids collapse of conservation laws to the trivial constant, without the need to manually add and tune additional regularisers. We demonstrate a proof-of-principle on $n$-harmonic oscillators and $n$-body systems. We find that our method correctly identifies the correct conserved quantities and U($n$) and SE($n$) symmetry groups, improving overall performance and predictive accuracy on test data.
