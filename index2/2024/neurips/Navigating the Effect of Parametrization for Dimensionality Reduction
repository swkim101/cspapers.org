Parametric dimensionality reduction methods have gained prominence for their ability to generalize to unseen datasets, an advantage that traditional approaches typically lack. Despite their growing popularity, there remains a prevalent misconception among practitioners about the equivalence in performance between parametric and non-parametric methods. Here, we show that these methods are not equivalent -- parametric methods retain global structure but lose significant local details. To explain this, we provide evidence that parameterized approaches lack the ability to repulse negative pairs, and the choice of loss function also has an impact. Addressing these issues, we developed a new parametric method, ParamRepulsor, that incorporates Hard Negative Mining and a loss function that applies a strong repulsive force. This new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on local structure preservation for parametric methods without sacrificing the fidelity of global structural representation.
