We focus on developing a theoretical understanding of meta-learning. Given multiple tasks drawn i.i.d. from some (unknown) task distribution, the goal is to find a good pre-trained model that can be adapted to a new, previously unseen, task with little computational and statistical overhead. We introduce a novel notion of stability for meta-learning algorithms, namely uniform meta-stability . We instantiate two uniformly meta-stable learning algorithms based on regularized empirical risk minimization and gradient descent and give explicit generalization bounds for convex learning problems with smooth losses and for weakly convex learning problems with non-smooth losses. Finally, we extend our results to stochastic and adversarially robust variants of our meta-learning algorithm.
