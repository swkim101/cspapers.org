Despite the success of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms in cooperative tasks, previous works, unfortunately, face challenges in heterogeneous scenarios since they simply disable parameter sharing for agent specialization. Sequential updating scheme was thus proposed, naturally diversifying agents by encouraging agents to learn from preceding ones. However, the exploration strategy in sequential scheme has not been investigated. Benefiting from updating one-by-one, agents have the access to the information from preceding agents. Thus, in this work, we propose to exploit the preceding information to enhance exploration and heterogeneity sequentially. We present Multi-Agent Divergence Policy Optimization (MADPO), equipped with mutual policy divergence maximization framework. We quantify the discrepancies between episodes to enhance exploration and between agents to heterogenize agents, termed intra-agent divergence and inter-agent divergence. To address the issue that traditional divergence measurements lack stability and directionality, we propose to employ the conditional Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to provide entropy-guided exploration incentives. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art sequential updating approaches in two challenging multi-agent tasks with various heterogeneous scenarios.
