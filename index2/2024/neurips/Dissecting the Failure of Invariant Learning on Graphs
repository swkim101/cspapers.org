Enhancing node-level Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs remains a crucial area of research. In this paper, we develop a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to theoretically dissect the performance of two prominent invariant learning methods -- Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx) -- in node-level OOD settings. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: due to the lack of class-conditional invariance constraints, these methods may struggle to accurately identify the structure of the predictive invariant ego-graph and consequently rely on spurious features. To address this, we propose Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA), which explicitly eliminates spurious features by aligning cross-environment representations conditioned on the same class, bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the causal pattern structure. To adapt CIA to node-level OOD scenarios where environment labels are hard to obtain, we further propose CIA-LRA (Localized Reweighting Alignment) that leverages the distribution of neighboring labels to selectively align node representations, effectively distinguishing and preserving invariant features while removing spurious ones, all without relying on environment labels. We theoretically prove CIA-LRA's effectiveness by deriving an OOD generalization error bound based on PAC-Bayesian analysis. Experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the superiority of CIA and CIA-LRA, marking a significant advancement in node-level OOD generalization.
