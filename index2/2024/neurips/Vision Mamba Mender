Mamba, a state-space model with selective mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, has demonstrated outstanding performance in long sequence modeling tasks, particularly garnering widespread exploration and application in the field of computer vision. While existing works have mixed opinions of its application in visual tasks, the exploration of its internal workings and the optimization of its performance remain urgent and worthy research questions given its status as a novel model. Existing optimizations of the Mamba model, especially when applied in the visual domain, have primarily relied on predefined methods such as improving scanning mechanisms or integrating other architectures, often requiring strong priors and extensive trial and error. In contrast to these approaches, this paper proposes the Vision Mamba Mender, a systematic approach for understanding the workings of Mamba, identifying flaws within, and subsequently optimizing model performance. Specifically, we present methods for predictive correlation analysis of Mamba’s hidden states from both internal and external perspectives, along with corresponding definitions of correlation scores, aimed at understanding the workings of Mamba in visual recognition tasks and identifying flaws therein. Additionally, tailored repair methods are proposed for identified external and internal state flaws to eliminate them and optimize model performance. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed methods on prevalent Mamba architectures, significantly enhancing Mamba’s performance. For more information,
