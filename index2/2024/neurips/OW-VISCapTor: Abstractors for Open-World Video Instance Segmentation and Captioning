We propose the new task 'open-world video instance segmentation and captioning'. It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing"abstractors"which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked cross-attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.
