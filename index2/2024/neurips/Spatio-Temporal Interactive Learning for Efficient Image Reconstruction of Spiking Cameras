The spiking camera is an emerging neuromorphic vision sensor that records high-speed motion scenes by asynchronously firing continuous binary spike streams. Prevailing image reconstruction methods, generating intermediate frames from these spike streams, often rely on complex step-by-step network architectures that overlook the intrinsic collaboration of spatio-temporal complementary information. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal interactive reconstruction network to jointly perform inter-frame feature alignment and intra-frame feature filtering in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, it starts by extracting hierarchical features from a concise hybrid spike representation, then refines the motion fields and target frames scale-by-scale, ultimately obtaining a full-resolution output. Meanwhile, we introduce a symmetric interactive attention block and a multi-motion field estimation block to further enhance the interaction capability of the overall network. Experiments on synthetic and real-captured data show that our approach exhibits excellent performance while maintaining low model complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/GitCVfb/STIR .
