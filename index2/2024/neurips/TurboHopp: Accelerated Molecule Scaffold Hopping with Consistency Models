Navigating the vast chemical space of druggable compounds is a formidable challenge in drug discovery, where generative models are increasingly employed to identify viable candidates. Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TurboHopp across multiple drug discovery scenarios, underscoring its potential in diverse molecular settings.
