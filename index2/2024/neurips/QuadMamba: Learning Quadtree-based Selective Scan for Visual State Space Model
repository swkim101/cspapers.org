Recent advancements in State Space Models, notably Mamba, have demonstrated superior performance over the dominant Transformer models, particularly in reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Yet, difficulties in adapting Mamba from language to vision tasks arise due to the distinct characteristics of visual data, such as the spatial locality and adjacency within images and large variations in information granularity across visual tokens. Existing vision Mamba approaches either flatten tokens into sequences in a raster scan fashion, which breaks the local adjacency of images, or manually partition tokens into windows, which limits their long-range modeling and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a new vision Mamba model, coined QuadMamba, that effectively captures local dependencies of varying granularities via quadtree-based image partition and scan. Concretely, our lightweight quadtree-based scan module learns to preserve the 2D locality of spatial regions within learned window quadrants. The module estimates the locality score of each token from their features, before adaptively partitioning tokens into window quadrants. An omnidirectional window shifting scheme is also introduced to capture more intact and informative features across different local regions. To make the discretized quadtree partition end-to-end trainable, we further devise a sequence masking strategy based on Gumbel-Softmax and its straight-through gradient estimator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.
