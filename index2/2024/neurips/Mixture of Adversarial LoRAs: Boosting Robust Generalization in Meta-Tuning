This paper introduces AMT, an A dversarial M eta-T uning methodology, to boost the robust generalization of pre-trained models in the out-of-domain (OOD) few-shot learning. To address the challenge of transferring knowledge from source domains to unseen target domains, we construct the robust LoRAPool by meta-tuning Lo-RAs with dual perturbations applied to not only the inputs but also singular values and vectors of the weight matrices at various robustness levels. On top of that, we introduce a simple yet effective test-time merging mechanism to dynamically merge discriminative LoRAs for test-time task customization. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AMT yields significant improvements, up to 12.92% in clean generalization and up to 49.72% in adversarial generalization, over previous state-of-the-art methods across a diverse range of OOD few-shot image classification tasks on three benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach to boost the robust generalization of pre-trained models.
