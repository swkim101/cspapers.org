Gradient boosting is a sequential ensemble method that fits a new weaker learner to pseudo residuals at each iteration. We propose Wasserstein gradient boosting, a novel extension of gradient boosting that fits a new weak learner to alternative pseudo residuals that are Wasserstein gradients of loss functionals of probability distributions assigned at each input. It solves distribution-valued supervised learning, where the output values of the training dataset are probability distributions for each input. In classification and regression, a model typically returns, for each input, a point estimate of a parameter of a noise distribution specified for a response variable, such as the class probability parameter of a categorical distribution specified for a response label. A main application of Wasserstein gradient boosting in this paper is tree-based evidential learning, which returns a distributional estimate of the response parameter for each input. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of the probabilistic prediction by Wasserstein gradient boosting in comparison with existing uncertainty quantification methods.
