Thanks to the rapid progress in RGB & thermal imaging, also known as multispectral imaging, the task of multispectral video semantic segmentation, or MVSS in short, has recently drawn significant attentions. Noticeably, it offers new opportunities in improving segmentation performance under unfavorable visual conditions such as poor light or overexposure. Unfortunately, there are currently very few datasets available, including for example MVSeg dataset that focuses purely toward eye-level view; and it features the sparse annotation nature due to the intensive demands of labeling process. To address these key challenges of the MVSS task, this paper presents two major contributions: the introduction of MVUAV, a new MVSS benchmark dataset, and the development of a dedicated semi-supervised MVSS baseline - SemiMV. Our MVUAV dataset is captured via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which offers a unique oblique birdâ€™s-eye view complementary to the existing MVSS datasets; it also encompasses a broad range of day/night lighting conditions and over 30 semantic categories. In the meantime, to better leverage the sparse annotations and extra unlabeled RGB-Thermal videos, a semi-supervised learning baseline, SemiMV, is proposed to enforce consistency regularization through a dedicated Cross-collaborative Consistency Learning (C3L) module and a denoised temporal aggregation strategy. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on both MVSeg and MVUAV benchmark datasets have showcased the efficacy of our SemiMV baseline.
