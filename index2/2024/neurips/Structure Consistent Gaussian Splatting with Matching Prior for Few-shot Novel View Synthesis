Despite the substantial progress of novel view synthesis, existing methods, either based on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or more recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), suffer significant degradation when the input becomes sparse. Numerous efforts have been introduced to alleviate this problem, but they still struggle to synthesize satisfactory results efficiently, especially in the large scene. In this paper, we propose SCGaussian, a Structure Consistent Gaussian Splatting method using matching priors to learn 3D consistent scene structure. Considering the high interdependence of Gaussian attributes, we optimize the scene structure in two folds: rendering geometry and, more importantly, the position of Gaussian primitives, which is hard to be directly constrained in the vanilla 3DGS due to the non-structure property. To achieve this, we present a hybrid Gaussian representation. Besides the ordinary non-structure Gaussian primitives, our model also consists of ray-based Gaussian primitives that are bound to matching rays and whose optimization of their positions is restricted along the ray. Thus, we can utilize the matching correspondence to directly enforce the position of these Gaussian primitives to converge to the surface points where rays intersect. Extensive experiments on forward-facing, surrounding, and complex large scenes show the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency.
