Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has progressed with return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), but its lack of stitching ability remains a limitation. We introduce $Q$-Aided Conditional Supervised Learning (QCS), which effectively combines the stability of RCSL with the stitching capability of $Q$-functions. By analyzing $Q$-function over-generalization, which impairs stable stitching, QCS adaptively integrates $Q$-aid into RCSL's loss function based on trajectory return. Empirical results show that QCS significantly outperforms RCSL and value-based methods, consistently achieving or exceeding the maximum trajectory returns across diverse offline RL benchmarks.
