The fundamental goal of deep multi-view clustering is to achieve preferable task performance through inter-view cooperation. Although numerous DMVC approaches have been proposed, the collaboration role of individual views have not been well investigated in existing literature. Moreover, how to further enhance view cooperation for better fusion still needs to be explored. In this paper, we firstly consider DMVC as an unsupervised cooperative game where each view can be regarded as a participant. Then, we introduce the Shapley value and propose a novel MVC framework termed S hapley-based C ooperation E nhancing M ulti-v iew C lustering ( SCE-MVC ), which evaluates view cooperation with game theory. Spe-cially, we employ the optimal transport distance between fused cluster distributions and single view component as the utility function for computing shapley values. Afterwards, we apply shapley values to assess the contribution of each view and utilize these contributions to promote view cooperation. Comprehensive experimental results well support the effectiveness of our framework adopting to existing DMVC frameworks, demonstrating the importance and necessity of enhancing the cooperation among views.
