Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modal retrieval task due to significant modality differences, primarily resulting from the absence of color information in the infrared modality. The development of large foundation models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) motivates us to explore a feasible solution to empower VI-ReID with off-the-shelf large foundation models. To this end, we propose a novel Text-enhanced VI-ReID framework driven by Large Foundation Models (TVI-LFM). The core idea is to enrich the representation of the infrared modality with textual descriptions automatically generated by VLMs. Specifically, we incorporate a pre-trained VLM to extract textual features from texts generated by VLM and augmented by LLM, and incrementally fine-tune the text encoder to minimize the domain gap between generated texts and original visual modalities. Meanwhile, to enhance the infrared modality with extracted textual representations, we leverage modality alignment capabilities of VLMs and VLM-generated feature-level filters. This enables the text model to learn complementary features from the infrared modality, ensuring the semantic structural consistency between the fusion modality and the visible modality. Furthermore, we introduce modality joint learning to align features across all modalities, ensuring that textual features maintain stable semantic representation of overall pedestrian appearance during complementary information learning. Additionally, a modality ensemble retrieval strategy is proposed to leverage complementary strengths of each query modality to improve retrieval effectiveness and robustness. Extensive experiments on three expanded VI-ReID datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance, paving the way for the utilization of large foundation models in downstream multi-modal retrieval tasks.
