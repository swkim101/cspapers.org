The recently-proposed framework of Predict+Optimize tackles optimization problems with parameters that are unknown at solving time, in a supervised learning setting. Prior frameworks consider only the scenario where all unknown parameters are (eventually) revealed at the same time. In this work, we propose Multi-Stage Predict+Optimize , a novel extension catering to applications where unknown parameters are instead revealed in sequential stages, with optimization decisions made in between. We further develop three training algorithms for neural networks (NNs) for our framework as proof of concept, all of which can handle mixed integer linear programs. The first baseline algorithm is a natural extension of prior work, training a single NN which makes a single prediction of unknown parameters. The second and third algorithms instead leverage the possibility of updating parameter predictions between stages, and trains one NN per stage . To handle the interdependency between the NNs, we adopt a sequential and parallelized versions of coordinate descent for training. Experimentation on three benchmarks demonstrates the superior learning performance of our methods over classical approaches.
