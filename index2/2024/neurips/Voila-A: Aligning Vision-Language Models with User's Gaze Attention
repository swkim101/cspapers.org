In recent years, the integration of vision and language understanding has led to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, existing VLMs face challenges in handling real-world applications with complex scenes and multiple objects, as well as aligning their focus with the diverse attention patterns of human users. In this paper, we introduce gaze information, feasibly collected by AR or VR devices, as a proxy for human attention to guide VLMs and propose a novel approach, Voila-A, for gaze alignment to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of these models in real-world applications. First, we collect hundreds of minutes of gaze data to demonstrate that we can mimic human gaze modalities using localized narratives. We then design an automatic data annotation pipeline utilizing GPT-4 to generate the VOILA-COCO dataset. Additionally, we innovate the Voila Perceiver modules to integrate gaze information into VLMs while preserving their pretrained knowledge. We evaluate Voila-A using a hold-out validation set and a newly collected VOILA-GAZE Testset, which features real-life scenarios captured with a gaze-tracking device. Our experimental results demonstrate that Voila-A significantly outperforms several baseline models. By aligning model attention with human gaze patterns, Voila-A paves the way for more intuitive, user-centric VLMs and fosters engaging human-AI interaction across a wide range of applications.
