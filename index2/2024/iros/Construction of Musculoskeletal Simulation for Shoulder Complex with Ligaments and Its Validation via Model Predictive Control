The complex ways in which humans utilize their bodies in sports and martial arts are remarkable, and human motion analysis is one of the most effective tools for robot body design and control. On the other hand, motion analysis is not easy, and it is difficult to measure complex body motions in detail due to the influence of numerous muscles and soft tissues, mainly ligaments. In response, various musculoskeletal simulators have been developed and applied to motion analysis and robotics. However, none of them reproduce the ligaments but only the muscles, nor do they focus on the shoulder complex, including the clavicle and scapula, which is one of the most complex parts of the body. Therefore, in this study, a detailed simulation model of the shoulder complex including ligaments is constructed. The model will mimic not only the skeletal structure and muscle arrangement but also the ligament arrangement and maximum muscle strength. Through model predictive control based on the constructed simulation, we confirmed that the ligaments contribute to joint stabilization in the first movement and that the proper distribution of maximum muscle force contributes to the equalization of the load on each muscle, demonstrating the effectiveness of this simulation.
