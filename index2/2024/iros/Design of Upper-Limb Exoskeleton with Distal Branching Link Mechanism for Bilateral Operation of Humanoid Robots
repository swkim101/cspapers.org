Exoskeletons for robot operation necessitate shoulders with high range of motions and high degrees of freedom to fit the operator’s shoulder girdle. These shoulder joints need high torque for force feedback on the operator. Existing exoskeletons struggle to simultaneously meet these requirements of high DOFs, wide ROM, and high torque due to spatial constraints. This study introduces an exoskeleton with a distal branching link mechanism that addresses this issue by concentrating on each link’s absolute and relative degrees of freedom. In the proposed exoskeleton, the end-effector’s absolute DOF, the forearm’s absolute DOF, and the end-effector and forearm’s relative DOF are matched between the operator and the exoskeleton. This is achieved while reducing the overall DOF by sharing the root link system’s DOF. Furthermore, by avoiding direct attachment of the operator to the exoskeleton’s shoulder, the design can accommodate the human shoulder’s high torque and high ROM. The study demonstrates that the branching exoskeleton outperforms existing link-fixed exoskeletons in terms of tracking the operator’s arms and the torque required by the exoskeleton’s joints. Utilizing this exoskeleton, we successfully maneuvered an actual humanoid robot to perform daily activities where the forearm posture is crucial.
