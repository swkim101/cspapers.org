The estimation of the 6D pose of industrial components is essential for smart manufacturing. Especially for complex units that require intensive manual operations, such as a concentrator photovoltaics solar panel, accurate spatial localization provides visual aids for industrial automation. In this paper, we propose an accurate and scalable framework to address the dimensional variability of industrial components and tackle practical implementation issues. First, we use the scalable architecture EfficientNet as the backbone coupled with an enhanced feature pyramid network to estimate the objectâ€™s pose. By introducing vertical and horizontal connections of shallow layers, the feature extraction of small objects is optimized for better detection accuracy. Second, leveraging the reliable 2D detection results and geometry information, an adaptive pose refinement module is designed to adjust the estimated 6D pose. The scaling of the backbone network and the computational complexity of refined modules are uniformly adjusted via a shared hyperparameter, resulting in a globally scalable framework. In terms of the pose estimation accuracy, the effectiveness of the refinement module and the real-time performance, validations are conducted both on the LINEMOD dataset and our customized datasets comprising of objects from the industrial photovoltaic system. Additionally, to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a precision parallel robot is employed to validate the accuracy of real-time object pose tracking.
