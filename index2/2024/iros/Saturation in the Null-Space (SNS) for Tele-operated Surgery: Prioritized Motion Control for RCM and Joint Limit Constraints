This paper showcases the application of the Saturation in the Null Space (SNS) algorithm to establish task prioritization and coordination within a tele-operated minimally invasive robotic surgical setting. In our work, SNS prioritizes achieving Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint, ensuring safe instrument manipulation, while respecting joint constraints for uninterrupted robot operation. This prioritization allows for accommodating the tracking of the surgeonâ€™s motion, within the capabilities defined by RCM and joint constraints. We investigate both the velocity and acceleration control variants of the SNS algorithm, incorporating bespoke adjustments to tailor the original algorithm to the intricate requirements of surgical applications. Through simulations and experiments, this work aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of SNS in enhancing the safety and controllability of tele-operated surgery, paving the way for its integration in various surgical procedures.
