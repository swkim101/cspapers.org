Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure designed to remove precancerous and cancerous lesions from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Given the GI tract’s tortuous and narrow shape, along with the need for varied movements during dissection, this requires highly flexible and compact instruments, making flexible continuum robots suitable candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel two-segment continuum robot system named DESectBot, featuring a diameter of 5.5 mm and a total length of the active bending module of 48 mm, while the robot’s total length exceeds 1 m. We designed a novel joint combination structure called the spatial cross-curved disk skeleton for the robot, which addresses the mechanical coupling problem between flexible robot actuators. The DESectBot boasts six degrees of freedom, and its kinematic modeling has been derived and utilized in the closed-loop control of the DESectBot. The validation of the DESectBot was conducted through a two-stage test: first, the decoupling performance of the DESectBot was validated. The results show that when one active bending segment bends, the other segment remains almost uninfluenced, with a maximum variation of 1.15 degrees, demonstrating the robot’s effective decoupling capability. Secondly, the accuracy of DESectBot was validated through trajectory-following experiments. The results reveal that the average tracking error for both trajectories is less than 2 mm, and the maximum tracking error is below 2.5 mm. Taking marking, one of the ESD procedures with a 5mm tolerance, as an example, the DESectBot has the potential to be utilized for ESD procedure.
