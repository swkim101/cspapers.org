The performance of prediction-based assistance for robot teleoperation degrades in unseen or goal-rich environments due to incorrect or quickly-changing intent inferences. Poor predictions can confuse operators or cause them to change their control input to implicitly signal their goal. We present a new assistance interface for robotic manipulation where an operator can explicitly communicate a manipulation goal by pointing the end-effector. The pointing target specifies a region for local pose generation and optimization, providing interactive control over grasp and placement pose candidates. We evaluate this explicit pointing interface against an implicit inference-based assistance scheme and an unassisted control condition in a within-subjects user study (N=20), where participants teleoperate a simulated robot to complete a multi-step singulation and stacking task in cluttered environments. We find that operators prefer the explicit interface, experience fewer pick failures and report lower cognitive workload. Our code is available at: github.com/NVlabs/fast-explicit-teleop.
