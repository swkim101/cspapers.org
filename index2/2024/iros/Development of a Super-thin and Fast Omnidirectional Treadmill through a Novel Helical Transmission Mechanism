To effectively enhance the spatial sensation for an immersive user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR), the locomotion interface (LI) is one of the most critical factors. To offer a room-scale LI suitable for use in typical office or home environments, it is imperative that the LI device enables a natural walking experience while occupying minimal space. To realize LI for all directions, an omnidirectional treadmill (ODT) can successfully achieve 2-dimensional holonomic motion (X and Y axes) and provide the most natural walking experience, such as walking on real ground. However, a problem arises due to the excessive system thickness caused by the torus structure of a large treadmill (X-axis) carrying several small treadmills (Y-axis), along with the installation of a complex power transmission mechanism inside the ODT. To reduce the thickness of its double-layer and complex structure, we propose an ODT with a novel transmission mechanism. The proposed ODT utilizes helical timing pulleys (HTPs) to generate Y-axis motion and helical gears (HGs) to synchronized-actuate the HTPs. As a result, the proposed ODT achieves a super-thin configuration and fast actuation performance. A pilot test of the proposed ODT was conducted to assess its maximum performance. The results indicate achievable speeds of 3.175 m/s and 4 m/s, along with an acceleration of 5 m/s2 for both the X and Y axes, respectively.
