In this paper, a kinematically modular approach to robot control is presented. The method involves structures called Elementary Dynamic Actions and a network model combining these elements. With this control framework, a rich repertoire of movements can be generated by combination of basic modules. The problems of solving inverse kinematics, managing kinematic singularity and kinematic redundancy are avoided. The modular approach is robust against contact and physical interaction, which makes it particularly effective for contact-rich manipulation. Each kinematic module can be learned by Imitation Learning, thereby resulting in a modular learning strategy for robot control. The theoretical foundations and their implementation on a real robot are presented. Using a KUKA LBR iiwa robot, three tasks were considered: (1) generating a sequence of discrete movements, (2) generating a combination of discrete and rhythmic movements, and (3) a drawing and erasing task. The results obtained show that this modular approach has the potential to simplify the generation of a diverse range of robot actions.
