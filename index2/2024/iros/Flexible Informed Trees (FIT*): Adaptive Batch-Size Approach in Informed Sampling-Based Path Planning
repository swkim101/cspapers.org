In path planning, anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal planners dominate the benchmark of sampling-based planners. A notable example is Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), where planners iteratively determine paths to batches of vertices within the exploration area. However, utilizing a consistent batch size is inefficient for initial pathfinding and optimal performance, it relies on effective task allocation. This paper introduces Flexible Informed Trees (FIT*), a sampling-based planner that integrates an adaptive batch-size method to enhance the initial path convergence rate. FIT* employs a flexible approach in adjusting batch sizes dynamically based on the inherent dimension of the configuration spaces and the hypervolume of the n-dimensional hyperellipsoid. By applying dense and sparse sampling strategy, FIT* improves convergence rate while finding successful solutions faster with lower initial solution cost. This method enhances the plannerâ€™s ability to handle confined, narrow spaces in the initial finding phase and increases batch vertices sampling frequency in the optimization phase. FIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners on the tested problems in R2 to R8, and was demonstrated on a real-world mobile manipulation task.
