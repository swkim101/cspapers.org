Wheeled bipedal robots offer the advantages of both wheeled and legged robots, combining the ability to traverse a wide range of terrains and environments with high efficiency. However, the conventional approach in existing wheeled bipedal robots involves motor-driven joints with high-ratio gearboxes. While this approach provides specific benefits, it also presents several challenges, including increased mechanical complexity, efficiency losses, noise, vibrations, and higher maintenance and lubrication requirements.Addressing the aforementioned concerns, we developed a direct-drive wheeled bipedal robot called DIABLO, which eliminates the use of gearboxes entirely. Our robotic system is simplified as a second-order inverted pendulum, and we have designed an LQR-based balance controller to ensure stability. Additionally, we implemented comprehensive motion controller, including yaw, split-angle, height, and roll controllers. Through experiments in both simulations and real-world prototypes, we have demonstrated that our platform achieves satisfactory performance.
