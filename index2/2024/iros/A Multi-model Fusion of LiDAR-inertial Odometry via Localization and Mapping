This work presents a comprehensive LiDAR-inertial odometry framework featuring robust smoothing and mapping capabilities, effectively correcting LiDAR feature point skewness using an inertial measurement unit (IMU). While the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a common choice for nonlinear motion estimation, its complexity grows when handling maneuvering targets. To overcome this challenge, a new framework that incorporates the Iterated Interactive Multiple Models of Kalman Filter (IMMKF) is given, providing a solution for reliable navigation in dynamic motion and noisy conditions. To ensure map consistency, an ikd-tree that facilitates continuous updates and adaptive rebalance is employed, preserving the mapâ€™s integrity. To guarantee the robustness of our approach, it undergoes extensive testing across diverse scales of indoor and outdoor environments. This testing scenario simulates absolute GPS denial. In terms of estimated motion, the new algorithm demonstrates superior accuracy compared to existing approaches. The implementation is openly accessible on GitHub4 for further exploration.
