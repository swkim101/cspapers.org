We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of 3D-BLUE, an ultra-low-power underwater 3D localization system that can be deployed on compact robots to accurately localize them in shallow underwater environments. 3D-BLUEâ€™s design introduces two core components. First, it adapts a recent ultra-low-power underwater acoustic communication technology (called piezo-electric backscatter) to the underwater robotics localization problem; specifically, it integrates backscatter nodes into the underwater robot and uses them for localizing it. Second, it leverages the physical properties of the backscatter technology to efficiently extract spatio-temporal-spectral features from the backscatter signal; using these features, it devises a particle-filter-based algorithm to localize the corresponding robot accurately in challenging shallow-water environments. We implemented an end-to-end prototype of 3D-BLUE on a BlueROV2 robot and custombuilt backscatter localization system, and evaluated it in dozens of experimental trials in a pool. Our results demonstrate that 3D-BLUE can localize the robot with an accuracy of around 0.25m at close range and an accuracy of around 1.4m at a range of 10m. This high localization accuracy opens important commercial, naval, and environmental applications in challenging shallow-water environments such as shores, rivers, pools, and narrow waterways.
