Traditional interaction perception of parallel robots relies on a six-dimensional force sensor for contact sensing at their distal end. However, the sensor body occupies the space of moving platform and also increases the load on the robot actuations. To enable both minimization and embodied intelligence, this paper proposes an external interaction estimation method with embodied mechanical intelligence by embedding two single-axis force sensors in each leg of 6-PSS parallel robot. The method uses a backward propagation neural network optimized by sparrow search algorithm, and it can simultaneously estimate the external force and its position using information from multiple single-axis force sensors and the encoder of driving motor. The experimental platform is established to collect the data and train the network. The result shows that the force estimation mean error is 2.4% and the position estimation error is 2.9%. A demonstration with a virtual display interface showing the reconstructed parallel robot pose, and the interaction force and its pose using the proposed estimation method, indicates the effectiveness of the proposed interaction method with embodied mechanical intelligence for 6-PSS parallel robot
