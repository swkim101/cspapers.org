Open Spina Bifida (OSB) is a congenital neural tube defect where a major component of the procedure to repair the defect involves the closure of a lesion wound through suturing. For a minimally invasive approach, tools entering the uterus to access the fetus should be as thin as possible to minimize maternal risk. This work presents the design of a 3 degrees-of-freedom, 2mm diameter tool wrist with a bending range of motion from 0° to 90°. This wrist is capable of generating up to 2N of force measured from the end of the wrist and achieving a bending curvature of 107m-1 (9.35mm bending radius). A pseudo-rigid body kinematic model has been implemented for the control of this tool with a protocol for singularity mitigation and avoidance. Timed teleoperation studies explicitly demonstrate that the tool is able to reliably execute suturing with a fastest achieved time of under 3 minutes for a simple interrupted suturing technique.
