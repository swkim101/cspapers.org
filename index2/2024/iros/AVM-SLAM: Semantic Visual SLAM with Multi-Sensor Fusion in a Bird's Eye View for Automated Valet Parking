Accurate localization in challenging garage environments—marked by poor lighting, sparse textures, repetitive structures, dynamic scenes, and the absence of GPS—is crucial for automated valet parking (AVP) tasks. Addressing these challenges, our research introduces AVM-SLAM, a cutting-edge semantic visual SLAM architecture with multi-sensor fusion in a bird’s eye view (BEV). This novel framework synergizes the capabilities of four fisheye cameras, wheel encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to construct a robust SLAM system. Unique to our approach is the implementation of a flare removal technique within the BEV imagery, significantly enhancing road marking detection and semantic feature extraction by convolutional neural networks for superior mapping and localization. Our work also pioneers a semantic prequalification (SPQ) module, designed to adeptly handle the challenges posed by environments with repetitive textures, thereby enhancing loop detection and system robustness. To demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of AVM-SLAM, we have released a specialized multi-sensor and high-resolution dataset of an underground garage, accessible at https://yale-cv.github.io/avm-slamdataset, encouraging further exploration and validation of our approach within similar settings.
