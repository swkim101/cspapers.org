Recent years have seen autonomous robots deployed in long-term missions across an ever-increasing breadth of domains. We consider robots deployed over a sequence of finite-horizon missions in the same environment, with the objective of maximising the value from observations of some unknown spatiotemporal process. This work is motivated by applications such as ecological monitoring, in which a robot might be repeatedly deployed in the field over weeks or months with the task of modelling processes of scientific interest. We formalise the problem of long-term monitoring over multiple finite-horizon missions as a Markov decision process with a partially unknown state, and present an online planning approach to address it. Our approach uses a spatiotemporal Gaussian process to model the environment and make predictions about unvisited states, integrating this with a belief-based Monte Carlo tree search algorithm which decides where the robot should go next. We demonstrate the strengths of our framework empirically through a series of experiments using synthetic data as well as real acoustic data from monitoring of bioactivity in coral reefs.
