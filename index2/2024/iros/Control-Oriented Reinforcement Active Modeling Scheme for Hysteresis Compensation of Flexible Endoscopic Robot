Hysteresis has posed significant challenges to the modeling and control of flexible endoscopic robots, which impedes the advancement of automated endoscopic operation. Despite numerous hysteresis modeling approaches aimed at improving accuracy, there are still several unresolved issues, such as inappropriate model selection and non-ideal assumption of noise. Focusing on these challenges, a novel reinforcement active modeling (RAM) scheme is proposed in this paper. By incorporating reinforcement learning, this method augments an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based active modeling strategy, which improves the insensitivity and generalization ability to non-Gaussian noise that is not introduced in training. Finally, a series of comparative experiments are conducted on the self-built flexible endoscopic robot to validate the improvement achieved by the proposed scheme. Compared with some widely-applied methods, the proposed scheme achieved at least 63.8% improvement in the root mean square error (RMSE) in modeling accuracy under Gaussian noise conditions, and at least 36.5% improvement in RMSE under Poisson noise conditions.
