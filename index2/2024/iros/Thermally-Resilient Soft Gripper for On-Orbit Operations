Research in soft manipulators has significantly enhanced object grasping capabilities, thanks to their adaptability to various shapes and sizes. Applying this technology to on-orbit servicing, especially during the capture and containment stages of active space debris removal missions, might offer a secure, adaptable, and cost-effective solution compared to the trend of increasing the degrees of freedom and complexity of the manipulator (e.g. ClearSpace, Astroscale). This work aims to conduct an experimental proof of concept, for which challenges such as radiation, vacuum, and microgravity are significant, but the predominant issue is ensuring effective operation in the extreme temperature swings, where flexible materials may exhibit cryogenic crystallization or drastic shifts in their elasticity. This work addresses this challenge through an initial stage of analytical modeling of the thermal dynamics inside the manipulator in orbit; which is then used for the development of a first multi-layered experimental prototype (leveraging the properties of TPU, silicone, PTFE and aerogel) tested with liquid nitrogen and heat guns. The tendon-actuated servo-driven gripper is tested in the laboratory by varying the shape and size of objects during the grasping. The results, based on servomotor force metrics to assess the flexible manipulator’s adaptability and object capture efficiency across temperature changes, affirm the concept’s viability. Forces increase up to 220% in cryogenic conditions and decrease by no more than 50% at high temperatures.
