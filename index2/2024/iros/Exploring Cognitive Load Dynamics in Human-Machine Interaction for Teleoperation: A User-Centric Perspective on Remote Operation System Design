Teleoperated robots, especially in hazardous environments, integrate human cognition with machine efficiency, but can increase cognitive load, causing stress and reducing task performance and safety. This study examines the impact of the information available to the operator on cognitive load, physiological responses (e.g., GSR, blinking, facial temperature), and performance during teleoperation in three conditions: C1 - in presence, C2 - remote with Visual feedback, and C3 - remote with telepresence robot. The findings from our user study involving 20 participants show that information availability significantly impacts perceived cognitive load, as evidenced by the differences observed between conditions in our analysis. Furthermore, the results indicated that blinking rates varied significantly among the conditions. The results also underline that individuals with higher error scores on the spatial orientation test (SOT), reflecting lower spatial ability, are more likely to experience failure in conditions 2 and 3. The results show that information availability significantly affects cognitive load and teleoperation performance, especially depth perception of the robot’s actions. Additionally, the thermal and GSR data findings indicate an increase in stress and anxiety levels when operators perform conditions 2 and 3, thus corroborating an increase in the user’s cognitive load.
