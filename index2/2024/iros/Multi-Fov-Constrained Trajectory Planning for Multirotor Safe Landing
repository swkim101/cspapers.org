In recent years, multirotors have become more and more widely used, such as in aerial photography and delivery. Ensuring a safe landing in emergencies is the most basic requirement, and it is important to make full use of all the sensors of the multirotor. To improve the safety of UAV landing in unknown unstructured scenes, this paper proposes a multi-FOV-constrained trajectory planning algorithm. Due to the discontinuity of multi-FOV constraints and the nonlinearity of UAV dynamics, the entire trajectory planning problem is a nonlinear optimization problem with non-convex constraints. To address this problem, our algorithm contains two stages, a multi-fov-constrained path search algorithm and a safe landing trajectory optimization algorithm. The multi-fov-constrained path search algorithm is used to generate a safe initial path that satisfies the FOV constraint. Then, the safe landing trajectory optimization algorithm generates a safe trajectory, which considers FOV constraints, dynamics, smoothness, and obstacle avoidance. We conducted simulation experiments and real-world experiments to verify the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithm.
