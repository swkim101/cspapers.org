A wire-driven parallel robot is a type of robotic system where multiple wires are used to control the movement of a end-effector. The wires are attached to the end-effector and anchored to fixed points on external structures. This configuration allows for the separation of actuators and end-effectors, enabling lightweight and simplified movable parts in the robot. However, its range of motion remains confined within the space formed by the wires, limiting the wire-driven capability to only within the pre-designed operational range. Here, in this study, we develop a wire-driven robot, CubiX, capable of connecting to and utilizing the environment. CubiX connects itself to the environment using up to 8 wires and drives itself by winding these wires. By integrating actuators for winding the wires into CubiX, a portable wire-driven parallel robot is realized without limitations on its workspace. Consequently, the robot can form parallel wire-driven structures by connecting wires to the environment at any operational location.
