Aggressive maneuvering is crucial for aerial vehicles to execute adversarial and penetration missions. However, this challenges the accurate tracking control of drones due to uncertainties induced by high-speed flight. Therefore, firstly, a highly dynamic tracking control framework is proposed to actualize the accurate tracking of aggressive trajectories with velocities up to 15 m/s (i.e., 54 km/h) and acceleration of 2 g. Secondly, in order to mitigate the impact of conjoint effects on uncertainty estimation during aggressive flights and to ensure that uncertainty is smoothly compensated, a novel adaptive nonlinear extended state observer (ANESO) with noise suppression and peak attenuation capabilities is designed. Finally, extensive comparative simulation and real-world practical experimental results certify the superiority of the proposed control strategy in tracking aggressive trajectories.
