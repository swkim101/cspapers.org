The movement of the legs involves the interaction between the feet and the ground. Consequently, most animals possess a wide variety of foot morphologies and multifunctional capabilities. The selection and switching of these foot functions are passive and environment-dependent, ensuring environmental compliance. Despite this, current research on compliant feet lacks mathematical models that simultaneously encompass locomotion and foot compliance. Therefore, conducting in-depth studies on locomotion properties under current conditions is challenging. In this study, we present novel passive compliant feet applicable to the passive walking of a rimless wheel. We first introduce a dynamic model, achieve passive walking through numerical simulations, and subsequently analyze the gait patterns for compliance and multi-period gait. This study bridges a gap in understanding the interaction between motion and compliance in foot design, providing insights into the dynamics of compliant motion.
