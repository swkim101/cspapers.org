With the widespread adoption of robots in high-mix, low-volume manufacturing, and the challenges posed by long-horizon assembly tasks, we introduce the RADAR system—an integrated human-robot collaboration system for Robotic Assembly by Demonstration via Augmented Reality. Existing frameworks lack a comprehensive, cross-task framework for effective assembly collaboration, limiting their applicability in complex tasks. We designed the RADAR system’s conceptual model, detailing its workflow and components. The system integrates human input into robotic metal beam assembly through augmented reality interactions and interfaces. We also developed a task planner that dynamically adjusts human-robot assembly tasks at coarse-fine resolutions. Validating through practical scenarios, particularly the RAMP assembly benchmark, showed that human involvement significantly enhances assembly precision and success rates, proving RADAR’s effectiveness and efficiency in human-robot collaborative assembly.
