Robust and accurate point cloud registration is an essential part of many robotic tasks such as SLAM or object pose retrieval. In this paper, we address the problem of global 3D point cloud registration, i.e., the task of estimating the 3D rigid body transform between a source and a target point cloud without any initial guess. Typically, the problem is solved by extracting and matching features to find a data association and then computing a transform that minimizes the squared distance between points. Our approach combines the normal distributions transform and oriented point pair framework and introduces the NDT distance histogram to quickly generate and test candidate transforms. Our method further exploits semantic information if available for greater speed. We implement our algorithm in C++ and compare it to other state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of environments. Our evaluation shows that our method outperforms the other approaches, especially concerning run-time and compute efficiency.
