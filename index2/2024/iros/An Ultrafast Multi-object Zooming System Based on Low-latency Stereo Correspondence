In this paper, we develop a multiple-object zooming system which can capture clear images of different objects at an ultrafast speed. The system consists of a panoramic HFR stereo camera and a galvanometer-based reflective pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera. In order to alleviate the impact of brightness, noise, and viewing angle in the image, we use the high speed motion information of the object for stereo correspondence. According to the spatial positions of all objects obtained from HFR stereo correspondence, we can obtain the control voltage of the pan and tilt mirror of the galvanometer-based reflective PTZ camera through the mapping relationship. Then, PTZ camera captures clear images of multiple objects in a time-division multiplexed manner at an extremely fast speed. Experimental results show that we can distinguish multiple fast-moving people indoors in the HFR stereo camera and capture their high-definition facial images simultaneously.
