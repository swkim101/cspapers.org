This work explores an innovative algorithm designed to enhance the mobility of underactuated bipedal robots across challenging terrains, especially when navigating through spaces with constrained opportunities for foot support, like steps or stairs. By combining ankle torque with a refined angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model (ALIP), our method allows variability in the robot’s center of mass height. We employ a dual-strategy controller that merges virtual constraints for precise motion regulation across essential degrees of freedom with an ALIP-centric model predictive control (MPC) framework, aimed at enforcing gait stability. The effectiveness of our feedback design is demonstrated through its application on the Cassie bipedal robot, which features 20 degrees of freedom. Key to our implementation is the development of tailored nominal trajectories and an optimized MPC that reduces the execution time to under 500 microseconds—and, hence, is compatible with Cassie’s controller update frequency. This paper not only showcases the successful hardware deployment but also demonstrates a new capability, a bipedal robot using a moving walkway.
