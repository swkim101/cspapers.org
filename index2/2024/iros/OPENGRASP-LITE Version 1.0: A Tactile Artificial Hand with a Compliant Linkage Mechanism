Recent advancements in artificial hand development have primarily concentrated on enhancing adaptive grasping, dexterity, as well as the integration of biomimetic skin. However, few designs have successfully combined lightweight, cost-effective solutions, and tactile sensing along with adaptive grasping in a human-sized prototype. We propose, an open-source, highly integrated artificial hand. It leverages a compliant linkage mechanism for versatile grasping capabilities, featuring six degrees of actuation and MEMS-based tactile sensors on every fingertip.
