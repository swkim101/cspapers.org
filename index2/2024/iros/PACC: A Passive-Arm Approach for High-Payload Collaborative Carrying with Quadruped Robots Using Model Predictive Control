In this paper, we introduce the concept of using passive arm structures with intrinsic impedance for robot-robot and human-robot collaborative carrying with quadruped robots. The concept is meant for a leader-follower task and takes a minimalist approach that focuses on exploiting the robots’ payload capabilities and reducing energy consumption, without compromising the robot locomotion capabilities. We introduce a preliminary arm mechanical design and describe how to use its joint displacements to guide the robot’s motion. To control the robot’s locomotion, we propose a decentralized Model Predictive Controller that incorporates an approximation of the arm dynamics and the estimation of the external forces from the collaborative carrying. We validate the overall system experimentally by performing both robot-robot and human-robot collaborative carrying on a stair-like obstacle and on rough terrain.
