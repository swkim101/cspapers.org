The bin packing problem (BPP) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem with a number of practical applications. This paper focuses on online 3D-BPP, where the packer makes immediate decisions for a loading position as items continually arrive. We propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, GREViT, which utilizes a vision transformer to tackle online 3D-BPP for the first time. By introducing the gradual receptive expansion technique, GREViT overcomes the limitations inherent in learning-based methods that only excel in their trained bins. As a result, GREViT surpasses existing BPP algorithms in packing ratio across various bin sizes. The effectiveness of GREViT in real-world scenarios is validated by its successful demonstrations using a real robot for solving 3D-BPP. The attached video demonstrates GREViT undertaking 3D-BPP in both simulated and real-world environments.
