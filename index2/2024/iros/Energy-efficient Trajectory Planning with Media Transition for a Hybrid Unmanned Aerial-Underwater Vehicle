Vehicles capable of operating in more than one environment have been developed to solve real problems. Among them, the hybrid unmanned aerial-underwater vehicle (HUAUV) is receiving attention from the robotics community, mainly with a quadrotor-like configuration. However, this vehicle presents high energy consumption because of the larger mass required compared to the only aerial vehicle, limiting its autonomy. This work addresses the trajectory planning problem for a HUAUV. The method is based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), a highly customizable planning technique. In addition, we propose two new heuristics to increase the energy efficiency of the hybrid vehicle. The first consists of biasing the tree expansion towards the environment with the lowest navigation cost, while the second one assigns estimated costs to nodes in the tree and chooses the least expensive trajectories. These techniques are evaluated in physically realistic simulation experiments performed in 135 scenarios. A comparative analysis of their performances is presented relative to the state of the art. We show that using efficient heuristics can significantly contribute to reducing energy consumption and even increase the average velocity in the missions performed by these vehicles.
