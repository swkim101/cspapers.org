Incorporating a robotic manipulator into a wheellegged robot enhances its agility and expands its potential for practical applications. However, the presence of potential instability and uncertainties presents additional challenges for control objectives. In this paper, we introduce an arm-constrained curriculum learning architecture to tackle the issues introduced by adding the manipulator. Firstly, we develop an arm-constrained reinforcement learning algorithm to ensure safety and reliability in control performance after equipping the manipulator. Additionally, to address discrepancies in reward settings between the arm and the base, we propose a reward-aware curriculum learning method. The policy is first trained in Isaac gym and transferred to the physical robot to complete grasping tasks, including the door-opening task, fan-twitching task and the relay-baton-picking and following task. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively controls the arm-equipped wheel-legged robot to master grasping abilities including the dynamic grasping skills, allowing it to chase and catch a moving object while in motion.
