Direct Visual Servoing (DVS) is a technique that controls the robot motion by using the pixel intensities captured by a camera. DVS demonstrates high accuracy at convergence, prompting the development of various methods aimed at expanding its convergence domain.In this paper, we propose a mathematical characterization of the DVS convergence domain with closed-form expressions for the controlled degrees of freedom. From these expressions, we concluded that the extent of the convergence domain is related to the presence of isotropic or defocus blur, a phenomenon that had only been observed previously as a trend in empirical experiments.
