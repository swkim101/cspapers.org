State estimation is a central component of autonomous navigation. To date, many methods presented have a disruptive potential for application, such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO), wheel and leg odometry (for short, body odometry). However, most of them are prone to fail in some challenging conditions like high-dynamic street scenes and sustain aggressive movements. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel visual-inertial-velocity odometry (VIVO) framework which incorporates velocity measurement provided by the proprioceptive sensing into the MSCKF-based VIO in a tightly coupled fashion. Furthermore, considering that the imprecise extrinsic parameters can severely undermine the state estimation performance, we hence perform VIVO along with online calibration of the body odometryâ€™s extrinsic parameters by adding them to the estimated state vector. The generic VIVO can be deployed for a broad spectrum of robot models ranging from wheeled robots to legged robots. Both simulation and real-world experiments are performed to extensively validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method in challenging scenarios using wheeled and legged robot models, respectively.
