As automation technologies advance, the need for compact and multi-modal sensors in robotic applications is growing. To address this demand, we introduce CompdVision, a novel sensor that employs a compound-eye imaging system to combine near-field 3D visual and tactile sensing within a compact form factor. CompdVision utilizes two types of vision units to address diverse sensing needs, eliminating the need for complex modality conversion. Stereo units with far-focus lenses can see through the transparent elastomer for depth estimation beyond the contact surface. Simultaneously, tactile units with near-focus lenses track the movement of markers embedded in the elastomer to obtain contact deformation. Experimental results validate the sensorâ€™s superior performance in 3D visual and tactile sensing, proving its capability for reliable external object depth estimation and precise measurement of tangential and normal contact forces. The dual modalities and compact design make the sensor a versatile tool for robotic manipulation.
