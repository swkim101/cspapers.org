As a medical microrobot, magnetic-controlled capsule robots (MCRs) are pivotal in internal diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Achieving high-precision localization of MCRs is essential for the successful execution of medical procedures. This paper introduces a novel Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO)-based localization method for MCR, demonstrating high localization accuracy and flexibility in static magnetic field environments and under the control of existing magnetic control systems. With the aid of an FPGA-based parallel measurement system, it can effectively eliminate measurement distortion. The average position and orientation errors could achieve 0.53 mm and 0.60° when performing 600 iterations per computation, and further increasing the number of iterations reduces the errors, which is superior to existing methods. Experimental validations underscore the method’s robust performance and compatibility with existing magnetic control systems.
