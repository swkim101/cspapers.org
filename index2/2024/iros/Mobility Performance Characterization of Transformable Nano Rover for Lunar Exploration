In January 2024, a Japanese lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon as part of the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) mission. Accompanying the SLIM on its journey were two small rovers named lunar excursion vehicles (LEV-1 and 2). LEV-2, a transformable nano rover, was particularly designed to capture images of the SLIM on the lunar surface. During the mission, LEV-2 successfully maneuvered and captured images of the lander. Understanding the mobility characteristics of LEV-2 was crucial for the success of this task. This study analyzed the mobility characteristics of LEV-2 through numerical simulation and traveling tests. In the numerical simulation, a dynamics model of LEV-2 was first developed. Subsequently, the motion behaviors of LEV2 were analyzed by utilizing the discrete element method. Traveling tests were then conducted using the LEV-2 engineering model on various terrains covered with a lunar regolith simulant. The results of both the numerical simulations and experiments revealed consistent trends across different moving modes of LEV-2. Furthermore, the simulation results indicated no significant deterioration in the mobility performance of LEV-2 on the moon when compared to that on the Earth. Based on the characteristics predicted from the simulation and the quantitative data obtained from the experiments, it was concluded that LEV-2 is supposed to travel at least 15â—¦ slopes on the moon.
