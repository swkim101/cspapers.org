Multiple approaches have already been proposed to mimic real driver behaviors in simulation. This article proposes a new one, based solely on the exploration of undisturbed observation of intersections. From them, the behavior profiles for each macro-maneuver will be discovered. Using the macro-maneuvers already identified in previous works, a comparison method between trajectories with different lengths using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed, which combined with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) inspired method, defines the different clusters that represent the behaviors observed. This is also paired with a Kullback-Liebler divergent (KL) criteria to define when the clusters need to be split or merged. Finally, the behaviors for each macro-maneuver are determined by each cluster discovered, without using any map information about the environment and being dynamically consistent with vehicle motion. By observation it becomes clear that the two main factors for driverâ€™s behavior are their assertiveness and interaction with other road users.
