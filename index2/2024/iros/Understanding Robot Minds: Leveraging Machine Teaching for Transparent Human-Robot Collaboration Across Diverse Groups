In this work, we aim to improve transparency and efficacy in human-robot collaboration by developing machine teaching algorithms suitable for groups with varied learning capabilities. While previous approaches focused on tailored approaches for teaching individuals, our method teaches teams with various compositions of diverse learners using team belief representations. We investigate various group teaching strategies, such as focusing on individual beliefs or the groupâ€™s collective beliefs, and assess their impact on learning robot policies for different team compositions. Our findings reveal that team belief strategies produce less variation in learning duration and better accommodate diverse teams compared to individual belief strategies, suggesting their suitability in mixed proficiency settings with limited resources. In contrast, individual belief strategies provide a more uniform knowledge level, particularly effective for homogeneously inexperienced groups. Our study indicates that the effectiveness of the teaching strategy is significantly influenced by team composition and learner proficiency, highlighting the importance of real-time assessment of learner proficiency and adapting teaching approaches based on learner proficiency for optimal teaching outcomes.
