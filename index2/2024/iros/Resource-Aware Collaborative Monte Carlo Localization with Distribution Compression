Global localization is essential in enabling robot autonomy, and collaborative localization is key for multi-robot systems, allowing for more efficient planning and execution of tasks. In this paper, we address the task of collaborative global localization under computational and communication constraints. We propose a method which reduces the amount of information exchanged and the computational cost. We also analyze, implement and open-source seminal approaches, which we believe to be a valuable contribution to the community. We exploit techniques for distribution compression in near-linear time, with error guarantees. We evaluate our approach and the implemented baselines on multiple challenging scenarios, simulated and real-world. Our approach can run online on an onboard computer. We release an open-source C++/ROS2 implementation of our approach, as well as the baselines.1
