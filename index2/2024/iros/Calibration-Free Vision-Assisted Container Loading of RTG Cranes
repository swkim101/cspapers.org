Vision-assisted container loading of Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) cranes are facing two primary challenges. Firstly, the uncertainty inherent in Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) based detection hinders its direct application in the safety-critical operation of such heavy-duty machinery. Secondly, sensor calibration introduces additional complexities and errors into the system. However, existing studies have not adequately addressed these challenges. Motivated by this gap, this paper proposes an integrated approach for target detection and alignment control in container loading of RTG cranes. To ensure reliable target marker identification, a heuristic post-processing algorithm is developed as a complement to CNN-based foreground segmentation, thereby ensuring safety during the container handling process. On this basis, a pixel-based control scheme is designed to align the container with the target markers, which eliminates the need for offline or online sensor calibrations. The proposed approach has been successfully implemented on a real RTG crane manufactured by Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (ZPMC) and validated at the Port of Ningbo, China. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over current manual operations in port industries, highlighting its potential for crane automation.
