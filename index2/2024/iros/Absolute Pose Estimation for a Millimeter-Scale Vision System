Vision is an important component of robotic perception systems due to the rich information provided by high resolution image sensors, but computer vision algorithms can be computationally expensive and ill-suited to resource-constrained robotic systems. Here, we present a mm-scale vision system capable of performing absolute pose estimation at 16.5 FPS. This novel vision system uses a commercial-off-the-shelf sensor and microcontroller unit, as well as planar light-based landmarks in the environment to simplify feature detection. We exploit the structure of the planar pose problem to reduce algorithmic complexity and improve latency and energy consumption through software-, processor-, and hardware-in-the-loop testing. The end-to-end system consumes 49 mA of current and computes absolute pose estimates within 15 mm over a number of reference trajectories.
