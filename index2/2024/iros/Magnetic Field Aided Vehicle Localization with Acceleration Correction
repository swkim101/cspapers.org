This paper presents a novel approach for vehicle localization by leveraging the ambient magnetic field within a given environment. Our approach involves introducing a global mathematical function for magnetic field mapping, combined with Euclidean distance-based matching technique for accurately estimating vehicle position in suburban settings. The mathematical function based map structure ensures efficiency and scalability of the magnetic field map, while the batch processing based localization provides continuity in pose estimation. Additionally, we establish a bias estimation pipeline for an onboard accelerometer by utilizing the updated poses obtained through magnetic field matching. Our work aims to showcase the potential utility of magnetic fields as supplementary aids to existing localization methods, particularly beneficial in scenarios where Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is restricted or where cost-effective navigation systems are required.
