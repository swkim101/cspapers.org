Despite the elegantly simple operation principle, the design of everting vine robots still presents two complexities: a tip-device required for buckle-free retraction; a pressurised base chamber to maintain inflation while allowing the everted body to be winded onto a motorised reel. We create a new type of vine robots with a unique eversion method: instead of using a single everting tube, our design comprises multiple interconnected tubes that bend to induce an overall eversion. Our design eliminates the pressurised base and the tip-device, while allowing buckle-free retraction. It also enables new designs and functionalities beyond conventional vine robots, including drone-based vine robots capable of cantilevered operations, everting grippers that grasp then transport objects into the robot body, and solid-state vine robots without the need for inflation.
