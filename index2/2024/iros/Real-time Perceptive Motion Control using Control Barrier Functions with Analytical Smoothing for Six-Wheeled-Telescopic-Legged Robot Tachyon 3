To achieve safe legged locomotion, it is crucial to generate motion in real-time considering various constraints in robots and environments. In this study, we propose a lightweight real-time perceptive motion control system for the newly developed six-wheeled-telescopic-legged robot, Tachyon 3. In the proposed method, analytically smoothed constraints including Smooth Separating Axis Theorem (SSAT) as a novel higher order differentiable collision detection for 3D shapes is applied to the Control Barrier Function (CBF). The proposed system integrating the CBF achieves online motion generation in a short control cycle of 1 ms that satisfies joint limitations, environmental collision avoidance and safe convex foothold constraints. The efficiency of SSAT is shown from the collision detection time of 1 µs or less and the CBF constraint computation time for Tachyon 3 of several µs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed system is verified through the stair-climbing motion, integrating online recognition in a simulation and a real machine.
