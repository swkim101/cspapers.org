Seed-inspired minimalist microflyers are showing potential as dispersal platforms for sensor networks and seeds. Their function relies on the sheer number of low-cost flyers, inevitably raising concerns about the post-operation environmental impact. We propose a biodegradable paper glider platform fabricated through origami inkjet printing. This method can fold origami along printing patterns on different paper varieties. We created a printing pattern that allows 2D paper sheets to self-fold into a 3D flying wing glider with designable wing geometry and center of gravity (CG). The design allows stable and repeatable gliding behavior, proven in our gliding tests. It successfully achieves the dispersal of multiple gliders from a hovering drone, covering an average horizontal distance larger than the release height. We also tested the biodegradation of different paper types compatible with the printing method, showing near-complete degradation after 15 weeks in moist soil. Our study presents a novel, potentially scalable approach for fabricating environmentally friendly microflyers, offering new avenues for remote environmental sensing and automated forest restoration programs.
