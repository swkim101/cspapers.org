The ubiquitous deployment of robots across diverse domains, from industrial automation to personal care, underscores their critical role in modern society. However, this growing dependence has also revealed security vulnerabilities. An attack vector involves the deployment of malicious software (malware) on robots, which can cause harm to robots themselves, users, and even the surrounding environment. Machine learning approaches, particularly supervised ones, have shown promise in malware detection by building intricate models to identify known malicious code patterns. However, these methods are inherently limited in detecting unseen or zero-day malware variants as they require regularly updated massive datasets that might be unavailable to robots. To address this challenge, we introduce RoboGuardZ, a novel malware detection framework based on zero-shot learning for robots. This approach allows RoboGuardZ to identify unseen malware by establishing relationships between known malicious code and benign behaviors, allowing detection even before the code executes on the robot. To ensure practical deployment in resource-constrained robotic hardware, we employ a unique parallel structured pruning and quantization strategy that compresses the RoboGuardZ detection model by 37.4% while maintaining its accuracy. This strategy reduces the size of the model and computational demands, making it suitable for real-world robotic systems. We evaluated RoboGuardZ on a recent dataset containing real-world binary executables from multi-sensor autonomous car controllers. The framework was deployed on two popular robot embedded hardware platforms. Our results demonstrate an average detection accuracy of 94.25% and a low false negative rate of 5.8% with a minimal latency of 20 ms, which demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality.
