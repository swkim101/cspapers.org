Identifying traversable areas is a critical task for unmanned vehicles exploring safely through unstructured environments. In practice, the ambiguity in perceiving terrain traversability usually brings great challenges for autonomous exploration in unknown and uneven terrain, which often leads to conservative strategies or potential risk of vehicle damage, resulting in many unexplored areas in the environment. To that end, this paper proposes a plane-assisted autonomous robot exploration framework (PARE) to achieve maximum volume and safe autonomous exploration. The process is carried out by a three-step dual-layer framework: constructing a local tree using Plane-Assisted RRT* (PA-RRT*), calculating exploration gain based on terrain information, and maintaining a global search graph. Firstly, the planar feature metrics (flatness, sparsity, elevation variation, slope and slope variation) are introduced to determine the terrain traversability. Secondly, to completely explore the rugged environment, we propose a dual-layer exploration framework comprising local and global strategies. A local planner based on PA-RRT* is proposed to find the best path by evaluating the planar information and the volumetric gain within the local exploration tree. Meanwhile, a global planner constructed by graph is proposed to record unexplored nodes with high exploration gain from the local tree to ensure a high level of exploration volume. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing frameworks, with an average improvement of more than 12% in exploration volume.
