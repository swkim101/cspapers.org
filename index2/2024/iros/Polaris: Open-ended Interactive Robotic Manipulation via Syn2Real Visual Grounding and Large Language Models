This paper investigates the task of the open-ended interactive robotic manipulation on table-top scenarios. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance robots' comprehension of user instructions, their lack of visual grounding constrains their ability to physically interact with the environment. This is because the robot needs to locate the target object for manipulation within the physical workspace. To this end, we introduce an interactive robotic manipulation framework called Polaris, which integrates perception and interaction by utilizing GPT-4 alongside grounded vision models. For precise manipulation, it is essential that such grounded vision models produce detailed object pose for the target object, rather than merely identifying pixels belonging to them in the image. Consequently, we propose a novel Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) pose estimation pipeline. This pipeline utilizes rendered synthetic data for training and is then transferred to real-world manipulation tasks. The real-world performance demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed pipeline and underscores its potential for extension to more general categories. Moreover, real-robot experiments have showcased the impressive performance of our framework in grasping and executing multiple manipulation tasks. This indicates its potential to generalize to scenarios beyond the tabletop. More information and video results are available here: https://star-uu-wang.github.io/Polaris/.
