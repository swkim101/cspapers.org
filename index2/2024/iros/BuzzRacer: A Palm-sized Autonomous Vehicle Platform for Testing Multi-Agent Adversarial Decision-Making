We present BuzzRacer, a palm-sized autonomous vehicle platform suitable for multi-agent autonomous racing. BuzzRacer consists of two parts. First, a software framework with multiple racetrack environments, dynamic simulation, visualization, and control pipelines. Second, a miniature autonomous vehicle platform capable of 1g acceleration and 3.5m/s top speed. BuzzRacer is an open-source project currently used at Georgia Tech in a project-based robotics course and research projects for experimental validation and benchmarking of novel planning and control algorithms.
