Much of HRI research focuses on personalizing robots in order to ease societal acceptance, and favour their uptake. Companion robots are indeed conceived as a potential solution to numerous societal concerns, among which aging population, and individualsâ€™ isolation. In such a perspective, personalization is indeed key, for it ensures individuals feel comfortable using robots in their daily lives and environments. This also depends upon the so called cultural competences the machine possesses. In fact, how humans behave largely depends upon their heritage, and overall understanding of the environment. An identical reaction, posture or expression might, indeed, be perceived very differently according to the culture of the person exposed to it.
