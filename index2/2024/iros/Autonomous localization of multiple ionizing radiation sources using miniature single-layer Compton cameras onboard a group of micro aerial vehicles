A novel method for autonomous localization of multiple sources of gamma radiation using a group of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is presented in this paper. The method utilizes an extremely lightweight (44 g) Compton camera MiniPIX TPX3. The compact size of the detector allows for deployment onboard safe and agile small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed radiation mapping approach fuses measurements from multiple distributed Compton camera sensors to accurately estimate the positions of multiple radioactive sources in real time. Unlike commonly used intensity-based detectors, the Compton camera reconstructs the set of possible directions towards a radiation source from just a single ionizing particle. Therefore, the proposed approach can localize radiation sources without having to estimate the gradient of a radiation field or contour lines, which require longer measurements. The instant estimation is able to fully exploit the potential of highly mobile MAVs. The radiation mapping method is combined with an active search strategy, which coordinates the future actions of the MAVs in order to improve the quality of the estimate of the sourcesâ€™ positions, as well as to explore the area of interest faster. The proposed solution is evaluated in simulation and real-world experiments with multiple Cesium-137 radiation sources.
