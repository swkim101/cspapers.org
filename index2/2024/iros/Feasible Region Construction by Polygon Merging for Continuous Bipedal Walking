Feasible regions for continuous walking must provide necessary information for footstep planning, including surrounding landing areas and details about obstacles to be avoided during foot swing. However, the current frame lacks sufficient information to construct a feasible region needed at the current moment due to knee occlusion. To this end, this paper uses polygon merging to construct an information-complete feasible region. This polygon merging refers to merging polygons from the current frame and a specific previous frame. Since the polygon is more concise and efficient than point cloud for environmental representation, construction can be completed quickly without GPU acceleration. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully constructs informative feasible regions within the allowed time frame, enabling the robot to navigate stairs.
