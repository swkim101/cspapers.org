The paper introduces an asymptotically optimal lifelong sampling-based path planning algorithm that combines the merits of lifelong planning algorithms and lazy search algorithms for rapid replanning in dynamic environments where edge evaluation is expensive. By evaluating only sub-path candidates for the optimal solution, the algorithm saves considerable evaluation time and thereby reduces the overall planning cost. It employs a novel informed rewiring cascade to efficiently repair the search tree when the underlying search graph changes. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms various state-of-the-art sampling-based planners in addressing both static and dynamic motion planning problems.
