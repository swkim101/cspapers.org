Manipulating deformable objects remains a challenge within robotics due to the difficulties of state estimation, long-horizon planning, and predicting how the object will deform given an interaction. These challenges are the most pronounced with 3D deformable objects. We propose SculptDiff, a goal-conditioned diffusion-based imitation learning framework that works with point cloud state observations to directly learn clay sculpting policies for a variety of target shapes. To the best of our knowledge this is the first real-world method that successfully learns manipulation policies for 3D deformable objects.
