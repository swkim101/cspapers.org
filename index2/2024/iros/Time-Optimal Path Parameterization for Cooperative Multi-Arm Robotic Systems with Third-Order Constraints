This paper presents a time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) method for cooperative multi-arm robotic systems (MARS) manipulating heavy objects with third-order constraints that include jerk, torque rate and wrench rate limits. The method is based on a problem reformulation as a sequential linear program and provides a unified planning approach that is faster than previous convex optimization techniques. The equivalence to a reachability-based TOPP is shown and simulation results for a cooperative MARS consisting of two 7 degree of freedom (DOF) robots and a tightly grasped object with 6 DOFs are provided.
