In robotic object manipulation, human preferences can often be influenced by the visual attributes of objects, such as color and shape. These properties play a crucial role in operating a robot to interact with objects and align with human intention. In this paper, we focus on the problem of inferring underlying human preferences from a sequence of raw visual observations in tabletop manipulation environments with a variety of object types, named Visual Preference Inference (VPI). To facilitate visual reasoning in the context of manipulation, we introduce the Chain-of-Visual-Residuals (CoVR) method. CoVR employs a prompting mechanism that describes the difference between the consecutive images (i.e., visual residuals) and incorporates such texts with a sequence of images to infer the user’s preference. This approach significantly enhances the ability to understand and adapt to dynamic changes in its visual environment during manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate such texts along with a sequence of images to infer the user’s preferences. Our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of extracting human preferences from visual sequences in both simulation and real-world environments.
