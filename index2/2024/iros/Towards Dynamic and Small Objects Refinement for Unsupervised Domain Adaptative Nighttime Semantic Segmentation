Nighttime semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in practical applications, such as autonomous driving, where it frequently encounters difficulties caused by inadequate illumination conditions and the absence of well-annotated datasets. Moreover, semantic segmentation models trained on daytime datasets often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to nighttime conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown the potential to address the challenges and achieved remarkable results for nighttime semantic segmentation. However, existing methods still face limitations in 1) their reliance on style transfer or relighting models, which struggle to generalize to complex nighttime environments, and 2) their ignorance of dynamic and small objects like vehicles and poles, which are difficult to be directly learned from other domains. This paper proposes a novel UDA method that refines both label and feature levels for dynamic and small objects for nighttime semantic segmentation. First, we propose a dynamic and small object refinement module to complement the knowledge of dynamic and small objects from the source domain to target the nighttime domain. These dynamic and small objects are normally context-inconsistent in under-exposed conditions. Then, we design a feature prototype alignment module to reduce the domain gap by deploying contrastive learning between features and prototypes of the same class from different domains, while re-weighting the categories of dynamic and small objects. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior arts by a large margin for nighttime segmentation. Project page: https://rorisis.github.io/DSRNSS/.
