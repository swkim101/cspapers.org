Visual navigation, a foundational aspect of Embodied AI (E-AI) and robotics has been extensively studied in the past few years. While many 3D simulators have been introduced for the visual navigation tasks, scarcely works have combined human dynamics, creating the gap between simulation and real-world applications. Furthermore, current 3D simulators incorporating human dynamics have several limitations, particularly in terms of computational efficiency, which is a promise of modern simulators. To overcome these issues, we introduce HabiCrowd, the new standard benchmark for crowd-aware visual navigation that includes a crowd dynamics model with diverse human settings into photorealistic environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed human dynamics model achieves state-of-the-art performance in collision avoidance while exhibiting superior computational efficiency compared to its counterparts. We leverage HabiCrowd to conduct several comprehensive studies on crowd-aware visual navigation tasks and human-robot interactions.
