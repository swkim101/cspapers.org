This paper introduces a position control system for a motion stage driven by a low-energy C-core reluctance actuator. The central concept explored here is the utilization of a variable air gap to enable energy-efficient operation of the motion stage. First, we show the design and mathematical model of the reluctance-actuated motion system (RAMS). Then, by analyzing open-loop responses of the RAMS under various conditions including variable air gaps and different excitation voltages, we show that using variable air gap can reduce the required current. Finally, the paper formulates a control approach that combines a feedforward controller to linearize the RAMSâ€™s dynamic behavior and a state feedback controller to achieve tracking performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control approach in achieving tracking objectives with errors that are less than 2% for constant desired displacement and less than 10% for tracking a sinusoidal reference signal.
