The problem of determining geolocation through visual inputs, known as Visual Place Recognition (VPR), has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to its potential applications in autonomous self-driving systems. The rising interest in these applications poses unique challenges, particularly the necessity for datasets encompassing unstructured environmental conditions to facilitate the development of robust VPR methods. In this paper, we address the VPR challenges by proposing an Indian driving VPR dataset that caters to the semantic diversity of unstructured driving environments like occlusions due to dynamic environments, variations in traffic density, viewpoint variability, and variability in lighting conditions. In unstructured driving environments, GPS signals are unreliable often affecting the vehicle to accurately determine location. To address this challenge, we develop an interactive image-to-image tagging annotation tool to annotate large datasets with ground truth annotations for VPR training. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to 15%, defeating a large number of standard VPR datasets. We also provide an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative experimental analysis of frontal-view, multi-view, and sequence-matching methods. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the VPR research community to build robust models. Project Page: https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/iddvpr
