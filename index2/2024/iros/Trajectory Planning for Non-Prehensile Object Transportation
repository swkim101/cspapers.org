Non-prehensile transportation of unstable objects presents a challenging task in robotics. To ensure the success of the transportation, it is necessary to consider both the objectâ€™s stability via contact dynamics and the motion constraints of the robot. We propose two novel trajectory planning methods derived from sampling and dynamic programming algorithms, tested on a 7-DoF Franka Emika robot against common strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and S-curve planning, particularly under the constraint of a non-rotating tray. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodologies in improving transportation speed. This research contributes to advancements in robotic manipulation techniques by tackling non-prehensile manipulation of dynamically unstable objects.
