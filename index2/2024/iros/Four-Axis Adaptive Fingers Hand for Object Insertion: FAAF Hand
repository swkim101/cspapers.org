Robots operating in the real world face significant but unavoidable issues in object localization that must be dealt with. A typical approach to address this is the addition of compliance mechanisms to hardware to absorb and compensate for some of these errors. However, for fine-grained manipulation tasks, the location and choice of appropriate compliance mechanisms are critical for success. For objects to be inserted in a target site on a flat surface, the object must first be successfully aligned with the opening of the slot, as well as correctly oriented along its central axis, before it can be inserted. We developed the Four-Axis Adaptive Finger Hand (FAAF hand) that is equipped with fingers that can passively adapt in four axes (x, y, z, yaw) enabling it to perform insertion tasks including lid fitting in the presence of significant localization errors. Furthermore, this adaptivity allows the use of simple control methods without requiring contact sensors or other devices. Our results confirm the ability of the FAAF hand on challenging insertion tasks of square and triangle-shaped pegs (or prisms) and placing of container lids in the presence of position errors in all directions and rotational error along the objectâ€™s central axis, using a simple control scheme.
