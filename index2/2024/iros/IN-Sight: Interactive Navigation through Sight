Current visual navigation systems often treat the environment as static, lacking the ability to adaptively interact with obstacles. This limitation leads to navigation failure when encountering unavoidable obstructions. In response, we introduce IN-Sight, a novel approach to self-supervised path planning, enabling more effective navigation strategies through interaction with obstacles. Utilizing RGB-D observations, IN-Sight calculates traversability scores and incorporates them into a semantic map, facilitating long-range path planning in complex, maze-like environments. To precisely navigate around obstacles, IN-Sight employs a local planner, trained imperatively on a differentiable costmap using representation learning techniques. The entire framework undergoes end-to-end training within the state-of-the-art photorealistic Intel SPEAR Simulator. We validate the effectiveness of IN-Sight through extensive benchmarking in a variety of simulated scenarios and ablation studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the systemâ€™s real-world applicability with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, deploying our planner on the legged robot platform ANYmal, showcasing its practical potential for interactive navigation in real environments.
