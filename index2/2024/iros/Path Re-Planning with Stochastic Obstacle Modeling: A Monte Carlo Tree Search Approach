Path re-planning and repairing are key topics for robust planning and navigation in open dynamic environments, finding applications in various domains such as fleet control of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in warehouses. The use of UGVs in open and dynamic environments requires flexible cooperation between human operators and the UGV fleet within a shared environment. In this paper, we propose a local strategy to re-plan the path of robots encountering unexpected and dynamic obstacles. Specifically, starting from a given Multi-Agent path, we model the re-planning problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) considering a stochastic obstacle lifespan, and we propose two local approaches based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search to re-plan the path of the robots that encounter obstacles. We compare these approaches with traditional Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms to obtain new collision-free paths when an obstacle is detected. The evaluation is performed in simulation using benchmarking instances of warehouses and experimentally in a research facility with a scaled-down Industry 4.0 production line.
