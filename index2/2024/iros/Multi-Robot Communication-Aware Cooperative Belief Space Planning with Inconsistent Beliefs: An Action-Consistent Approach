Multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) is essential for reliable and safe autonomy. While planning, each robot maintains a belief over the state of the environment and reasons how the belief would evolve in the future for different candidate actions. Yet, existing MR-BSP works have a common assumption that the beliefs of different robots are consistent at planning time. Such an assumption is often highly unrealistic, as it requires prohibitively extensive and frequent communication capabilities. In practice, each robot may have a different belief about the state of the environment. Crucially, when the beliefs of different robots are inconsistent, state-of-the-art MR-BSP approaches could result in a lack of coordination between the robots, and in general, could yield dangerous, unsafe and suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we tackle this crucial gap. We develop a novel decentralized algorithm that is guaranteed to find a consistent joint action. For a given robot, our algorithm reasons for action preferences about 1) its local information, 2) what it perceives about the reasoning of the other robot, and 3) what it perceives about the reasoning of itself perceived by the other robot. This algorithm finds a consistent joint action whenever these steps yield the same best joint action obtained by reasoning about action preferences; otherwise, it self-triggers communication between the robots. Experimental results show efficacy of our algorithm in comparison with two baseline algorithms.
