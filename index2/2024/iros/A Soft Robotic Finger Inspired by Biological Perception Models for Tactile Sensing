Tactile sensing is pivotal for enabling effective human-robot interaction, especially in unstructured environments. This work introduces an innovative bioinspired soft robotic finger endowed with shape-adaptive and multi-modal tactile perception capabilities, drawing inspiration from diverse biological tactile sensing modalities. Through an advanced Fin Ray structure, the soft finger features tactile whiskers on its fingertips, facilitating perception of obstacle orientation, fingertip pressure, surface roughness, and grasping ball size. Leveraging distributed optical fiber sensing technology, we develop a sophisticated multi-point, multi-modal tactile perception neural network tailored for the soft finger. Meticulous integration via advanced 3D printing and silicone coating techniques seamlessly embeds optical fiber sensors within the soft robotic finger, creating an intelligent perception-capable bioinspired mechanical system. Experimental validation confirms the soft robotic fingerâ€™s sensitive and precise force perception and curvature recognition abilities, achieving accuracies of up to 100%. In summary, our bioinspired robotic finger holds significant promise for applications in intelligent sensing, non-destructive grasping, and fruit classification within unstructured environments, thus advancing the field of robotics and human-robot interaction.
