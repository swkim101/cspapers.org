This paper presents a stochastic/robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to enhance the robustness of model-based legged locomotion against contact uncertainties. We integrate the contact uncertainties into the covariance propagation of stochastic/robust NMPC framework by lever-aging the guard saltation matrix and an extended Kalman filter-like covariance update. We achieve fast stochastic/robust NMPC computation by utilizing the zero-order algorithm with additional improvements in computational efficiency concerning the feedback gains. We conducted numerical experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately forecast future state covariance and generate trajectories that satisfies constraints even in the presence of the contact uncertainties. Hardware experiments on the perceptive locomotion of a wheeled-legged robot were also carried out, validating the feasibility of the proposed method in a real-world system with limited on-board computation.
