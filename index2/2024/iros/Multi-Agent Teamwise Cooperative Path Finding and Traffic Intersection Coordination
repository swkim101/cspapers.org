When coordinating the motion of connected autonomous vehicles at a signal-free intersection, the vehicles from each direction naturally forms a team and each team seeks to minimize their own traversal time through the intersection, without concerning the traversal times of other teams. Since the intersection is shared by all teams and agent-agent collision must be avoided, the coordination has to trade the traversal time of one team for the other. This paper thus investigates a problem called Multi-Agent Teamwise Cooperative Path Finding (TCPF), which seeks a set of collision-free paths for the agents from their respective start to goal locations, and agents are grouped into multiple teams with each team having its own objective function to optimize. In general, there are more than one teams and hence multiple objectives. TCPF thus seeks the Pareto-optimal front that represents possible trade-offs among the teams. We develop a centralized planner for TCPF by leveraging the Multi-Agent Path Finding techniques to resolve agent-agent collision, and Multi-Objective Optimization to find Pareto-optimal solutions. We analyze the completeness and optimality of the planner, which is then tested in various settings with up to 40 agents to verify the runtime efficiency and showcase the usage in intersection coordination.
