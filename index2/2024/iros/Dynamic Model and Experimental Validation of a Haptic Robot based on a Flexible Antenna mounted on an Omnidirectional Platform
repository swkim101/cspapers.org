The development of new measurement systems for mobile robots has been a growing interest in recent years, particularly tactile systems based on bioinspired sensor antennae, such as whiskers and antennae found in animals and insects. This work focuses on studying a mobile robot equipped with such systems. Specifically, a dynamic model is developed for an omnidirectional robot with a sensing antenna, considering the planar motion of the system and taking into account the gravity effect. The extended Hamilton principle is applied to derive the equations of motion for the mobile platform, while the boundary-value problem is formulated for the antenna. Subsequently, modal analysis is employed to obtain a unique solution for the sensor antenna model, which is then validated using experimental data.
