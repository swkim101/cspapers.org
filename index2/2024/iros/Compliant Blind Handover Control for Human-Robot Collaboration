This paper presents a Human-Robot Blind Handover architecture within the context of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The focus lies on a blind handover scenario where the operator is intentionally faced away, focused in a task, and requires an object from the robot. In this context, it is imperative for the robot to autonomously manage the entire handover process. Key considerations include ensuring safety while handing the object to the operatorâ€™s hand, and detect the proper timing to release the object. The article explores strategies to navigate these challenges, emphasizing the need for a robot to operate safely and independently in facilitating blind handovers, thereby contributing to the advancement of HRC protocols and fostering a natural and efficient collaboration between humans and robots.
