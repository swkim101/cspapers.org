Recent research on mobile robots has focused on increasing their adaptability to unpredictable and unstructured environments using soft materials and structures. However, the determination of key design parameters and control over these compliant robots are predominantly iterated through experiments, lacking a solid theoretical foundation. To improve their efficiency, this paper aims to provide mathematics modeling over two locomotion, crawling and swimming. Specifically, a dynamic model is first devised to reveal the influence of the contact surfacesâ€™ frictional coefficients on displacements in different motion phases. Besides, a swimming kinematics model is provided using coordinate transformation, based on which, we further develop an algorithm that systematically plans human-like swimming gaits, with maximum thrust obtained. The proposed algorithm is highly generalizable and has the potential to be applied in other soft robots with similar multiple joints. Simulation experiments have been conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling.
