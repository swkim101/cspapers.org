Despite advancements in visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), prevailing visual Loop Closure Detection (LCD) methods primarily rely on computationally intensive image similarity comparisons, neglecting temporal-spatial context during long-term exploration. To address this issue, we propose TOSA, a novel visual LCD algorithm harnessing TempOral and SpAtial context for efficient LCD. Specifically, as the agent explores through time, our approach recurrently updates a latent feature incorporating historical information via a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module. Upon receiving a query frame, TOSA seamlessly fuses the latent feature with the query feature to predict the candidatesâ€™ distribution, thus averting intensive similarity computation. Additionally, TOSA integrates a temporal-spatial convolution for candidate refinement by thoroughly exploiting the temporal consistency and spatial correlation to enhance selected candidates, further boosting the performance. Extensive experiments across four standard datasets showcase the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing rich temporal-spatial contexts.
