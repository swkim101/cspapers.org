Learning-based grasp detectors typically assume a precision grasp, where each finger only has one contact point, and estimate the grasp probability. In this work, we propose a data generation and learning pipeline that can leverage power grasping, which has more contact points with an enveloping configuration and is robust against both positioning error and force disturbance. To train a grasp detector to prioritize power grasping while still keeping precision grasping as the secondary choice, we propose to train the network against the magnitude of disturbance in the gravity direction a grasp can resist (gravity-rejection score) rather than the binary classification of success. We also provide an efficient data generation pipeline for a dataset with gravity-rejection score annotation. Evaluation in both simulation and real-robot clarifies the significant improvement in our approach, especially when the objects are heavy.
