Animatronic robots hold the promise of enabling natural human-robot interaction through lifelike facial expressions. However, generating realistic, speech-synchronized robot expressions poses significant challenges due to the complexities of facial biomechanics and the need for responsive motion synthesis. This paper introduces a novel, skinning-centric approach to drive animatronic robot facial expressions from speech input. At its core, the proposed approach employs linear blend skinning (LBS) as a unifying representation, guiding innovations in both embodiment design and motion synthesis. LBS informs the actuation topology, facilitates human expression retargeting, and enables efficient speech-driven facial motion generation. This approach demonstrates the capability to produce highly realistic facial expressions on an animatronic face in real-time at over 4000 fps on a single Nvidia RTX 4090, significantly advancing robots' ability to replicate nuanced human expressions for natural interaction.
