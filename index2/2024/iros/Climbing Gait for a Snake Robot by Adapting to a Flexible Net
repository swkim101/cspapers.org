This paper introduces climbing gait for the snake robot by adapting to a flexible net. A net deforms in various ways due to external forces. Therefore, we tilt snake robotâ€™s body to adapt to the deformation of the net. In addition, we can adjust the position of the head of a snake robot passing through the mesh. A snake robot can move not only vertically but also horizontally. We demonstrated the validity of the proposed method through experiments in vertical movement and movement in diagonal direction.
