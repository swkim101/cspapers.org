LiDAR is an essential sensor for intelligent vehicles. Recently, LiDARs used in vehicles produced by different companies have significant differences in their scanning patterns. Some vehicles use mechanical and solid-state (repetitive) LiDARs, while others use prism-based (non-repetitive) LiDARs. The scanning pattern of a LiDAR has a profound impact on its scanning performance. To investigate the influence of LiDAR scanning patterns, we created the "Repetitive-or-not" dataset, which is collected simultaneously by LiDARs with both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning patterns in the CARLA simulation environment. Using this dataset, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of the scanning ability of repetitive and non-repetitive LiDARs. Furthermore, we looked into the effects of these two LiDAR scanning patterns on the performance of various 3D object detection algorithms. Finally, we explored the domain gap in the point cloud data produced by repetitive and non-repetitive LiDARs. Through an in-depth investigation of the "Repetitive-or-not" dataset, we have discovered that non-repetitive LiDAR shows great promise. This conclusion is primarily supported by its superior object scanning capabilities.
