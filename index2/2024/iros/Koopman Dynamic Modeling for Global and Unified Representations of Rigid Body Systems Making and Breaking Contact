A global modeling methodology based on Koopman operator theory for the dynamics of rigid bodies that make and break contact is presented. Traditionally, robotic systems that contact with their environment are represented as a system comprised of multiple dynamic equations that are switched depending on the contact state. This switching of governing dynamics has been a challenge in both task planning and control. Here, a Koopman lifting linearization approach is presented to subsume multiple dynamics such that no explicit switching is required for examining the dynamic behaviors across diverse contact states. First, it is shown that contact/non-contact transitions are continuous at a microscopic level. This allows for the application of Koopman operator theory to the class of robotic systems that repeat contact/non-contact transitions. Second, an effective method for finding Koopman operator observables for capturing rapid changes to contact forces is presented. The method is applied to the modeling of dynamic peg insertion where a peg collides against and bounces on the chamfer of the hole. Furthermore, the method is applied to the dynamic modeling of a sliding object subject to complex friction and damping properties. Segmented dynamic equations are unified with the Koopman modeling method.
