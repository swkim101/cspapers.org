Point Cloud Registration (PCR) is a critical and challenging task in computer vision and robotics. One of the primary difficulties in PCR is identifying salient and meaningful points that exhibit consistent semantic and geometric properties across different scans. Previous methods have encountered challenges with ambiguous matching due to the similarity among patch blocks throughout the entire point cloud and the lack of consideration for efficient global geometric consistency. To address these issues, we propose a new framework that includes several novel techniques. Firstly, we introduce a semantic-aware geometric encoder that combines object-level and patch-level semantic information. This encoder significantly improves registration recall by reducing ambiguity in patch-level superpoint matching. Additionally, we incorporate a prior knowledge approach that utilizes an intrinsic shape signature to identify salient points. This enables us to extract the most salient super points and meaningful dense points in the scene. Secondly, we introduce an innovative transformer that encodes High-Order (HO) geometric features. These features are crucial for identifying salient points within initial overlap regions while considering global high-order geometric consistency. We introduce an anchor node selection strategy to optimize this high-order transformer further. By encoding inter-frame triangle or polyhedron consistency features based on these anchor nodes, we can effectively learn high-order geometric features of salient super points. These high-order features are then propagated to dense points and utilized by a Sinkhorn matching module to identify critical correspondences for successful registration. The experiments conducted on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
