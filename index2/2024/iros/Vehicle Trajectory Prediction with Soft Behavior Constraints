Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, but it is challenging due to the multi-modal nature of future trajectories. Behavior information is frequently employed to capture more diverse modalities of future trajectories. Traditional behavior information is typically hard-encoded, which is often inaccurate and inadequate for reflecting future multimodality. Therefore, we introduce the concept of soft vehicle behavior, which is represented as a probability distribution over a predefined comprehensive set of behaviors. This approach allows for a more rational depiction of vehicle behavior and captures potential future driving modalities. Based on it, we propose a new soft-behavior-constrained vehicle trajectory prediction framework. The framework consists of a backbone and a lightweight and plug-and-play behavior prediction module, which is used to imbue soft behavior constraints to assist in representation learning. We integrated the behavior prediction module into five representative trajectory predictors and achieved improvements of at least 4.2% in minFDE(K=5) on the nuScenes dataset and 0.5% in minFDE(K=6) on the Argoverse 1 motion forecasting dataset. These universal increments prove the effectiveness and generalizability of soft behavior constraints in vehicle trajectory prediction.
