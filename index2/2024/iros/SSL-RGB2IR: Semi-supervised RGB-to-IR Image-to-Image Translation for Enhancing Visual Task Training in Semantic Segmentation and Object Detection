The scarcity of annotated infrared (IR) image datasets limits deep learning networks from achieving performances comparable to those achieved with RGB data. To address this, we introduce a novel semi-supervised RGB-to-IR Image-to-Image Translation model (SSL-RGB2IR) that generates synthetic IR data from RGB images. Our model effectively preserves the IR characteristics in the generated images from both synthetic and real-world data. Compared to existing image-to-image translation techniques, training models on this generated IR data significantly improves performance in downstream tasks like segmentation and detection. Notably, in sim-to-real transfer, the segmentation model trained on SSL-RGB2IR generated IR images outperforms baselines and other Image-to-Image (I2I) models. Furthermore, for real-world applications utilizing EO/IR fusion images, this approach solves the well-known challenge of co-registering EO and IR images, which often have inherent misalignmentâ€™s due to differing sensor characteristics.
