Existing conversational robots are mostly reactive in that the interactions are usually initiated by the users. With the knowledge of the environmental context such as peopleâ€™s daily activities, robots can be more intelligent and proactive. In this paper, we proposed a context-aware conversation adaptation system (CACAS) for human-robot interaction (HRI). First, a context recognition module and a language processing module are developed to obtain the context information, user intent and slots, which become part of the state. Second, a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to train an initial policy with a simulated user. User feedback data is collected through HRI using the initial policy. Third, a policy combining the reinforcement learning-based policy with the neural network-based policy is adapted based on the user feedback. We conducted both simulated user tests and real human subject tests to evaluate the proposed system. The results show that CACAS achieved a success rate of 85% in the real human subject test and 87.5% of participants were satisfied with the adaptation results. For the simulation test, CACAS had the highest success rate compared with the baseline methods.
