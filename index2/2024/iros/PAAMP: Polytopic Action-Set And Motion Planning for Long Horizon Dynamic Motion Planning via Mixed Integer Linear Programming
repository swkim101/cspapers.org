Optimization methods for long-horizon, dynamically feasible motion planning in robotics tackle challenging nonconvex and discontinuous optimization problems. Traditional methods often falter due to the nonlinear characteristics of these problems. We introduce a technique that utilizes learned representations of the system, known as Polytopic Action Sets, to efficiently compute long-horizon trajectories. By employing a suitable sequence of Polytopic Action Sets, we transform the long-horizon dynamically feasible motion planning problem into a Linear Program. This reformulation enables us to address motion planning as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of a Polytopic Action-Set and Motion Planning (PAAMP) approach by identifying swing-up motions for a torque-constrained pendulum as fast as 0.75 milliseconds. This approach is well-suited for solving complex motion planning and long-horizon Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in dynamic and underactuated systems such as legged and aerial robots.
