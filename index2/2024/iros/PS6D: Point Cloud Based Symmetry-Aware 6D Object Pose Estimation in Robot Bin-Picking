6D object pose estimation holds essential roles in various fields, particularly in the grasping of industrial workpieces. Given challenges like rust, high reflectivity, and absent textures, this paper introduces a point cloud based pose estimation framework (PS6D). PS6D centers on slender and multi-symmetric objects. It extracts multi-scale features through an attention-guided feature extraction module, designs a symmetry-aware rotation loss and a center distance sensitive translation loss to regress the pose of each point to the centroid of the instance, and then uses a two-stage clustering method to complete instance segmentation and pose estimation. Objects from the Sil√©ane and IPA datasets and typical workpieces from industrial practice are used to generate data and evaluate the algorithm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approach, PS6D demonstrates an 11.5% improvement in ${{\text{F}}_{{1_{inst}}}}$ and a 14.8% improvement in Recall. The main part of PS6D has been deployed to the software of Mech-Mind, and achieves a 91.7% success rate in bin-picking experiments, marking its application in industrial pose estimation tasks.
