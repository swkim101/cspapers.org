Recent studies reveal that well-performing reinforcement learning (RL) agents in training often lack resilience against adversarial perturbations during deployment. This highlights the importance of building a robust agent before deploying it in the real world. Most prior works focus on developing robust training-based procedures to tackle this problem, including enhancing the robustness of the deep neural network component itself or adversarially training the agent on strong attacks. In this work, we instead study an input transformation-based defense for RL. Specifically, we propose using a variant of vector quantization (VQ) as a transformation for input observations, which is then used to reduce the space of adversarial attacks during testing, resulting in the transformed observations being less affected by attacks. Our method is computationally efficient and seamlessly integrates with adversarial training, further enhancing the robustness of RL agents against adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments in multiple environments, we demonstrate that using VQ as the input transformation effectively defends against adversarial attacks on the agentâ€™s observations.
