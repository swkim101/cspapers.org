Virtual Model Control (VMC) is an approach to design a controller for force-controlled robots in complex uncertain environments. While this method was primarily investigated for legged robot locomotion in the past, it can be more generally applicable to other types of robotic systems. This paper investigates the VMC framework for reaching tasks in a force-controlled robotic arm. We propose six different approaches to designing virtual models in order to achieve reaching tasks in environments with obstacles and uncertainties. A force-controlled 8 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot was used to validate the proposed approach in the real world. We conducted three experiments to test the performance of VMC controllers in terms of predictability, sensitivity to external force, and adaptability against known and unknown obstacles. Experimental analyses show that, even though the proposed approach needs to sacrifice accuracy and trajectory optimality, it enables us to design complex reaching motions under uncertainties, in an intuitive and extendable manner.
