The paper explores the challenging task of performing a non-prehensile manipulation of several balls synchronously rolling on the curved hands of Butterfly robots. Each Butterfly robot represents a standard benchmark hardware setup, comprising a DC motor rotating a butterfly-shaped frame in a vertical plane, with a ball moving freely upon it, equipped with integrated computer vision, communication, programmable control, and computation interfaces. The combined dynamics of the considered system, consisting of N â‰¥ 2 such robots, is inherently underactuated, characterized by N active and N passive degrees of freedom, as well as N independent unilateral constraints that model the interactions between the frames and the balls, assuming no slipping. We focus on designing a model-based centralized feedback controller to achieve synchronized rotations of the balls. We assume the accuracy of our mathematical model and the feasibility of implementing a discretized version of the proposed continuous-time controller with a sufficiently small sampling time, that, in particular, is necessary for numerical differentiation. Relying on orbital stability of nominal periodic solution of the closed-loop system, we will experimentally check robustness to various inevitable challenges such as noises, disturbances, uncertainties, and communication delays. Hence, our concentration lies in designing an orbitally stabilizing controller for the underactuated models. The primary contribution is proposing one set of transverse coordinates, enabling transverse-linearization-based controller design, accompanied by pertinent closed-loop system analysis tools, thereby enhancing the efficacy of solving the manipulation task. Analytical and model-based arguments are validated through successful simulations and experiments conducted on two Butterfly robots, thereby emphasizing the validity and practicality of the proposed approach.
