A pilot needs to manipulate various gadgets in the cockpit based on vast knowledge of rules and procedures while verbally communicating with air traffic controllers. While precision manipulation in the cockpit during the flight is already a difficult task, a far more difficult thing is how to make a robot learn all the knowledge needed to fly an airplane in accordance with all the rules and regulations. As a pioneering effort, this paper introduces LLM-PIBOT, which leverages the latest advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to empower a humanoid pilot robot (PIBOT) to take the full authority of an airplane by understanding and executing complex procedures outlined in Pilotâ€™s Operating Handbooks (POHs). Unlike traditional rule-based methods, LLM-PIBOT system infers suitable flight procedures, employs an embedding process to accurately identify relevant procedures within documents, and structures the text-extracted flight tasks into tuples using our carefully crafted prompts. This approach enables PIBOT to adapt to the given POHs, generating and executing task plans in real-time in response to commands and situations. Experimental results show that LLM-PIBOT can comprehend and follow the complex procedures specified in the manuals and to fly the airplane on a full-scale simulator using the generated flight plans.
