This paper addresses the challenge of actuating millimetre-sized motors, which are wirelessly driven by external magnetic fields. Traditional approaches, relying on rotating magnetic fields, often inadvertently cause the entire robot – especially if it is small and lightweight – to rotate, instead of a specified shaft in the motor. To overcome this issue, our study introduces a novel mechanism that leverages symmetrically configured magnetic motors to cancel out the torques, thus preventing unwanted rotation of the robot. This is achieved by utilizing a magnetic field along a single axis to induce rotational movement. The design features two millimetre-sized rotating magnets that interact to achieve a 90◦ rotation, complemented by an external magnetic field that accomplishes the remaining 270◦, thus completing a full rotation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying a perpendicularly oriented magnetic field can inversely affect the motor’s rotation direction. A proof-of-concept experiment employing this mechanism successfully actuated a gripper in a water tank while it is free-floating, showcasing its potential for enhancing robotic applications at the sub-centimeter scale, where the small net torque of a miniature motor is essential.
