This paper builds upon the well-established ML-based grasping technique, known as the Grasp-Rectangle (GR) method. The original GR method made two simplifying assumptions: it was designed exclusively for two-finger grippers, and it assumed that the gripper would approach objects solely from a top-down perspective on a horizontal surface. We have extended the GR method, for a multi-finger hand beyond these assumptions to (1) enable grasping from top and side views and (2) engage multiple points of contact, enhancing the algorithmâ€™s overall performance. Our approach leverages geometric cues extracted from object images to calculate the optimal grasp pose and contact points, thereby enhancing grasp reliability. Extensive testing was conducted using a 7DOF robotic arm equipped with a 7-DOF 3-finger gripper. We achieved an accuracy of 98.6% on the Cornell Grasping Dataset with a processing time of 120 milliseconds. Furthermore, when assessing object grasping from both top and side perspectives, our algorithm delivered successful grasps at rates of 95% and 96%, respectively. These findings are rooted in a comprehensive series of tests performed across a diverse array of objects.
