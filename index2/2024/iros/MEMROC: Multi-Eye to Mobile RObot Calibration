This paper presents MEMROC (Multi-Eye to Mobile RObot Calibration), a novel motion-based calibration method that simplifies the process of accurately calibrating multiple cameras relative to a mobile robot’s reference frame. MEMROC utilizes a known calibration pattern to facilitate accurate calibration with a lower number of images during the optimization process. Additionally, it leverages robust ground plane detection for comprehensive 6-DoF extrinsic calibration, overcoming a critical limitation of many existing methods that struggle to estimate the complete camera pose. The proposed method addresses the need for frequent recalibration in dynamic environments, where cameras may shift slightly or alter their positions due to daily usage, operational adjustments, or vibrations from mobile robot movements. MEMROC exhibits remarkable robustness to noisy odometry data, requiring minimal calibration input data. This combination makes it highly suitable for daily operations involving mobile robots. A comprehensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real data proves MEMROC’s efficiency, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and ease of use. To facilitate further research, we have made our code publicly available1.
