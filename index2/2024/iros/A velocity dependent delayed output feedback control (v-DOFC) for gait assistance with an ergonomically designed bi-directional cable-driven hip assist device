Hip assistance with cable-driven devices has been proven to help decrease the metabolic cost of gait. However, most existing devices use heavy actuating modules or provide assistance in only one direction, limiting the effectiveness. Cable-driven devices are also difficult to accurately estimate the hip position using only motor encoders, therefore utilizing various auxiliary sensors. This paper introduces a 1.5 kg cable-driven soft wearable hip assist device that can provide assistance in both flexion and extension, using a velocity-dependent delayed output feedback controller (v-DOFC). The device is designed with the consideration of ergonomics and pressure distribution of wearable parts, to increase the anchoring performance and comfort. The controller uses time-delayed feedback proportional to the velocity output state, allowing control without requiring accurate position estimation. Additionally, directional weighting is used to provide different assistance forces for extension and flexion to match different optimal assistance values. Experimental results show that the device can reduce metabolic cost by 13.8 % compared to walking without the device. The soft wearable hip assist device can be applied to help the elderly with weaker muscles to walk longer distances.
