Zero-day vulnerabilities pose a significant challenge to robot cyber-physical systems (CPS). Attackers can exploit software vulnerabilities in widely-used robotics software, such as the Robot Operating System (ROS), to manipulate robot behavior, compromising both safety and operational effectiveness. The hidden nature of these vulnerabilities requires strong defense mechanisms to guarantee the safety and dependability of robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce RoboCop, a cyber-physical attack detection framework designed to protect robots from zero-day threats. RoboCop leverages static software features in the pre-execution analysis along with runtime state monitoring to identify attack patterns and deviations that signal attacks, thus ensuring the robotâ€™s operational integrity. We evaluated RoboCop on the F1-tenth autonomous car platform. It achieves a 93% detection accuracy against a variety of zero-day attacks targeting sensors, actuators, and controller logic. Importantly, in on-robot deployments, it identifies attacks in less than 7 seconds with a 12% computational overhead.
