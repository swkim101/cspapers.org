LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) demonstrates outstanding accuracy and stability in general low-speed and smooth motion scenarios. However, in high-speed and intense motion scenarios, such as sharp turns, two primary challenges arise: firstly, due to the limitations of IMU frequency, the error in estimating significantly non-linear motion states escalates; secondly, drastic changes in the Field of View (FOV) may diminish the spatial overlap between LiDAR frame and pointcloud map (or between frames), leading to insufficient data association and constraint degradation.To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive Sliding window LIO framework (AS-LIO) guided by the Spatial Overlap Degree (SOD). Initially, we assess the SOD between the LiDAR frames and the registered map, directly evaluating the adverse impact of current FOV variation on pointcloud alignment. Subsequently, we design an adaptive sliding window to manage the continuous LiDAR stream and control state updates, dynamically adjusting the update step according to the SOD. This strategy enables our odometry to adaptively adopt higher update frequency to precisely characterize trajectory during aggressive FOV variation, thus effectively reducing the non-linear error in positioning. Meanwhile, the historical constraints within the sliding window reinforce the frame-to-map data association, ensuring the robustness of state estimation. Experiments show that our AS-LIO framework can quickly perceive and respond to challenging FOV change, outperforming other state-of-the-art LIO frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.
