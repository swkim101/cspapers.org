Intubation is essential for ventilating critically ill patients and involves precise maneuvering of a laryngoscope to place an endotracheal tube (ETT). However, training for this procedure is fraught with challenges. Traditional methods, relying on manikins or training with a single sensing modality, fail to adequately convey important interaction information. Such challenge is heightened in pediatric intubation due to anatomical differences that demand greater precision. Furthermore, integrating multiple sensing modalities into a laryngoscope without changing its size presents a significant design challenge, critical for maintaining realistic training scenarios. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a sensorized laryngoscope system equipped with a force-torque sensor, a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU), and tactile sensors. This system, validated in a preliminary user study, provides online feedback on angles, forces, and grip strength through an online feedback GUI. Adopting a learning-by-demonstration approach with both experts and novices, the initial validation confirmed the systemâ€™s potential, paving the way for expanded trials with more participants.
