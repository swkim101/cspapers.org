In this work, we develop a control algorithm for mobile manipulators manipulating an object within a leader-follower framework. Unlike existing literature, we avoid the knowledge of the objectâ€™s dynamics, and only the leader is aware of the tasks to be executed by the object. The followers are primarily tasked to lift the object and maintain a desired posture while the leader manipulates the object despite its unknown dynamic parameters. We employ a stiffness-based controller for the followers, allowing set-point stabilisation with permissible flexibility and a high-gain prescribed performance controller for the leader to facilitate manipulation from the object's equilibrium state. We present simulation results with two followers and one leader KUKA youbots to validate our proposed framework.
