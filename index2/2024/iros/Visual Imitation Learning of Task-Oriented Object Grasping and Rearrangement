Task-oriented object grasping and rearrangement are key skills for robots, which have to perform versatile real-world manipulation tasks. However, they remain challenging due to partial observations of the objects and shape variations in categorical objects. In this paper, we present the Multi-feature Implicit Model (MIMO), a novel object representation that encodes multiple spatial features between a point and an object in an implicit neural field. Training such a model on multiple features ensures that it embeds the object shapes consistently in different aspects, thus improving its performance in object shape reconstruction from partial observation, shape similarity measure, and modeling spatial relations between objects. Based on MIMO, we propose a framework to learn task-oriented object grasping and rearrangement from single or multiple human demonstration videos. The evaluations in simulation show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for multi- and single-view observations. Real-world experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in one- and few-shot imitation learning of manipulation tasks.
