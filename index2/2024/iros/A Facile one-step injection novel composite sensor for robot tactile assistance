Tactile information is the research hotspot of wearable flexible sensors due to its importance and complexity. With the innovation of wearable technology and robotics in healthcare, researchers are increasingly integrating wearable flexible sensors on the front end of robots to reproduce the hand tactile manipulation of human tissues. Therefore, it is hoped to develop a thin-film sensor that can be deployed in a small area to assist robots in surgery and data collection of human tissues. Here we use a one-step injection method to fabricate a novel composite sensor based on liquid metal. By laminating multiple PDMS microfluidic layers, the two parameters of pressure and deformation are measured simultaneously in a decoupled manner. The sensor is small and thin, making it easy to integrate into fingers/robot fingers for assistance. The finger/robot finger exerts pressure on the sensor and the sensor deforms with the material to identify the hardness of the material being touched. Separate performance tests of the two sensors show that the strain and pressure functions are decoupled from each other, and their ratios can identify and classify the hardness of different touched materials (glass, PDMS and silicone). This novel composite sensor we proposed can assist robots in manipulating human tissues during medical surgeries. At the same time, its function in tactile information feedback also has broad applications in medical treatment, rehabilitation and services.
