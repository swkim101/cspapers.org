This study presents the development and validation of an innovative hand exoskeleton designed for the re-habilitation of patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a condition frequently arising post-injury or surgeries. The prototype is tailored for the hand, a region commonly affected by CRPS, and is notable for its adaptability and a comprehensive sensor system for monitoring individual joint movements. Reliable sensor performance was defined through precise force measurements and stability over time, showing minimal drift. These features enable personalized rehabilitation and objective progress tracking, addressing limitations in traditional physiotherapy such as availability, cost, and time constraints. The contributions of this work lie in its innovative design and the potential for robotic systems to improve therapeutic outcomes in CRPS rehabilitation.
