In flexible redundantly-driven multi-DOF systems, like living beings, the representation of redundant kinematics including the diversity of solutions, is crucial for leveraging its distinctive characteristics. This paper proposes an active learning framework for forward and inverse modeling of complex kinematics that improves expressions of control space, task space, and null space. It consists of a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)-type network that internally holds expressions of control space, task space, and null space, and an algorithm for selecting new data using the cross-entropy method. The validity of the proposed system was verified using a tensegrity manipulator driven by 40 pneumatic cylinders. As a result, it was confirmed that active learning contributed to achieving the entire range of motion covered and a well-organized representation of the null space.
