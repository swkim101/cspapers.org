Efficiently navigating and manipulating objects in complex environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics. This paper presents a novel approach to streamline object-pushing tasks by integrating Behavior Trees (BT) to coordinate a control and planning framework. The proposed system optimizes the execution of tasks involving the pushing of objects while ensuring adaptability to varying scenarios.Our approach employs BTs to encapsulate high-level task specifications and decision-making processes, facilitating a flexible and intuitive representation of robot behavior. By seamlessly integrating BT technology with a coordinated control and planning system, we enable the robot to make real-time decisions and adapt to dynamic environments.We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its ability to improve task execution efficiency and adaptability.
