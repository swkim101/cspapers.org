Building on the unprecedented capabilities of large language models for command understanding and zero-shot recognition of multi-modal vision-language transformers, visual language navigation (VLN) has emerged as an effective way to address multiple fundamental challenges toward a natural language interface to robot navigation. However, such vision-language models are inherently vulnerable due to the lack of semantic meaning of the underlying embedding space. Using a recently developed gradient-based optimization procedure, we demonstrate that images can be modified imperceptibly to match the representation of totally different images and unrelated texts for a vision-language model. Building on this, we develop algorithms that can adversarially modify a minimal number of images so that the robot will follow a route of choice for commands that require a number of landmarks. We demonstrate that experimentally using a recently proposed VLN system; for a given navigation command, a robot can be made to follow drastically different routes. We also develop an efficient algorithm to detect such malicious modifications reliably based on the fact that the adversarially modified images have much higher sensitivity to added Gaussian noise than the original images.
