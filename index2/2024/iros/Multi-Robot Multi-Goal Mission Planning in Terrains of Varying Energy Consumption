This paper considers planning missions for a fleet of robots with limited energy. Each robot has size, heading, and velocity and its motion is described by non-linear differential equations. The dynamics of movements, existing obstacles, multiple robots, and waypoints are additional challenges, as the combined task and motion planning procedure prevents collisions. On their long-term missions, robots have to visit several waypoints in a cost-minimizing manner to satisfy the overall mission task. The robots consume energy and have to be recharged. The framework guides expanding a motion tree via a state projection to a discrete problem, whose solutions serve as search heuristics. Our experiments highlight that despite all these challenges, even sizable problem tasks can be solved even for complex environments.
