If a picture paints a thousand words, sound may voice a million. While recent robotic painting and image synthesis methods have achieved progress in generating visuals from text inputs, the translation of sound into images is vastly unexplored. Generally, sound-based interfaces and sonic interactions have the potential to expand accessibility and control for the user and provide a means to convey complex emotions and the dynamic aspects of the real world. In this paper, we propose an approach for using sound and speech to guide a robotic painting process, known here as robot synesthesia. For general sound, we encode the simulated paintings and input sounds into the same latent space. For speech, we decouple speech audio into its transcribed text and the tone of the speech. Whereas we use the text to control the content, we estimate the emotions from the tone to guide the mood of the painting. Our approach has been fully integrated with FRIDA, a robotic painting framework, adding sound and speech to FRIDAâ€™s existing input modalities such as text and style. In two surveys, participants were able to correctly guess the emotion or natural sound used to generate a given painting more than twice as likely as random chance. On our sound-guided image manipulation and music-guided paintings, we discuss the results qualitatively.
