Rod-driven soft robots (RDSR) with a well-balanced performance in terms of perception, precision, and intelligence have a great potential for application. Mathematical description and predicted sensing of deformable soft bodies are crucial to achieve controllable and intelligent behaviors of these robots. In this work, we propose a kinetostatic model for RDSR embedded with co-located sensors based on the Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) approach where local deformations, actuation lengths and external interactions are included. This approach allows us to estimate the shape of RDSR and predict the strain variation of soft bodies under internal and external interactions. Simulations and experimental results show that tip position errors are not greater than 1.8% with respect to the whole body length under different loads (0, 100, 200, 300 gf). The maximum error of predicted sensor length change is up to 2 mm and its percentage relative to the actual length does not exceed 4%. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model.
