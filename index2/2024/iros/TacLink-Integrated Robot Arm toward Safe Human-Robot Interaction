Recent developments in vision-based tactile sensing offer a simple means to enable robots to perceive touch interactions. However, existing sensors are primarily designed for small-scale applications like robotic hands, lacking research on their integration for large-sized robot bodies that can be leveraged for safe human-robot interactions. This paper explores the utilization of the previously-developed vision-based tactile sensing link (called TacLink) with soft skin as a safety control mechanism, which can serve as an alternative to conventional rigid robot links and impact observers. We characterize the behavior of a robot integrated with the soft TacLink in response to collisions, particularly employing a reactive control strategy. The controller is primarily driven by tactile force information acquired from the soft TacLink sensor through a data-driven sim2real learning method. Compared with a standard rigid link, the results obtained from collision experiments also confirm the advantages of our "soft" solution in impact resilience and in facilitating controls that are difficult to achieve with a stiff robot body. This study can act as a benchmark for assessing the efficiency of soft tactile-sensitive skins in reactive collision responses and open new safety standards for soft skin-based collaborative robots in human-robot interaction scenarios.
