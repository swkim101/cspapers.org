Despite their success in LIDAR object detection, modern detectors are vulnerable to uncommon instances and corner cases (e.g., a runaway tire) since they are closed-set and static. Networks under the closed-set setup only predict labels of seen classes, while static models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when gradually learning novel concepts. This motivates us to formulate the open-world 3D object detection task for autonomous driving, which aims to 1) tackle the closed-set issue by identifying unseen instances as unknown and 2) incrementally learn novel classes without forgetting previously obtained knowledge. To achieve the open-world objectives, we propose Open-World 3D Detector (OW3Det), the first framework for open-world 3D object detection. The OW3Det comprises a base detector, a self-supervised unknown identifier, and a knowledge-distillation-restricted incremental learner. Although knowledge distillation facilitates preserving memories, imposing penalties on areas containing unknown objects hinders the incremental learning process. We mitigate this hindrance by employing unknown-driven pivotal mask, which eliminates unnecessary restrictions on regions overlapping with novel instances. Abundant experiments and visualizations demonstrate that the proposed OW3Det attains state-of-the-art performance.
