In intelligent robotics, which spans from assistive devices to automation, the development of autonomous systems merges computational and physical capabilities, such as in autonomous wheelchairs. Many-core processor, essential for real-time operations, pose challenges to software adaptability. This paper introduces ROS-lite2, which is a software platform for autonomous vehicles, utilizing a ROS 2 framework based on many-core processor to boost flexibility and simplify deployment. Our method facilitates complex function integration and intuitive operation with less hardware knowledge. Experiments with an autonomous wheelchair demonstrate the platformâ€™s effectiveness in improving autonomy and reducing development effort, advancing robotic assistance.
