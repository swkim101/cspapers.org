This paper presents an incremental replanning algorithm, dubbed LTL-D*, for temporal-logic-based task planning in a dynamically changing environment. Unexpected changes in the environment may lead to failures in satisfying a task specification in the form of a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). In this study, the considered failures are categorized into two classes: (i) the desired LTL specification can be satisfied via replanning, and (ii) the desired LTL specification is infeasible to meet strictly and can only be satisfied in a "relaxed" fashion. To address these failures, the proposed algorithm finds an optimal replanning solution that minimally violates desired task specifications. In particular, our approach leverages the D* Lite algorithm and employs a distance metric within the synthesized automaton to quantify the degree of the task violation and then replan incrementally. This ensures plan optimality and reduces planning time, especially when frequent replanning is required. Our approach is implemented in a robot navigation simulation to demonstrate a significant improvement in the computational efficiency for replanning by two orders of magnitude.
