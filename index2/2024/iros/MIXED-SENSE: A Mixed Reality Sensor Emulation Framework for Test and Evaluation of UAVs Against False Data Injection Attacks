We present a high-fidelity Mixed Reality sensor emulation framework for testing and evaluating the resilience of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) against false data injection (FDI) attacks. The proposed approach can be utilized to assess the impact of FDI attacks, benchmark attack detector performance, and validate the effectiveness of mitigation/reconfiguration strategies in single-UAV and UAV swarm operations. Our Mixed Reality framework leverages high-fidelity simulations of Gazebo and a Motion Capture system to emulate proprioceptive (e.g., GNSS) and exteroceptive (e.g., camera) sensor measurements in real-time. We propose an empirical approach to faithfully recreate signal characteristics such as latency and noise in these measurements. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of our proposed framework through a Mixed Reality experiment consisting of an emulated GNSS attack on an actual UAV, which (i) demonstrates the impact of false data injection attacks on GNSS measurements and (ii) validates a mitigation strategy utilizing a distributed camera network developed in our previous work.
