In this work, we introduce SMART-LLM, an innovative framework designed for embodied multi-robot task planning. SMART-LLM: Smart Multi-Agent Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models (LLMs), harnesses the power of LLMs to convert high-level task instructions provided as input into a multi-robot task plan. It accomplishes this by executing a series of stages, including task decomposition, coalition formation, and task allocation, all guided by programmatic LLM prompts within the few-shot prompting paradigm. We create a benchmark dataset designed for validating the multi-robot task planning problem, encompassing four distinct categories of high-level instructions that vary in task complexity. Our evaluation experiments span both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating that the proposed model can achieve promising results for generating multi-robot task plans.
