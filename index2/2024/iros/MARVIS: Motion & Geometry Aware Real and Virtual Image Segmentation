Tasks such as autonomous navigation, 3D reconstruction, and object recognition near the water surfaces are crucial in marine robotics applications. However, challenges arise due to dynamic disturbances, e.g., light reflections and refraction from the random air-water interface, irregular liquid flow, and similar factors, which can lead to potential failures in perception and navigation systems. Traditional computer vision algorithms struggle to differentiate between real and virtual image regions, significantly complicating tasks. A virtual image region is an apparent representation formed by the redirection of light rays, typically through reflection or refraction, creating the illusion of an objectâ€™s presence without its actual physical location. This work proposes a novel approach for segmentation on real and virtual image regions, exploiting synthetic images combined with domain-invariant information, a Motion Entropy Kernel, and Epipolar Geometric Consistency. Our segmentation network does not need to be re-trained if the domain changes. We show this by deploying the same segmentation network in two different domains: simulation and the real world. By creating realistic synthetic images that mimic the complexities of the water surface, we provide fine-grained training data for our network (MARVIS) to discern between real and virtual images effectively. By motion & geometry-aware design choices and through comprehensive experimental analysis, we achieve state-of-the-art real-virtual image segmentation performance in unseen real world domain, achieving an IoU over 78% and a F1-Score over 86% while ensuring a small computational footprint. MARVIS offers over 43 FPS (8 FPS) inference rates on a single GPU (CPU core). Our code and dataset are available here https://github.com/jiayi-wu-umd/MARVIS.
