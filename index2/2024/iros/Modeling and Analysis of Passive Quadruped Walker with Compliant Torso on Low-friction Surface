The quadrupeds have wider active territory than humans. Their bodies can adapt various environments through evolution, enabling the efficient, elegant gait for their legged locomotion. Previous researches have indicated lots of examples of utilizing the advantages of body to achieve environment adaptive and stable gait, and for legged locomotion, especially with quadruped robot determining how to generate environment-adaptive mobile locomotion remains a significant challenge. In this study, we discussed the adaptability to environments of quadruped robots, specific walking stability and gait convergence in low-friction environments with compliant torso. The numerically simulations are proposed for observing the trend of walking performance with various friction coefficient. By analyzing the typical walking gait, the adaptability of quadruped walkers with compliant torso are found. These conclusions contribute to the design and development of compliant torso for quadruped walkers.
