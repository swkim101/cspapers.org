Suction cups are popular for picking and transporting packages in warehouse applications. To maximize throughput, high transport speeds are desired. Many packages are deformable and may detach from the suction cups due to inertial loading if trajectories use excessive velocities. This paper introduces a novel methodology that analyzes package deformation through its curvature at the package-suction cup contact interface to generate a Factor-of-Safety (FOS) score for each waypoint in a given trajectory. By maintaining the FOS above a predetermined threshold, the trajectory planner is able to generate transport trajectories that are both safe and time-optimized. Experimental results show the methodâ€™s efficacy, demonstrating a 21.92% reduction in transport times compared to a conservative trajectory generation. Our FOS predictor identified trajectories that ensured safe package transport with 100% accuracy across all 627 real-world experiments.
