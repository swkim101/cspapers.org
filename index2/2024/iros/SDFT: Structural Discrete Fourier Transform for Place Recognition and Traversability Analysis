The ability to associate the current location with previously visited places is an essential aspect of autonomous ground robots. Unstructured environments such as planetary surfaces pose a significant challenge for robots because their terrain is less distinctive. Meanwhile, traversability must be analyzed simultaneously for safe navigation. In the past, place recognition research has rarely considered traversability analysis despite its significance. This is because the structural information of terrains becomes quickly implicit during the encoding process. This paper provides a method that explicitly addresses both problems: place recognition and traversability analysis. It proposes a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to represent the frequency components embedded in ground curvature, which underlies both concepts. Our place recognition function demonstrates excellent performance in extensive experiments using challenging planetary & urban datasets while estimating traversability that other approaches find difficult to handle.
