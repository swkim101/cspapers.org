Semantic segmentation of point clouds is an essential task for understanding the environment in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent range-based works achieve real-time efficiency, while point- and voxel-based methods produce better results but are affected by high computational complexity. Moreover, highly complex deep learning models are often not suited to efficiently learn from small datasets. Their generalization capabilities can easily be driven by the abundance of data rather than the architecture design. In this paper, we harness the information from the three-dimensional representation to proficiently capture local features, while introducing the range image representation to incorporate additional information and facilitate fast computation. A GPU-based KDTree allows for rapid building, querying, and enhancing projection with straightforward operations. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate the benefits of our modification in a "small data" setup, in which only one sequence of the dataset is used to train the models, but also in the conventional setup, where all sequences except one are used for training. We show that a reduced version of our model not only demonstrates strong competitiveness against full-scale state-of-the-art models but also operates in real-time, making it a viable choice for real-world case applications.
