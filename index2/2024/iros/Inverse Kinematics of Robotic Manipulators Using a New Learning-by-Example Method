Inverse Kinematics (IK) is one of the most fundamental challenges in robotics. It refers to the process of determining the joint configurations required to achieve the desired position and orientation (pose) of a robot end-effector. Although numerous Data-Driven (DD) IK solvers have demonstrated encouraging results, they have not achieved the same accuracy when compared to other IK methods for complex robot configurations (e.g., numerical methods for higher Degrees of Freedom (DoF)). In this work, we propose a new Learning-by-Example method, and show that such a scheme considerably improves the IK learning results when compared to other DD learners. In our approach, the network input incorporates an example of joint-pose pair along with the query pose to predict the desired robot joint configuration. We show that the example joint-pose pair does not need to be too close to the query â€“ i.e. example and query can be as far as 20 degrees apart in the joint configuration space. Furthermore, we investigate the utilization of residual and dense skip connections in Multilayer Perceptron for DDIK solvers and employ the resulting networks for two redundant robotic manipulators: a 7-DoF-7R commensurate robot and a 7DoF-2RP4R incommensurate robot. Our experimental results show that the resulting DDIK solver can reliably predict IK solutions with accuracy better than 1mm in position and 1deg in orientation.
