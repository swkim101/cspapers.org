With the aging of society, there has been an increase in the number of elderly individuals with limb movement disorders. Active rehabilitation training using limb rehabilitation electromechanical devices that incorporate multimodal sensing and monitoring functions can significantly contribute to the recovery of limb motor functions. This report introduces a wearable mechanical pressure-electrophysiological monitoring bimodal sensing system specifically designed for human limb rehabilitation devices. By utilizing just four electrodes (SE, CE/DE, GND, REF), this system enables simultaneous and co-located measurement of surface electromyographic (sEMG), pressure, and mechanomyography (MMG) signals. These signals can be utilized to analyze muscle tension, stiffness, and tremor information. At last, this sensing system was used to assess muscle contraction force and localized muscle fatigue. The time and frequency domain characteristics of physiological signals during exercise were thoroughly investigated. The wearable mechanical pressure-electrophysiological bimodal sensing system can provide valuable data references for rehabilitation robots or human limb rehabilitation device, which is of great significance in the diagnosis of muscular diseases and rehabilitation treatment.
