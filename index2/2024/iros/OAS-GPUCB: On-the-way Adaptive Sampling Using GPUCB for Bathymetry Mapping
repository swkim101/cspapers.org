Bathymetry mapping of static water bodies like lakes is essential for sustainable ecosystem development strategies. However, bathymetry mapping using (i) traditional manual sampling approaches using single-beam echosounder (SBE) has large mapping errors and (ii) performing multi-beam survey is very expensive. Alternatively, performing lawn-mower SBE surveys is time consuming due to limited field-of-view. In order to address the above issues, in this paper, we present an on-the-way sampling approach with Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GPUCB) algorithm called as OAS-GPUCB that can adaptively sample the lake to minimize the bathymetry error while reducing the distance travelled to achieve a given mapping accuracy. We validate the proposed approach using simulations on actual lake bathymetry maps and also carry out real-world experiments using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) with SBE. Further, we compare OAS-GPUCB to lawn-mower, GPUCB, and GPUCB with fixed radius approaches. The results consistently show that the proposed approach can achieve less than 10% bathymetry error while achieving distance reduction of more than 55%compared to the lawn-mower approach, and more than 90% less distance travelled compared to GPUCB and GPUCB with fixed radius approaches. The results shows the general applicability of OAS-GPUCB for bathymetry mapping of water bodies without any prior information maps.
