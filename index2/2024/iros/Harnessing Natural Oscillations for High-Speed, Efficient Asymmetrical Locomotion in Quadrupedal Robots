This study explores the dynamics of asymmetrical bounding gaits in quadrupedal robots, focusing on the integration of torso pitching and hip motion to enhance speed and stability. Traditional control strategies often enforce a fixed posture, minimizing natural body movements to simplify the control problem. However, this approach may overlook the inherent dynamical advantages found in natural locomotion. By considering the robot as two interconnected segments, we concentrate on stance leg motion while allowing passive torso oscillation, drawing inspiration from natural dynamics and underactuated robotics principles. Our control scheme employs Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) and Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) models to govern front and rear leg movements independently. This approach has been validated through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating successful high-speed locomotion with top speeds nearing 4 m/s and reduced ground reaction forces, indicating a more efficient gait. Furthermore, unlike conventional methods, our strategy leverages natural torso oscillations to aid leg circulation and stride length, aligning robot dynamics more closely with biological counterparts. Our findings suggest that embracing the natural dynamics of quadrupedal movement, particularly in asymmetrical gaits like bounding, can lead to more stable, efficient, and high-speed robotic locomotion. This investigation lays the groundwork for future studies on versatile and dynamic quadrupedal gaits and their potential applications in scenarios demanding rapid and effective locomotion.
