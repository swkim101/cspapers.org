In this work, we address the challenges of robust precision landing maneuvers for a quadrotor on both stationary and moving ground targets in the presence of disturbances that can cause the quadrotor to deviate from its desired trajectory, leading to maneuver failure. To overcome this, we propose a novel online adaptive trajectory planning approach based on the online temporal scaling adaptation of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). This adaptation enables the desired trajectory to be dynamically adjusted in response to tracking errors and the goalâ€™s state. Consequently, our proposed approach enhances accuracy, precision, and safety during landing maneuvers. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through comprehensive experiments conducted in both physical simulations and real-world environments, covering various disturbance scenarios.
