We present a novel approach to learning-augmented, long-horizon navigation under uncertainty in large-scale environments in which considering the robot dynamics is essential for informing good behavior. Our approach tightly integrates sampling-based motion planning, which computes dynamically feasible routes to the goal through different unexplored boundaries, and a high-level planner that leverages predictions about unseen space to select a route that best makes progress toward the unseen goal. Owing to its ability to understand the impacts of the robotâ€™s dynamics on how it should attempt to reach the goal, our approach achieves both higher reliability and improved navigation performance compared to competitive learning-informed and non-learned baselines in simulated office-building-like environments.
