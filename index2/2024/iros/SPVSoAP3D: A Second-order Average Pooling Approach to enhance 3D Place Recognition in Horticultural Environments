3D LiDAR-based place recognition has been extensively researched in urban environments, yet it remains underexplored in agricultural settings. Unlike urban contexts, horticultural environments, characterized by their permeability to laser beams, result in sparse and overlapping LiDAR scans with suboptimal geometries. This phenomenon leads to intra-and inter-row descriptor ambiguity. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing SPVSoAP3D, a novel modeling approach that combines a voxel-based feature extraction network with an aggregation technique based on a second-order average pooling operator, complemented by a descriptor enhancement stage. Furthermore, we augment the existing HORTO-3DLM dataset by introducing two new sequences derived from horticultural environments. We evaluate the performance of SPVSoAP3D against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, including OverlapTransformer, PointNetVLAD, and LOGG3D-Net, utilizing a cross-validation protocol on both the newly introduced sequences and the existing HORTO-3DLM dataset. The findings indicate that the average operator is more suitable for horticultural environments compared to the max operator and other first-order pooling techniques. Additionally, the results highlight the improvements brought by the descriptor enhancement stage. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cybonic/SPVSoAP3D.git
