State-of-the-art (SOTA) visual object tracking methods have significantly enhanced the autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, in low-light conditions, the presence of irregular real noise from the environments severely degrades the performance of these SOTA methods. Moreover, existing SOTA denoising techniques often fail to meet the real-time processing requirements when deployed as plug-and-play denoisers for UAV tracking. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel conditional generative denoiser (CG-Denoiser), which breaks free from the limitations of traditional deterministic paradigms and generates the noise conditioning on the input, subsequently removing it. To better align the input dimensions and accelerate inference, a novel nested residual Transformer conditionalizer is developed. Furthermore, an innovative multi-kernel conditional refiner is designed to pertinently refine the denoised output. Extensive experiments show that CGDenoiser promotes the tracking precision of the SOTA tracker by 18.18% on DarkTrack2021 whereas working 5.8 times faster than the second well-performed denoiser. Real-world tests with complex challenges also prove the effectiveness and practicality of CGDenoiser.
