The rising demand for customized products necessitates the integration of multiple robotic systems, underscoring the need for advanced production planning and scheduling. This paper introduces an ontology-based, artificial intelligence-enhanced method for dynamic task planning and scheduling, aimed at improving the efficiency of production process, reducing machine downtime, and consequently increasing throughput in assembly operations. Designed to generate and execute feasible production plans dynamically, this method minimizes manual planning and scheduling efforts. We evaluate its effectiveness using two gear assembly use cases with various robot skills, highlighting its flexibility in planning and scheduling and its contributions to the evolution of smart manufacturing. The methodâ€™s adaptability suggests its applicability across diverse smart factory environments.
