In order to improve the terrain adaptability and energy efficiency of wheel-legged robot in complex environment, a dual-mode navigation system based on robot energy consumption model is proposed. Firstly, the obstacle trafficability is evaluated according to the maximum obstacle crossing capability of the robot, and the two-dimensional grid map is preprocessed. Secondly, the established energy consumption model is integrated into the evaluation function of A* algorithm, and the eight-adjacency expansion mode is improved to search the surrounding nodes according to the obstacle characteristics of the robot. In the obstacle-crossing area, the obstacle-crossing and obstacle-bypassing modes are intelligently switched based on the principle of minimum energy consumption. Finally, a dual-mode robot navigation system is built, and the experimental results show that the proposed navigation system reduces the average energy consumption, path length, and steering angle by 16.8%, 24.7%, and 31.18%, respectively.
