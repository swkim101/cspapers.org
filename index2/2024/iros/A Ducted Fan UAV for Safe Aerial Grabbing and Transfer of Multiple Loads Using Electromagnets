In recent years, research on aerial grasping, manipulation, and transportation of objects has garnered significant attention. These tasks often require UAVs to operate safely close to environments or objects and to efficiently grasp payloads. However, current widely adopted flying platforms pose safety hazards: unprotected high-speed rotating propellers can cause harm to the surroundings. Additionally, the space for carrying payloads on the fuselage is limited, and the restricted position of the payload also hinders efficient grasping. To address these issues, this paper presents a coaxial ducted fan UAV which is equipped with electromagnets mounted externally on the fuselage, enabling safe grasping and transfer of multiple loads in midair without complex additional actuators. It also has the capability to achieve direct human-UAV cargo transfer in the air. The forces acting on the loads during magnetic attachment and their influencing factors were analyzed. An ADRC controller is utilized to counteract disturbances during grasping and achieve attitude control. Finally, flight tests are conducted to verify the UAVâ€™s ability to directly grasp multiple loads from human hands in flight while maintaining attitude tracking.
