The burgeoning demand for home-care services, driven by a rapidly aging global population, necessitates innovative solutions to alleviate the burden on caregivers and enhance care quality. This paper introduces the development of an Inter-net of Human and Robotic Things (IoHRT) framework, which synergizes cloud computing and the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) with human-robot collaborative control mechanisms for home-care applications. The IoHRT framework is designed to enable the seamless integration of customizable robotic platforms with modular, scalable, and compatible features, thereby creating a dynamic and adaptable home-care ecosystem. By leveraging the scalability and computational power of cloud computing, the framework facilitates real-time data analysis and remote monitoring, thus enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of home-care. We present an in-depth analysis of the key characteristics of IoHRT, supported by evidence embedded in our design, and conduct user studies to evaluate the framework from usersâ€™ perspectives. We demonstrate the performance and utility of our proposed framework for the future of home-care applications.
