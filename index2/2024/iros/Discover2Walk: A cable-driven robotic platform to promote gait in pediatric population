Recent advancements in gait rehabilitation have led to the development of innovative approaches that complement traditional therapeutic methods. These include intense, task-specific exercise strategies, non-invasive treatments, surgical interventions, and advanced robotic technologies. While robotic systems for adult gait rehabilitation are well-established, there is a notable scarcity of such devices for pediatric patients, especially toddlers, due to their unique developmental and biomechanical needs. This work introduces Discover2Walk (D2W), a novel robotic platform designed specifically for pediatric gait rehabilitation in small children. The D2W platform features a multi-module, cable-driven architecture guided by an omnidirectional traction module, addressing the limitations of current rehabilitation devices for younger populations. The platform's modular design consists of three actuated modules—pelvic, ankle, and traction—synchronized by a personalised gait pattern generator. This configuration allows for simultaneous control and monitoring of pelvic and ankle motion using partial body weight support and Assistance As Needed (AAN) approaches. Preliminary evaluations were conducted with pediatric patients with Cerebral Palsy, involving two ambulatory six-year-olds and one non-ambulatory four-year-old, over a series of 10 gait rehabilitation sessions. Data analysis from the ambulatory children showed a decrease in the robotic effort required to assist limb movements along healthy trajectories throughout the sessions, accompanied by an increase in walking speeds. Further work will include expanding the patient cohort to include a broader range of ages, sizes and GMFCS levels to validate the system's effectiveness across a wider spectrum of pediatric gait disabilities and validating the traction effectiveness.
