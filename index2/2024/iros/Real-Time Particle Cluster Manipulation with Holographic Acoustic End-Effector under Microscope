Non-contact particle cluster manipulation holds significant promise in the realms of advanced manufacturing, chemistry, and pharmacy. However, achieving precise and dynamic control over the spatial kinematics of particle clusters remains a significant challenge, necessitating real-time and accurately programmable robotic end-effector. To this end, we develop an innovative non-contact, precise particle cluster manipulation system with ultrasonic phased array transducer (PAT) under microscope. This system combines a physics-based deep learning algorithm for real-time calculation of phase-only holograms (POHs), supporting PAT to dynamically form acoustic fields, namely holographic acoustic end-effector (HAE). Leveraging the dynamically and accurately generated HAEs by our system, kinematics control of particle clusters including aggregation, rotation, and translation is yielded. The extensive experiments well demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed system for particle cluster manipulation.
