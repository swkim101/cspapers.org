Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable reasoning capabilities, making them influential across various fields. However, in robotics, their use has primarily been limited to manipulation planning tasks due to their inherent textual output. This paper addresses this limitation by investigating the potential of adopting the reasoning ability of LLMs for generating numerical predictions in robotics tasks, specifically for robotic grasping. We propose Reasoning Tuning, a novel method that integrates a reasoning phase before prediction during training, leveraging the extensive prior knowledge and advanced reasoning abilities of LLMs. This approach enables LLMs, notably with multi-modal capabilities, to generate accurate numerical outputs like grasp poses that are context-aware and adaptable through conversations. Additionally, we present the Reasoning Tuning VLM Grasp dataset, carefully curated to facilitate the adaptation of LLMs to robotic grasping. Extensive validation on both grasping datasets and real-world experiments underscores the adaptability of multi-modal LLMs for numerical prediction tasks in robotics. This not only expands their applicability but also bridges the gap between text-based planning and direct robot control, thereby maximizing the potential of LLMs in robotics. Our dataset will be released. More details and videos of this work are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/rt-grasp.
