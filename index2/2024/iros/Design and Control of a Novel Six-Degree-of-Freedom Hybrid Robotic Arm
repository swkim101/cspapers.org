Robotic arms are key components in fruit-harvesting robots. In agricultural settings, conventional serial or parallel robotic arms often fall short in meeting the demands for a large workspace, rapid movement, enhanced capability of obstacle avoidance and affordability. This study proposes LingXtend, a novel hybrid six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic arm that combines the advantages of parallel and serial mechanisms. Inspired by yoga, we designed two sliders capable of moving independently along a single rail, acting as two feet. These sliders are interconnected with linkages and a meshed-gear set, allowing the parallel mechanism to lower itself and perform a split to pass under obstacles. This unique feature allows the arm to avoid obstacles such as pipes, tables and beams typically found in greenhouses. Integrated with serially mounted joints, the patented hybrid arm is able to maintain the end’s pose even when it moves with a mobile platform, facilitating fruit picking with the optimal pose in dynamic conditions. Moreover, the hybrid arm’s workspace is substantially larger, being almost three times the volume of UR3 serial arms and fourteen times that of the ABB IRB parallel arms. Experiments show that the repeatability errors are 0.017 mm, 0.03 mm and 0.109 mm for the two sliders and the arm’s end, respectively, providing sufficient precision for agricultural robots.
