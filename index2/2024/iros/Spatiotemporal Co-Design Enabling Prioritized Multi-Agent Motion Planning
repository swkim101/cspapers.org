This paper introduces an innovative planner for prioritized multi-agent motion planning, employing a sequential integration of spatial and temporal designs. The planner initiates a smooth trajectory in space for each agent, ignoring the presence of other agents. Subsequently, by treating spatial collisions as 2D obstacles from a temporal perspective, the planner dynamically fine-tunes the trajectory-tracking speed of agents to avoid collisions, ensuring optimal time consumption for the last agent to reach the target as well. Additionally, the proposed approach systematically coordinates priority for each agent. The efficacy of the approach is validated through both simulations and comparative experiments with a recent planner.
