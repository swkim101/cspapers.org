Traditional teleoperation technologies based on video streaming are facing several challenges in practical applications, including limited bandwidth, constrained spatial awareness, and sensitivity to illumination. Existing studies have not adequately addressed these issues. This paper presents a novel non-video based teleoperation framework for autonomous vehicles operating in bandwidth-limited environments. To reduce the amount of data being transmitted, a persistent-transient environment model is proposed for telepresence. Initially, a digital twin of the environment is preconstructed, containing only persistent environmental information. Subsequently, transient information captured by onboard sensors, such as vehicle state and dynamic objects, necessitate real-time transmission. Based on this model, a 3D virtual scene is rendered in front of the teleoperator, offering any desired virtual viewpoint to enhance spatial awareness. This telepresence model only requires real-time transmission of minimal data, i.e., vehicle state and detected objects, and remains unaffected by illumination conditions, enabling teleoperation even in applications with Kbps-level bandwidth constraints. Experimental results showcase the substantial potential of the proposed framework in bandwidth-limited settings.
