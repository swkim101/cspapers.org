Many autonomous robotic applications require object-level understanding when deployed. Actively reconstructing objects of interest, i.e. objects with specific semantic meanings, is therefore relevant for a robot to perform downstream tasks in an initially unknown environment. In this work, we propose a novel framework for semantic-targeted active reconstruction using posed RGB-D measurements and 2D semantic labels as input. The key components of our framework are a semantic implicit neural representation and a compatible planning utility function based on semantic rendering and uncertainty estimation, enabling adaptive view planning to target objects of interest. Our planning approach achieves better reconstruction performance in terms of mesh and novel view rendering quality compared to implicit reconstruction baselines that do not consider semantics for view planning. Our framework further outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic-targeted active reconstruction pipeline based on explicit maps, justifying our choice of utilising implicit neural representations to tackle semantic-targeted active reconstruction problems.
