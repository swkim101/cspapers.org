Torque ripple reduction in quasi-direct drive (QDD) motors is crucial in their robotic applications for dynamic locomotion and dexterous manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for reducing torque ripples of QDD motors, which integrates an angle-based repetitive learning observer (ARLO) and a model predictive control-based field-oriented controller (MPC-FOC). The proposed method successfully improves the torque loop control bandwidth and surpasses conventional proportional-integral (PI) controllers owing to the integrated physical constraints inside MPC. Additionally, the ARLO portion is able to mitigate ripple caused by the inherent cogging torque in brushless motors and also the periodic friction torque from the planetary gearboxes in QDD systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both simulation of a single QDD motor and experiments on a two-degree-of-freedom robotic leg, where the performance improvement can be 72.7% in speed tracking and 58.5% in trajectory tracking. The proposed method shows great potential in facilitating smooth motion and precise force control in future robotic applications.
