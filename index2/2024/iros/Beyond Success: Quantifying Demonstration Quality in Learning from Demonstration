Learning from Demonstration (LfD) empowers novice users to teach robots daily life tasks without writing sophisticated code, thereby promoting the democratization of robotics. However, novice users often provide sub-optimal demonstrations, which can potentially impact the robot’s ability to efficiently learn and execute the tasks. Prior research has assessed the quality of demonstrations by evaluating the robot’s task performance; however, the approach remains insufficient to qualify individual demonstrations, leaving the reason for classifying demonstrations as high- or low-quality unknown. Therefore, this simulation-based study aims to quantify the quality of individual demonstration at each step by incorporating motion-related quality features such as manipulability and joint-space jerk. To assess the efficacy of these features, we initially evaluated the given demonstrations—taking into account each quality feature—to rank them from high- to low-quality. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of demonstration’s quality on task performance and the quality of task execution. In this pursuit, we trained a series of LfD models for distinct manipulation tasks: cube lifting and pick-and-place of soda can. Our results illustrate a strong correlation between ranked demonstrations and the quality of task execution. Interestingly, we observed that the quality features have a significant impact on task performance, particularly when the provided demonstrations exhibit diversity in terms of quality. Overall, this analysis enables quantifying the quality of individual demonstrations based on motion-related quality features, thus improving learning from demonstration.
