Inspired by the fascinating underwater locomotion of cephalopods such as octopuses, this research explores the possibility of using legged robots in underwater environments. Using a rimless wheel model, we investigated their navigation and adaptation capabilities in a dynamic fluid environment. Through sophisticated numerical simulations, we reproduce legged robot behaviours such as walking underwater and jumping over uneven seabed terrain. Our research aims to provide valuable insights for the development of versatile underwater robotic systems suitable for various applications in ocean exploration and surveying.
