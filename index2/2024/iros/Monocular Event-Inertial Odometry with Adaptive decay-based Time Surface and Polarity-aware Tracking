Event cameras have garnered considerable attention due to their advantages over traditional cameras in low power consumption, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. This paper proposes a monocular event-inertial odometry incorporating an adaptive decay kernel-based time surface with polarity-aware tracking. We utilize an adaptive decay-based Time Surface to extract texture information from asynchronous events, which adapts to the dynamic characteristics of the event stream and enhances the representation of environmental textures. However, polarity-weighted time surfaces suffer from event polarity shifts during changes in motion direction. To mitigate its adverse effects on feature tracking, we optimize the feature tracking by incorporating an additional polarityinverted time surface to enhance the robustness. Comparative analysis with visual-inertial and event-inertial odometry methods shows that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, with competitive results across various datasets.
