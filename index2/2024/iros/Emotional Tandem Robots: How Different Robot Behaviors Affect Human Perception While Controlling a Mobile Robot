In human-robot interaction (HRI), we study how humans interact with robots, but also the effects of robot behavior on human perception and well-being. Especially, the influence on humans by tandem robots with one human-controlled and one autonomous robot or even semi-autonomous multi-robot systems is not yet fully understood. Here, we focus on a leader-follower scenario and study how emotionally expressive motion patterns of a small, mobile follower robot affect the perception of a human operator controlling the leading robot. We examined three distinct emotional behaviors for the follower compared to a neutral condition: angry, happy, and sad. We asked participants to maneuver the leader robot along a set path while experiencing each follower behavior in a randomized order. We identified a significant shift in subjective attention toward the follower with emotionally expressive behaviors compared to the neutral condition. For example, the angry behavior significantly heightened participant stress levels and was considered the least preferred behavior. The happy behavior was the most preferred and associated with increased excitement by the participants. Integrating the proposed behaviors in robots can profoundly influence the human operatorâ€™s perceived attention, emotional state, and overall experience. These insights are valuable for future HRI tandem robot designs.
