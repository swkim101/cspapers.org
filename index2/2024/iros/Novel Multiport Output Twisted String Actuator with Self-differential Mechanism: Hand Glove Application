The differential mechanism can reduce the number of actuators and efficiently distribute force or power. We proposed a novel multiport output twisted string actuator (MO-TSA) with self-differential mechanism that employs a single actuator to achieve multiport outputs. The differential MO-TSA is adaptively controlled in accordance with the force differences at each output port, thus replacing the traditional differential gears and whiffletree mechanisms. Inspired by the hand muscles, we designed one hand glove using the MO-TSA, aiming to enhance the range of achievable grasp configurations. The hand glove is capable of performing various grasps with a single actuator, resulting in a lighter and simpler hand design and revolutionizing the field of twisted string actuators (TSAs) by offering a streamlined solution for achieving versatile actuation.
