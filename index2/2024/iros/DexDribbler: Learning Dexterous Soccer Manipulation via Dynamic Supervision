Learning dexterous locomotion policy for legged robots is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to handle diverse terrains and resemble intelligent behaviors. However, joint manipulation of moving objects and locomotion with legs, such as playing soccer, receive scant attention in the learning community, although it is natural for humans and smart animals. A key challenge to solve this multitask problem is to infer the objectives of locomotion from the states and targets of the manipulated objects. The implicit relation between the object states and robot locomotion can be hard to capture directly from the training experience. We propose adding a feedback control block to compute the necessary body- level movement accurately and using the outputs as dynamic joint-level locomotion supervision explicitly. We further utilize an improved ball dynamic model, an extended context-aided estimator, and a comprehensive ball observer to facilitate transferring policy learned in simulation to the real world. We observe that our learning scheme can not only make the policy network converge faster but also enable soccer robots to perform sophisticated maneuvers like sharp cuts and turns on flat surfaces, a capability that was lacking in previous methods.
