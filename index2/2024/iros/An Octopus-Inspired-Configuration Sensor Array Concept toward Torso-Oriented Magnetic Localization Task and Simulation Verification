In response to torso-oriented magnetic localization tasks that require the system to have interactivity and flexibility with guaranteed accuracy, a novel bio-inspired magnetic sensor array configuration is proposed in this paper. Precisely, the ideas of the natural characteristics of octopus flexible tentacles and the "wrap" morphology are integrated into the design of the magnetic localization system based on the sensor array method. It is worth mentioning that such a design enhances the interactivity and flexibility of the localization system compared to the general planar sensor array strategy. Apart from the concept introduction, the geometry analysis of the proposed configuration is presented based on the constant curvature model. Besides, the magnetic localization algorithm for the system is presented by constructing a magnetic tracking optimization function. Eventually, the proposed concept and developed algorithm are examined in the sensor-array-simulation environment to manifest their effectiveness and applicability. The experimental results indicate that the octopus-inspired-configuration sensor array achieves a mean accuracy at a centimeter-level in our cases, and has better accuracy with a mean value of Ä“ as 0.0178 m and ${\overline {SQR} _{ave{\text{ }}}}$ as 0.0883 for the center interest space compared to general planar configuration one. Moreover, the effect of the configuration error is analyzed. These results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed concept and hold significant practical significance in addressing the challenge associated with magnetic localization tasks toward the clinical application scenarios.
