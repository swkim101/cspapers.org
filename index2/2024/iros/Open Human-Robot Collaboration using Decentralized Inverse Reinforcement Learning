The growing interest in human-robot collaboration (HRC), where humans and robots cooperate towards shared goals, has seen significant advancements over the past decade. While previous research has addressed various challenges, several key issues remain unresolved. Many domains within HRC involve activities that do not necessarily require human presence throughout the entire task. Existing literature typically models HRC as a closed system, where all agents are present for the entire duration of the task. In contrast, an open model offers flexibility by allowing an agent to enter and exit the collaboration as needed, enabling them to concurrently manage other tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel multiagent framework called oDec-MDP, designed specifically to model open HRC scenarios where agents can join or leave tasks flexibly during execution. We generalize a recent multiagent inverse reinforcement learning method - Dec-AIRL to learn from open systems modeled using the oDec-MDP. Our method is validated through experiments conducted in both a simplified toy firefighting domain and a realistic dyadic human-robot collaborative assembly. Results show that our framework and learning method improves upon its closed system counterpart.
