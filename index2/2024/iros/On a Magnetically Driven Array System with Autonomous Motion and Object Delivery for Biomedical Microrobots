The application of microrobots in the biomedical field has attracted great interest, among which drug transportation is one of the application scenarios. Traditional studies used the global magnetic field to control single microrobot, therefore it is impossible to control multiple microrobots. To address this problem, this paper develops a local magnetic field generation system to realize the independent control of multiple microrobots. The proposed multi-microrobot motion system integrates perception, planning, and actuation, enabling autonomous multi-task drug delivery. In our system, we first develop a printed circuit board (PCB) array magnetic driven microrobot system based on a micro coil array, then the Yolov8 framework is employed for the target/environment recognition, accurately identifying microrobots and magnetic fluids, while the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm is used for path planning. We have conducted experiments on obstacle avoidance, droplet transport, and drug fusion. The results clearly demonstrate the significant potential of magnetic fielddriven microcoil array devices in transportation and drug fusion engineering.
