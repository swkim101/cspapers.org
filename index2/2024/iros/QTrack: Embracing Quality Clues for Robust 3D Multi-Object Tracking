3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has achieved tremendous achievement thanks to the rapid development of 3D object detection and 2D MOT. Recent advanced works generally employ a series of object attributes, e.g., position, size, velocity, and appearance, to provide the clues for the association in 3D MOT. However, these cues may not be reliable due to some visual noise, such as occlusion and blur, leading to tracking performance bottlenecks. To reveal the dilemma, we conduct extensive empirical analysis to expose the key bottleneck of each clue and how they correlate with each other. The analysis results motivate us to efficiently absorb the merits among all cues and adaptively produce an optimal tracking manner. Specifically, we present Location and Velocity Quality Learning, which efficiently guides the network to estimate the quality of predicted object attributes. Based on these quality estimations, we propose a quality-aware object association (QOA) strategy to leverage the quality score as an important reference factor for achieving robust association. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments indicate that the proposed strategy significantly boosts tracking performance by 2.2% AMOTA and our method outperforms all existing state-of-the-art works on nuScenes by a large margin. Moreover, QTrack achieves 51.1%, 54.8% and 56.6% AMOTA tracking performance on the nuScenes test sets with BEVDepth, VideoBEV, and StreamPETR models respectively, which significantly reduces the performance gap between the pure camera and LiDAR-based trackers.
