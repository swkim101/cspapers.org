This paper focuses on target-oriented grasping in occluded scenes, where the target object is specified by a binary mask and the goal is to grasp the target object with as few robotic manipulations as possible. Most existing methods rely on a push-grasping synergy to complete this task. To deliver a more powerful target-oriented grasping pipeline, we present MPGNet, a three-branch network for learning a synergy between moving, pushing, and grasping actions. We also propose a multi-stage training strategy to train the MPGNet which contains three policy networks corresponding to the three actions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated via both simulated and real-world experiments. Video of the real-world experiments is at https://youtu.be/S_QKZqkh0w8.
