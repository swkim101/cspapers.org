Reproductive medicine has recently witnessed significant advancements, particularly in vitro fertilization (IVF). One crucial aspect of IVF involves the extraction of cellular material and its analysis to maximize the chance of successful implantation. This work highlights the development and application of the automated system for Trophectoderm cell (TE) extraction and separation, addressing the need for precision, efficiency, and reduced manual intervention. The presented automated system is equipped with a computer vision algorithm, microliter pump, vacuum system, and micromanipulation tools to consistently and accurately biopsy TE cells. An experimental setup is developed to verify the behavior of the proposed method, in which a holding micropipette is connected to a vacuum system and holds the embryo stationary. Three steps are performed to complete the process and are controlled by a computer vision algorithm. The coordinates of the Zona Pellucida (ZP) perforation (perforated in a previous step) are used as a feedback signal to a simple proportional controller to control the biopsy pipette motion. The computer vision monitors the amount of TE cells aspirated inside the biopsy pipette and controls the microliter pump. The aspirated TE cells were separated away using a laser cutting system. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can relocate the biopsy pipette, TE cell extraction, and separation.
