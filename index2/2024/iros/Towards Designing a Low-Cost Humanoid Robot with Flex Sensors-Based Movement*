Humanoid robots have potential applications across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and customer service. This paper presents a project on designing and building a low-cost humanoid robot equipped with a flex sensor-based movement mechanism, highlighting its compatibility with Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers such as Arduino Uno and Nano. The project aims to investigate the robot's relevance and effectiveness within educational settings to showcase how a low-cost humanoid robot can potentially support the United Nations' fourth Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG4) by improving access to quality education through innovative robotics solutions. The robot was tested in a cycle two school (covering Grades 5 to 8 (ages 10 to 13)) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was integrated into math, science, and design technology classes to assess its functionality and efficiency. Surveys conducted among students and teachers showed a high level of acceptance towards the robot, with over 85% of respondents expressing positive attitudes about its presence and interaction in the classroom. However, teachers and students provided feedback concerning the robot's shape, capabilities, and movement mechanism. Teachers also appreciated the robot's alignment with the UN SDG4, stating its capability to support students learning and engagement. The authors highlighted the robot's potential to assist students with sensory challenges, such as hearing and vision impairments, and learning difficulties like dyslexia while emphasizing their commitment to enhancing its accessibility features for a more inclusive learning environment.
