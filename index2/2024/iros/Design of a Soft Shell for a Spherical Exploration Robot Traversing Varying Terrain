Exploration robots are typically equipped with either wheels or legs for mobility. However, these conventional designs inherently possess certain limitations, such as restricted ability to navigate through steep slopes, soft soil or muddy watery terrain. Despite the advancements in robotics technoloy, these challenges persist in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. To overcome these obstacles, we have proposed a novel solution in the form of a spherical robot with a soft shell. This paper provides an overview of the construction of this spherical robot and the design of its soft shell for adapting to varying terrain. Furthermore, we analyze and characterize its performance across various terrain types as the shell pressure is changed. By employing this approach, the paper establishes the suitability and efficiency of the spherical robot in traversing different terrain by adapting the shell pressure.
