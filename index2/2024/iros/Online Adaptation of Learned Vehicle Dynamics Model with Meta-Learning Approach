We represent a vehicle dynamics model for autonomous driving near the limits of handling via a multilayer neural network. Online adaptation is desirable in order to address unseen environments. However, the model needs to adapt to new environments without forgetting previously encountered ones. In this study, we apply Continual-MAML to overcome this difficulty. It enables the model to adapt to the previously encountered environments quickly and efficiently by starting updates from optimized initial parameters. We evaluate the impact of online model adaptation with respect to inference performance and impact on control performance of a model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller using the TRIKart platform. The neural network was pre-trained using driving data collected in our test environment, and experiments for online adaptation were executed on multiple different road conditions not contained in the training data. Empirical results show that the model using Continual-MAML outperforms the fixed model and the model using gradient descent in test set loss and online tracking performance of MPPI.
