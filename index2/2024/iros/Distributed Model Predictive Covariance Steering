This paper proposes Distributed Model Predictive Covariance Steering (DiMPCS) for multi-agent control under stochastic uncertainty. The scope of our approach is to blend covariance steering theory, distributed optimization and model predictive control (MPC) into a single framework that is safe, scalable and decentralized. Initially, we pose a problem formulation that uses the Wasserstein distance to steer the state distributions of a multi-agent system to desired targets, and probabilistic constraints to ensure safety. We then transform this problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one by utilizing a disturbance feedback policy parametrization for covariance steering and a tractable approximation of the safety constraints. To solve the latter problem, we derive a decentralized consensus-based algorithm using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. This method is then extended to a receding horizon form, which yields the proposed DiMPCS algorithm. Simulation experiments on a variety of multi-robot tasks with up to hundreds of robots demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMPCS. The superior scalability and performance of the proposed method is also highlighted through a comparison against related stochastic MPC approaches. Finally, hardware results on a multi-robot platform also verify the applicability of DiMPCS on real systems.
