We consider a new type of inverse combinatorial optimization, Inverse Submodular Maximization (ISM), for human-in-the-loop multi-robot coordination. Forward combinatorial optimization - solving a combinatorial problem given the reward (cost)-related parameters - is widely used in multi-robot coordination. In the standard pipeline, the reward (cost)-related parameters are designed offline by domain experts. These parameters are utilized for coordinating robots online. What if non-expert human supervisors desire to change these parameters during task execution to adapt to some new requirements? We are interested in the case where human supervisors can suggest what actions to take, and the robots need to change these internal parameters accordingly. We study such problems from the perspective of inverse combinatorial optimization, i.e., the process of finding parameters given solutions to the problem. Specifically, we propose a new formulation for ISM, in which we aim to find a new set of parameters that minimally deviate from the current parameters while causing a greedy algorithm to output actions which are the same as those desired by the human supervisors. We show that such problems can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) which is intractable for existing solvers when the problem size is large. We propose a new Branch & Bound algorithm to solve such problems. In numerical simulations, we demonstrate how to use ISM in multi-robot multi-objective coverage control, and we show that the proposed algorithm provides significant advantages in running time and peak memory usage compared to directly using an existing solver.
