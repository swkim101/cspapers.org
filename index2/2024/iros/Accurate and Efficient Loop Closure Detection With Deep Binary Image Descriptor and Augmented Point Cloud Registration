Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is an essential component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), helping to correct drift errors, facilitate map merging, or both by identifying previously observed scenes. Despite its importance, traditional LCD algorithms based on single sensor such as camera or LiDAR exhibit degraded performance in challenging scenarios due to their inherent limitations. To address this issue, we propose a novel LCD method based on camera-LiDAR fusion, exploiting the rich textural information from cameras and the accurate geometric data from LiDAR to ensure robustness and speed in challenging environments. Specifically, we first employ deep hashing learning to encode deep image features into binary image descriptors for extremely fast loop candidate (LC) retrieval. Then, LiDAR points are augmented with image color for accurate geometric verification. Finally, we incorporate a spatial-temporal consistency check that mandates an LC to have consistently matched neighbors to be accepted as true. Our method is extensively verified and compared with the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets encompassing both indoor and outdoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains the best performance, increasing the maximum recall rate at 100% precision by a significant margin of 20% while operating in real-time at an average speed of 30 fps.
