Teleoperation is a crucial technology enabling human operators to control robots remotely to perform tasks in hazardous and difficult-to-access environments. Tasks in such environments often involve complex physical interactions with tools and objects of various softness. To this end, teleimpedance enables the operators to adjust the robot impedance in real-time to simplify such interactions. While the existing teleimpedance approaches provide several interfaces to command the robot impedance, there are no interfaces to visualize both the commanded impedance and that of the objects to be interacted with. This paper presents a novel interface to provide visual feedback on the impedance of remote robots and objects. To do so, we use virtual stiffness ellipsoids and different modes that display the individual impedance of the robot and objects as well as combined post-contact impedance. The key advantage of visual feedback on the impedance compared to force feedback is that the operator can see the interaction characteristics before the contact occurs. This enables the operator to act proactively before contact rather than just reactively after the contact. This paper also proposes a new intuitive way to command the robot impedance using mixed reality, interacting with these ellipsoids and modifying them as needed. To demonstrate the key functionalities of the developed interface, we performed proof-of-concept experiments on teleoperated tasks.
