An integrated 3DOF trajectory tracking control algorithm with lateral drift correction for under-actuated Marine Surface Vehicles is presented using the Multi-Nested Loop Trajectory Linearization Control architecture. The sideslip angle is used as a virtual control effector for generating a lateral hydrodynamic force to correct the lateral drift due to a skid-turn, which is intrinsic to MSVs. The nominal sideslip angle is determined based on the kinematics and dynamics of the MSV along a nominal trajectory. Simulation results for a sub-scale vessel with significant vessel parameter perturbations are presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
