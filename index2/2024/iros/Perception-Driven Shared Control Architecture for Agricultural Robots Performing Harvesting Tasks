This paper introduces a shared control framework designed specifically for agricultural mobile manipulators engaged in harvesting operations. The shared control strategy allows for achieving such operations by dynamically exchanging the control between the robotic system and a human operator depending on the uncertainty in the environment perception. For this purpose, the robotâ€™s behavior is dynamically adapted to switch between two control modes with a different level of autonomy of the robot. The level of autonomy is encoded in two different admittance behaviors which are included in a first-order Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) control framework, that allows the robot to simultaneously address other control objectives at the same time. Experimental results with a dual-arm mobile robot, developed as part of the EU-funded CANOPIES project, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real conditions.
