In the context of unstructured and unknown environment, the autonomous navigation still faces many challenges, such as assessing rough terrain and deciding how to safely navigate complex terrain. In this work, we propose a robust and practical off-road navigation framework that has been successfully deployed on a vibroseis truck for land exploration. First, in degraded wild scenes, a tightly coupled lidar-GNSS-inertial fusion odometry and mapping framework is adopted to construct a local point cloud map around the vehicle in real-time and provide precise localization. Then, based on amplitude-frequency characteristic analysis and point cloud PCA, a multi-layer terrain assessment map containing terrain roughness, obstacles and slope information is obtained. Finally, combining Gaussian distribution based adaptive sampler and Bayesian sequentially updated proposal distribution, a local graph is efficiently built to obtain multiple path solutions under constrained conditions. Both simulations and field experiments show that the proposed navigation framework can decide how to travel on a flat road even in harsh terrain conditions, naturally suppressing frequent attitude angle changes and preventing vehicle accidents.
