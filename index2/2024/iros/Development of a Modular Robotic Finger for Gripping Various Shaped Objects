With the introduction of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the spread of smart factories, the demand for small-quantity batch production systems is rapidly increasing. As a result, the implementation of robotic gripper systems that can handle various objects is required. Until now, grippers have to be replaced or newly developed each time depending on the object to be gripped. In addition, conventional gripper systems require a picking system based on a sophisticated gripping plan to handle products with complex shapes. This requires the integration of vision and various sensor systems, which in turn increases the cost of the system and makes it challenging to apply it to real industrial sites. To solve this problem, we developed a robotic finger by applying the paired crossed flexure hinge (p-CFH) developed in our previous research. The p-CFH-based robotic finger is driven by an underactuated wire-driven method that can be controlled by a single motor and has compliance and shape adaptive features. It also has the advantage of being modularized, easy to install and replace, and easy to maintain. The proposed finger module has a tip force of about 0.58 kg and its impact absorption capacity has been experimentally verified. In addition, gripping experiments were conducted on a total of four objects with different characteristics, and successful gripping was confirmed.
