In this work, a methodology to find the best view of a grape stem and approach angle in order to crop it is proposed. The control scheme is based only on a classified point cloud obtained by the in-hand camera attached to the robotâ€™s end effector without continuous stem tracking. It is shown that the proposed controller finds and reaches the optimal view point and subsequently the stem fast and efficiently, accelerating the overall harvesting procedure. The proposed control scheme is evaluated through experiments in the lab with a UR5e robot with an in-hand RealSense camera on a mock-up vine.
