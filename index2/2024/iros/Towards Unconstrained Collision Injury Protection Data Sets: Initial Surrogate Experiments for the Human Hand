Safety for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is a major concern for all application domains. While current standardization for industrial robot applications provide safety constraints that address the onset of pain in blunt impacts, these impact thresholds are difficult to use on edged or pointed impactors. The most severe injuries occur in constrained contact scenarios, where crushing is possible. Nevertheless, situations potentially resulting in constrained contact only occur in certain areas of a workspace and design or organisational approaches can be used to avoid them. What remains are risks to the human physical integrity caused by unconstrained accidental contacts, which are difficult to avoid while maintaining robot motion efficiency. Nevertheless, the probability and severity of injuries occurring with edged or pointed impacting objects in unconstrained collisions is hardly researched. In this paper, we propose an experimental setup and procedure using two pendulums modeling human hands and arms and robots to understand the injury potential of unconstrained collisions of human hands with edged objects. Pig feet are used as ex vivo surrogate samples - as these closely resemble the physiological characteristics of human hands - to create an initial injury database on the severity of injuries caused by unconstrained edged or pointed impacts. For the effective mass range of typical lightweight robots, the data obtained show low probabilities of injuries such as skin cuts or bone/tendon injuries in unconstrained collisions when the velocity is reduced to < 0.5 m/s. Additionally, distinct differences between injury probability of the finger substitutes and the back of the hand substitutes are observed. The proposed experimental setups and procedures should be complemented by sufficient human modeling, e.g. the effective masses of human body parts, and will eventually lead to a complete understanding of the biomechanical injury potential in pHRI.
