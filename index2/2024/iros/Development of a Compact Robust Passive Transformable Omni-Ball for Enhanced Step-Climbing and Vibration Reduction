This paper introduces the Passive Transformable Omni-Ball (PTOB), an advanced omnidirectional wheel engineered to enhance step-climbing performance, incorporate built-in actuators, diminish vibrations, and fortify structural integrity. By modifying the omni-ball’s structure from two to three segments, we have achieved improved in-wheel actuation and a reduction in vibrational feedback. Additionally, we have implemented a sliding mechanism in the follower wheels to boost the wheel’s step-climbing abilities. A prototype with a 127 mm diameter PTOB was constructed, which confirmed its functionality for omnidirectional movement and internal actuation. Compared to a traditional omni-wheel, the PTOB demonstrated a comparable level of vibration while offering superior capabilities. Extensive testing in varied settings showed that the PTOB can adeptly handle step obstacles up to 45 mm, equivalent to 35 % of the wheel’s diameter, in both the forward and lateral directions. The PTOB showcased robust construction and proved to be versatile in navigating through environments with diverse obstacles.
