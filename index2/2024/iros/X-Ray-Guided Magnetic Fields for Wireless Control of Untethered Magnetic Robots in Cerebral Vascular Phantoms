This paper explores the application of X-ray-guided magnetic fields for the wireless control of untethered magnetic robots (UMRs) within cerebral vascular phantoms. With a focus on addressing challenges associated with strokes and brain aneurysms, the study aims to enhance neurosurgical procedures by improving precision and maneuverability. Experimental findings showcase the feasibility and effectiveness of this innovative approach in navigating UMRs, characterized by a screw-shaped body and a ferromagnetic core, through complex vascular structures. Cone-beam computed tomography is employed to determine the tomography and provide various reference trajectories for the UMR inside the cerebral vascular phantom. Our motion control experiments show that the X-ray-guided magnetic fields enable the UMR to move along any intended path with an average success rate of 89%, allowing the UMR to move between the left and right common carotid artery to the left and right internal and external carotid artery.
