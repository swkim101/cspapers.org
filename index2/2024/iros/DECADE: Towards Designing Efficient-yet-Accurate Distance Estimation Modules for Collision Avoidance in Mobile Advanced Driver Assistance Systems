The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices provides a unique opportunity to make Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) accessible to everyone in the form of an application empowered by low-cost Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) models to enhance road safety. For the critical feature of Collision Avoidance in Mobile ADAS, lightweight Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for object detection exist, but conventional pixel-wise depth/distance estimation DNNs are vastly more computationally expensive making them unsuitable for a real-time application on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a distance estimation model, DECADE, that processes each detector output instead of constructing pixel-wise depth/disparity maps. In it, we propose a pose estimation DNN to estimate allocentric orientation of detections to supplement the distance estimation DNN in its prediction of distance using bounding box features. We demonstrate that these modules can be attached to any detector to extend object detection with fast distance estimation. Evaluation of the proposed modules with attachment to and fine-tuning on the outputs of the YOLO object detector on the KITTI 3D Object Detection dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1.38 meters in Mean Absolute Error and 7.3% in Mean Relative Error in the distance range of 0-150 meters. Our extensive evaluation scheme not only evaluates class-wise performance, but also evaluates range-wise accuracy especially in the critical range of 0-70m.
