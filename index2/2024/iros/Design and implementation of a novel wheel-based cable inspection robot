Regular maintenance and inspection of cables are essential for cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges, as cables serve as the core components. In order to enable automated detection of cables, this paper proposes a novel wheeled cable inspection robot. The robot utilizes a bilateral wheel structure and is composed of four independent suspension mechanisms. By collaborating with a lifting mechanism, the robot achieves functions such as adhesion, climbing, and obstacle overcoming. The robot is powered by a lithium polymer battery and operated via wireless control by ground personnel. This paper provides a detailed exposition on the structure design and control system of robots, and conducts a mechanical analysis of the suspension mechanism of robots. The maximum obstacle-negotiation height of the robot is calculated, and a mechanical model for cable climbing is established. During prototype testing, the robot demonstrated a mass of 6.7kg, a maximum payload capacity of 6kg, a maximum obstacle height of 10mm, and a fastest climbing speed of 14m/min. These specifications meet the requirements of practical inspections.
