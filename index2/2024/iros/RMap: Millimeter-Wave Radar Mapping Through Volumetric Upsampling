Millimeter Wave Radar is being adopted as a viable alternative to lidar and radar in adverse visually degraded conditions, such as in the presence of fog and dust. However, this sensor modality suffers from severe sparsity and noise under nominal conditions, which makes it difficult to use in precise applications such as mapping. This work presents a novel solution to generate accurate 3D maps from sparse radar point clouds. RMap uses a generative transformer architecture which upsamples, denoises, and fills the incomplete radar maps to resemble lidar maps. We test this method on the ColoRadar dataset to demonstrate its efficacy.
