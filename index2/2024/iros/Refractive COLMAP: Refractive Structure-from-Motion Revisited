In this paper, we present a complete refractive Structure-from-Motion (RSfM) framework for underwater 3D reconstruction using refractive camera setups (for both, flat-and dome-port underwater housings). Despite notable achievements in refractive multi-view geometry over the past decade, a robust, complete and publicly available solution for such tasks is not available at present, and often practical applications have to resort to approximating refraction effects by the intrinsic (distortion) parameters of a pinhole camera model. To fill this gap, we have integrated refraction considerations throughout the entire SfM process within the state-of-the-art, open-source SfM framework COLMAP. Numerical simulations and reconstruction results on synthetically generated but photo-realistic images with ground truth validate that enabling refraction does not compromise accuracy or robustness as compared to in-air reconstructions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for large-scale refractive scenarios using a dataset consisting of nearly 6000 images. The implementation is released as open-source at: https://cau-git.rz.uni-kiel.de/inf-ag-koeser/colmap_underwater.
