Data augmentation methods to enhance perception performance in adverse weather have recently attracted considerable attention. Most of the LiDAR data augmentation methods post-process the existing dataset by physics-based models or machine-learning methods. However, due to the limited environmental annotations and the fixed vehicle trajectories in existing datasets, it is challenging to edit the scene and expand the diversity of traffic flow and scenario. To this end, we propose a simulator-based physical modeling approach to augment LiDAR data in rainy weather, enhancing the performance of the perception model. We complete the modeling task of the rainy weather effect in the CARLA simulator and establish a data collection pipeline for LiDAR. Furthermore, we pay special attention to the spray generated by vehicles in rainy weather and simulate this phenomenon through the Spray Emitter method we developed. In addition, considering the influence of different weather conditions on point cloud intensity, we develop a prediction network to forecast the intensity of the LiDAR echo. This enables us to complete the rainy weather simulation of 4D point cloud data. In the experiment, we observe that the model augmented by our synthetic dataset improves the performance for 3D object detection in rainy weather. Both code and dataset are available at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/PCSim#rainypcsim.
