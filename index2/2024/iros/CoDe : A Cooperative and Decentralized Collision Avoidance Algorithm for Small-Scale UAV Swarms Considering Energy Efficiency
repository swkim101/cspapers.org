This paper introduces a cooperative and decentralized collision avoidance algorithm (CoDe) for small-scale UAV swarms consisting of up to three UAVs. CoDe improves energy efficiency of UAVs by achieving effective cooperation among UAVs. Moreover, CoDe is specifically tailored for UAV’s operations by addressing the challenges faced by existing schemes, such as ineffectiveness in selecting actions from continuous action spaces and high computational complexity. CoDe is based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), and finds cooperative policies by incorporating a novel credit assignment scheme. The novel credit assignment scheme estimates the contribution of an individual by subtracting a baseline from the joint action value for the swarm. The credit assignment scheme in CoDe outperforms other benchmarks as the baseline takes into account not only the importance of a UAV’s action but also the interrelation between UAVs. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted against existing MARL-based and conventional heuristic-based algorithms to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.
