Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive results in solving complex robotic tasks such as quadruped locomotion. Yet, current solvers fail to produce efficient policies respecting hard constraints. In this work, we advocate for integrating constraints into robot learning and present Constraints as Terminations (CaT), a novel constrained RL algorithm. Departing from classical constrained RL formulations, we reformulate constraints through stochastic terminations during policy learning: any violation of a constraint triggers a probability of terminating potential future rewards the RL agent could attain. We propose an algorithmic approach to this formulation, by minimally modifying widely used off-the-shelf RL algorithms in robot learning (such as Proximal Policy Optimization). Our approach leads to excellent constraint adherence without introducing undue complexity and computational overhead, thus mitigating barriers to broader adoption. Through empirical evaluation on the real quadruped robot Solo crossing challenging obstacles, we demonstrate that CaT provides a compelling solution for incorporating constraints into RL frameworks.
