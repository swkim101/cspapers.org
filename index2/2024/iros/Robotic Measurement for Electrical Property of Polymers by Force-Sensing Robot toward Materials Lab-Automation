With the background of research on materials laboratory automation, this study aims to construct an automation system for measuring dielectric property, which is an electrical property of materials. The automation system is composed of the combination of a manipulation by a force-sensing robot and a control system for the measurement instrument. As challenges for the automation system, we worked on stabilizing a polymer film placement during insertion into the measurement instrument, implementing a communication control system between different platforms, and constructing a polymer film transfer environment. In the measurement experiment using the automation system, it was confirmed that the dielectric properties could be measured as well as that of a human.
