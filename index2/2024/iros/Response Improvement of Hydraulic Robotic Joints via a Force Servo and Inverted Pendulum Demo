In this paper, a force servo for hydraulic robot joints is designed and applied to an inverted pendulum demo. First, the nonlinear nominal model of the hydraulic cylinder is reviewed, and the nominal integrator is introduced. Second, through a partial fusion of our modeling and control techniques, a force servo is designed based on a modification of the nominal integrator as an intermediate stage. Finally, against the non-short hydraulic pipes (1.9 m), the response is improved by the designed force servo in the presence of rotational motion effects.
