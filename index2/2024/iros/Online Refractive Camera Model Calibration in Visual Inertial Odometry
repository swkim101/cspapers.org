This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of an unknown media. This enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific camera calibration.
