In this article, we present a reactive multi-agent coordination architecture for the management of material flows between production/pickup stages and delivery/drop-off stages, in scenarios such as underground mines and automated factory floors. The pickup and delivery stages are modelled as variable task queues, with no a priori information about the inflow into the production queues. The proposed solution coordinates the movement of a group of mobile agents operating between the two stages in a reactive and scalable manner, so that the material is transported from multiple production queues to multiple delivery queues in a balanced/equalized manner. In such a scenario, centralized planners suffer from low reactivity and poor scaling, as the number of agents and number of queues increases. To overcome this problem, we propose a decentralized approach comprising of two separate auction-based task distribution systems for the production and delivery stages, along with behavior-tree based management of agent autonomy and task bidding. Each auction system tracks the length of production/delivery queues and solves the optimal task assignment, based on the bids submitted by the agents. The agents participate in one of the two auction systems at any given time, based on the status of the behavior tree executing the two-stage tasks. We analytically show that the proposed decentralized auctioning approach along with agent autonomy and bidding managed by behavior trees, offers better scalability and reactiveness compared to the centralized approach. The proposed methodology is experimentally validated in a lab environment, in three illustrative material flow management scenarios, using TurtleBot3 robots as agents.
