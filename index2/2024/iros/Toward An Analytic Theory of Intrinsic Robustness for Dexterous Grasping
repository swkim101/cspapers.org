Conventional approaches to grasp planning re- quire perfect knowledge of an object’s pose and geometry. Uncertainties in these quantities induce uncertainties in the quality of planned grasps, which can lead to failure. Classically, grasp robustness refers to the ability to resist external disturbances after grasping an object. In contrast, this work studies robustness to intrinsic sources of uncertainty like object pose or geometry affecting grasp planning before execution. To do so, we develop a novel analytic theory of grasping that reasons about this intrinsic robustness by characterizing the effect of friction cone uncertainty on a grasp’s force closure status. We apply this result in two ways. First, we analyze the theoretical guarantees on intrinsic robustness of two grasp metrics in the literature, the classical Ferrari-Canny metric and more recent min-weight metric. We validate these results with hardware trials that compare grasps synthesized with and without robustness guarantees, showing a clear improvement in success rates. Second, we use our theory to develop a novel analytic notion of probabilistic force closure, which we show can generate unique, uncertainty-aware grasps in simulation.
