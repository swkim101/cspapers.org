Variational Inference (VI) has gained popularity as a flexible approximate inference scheme for computing posterior distributions in Bayesian models. Original VI methods use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to construct variational objectives. However, KL divergence has zero-forcing behavior and is completely agnostic to the metric of the underlying data distribution, resulting in bad approximations. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new variational objective by using Optimal Transport (OT) distance, which is a metric-aware divergence, to measure the difference between approximate posteriors and priors. The superior performance of OT distance enables us to learn more accurate approximations. We further enhance the objective by gradually including the OT term using a hyperparameter Î» for over-parameterized models. We develop a Variational inference method with OT (VOT) which presents a gradient-based black-box framework for solving Bayesian models, even when the density function of approximate distribution is not available. We provide the consistency analysis of approximate posteriors and demonstrate the practical effectiveness on Bayesian neural networks and variational autoencoders.
