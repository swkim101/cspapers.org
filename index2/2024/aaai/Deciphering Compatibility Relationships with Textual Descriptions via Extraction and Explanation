Understanding and accurately explaining compatibility relationships between fashion items is a challenging problem in the burgeoning domain of AI-driven outfit recommendations. Present models, while making strides in this area, still occasionally fall short, offering explanations that can be elementary and repetitive. This work aims to address these shortcomings by introducing the Pair Fashion Explanation (PFE) dataset, a unique resource that has been curated to illuminate these compatibility relationships. Furthermore, we propose an innovative two stage pipeline model that leverages this dataset. This fine-tuning allows the model to generate explanations that convey the compatibility relationships between items. Our experiments showcase the model's potential in crafting descriptions that are knowledgeable, aligned with ground-truth matching correlations, and that produce understandable and informative descriptions, as assessed by both automatic metrics and human evaluation.
