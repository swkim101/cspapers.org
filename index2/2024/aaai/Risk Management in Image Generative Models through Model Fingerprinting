My doctoral research delves into the realm of generative model fingerprinting, aiming to assign responsibility for the generated images. I introduce frameworks that modify generative models to incorporate each user's distinct digital fingerprint. This ensures that every piece of generated content carries a traceable identifier linked to its originator. The primary objective of my research is to achieve optimal attribution accuracy while ensuring minimal compromise on the model's performance. Additionally, I present strategies designed to enhance robustness against common adversarial manipulations, which malicious users might employ to obscure or remove these fingerprints.
