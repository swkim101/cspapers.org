Given a table with a minimal set of input columns that functionally determines an output column, we introduce a method that tries to gradually decompose the corresponding minimal functional dependency (mfd) to acquire a formula expressing the output column in terms of the input columns. A first key element of the method is to create sub-problems that are easier to solve than the original formula acquisition problem, either because it learns formulae with fewer inputs parameters, or as it focuses on formulae of a particular class, such as Boolean formulae; as a result, the acquired formulae can mix different learning biases such as polynomials, conditionals or Boolean expressions. A second key feature of the method is that it can be applied recursively to find formulae that combine polynomial, conditional or Boolean sub-terms in a nested manner. The method was tested on data for eight families of combinatorial objects; new conjectures were found that were previously unattainable. The method often creates conjectures that combine several formulae into one with a limited number of automatically found Boolean terms.
