The increasingly decentralized and private nature of data in our digital society has motivated the development of personalized, collaborative intelligent systems that enable knowledge aggregation across multiple data owners while accommodating for their data privacy and system constraints. However, collaborative learning has only been investigated in simple and limited settings: isolated task scenarios where learning begins from scratch and does not build on prior expertise; learned model is represented in task-specific forms which are not generalizable to unseen, emerging scenarios; and more often, a universal model representation is assumed across collaborators, ignoring their local compute constraints or input representations. This restricts its practicality in continual learning scenarios with limited task data, which demand continuous adaptation and knowledge transfer across different information silos, tasks, and learning models, as well as the utilization of prior solution expertises. To overcome these limitations, my research has been focused on developing effective and scalable resource-aware collaborative learning frameworks across heterogeneous systems.
