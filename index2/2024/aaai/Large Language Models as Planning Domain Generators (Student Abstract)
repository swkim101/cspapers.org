The creation of planning models, and in particular domain
models, is among the last bastions of tasks that require exten-
sive manual labor in AI planning; it is desirable to simplify
this process for the sake of making planning more accessi-
ble. To this end, we investigate whether large language mod-
els (LLMs) can be used to generate planning domain models
from textual descriptions. We propose a novel task for this
as well as a means of automated evaluation for generated do-
mains by comparing the sets of plans for domain instances.
Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of 7 large language
models, including coding and chat models across 9 different
planning domains. Our results show that LLMs, particularly
larger ones, exhibit some level of proficiency in generating
correct planning domains from natural language descriptions
