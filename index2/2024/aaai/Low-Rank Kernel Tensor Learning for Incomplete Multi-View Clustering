Incomplete Multiple Kernel Clustering algorithms, which aim to learn a common latent representation from pre-constructed incomplete multiple kernels from the original data, followed by k-means for clustering. They have attracted intensive attention due to their high computational efficiency. However, our observation reveals that the imputation of these approaches for each kernel ignores the influence of other incomplete kernels. In light of this, we present a novel method called Low-Rank Kernel Tensor Learning for Incomplete Multiple Views Clustering (LRKT-IMVC) to address the above issue. Specifically, LRKT-IMVC first introduces the concept of kernel tensor to explore the inter-view correlations, and then the low-rank kernel tensor constraint is used to further capture the consistency information to impute missing kernel elements, thereby improving the quality of clustering. Moreover, we carefully design an alternative optimization method with promising convergence to solve the resulting optimization problem. The proposed method is compared with recent advances in experiments with different missing ratios on seven well-known datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed interpolation method.
