Global surface water detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery can directly serve major applications such as refined flood mapping and water resource assessment. Although achievements have been made in detecting surface water in small-size satellite images corresponding to local geographic scales, datasets and methods suitable for mapping and analyzing global surface water have yet to be explored. To encourage the development of this task and facilitate the implementation of relevant applications, we propose the GLH-water dataset that consists of 250 satellite images and 40.96 billion pixels labeled surface water annotations that are distributed globally and contain water bodies exhibiting a wide variety of types (e.g. , rivers, lakes, and ponds in forests, irrigated fields, bare areas, and urban areas). Each image is of the size 12,800 Ã— 12,800 pixels at 0.3 meter spatial resolution. To build a benchmark for GLH-water, we perform extensive experiments employing representative surface water detection models, popular semantic segmentation models, and ultra-high resolution segmentation models. Furthermore, we also design a strong baseline with the novel pyramid consistency loss (PCL) to initially explore this challenge, increasing IoU by 2.4% over the next best baseline. Finally, we implement the cross-dataset generalization and pilot area application experiments, and the superior performance illustrates the strong generalization and practical application value of GLH-water dataset.
