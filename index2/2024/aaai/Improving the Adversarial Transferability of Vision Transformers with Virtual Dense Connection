With the great achievement of vision transformers (ViTs), transformer-based approaches have become the new paradigm for solving various computer vision tasks. However, recent research shows that similar to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To explore the shared deficiency of models with different structures, researchers begin to analyze the cross-structure adversarial transferability, which is still under-explored. Therefore, in this work, we focus on the ViT attacks to improve the cross-structure transferability between the transformer-based and convolution-based models. Previous studies fail to thoroughly investigate the influence of the components inside the ViT models on adversarial transferability, leading to inferior performance. To overcome the drawback, we launch a motivating study by linearly down-scaling the gradients of components inside the ViT models to analyze their influence on adversarial transferability. Based on the motivating study, we find that the gradient of the skip connection most influences transferability and believe that back-propagating gradients from deeper blocks can enhance transferability. Therefore, we propose the Virtual Dense Connection method (VDC). Specifically, without changing the forward pass, we first recompose the original network to add virtual dense connections. Then we back-propagate gradients of deeper Attention maps and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) blocks via virtual dense connections when generating adversarial samples. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art baselines, with an 8.2% improvement in transferability between ViT models and a 7.2% improvement in cross-structure transferability from ViTs to CNNs.
