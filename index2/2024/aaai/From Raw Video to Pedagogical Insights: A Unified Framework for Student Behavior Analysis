Understanding student behavior in educational settings is critical in improving both the quality of pedagogy and the level of student engagement. While various AI-based models exist for classroom analysis, they tend to specialize in limited tasks and lack generalizability across diverse educational environments. Additionally, these models often fall short in ensuring student privacy and in providing actionable insights accessible to educators. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified, end-to-end framework by leveraging temporal action detection techniques and advanced large language models for a more nuanced student behavior analysis. Our proposed framework provides an end-to-end pipeline that starts with raw classroom video footage and culminates in the autonomous generation of pedagogical reports. It offers a comprehensive and scalable solution for student behavior analysis. Experimental validation confirms the capability of our framework to accurately identify student behaviors and to produce pedagogically meaningful insights, thereby setting the stage for future AI-assisted educational assessments.
