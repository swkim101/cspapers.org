Defect detection is a pivotal aspect ensuring product quality and production efficiency in industrial manufacturing. Existing studies on defect detection predominantly focus on locating defects through bounding boxes and classifying defect types. However, their methods can only provide limited information and fail to meet the requirements for further processing after detecting defects. To this end, we propose a novel task called defect detection report generation, which aims to provide more comprehensive and informative insights into detected defects in the form of text reports. For this task, we propose some new datasets, which contain 16 different materials and each defect contains a detailed report of human constructs. In addition, we propose a knowledge-aware report generation model as a baseline for future research, which aims to incorporate additional knowledge to generate detailed analysis and subsequent processing related to defect in images. By constructing defect report datasets and proposing corresponding baselines, we chart new directions for future research and practical applications of this task.
