Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) aims at recognizing samples in novel classes from unseen domains that are vastly different from training classes, with few labeled samples. However, the large domain gap between training and novel classes makes previous FSL methods perform poorly. To address this issue, we propose MetaPrompt, a Task-adaptive Prompted Transformer model for CD-FSL, by jointly exploiting prompt learning and the parameter generation framework. The proposed MetaPrompt enjoys several merits. First, a task-conditioned prompt generator is established upon attention mechanisms. It can flexibly produce a task-adaptive prompt with arbitrary length for unseen tasks, by selectively gathering task characteristics from the contextualized support embeddings. Second, the task-adaptive prompt is attached to Vision Transformer to facilitate fast task adaptation, steering the task-agnostic representation to incorporate task knowledge. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to exploit a prompt-based parameter generation mechanism for CD-FSL. Extensive experimental results on the Meta-Dataset benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior results against state-of-the-art methods.
