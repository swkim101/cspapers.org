Translating entity names, especially when a literal translation is not correct, poses a significant challenge. Although Machine Translation (MT) systems have achieved impressive results, they still struggle to translate cultural nuances and language-specific context. In this work, we show that the integration of multilingual knowledge graphs into MT systems can address this problem and bring two significant benefits: i) improving the translation of utterances that contain entities by leveraging their human-curated aliases from a multilingual knowledge graph, and, ii) increasing the interpretability of the translation process by providing the user with information from the knowledge graph.
