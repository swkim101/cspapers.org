This paper addresses the problem of maintaining safety during training in Reinforcement Learning (RL), such that the safety constraint violations are bounded at any point during learning. As enforcing safety during training might severely limit the agentâ€™s exploration, we propose here a new architecture that handles the trade-off between efficient progress and safety during exploration. As the exploration progresses, we update via Bayesian inference Dirichlet-Categorical models of the transition probabilities of the Markov decision process that describes the environment dynamics. We then propose a way to approximate moments of belief about the risk associated to the action selection policy. We demonstrate that this approach can be easily interleaved with RL and we present experimental results to showcase the performance of the overall architecture.
