Accurately predicting pedestrian movements in complex environments is challenging due to social interactions, scene constraints, and pedestrians' multimodal behaviors. Sequential models like long short-term memory fail to effectively integrate scene features to make predicted trajectories comply with scene constraints due to disparate feature modalities of scene and trajectory. Though existing convolution neural network (CNN) models can extract scene features, they are ineffective in mapping these features into scene constraints for pedestrians and struggle to model pedestrian interactions due to the loss of target pedestrian information. To address these issues, we propose a unified environmental network based on CNN for pedestrian trajectory prediction. We introduce a polar-based method to reflect the distance and direction relationship between any position in the environment and the target pedestrian. This enables us to simultaneously model scene constraints and pedestrian social interactions in the form of feature maps. Additionally, we capture essential local features in the feature map, characterizing potential multimodal movements of pedestrians at each time step to prevent redundant predicted trajectories. We verify the performance of our proposed model on four trajectory prediction datasets, encompassing both short-term and long-term predictions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods.
