Sign language is a visual and gestural communication system used by deaf and hearing-impaired people. Despite numerous deep learning methods proposed for automatic interpretation, a gap persists in developing applications that effectively utilize these models for assisting sign language studies and inclusion. We introduce LERMO (https://lermo.app/), a web game merging machine learning and gamification to enhance sign language fingerspelling. Inspired by Wordleâ„¢, LERMO offers an interactive word-guessing game where users can play using a video camera. We create a new dataset of labeled landmark fingerspelling and design our model to ensure optimal speed and efficiency to run on a web browser. We survey approximately 40 users, which find LERMO user-friendly and innovative. From those, 95% believe LERMO could be used to enhance fingerspelling skills.
