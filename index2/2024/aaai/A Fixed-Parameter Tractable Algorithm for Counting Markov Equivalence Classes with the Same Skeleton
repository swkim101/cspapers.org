Causal DAGs (also known as Bayesian networks) are a popular tool for encoding
conditional dependencies between random variables. In a causal DAG, the random
variables are modeled as vertices in the DAG, and it is stipulated that every
random variable is independent of its non-descendants conditioned on its parents. It
is possible, however, for two different causal DAGs on the same set of random
variables to encode exactly the same set of conditional dependencies. Such
causal DAGs are said to be Markov equivalent, and equivalence classes of
Markov equivalent DAGs are known as Markov Equivalent Classes (MECs).
Beautiful combinatorial characterizations of MECs have been developed in the
past few decades, and it is known, in particular, that all DAGs in the same MEC
must have the same skeleton (underlying undirected graph) and v-structures (induced subgraph of the form a->b
