Document layout analysis is a crucial step for intelligent document understanding. However, many existing methods primarily focus on the visual aspects and overlook the textual features of documents. Although document pre-trained models utilize multi-modal features during the pre-training phase, they tend to operate as a unimodal pipeline when it comes to layout analysis tasks. Furthermore, current multi-modal methods perform worse than unimodal detectors on complex layout analysis datasets. To address these limitations, we propose an effective and pluggable multi-modal fusion approach named M2Doc, which fuses visual and textual features for better layout detection. M2Doc contains two pluggable multi-modal fusion modules, early-fusion and late-fusion, which align and fuse visual and textual features at the pixel level and block level. Benefitting from the concision and effectiveness of M2Doc, it can be easily applied to various detectors for better layout detection, including two-stage and end-to-end object detectors. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in detectors equipped with M2Doc on datasets such as DocLayNet (+11.3 mAP) and M6Doc (+1.9 mAP). Furthermore, through the integration of the DINO detector with M2Doc, we achieve state-of-the-art results on DocLayNet (89.0 mAP), M6Doc (69.9 mAP), and PubLayNet (95.5 mAP).
