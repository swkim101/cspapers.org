In recent years, there has been significant progress in employing color images for anomaly detection in industrial scenarios, but it is insufficient for identifying anomalies that are invisible in RGB images alone. As a supplement, introducing extra modalities such as depth and surface normal maps can be helpful to detect these anomalies. To this end, we present a novel Multi-Modal Reverse Distillation (MMRD) paradigm that consists of a frozen multi-modal teacher encoder to generate distillation targets and a learnable student decoder targeting to restore multi-modal representations from the teacher. Specifically, the teacher extracts complementary visual features from different modalities via a siamese architecture and then parameter-freely fuses these information from multiple levels as the targets of distillation. For the student, it learns modality-related priors from the teacher representations of normal training data and performs interaction between them to form multi-modal representations for target reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our MMRD outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on both anomaly detection and localization on MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies benchmarks. Codes will be available upon acceptance.
