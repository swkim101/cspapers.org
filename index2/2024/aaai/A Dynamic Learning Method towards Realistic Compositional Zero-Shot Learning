To tackle the challenge of recognizing images of unseen attribute-object compositions, Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) methods have been previously addressed. However, test images in realistic scenarios may also incorporate other forms of unknown factors, such as novel semantic concepts or novel image styles. As previous CZSL works have overlooked this critical issue, in this research, we first propose the Realistic Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (RCZSL) task which considers the various types of unknown factors in an unified experimental setting. To achieve this, we firstly conduct re-labelling on MIT-States and use the pre-trained generative models to obtain images of various domains. Then the entire dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the latter containing images of unseen concepts, unseen compositions, unseen domains as well as their combinations. Following this, we show that the visual-semantic relationship changes on unseen images, leading us to construct two dynamic modulators to adapt the visual features and composition prototypes in accordance with the input image. We believe that such a dynamic learning method could effectively alleviate the domain shift problem caused by various types of unknown factors. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for both the conventional CZSL setting and the proposed RCZSL setting. The effectiveness of our method has been proven by empirical results, which significantly outperformed both our baseline method and state-of-the-art approaches.
