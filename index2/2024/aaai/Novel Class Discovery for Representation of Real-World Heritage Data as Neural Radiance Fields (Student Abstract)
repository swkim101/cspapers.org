Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been extensively explored as a leading approach for modeling and representing 3D data across various domains. Their ability to capture arbitrary scale point clouds and generate novel views makes them particularly valuable for digitizing cultural heritage sites. However, despite their impressive rendering capabilities, prior methods have often overlooked a significant real-world challenge: handling open-world scenarios characterized by unstructured data containing multiple classes in a single set of unlabeled images. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method NCD-NeRF that leverages Novel-Class Discovery to effectively tackle the complexities inherent in real-world data with unlabeled classes while excelling in producing high-quality NeRF representation. To validate our approach, we conducted a benchmarking analysis using a custom-collected dataset featuring UNESCO World Heritage sites in India. We observe that our proposed NCD-NeRF can parallely discover novel classes and render high-quality 3D volumes.
