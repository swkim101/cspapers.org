Depth map super-resolution (DSR) plays an indispensable role in 3D vision. We discover an non-trivial spectral phenomenon: the components of high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) depth maps manifest the same intrinsic phase, and the spectral phase of RGB is a superset of them, which suggests that a phase-aware filter can assist in the precise use of RGB cues. Motivated by this, we propose an intrinsic phase-preserving DSR paradigm, named IPPNet, to fully exploit inter-modality collaboration in a mutually guided way. In a nutshell, a novel Phase-Preserving Filtering Module (PPFM) is developed to generate dynamic phase-aware filters according to the LR depth flow to filter out erroneous noisy components contained in RGB and then conduct depth enhancement via the modulation of the phase-preserved RGB signal. By stacking multiple PPFM blocks, the proposed IPPNet is capable of reaching a highly competitive restoration performance. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, e.g., NYU v2, RGB-D-D, reach SOTA performance and also well demonstrate the validity of the proposed phase-preserving scheme.
