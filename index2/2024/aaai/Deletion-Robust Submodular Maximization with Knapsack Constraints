Submodular maximization algorithms have found wide applications in various fields such as data summarization, recommendation systems, and active learning. In recent years, deletion-robust submodular maximization algorithms have garnered attention due to their significant implications in scenarios where some data points may be removed due to user preferences or privacy concerns, such as in recommendation systems and influence maximization. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of submodular maximization with knapsack constraints and propose a robust streaming algorithm for it. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first to solve this problem for non-monotone submodular functions and can achieve an approximation ratio of 1/(6.82+2.63d)-ϵ under a near-optimal summary size of O(k+r), where k denotes the maximum cardinality of any feasible solution, d denotes the number of the knapsack constraints and r is the robustness parameter. For monotone submodular functions, our algorithm can achieve an approximation ratio of 1/(2+2d)-ϵ under a near-optimal summary size of O(k+r), significantly improving upon the best-known ratio of Ω((1/d-ϵ)^2). The empirical performance of our algorithm is extensively evaluated in several applications including influence maximization and recommendation systems, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
