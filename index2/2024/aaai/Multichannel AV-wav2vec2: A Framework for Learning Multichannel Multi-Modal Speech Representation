Self-supervised speech pre-training methods have developed rapidly in recent years, which show to be very effective for many near-field single-channel speech tasks. However, far-field multichannel speech processing is suffering from the scarcity of labeled multichannel data and complex ambient noises. The efficacy of self-supervised learning for far-field multichannel and multi-modal speech processing has not been well explored. Considering that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance in noisy scenes, in this work we propose the multichannel multi-modal speech self-supervised learning framework AV-wav2vec2, which utilizes video and multichannel audio data as inputs. First, we propose a multi-path structure to process multi-channel audio streams and a visual stream in parallel, with intra-, and inter-channel contrastive as training targets to fully exploit the rich information in multi-channel speech data. Second, based on contrastive learning, we use additional single-channel audio data, which is trained jointly to improve the performance of multichannel multi-modal representation. Finally, we use a Chinese multichannel multi-modal dataset in real scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR) and audio-visual speaker diarization (AVSD) tasks.
