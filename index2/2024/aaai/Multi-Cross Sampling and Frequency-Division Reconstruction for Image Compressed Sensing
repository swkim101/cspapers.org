Deep Compressed Sensing (DCS) has attracted considerable interest due to its superior quality and speed compared to traditional CS algorithms. However, current approaches employ simplistic convolutional downsampling to acquire measurements, making it difficult to retain high-level features of the original signal for better image reconstruction. Furthermore, these approaches often overlook the presence of both high- and low-frequency information within the network, despite their critical role in achieving high-quality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Cross Sampling and Frequency Division Network (MCFD-Net) for image CS. The Dynamic Multi-Cross Sampling (DMCS) module, a sampling network of MCFD-Net, incorporates pyramid cross convolution and dual-branch sampling with multi-level pooling. Additionally, it introduces an attention mechanism between perception blocks to enhance adaptive learning effects. In the second deep reconstruction stage, we design a Frequency Division Reconstruction Module (FDRM). This module employs a discrete wavelet transform to extract high- and low-frequency information from images. It then applies multi-scale convolution and self-similarity attention compensation separately to both types of information before merging the output reconstruction results. The MCFD-Net integrates the DMCS and FDRM to construct an end-to-end learning network. Extensive CS experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MCFD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, while also exhibiting superior noise robustness.
