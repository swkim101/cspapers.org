Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning representations for graph-structured data. However, GNNs still face challenges in modeling complex phenomena that involve feature transportation. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN architecture inspired by Advection-Diffusion-Reaction systems, called ADR-GNN.
Advection models feature transportation, while diffusion captures the local smoothing of features, and reaction represents the non-linear transformation between feature channels. We provide an analysis of the qualitative behavior of ADR-GNN, that shows the benefit of combining advection, diffusion, and reaction.
To demonstrate its efficacy, we evaluate ADR-GNN on real-world node classification and spatio-temporal datasets, and show that it improves or offers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art networks.
