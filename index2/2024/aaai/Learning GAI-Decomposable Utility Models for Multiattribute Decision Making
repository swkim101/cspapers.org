We propose an approach to learn a multiattribute utility function to model, explain or predict the value system of a Decision Maker. The main challenge of the modelling task is to describe human values and preferences in the presence of interacting attributes while keeping the utility function as simple as possible. We focus on the generalized additive decomposable utility model which allows interactions between attributes while preserving some additive decomposability of the evaluation model. We present a learning approach able to identify the factors of interacting attributes and to learn the utility functions defined on these factors. This approach relies on the determination of a sparse representation of the ANOVA decomposition of the multiattribute utility function using multiple kernel learning. It applies to both continuous and discrete attributes. Numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the practical efficiency of the learning approach.
