We propose a Dynamic Context-Guided Upsampling (DCGU) module for video super-resolution (VSR) that leverages temporal context guidance to achieve efficient and effective arbitrary-scale VSR. While most VSR research focuses on backbone design, the importance of the upsampling part is often overlooked. Existing methods rely on pixelshuffle-based upsampling, which has limited capabilities in handling arbitrary upsampling scales. Recent attempts to replace pixelshuffle-based modules with implicit neural function-based and filter-based approaches suffer from slow inference speeds and limited representation capacity, respectively. To overcome these limitations, our DCGU module predicts non-local sampling locations and content-dependent filter weights, enabling efficient and effective arbitrary-scale VSR. Our proposed multi-granularity location search module efficiently identifies non-local sampling locations across the entire low-resolution grid, and the temporal bilateral filter modulation module integrates content information with the filter weight to enhance textual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and speed on arbitrary-scale VSR.
