We present a new boundary sensitive framework for polyp segmentation, termed Polyper.Our method is motivated by a clinical approach that seasoned medical practitioners often leverage the inherent features of interior polyp regions to tackle blurred boundaries.Inspired by this, we propose to explicitly leverages boundary regions to bolster the model's boundary discrimination capability while minimizing computational resource wastage. Our approach first extracts low-confidence boundary regions and high-confidence prediction regions from an initial segmentation map through differentiable morphological operators.Then, we design the boundary sensitive attention that concentrates on augmenting the features near the boundary regions using the high-confidence prediction region's characteristics to generate good segmentation results.Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated with classical encoder networks, like ResNet-50, MiT-B1, and Swin Transformer.To evaludate the effectiveness of Polyper, we conduct experiments on five publicly available challenging datasets, and receive state-of-the-art performance on all of them.
