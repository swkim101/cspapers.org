Multi-view K-means clustering successfully generalizes K-means from single-view to multi-view, and obtains excellent clustering performance. In every view, it makes each data point close to the center of the corresponding cluster. However, multi-view K-means only considers the compactness of each cluster, but ignores the separability of different clusters, which is of great importance to producing a good clustering result. In this paper, we propose Discriminatively Fuzzy Multi-view K-means clustering with Local Structure Preserving (DFMKLS). On the basis of minimizing the distance between each data point and the center of the corresponding cluster, DFMKLS separates clusters by maximizing the distance between the centers of pairwise clusters. DFMKLS also relaxes its objective by introducing the idea of fuzzy clustering, which calculates the probability that a data point belongs to each cluster. Considering multi-view K-means mainly focuses on the global information of the data, to efficiently use the local information, we integrate the local structure preserving into the framework of DFMKLS. The effectiveness of DFMKLS is evaluated on benchmark multi-view datasets. It obtains superior performances than state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods, including multi-view K-means.
