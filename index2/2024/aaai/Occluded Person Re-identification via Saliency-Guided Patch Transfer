While generic person re-identification has made remarkable improvement in recent years, these methods are designed under the assumption that the entire body of the person is available. This assumption brings about a significant performance degradation when suffering from occlusion caused by various obstacles in real-world applications. To address this issue, data-driven strategies have emerged to enhance the model's robustness to occlusion. Following the random erasing paradigm, these strategies typically employ randomly generated noise to supersede randomly selected image regions to simulate obstacles. However, the random strategy is not sensitive to location and content, meaning they cannot mimic real-world occlusion cases in application scenarios. To overcome this limitation and fully exploit the real scene information in datasets, this paper proposes a more intuitive and effective data-driven strategy named Saliency-Guided Patch Transfer (SPT). Combined with the vision transformer, SPT divides person instances and background obstacles using salient patch selection. By transferring person instances to different background obstacles, SPT can easily generate photo-realistic occluded samples. Furthermore, we propose an occlusion-aware Intersection over Union (OIoU) with mask-rolling to filter the more suitable combination and a class-ignoring strategy to achieve more stable processing. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on occluded and holistic person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that SPT provides a significant performance gain among different ViT-based ReID algorithms on occluded ReID.
