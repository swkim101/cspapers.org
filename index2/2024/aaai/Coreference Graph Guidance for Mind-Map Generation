Mind-map generation aims to process a document into a hierarchical structure to show its central idea and branches. Such a manner is more conducive to understanding the logic and semantics of the document than plain text. Recently, a state-of-the-art method encodes the sentences of a document sequentially and converts them to a relation graph via sequence-to-graph. Though this method is efficient to generate mind-maps in parallel, its mechanism focuses more on sequential features while hardly capturing structural information. Moreover, it's difficult to model long-range semantic relations. In this work, we propose a coreference-guided mind-map generation network (CMGN) to incorporate external structure knowledge. Specifically, we construct a coreference graph based on the coreference semantic relationship to introduce the graph structure information. Then we employ a coreference graph encoder to mine the potential governing relations between sentences. In order to exclude noise and better utilize the information of the coreference graph, we adopt a graph enhancement module in a contrastive learning manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms all the existing methods. The case study further proves that our model can more accurately and concisely reveal the structure and semantics of a document. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Cyno2232/CMGN.
