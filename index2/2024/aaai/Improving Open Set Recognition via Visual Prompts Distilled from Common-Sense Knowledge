Open Set Recognition (OSR) poses significant challenges in distinguishing known from unknown classes. In OSR, the overconfidence problem has become a persistent obstacle, where visual recognition models often misclassify unknown objects as known objects with high confidence. This issue stems from the fact that visual recognition models often lack the integration of common-sense knowledge, a feature that is naturally present in language-based models but lacking in visual recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance OSR performance by distilling common-sense knowledge into visual prompts. Utilizing text prompts that embody common-sense knowledge about known classes, the proposed visual prompt is learned by extracting semantic common-sense features and aligning them with image features from visual recognition models. The unique aspect of this work is the training of individual visual prompts for each class to encapsulate this common-sense knowledge. Our methodology is model-agnostic, capable of enhancing OSR across various visual recognition models, and computationally light as it focuses solely on training the visual prompts. This research introduces a method for addressing OSR, aiming at a more systematic integration of visual recognition systems with common-sense knowledge. The obtained results indicate an enhancement in recognition accuracy, suggesting the applicability of this approach in practical settings.
