Few-shot font generation, especially for Chinese calligraphy fonts, is a challenging and ongoing problem. With the help of prior knowledge that is mainly based on glyph consistency assumptions, some recently proposed methods can synthesize high-quality Chinese glyph images. However, glyphs in calligraphy font styles often do not meet these assumptions. To address this problem, we propose a novel model, DeepCalliFont, for few-shot Chinese calligraphy font synthesis by integrating dual-modality generative models. Specifically, the proposed model consists of image synthesis and sequence generation branches, generating consistent results via a dual-modality representation learning strategy. The two modalities (i.e., glyph images and writing sequences) are properly integrated using a feature recombination module and a rasterization loss function. Furthermore, a new pre-training strategy is adopted to improve the performance by exploiting large amounts of uni-modality data. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method to other state-of-the-art approaches in the task of few-shot Chinese calligraphy font synthesis.
