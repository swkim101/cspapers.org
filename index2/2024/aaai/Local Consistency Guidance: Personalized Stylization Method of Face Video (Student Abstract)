Face video stylization aims to convert real face videos into specified reference styles. While one-shot methods perform well in single-image stylization, ensuring continuity between frames and retaining the original facial expressions present challenges in video stylization. To address these issues, our approach employs a personalized diffusion model with pixel-level control. We propose Local Consistency Guidance(LCG) strategy, composed of local-cross attention and local style transfer, to ensure temporal consistency. This framework enables the synthesis of high-quality stylized face videos with excellent temporal continuity.
