Homography estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Previous works mainly focus on estimating either a single homography, or multiple homographies based on mesh grid division of the image. In practical scenarios, single homography is inadequate and often leads to a compromised result for multiple planes; while mesh grid multi-homography damages the plane distribution of the scene, and does not fully address the restriction to use homography. 

In this work, we propose a novel semantics guided multi-homography estimation framework, Mask-Homo, to provide an explicit solution to the multi-plane depth disparity problem. First, a pseudo plane mask generation module is designed to obtain multiple correlated regions that follow the plane distribution of the scene. Then, multiple local homography transformations, each of which aligns a correlated region precisely, are predicted and corresponding warped images are fused to obtain the final result. Furthermore, a new metric, Mask-PSNR, is proposed for more comprehensive evaluation of alignment. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
