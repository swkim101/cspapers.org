Domain Generalization (DG) aims to improve the generalization ability of models trained on a specific group of source domains, enabling them to perform well on new, unseen target domains. Recent studies have shown that methods that converge to smooth optima can enhance the generalization performance of supervised learning tasks such as classification. In this study, we examine the impact of smoothness-enhancing formulations on domain adversarial training, which combines task loss and adversarial loss objectives. Our approach leverages the fact that converging to a smooth minimum with respect to task loss can stabilize the task loss and lead to better performance on unseen domains. Furthermore, we recognize that the distribution of objects in the real world often follows a long-tailed class distribution, resulting in a mismatch between machine learning models and our expectations of their performance on all classes of datasets with long-tailed class distributions. To address this issue, we consider the domain generalization problem from the perspective of the long-tail distribution and propose using the maximum square loss to balance different classes which can improve model generalizability. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on various domain generalization datasets. Code: https://github.com/bamboosir920/SAMALTDG.
