Accurate prediction of coupon usage is crucial for promoting user consumption through targeted coupon recommendations. However, in real-world coupon recommendations, the coupon allocation process is not solely determined by the model trained with the history interaction data but is also interfered with by marketing tactics desired to fulfill specific commercial goals.This interference creates an imbalance in the interactions, which causes the data to deviate from the user's natural preferences. We refer to this deviation as the matching bias. Such biased interaction data affects the efficacy of the model, and thus it is necessary to employ debiasing techniques to prevent any negative impact.
We investigate the mitigation of matching bias in coupon recommendations from a causal-effect perspective. By treating the attributes of users and coupons associated with marketing tactics as confounders, we find the confounders open the backdoor path between user-coupon matching and the conversion, which introduces spurious correlation. To remove the bad effect, we propose a novel training paradigm named Backdoor Adjustment via Group Adaptation (BAGA) for debiased coupon recommendations, which performs intervened training and inference, i.e., separately modeling each user-coupon group pair. However, modeling all possible group pairs greatly increases the computational complexity and cost. To address the efficiency challenge, we further present a simple but effective dual-tower multi-task framework and leverage the Customized Gate Control (CGC) model architecture, which separately models each user and coupon group with a separate expert module. We instantiate BAGA on five representative models: FM, DNN, NCF, MASKNET, and DEEPFM, and conduct comprehensive offline and online experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed paradigm.
