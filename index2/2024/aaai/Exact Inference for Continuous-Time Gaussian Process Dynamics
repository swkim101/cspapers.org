Many physical systems can be described as a continuous-time dynamical system. In practice, the true system is often unknown and has to be learned from measurement data. Since data is typically collected in discrete time, e.g. by sensors, most methods in Gaussian process (GP) dynamics model learning are trained on one-step ahead predictions. While this scheme is mathematically tempting, it can become problematic in several scenarios, e.g. if measurements are provided at irregularly-sampled time steps or physical system properties have to be conserved. Thus, we aim for a GP model of the true continuous-time dynamics. We tackle this task by leveraging higher-order numerical integrators. These integrators provide the necessary tools to discretize dynamical systems with arbitrary accuracy. However, most higher-order integrators require dynamics evaluations at intermediate time steps, making exact GP inference intractable. In previous work, this problem is often addressed by approximate inference techniques. However, exact GP inference is preferable in many scenarios, e.g. due to its mathematical guarantees. In order to enable direct inference, we propose to leverage multistep and Taylor integrators. We demonstrate how exact inference schemes can be derived for these types of integrators. Further, we derive tailored sampling schemes that allow one to draw consistent dynamics functions from the posterior. The learned model can thus be integrated with arbitrary integrators, just like a standard dynamical system. We show empirically and theoretically that our approach yields an accurate representation of the continuous-time system.
