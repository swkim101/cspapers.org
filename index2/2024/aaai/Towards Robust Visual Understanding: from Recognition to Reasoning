Models that learn from data are widely and rapidly being deployed today for real-world use, but they suffer from unforeseen failures due to distribution shift, adversarial attacks, noise and corruption, and data scarcity. But many failures also occur because many modern AI tasks require reasoning beyond pattern matching -- and such reasoning abilities are difficult to formulate as data-based input-output function fitting. The reliability problem has become increasingly important under the new paradigm of semantic ``multimodal'' learning. My research provides avenues to develop robust and reliable computer vision systems, particularly by leveraging the interactions between vision and language. In this AAAI New Faculty highlights talk, I will cover three thematic areas of my research, ranging from robustness in computer vision, open-domain reliability in visual reasoning, and challenges and opportunities in evaluation of generative models. Readers are encouraged to refer to my website (www.tejasgokhale.com) for more details and updates from my lab's activities towards the goal of robust visual understanding.
