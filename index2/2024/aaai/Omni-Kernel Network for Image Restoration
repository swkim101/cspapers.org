Image restoration aims to reconstruct a high-quality image from a degraded low-quality observation. Recently, Transformer models have achieved promising performance on image restoration tasks due to their powerful ability to model long-range dependencies. However, the quadratically growing complexity with respect to the input size makes them inapplicable to practical applications. In this paper, we develop an efficient convolutional network for image restoration by enhancing multi-scale representation learning. To this end, we propose an omni-kernel module that consists of three branches, i.e., global, large, and local branches, to learn global-to-local feature representations efficiently. Specifically, the global branch achieves a global perceptive field via the dual-domain channel attention and frequency-gated mechanism. Furthermore, to provide multi-grained receptive fields, the large branch is formulated via different shapes of depth-wise convolutions with unusually large kernel sizes. Moreover, we complement local information using a point-wise depth-wise convolution. Finally, the proposed network, dubbed OKNet, is established by inserting the omni-kernel module into the bottleneck position for efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 benchmark datasets for three representative image restoration tasks, including image dehazing, image desnowing, and image defocus deblurring.
