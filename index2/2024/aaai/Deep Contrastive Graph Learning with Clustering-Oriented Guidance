Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has exhibited remarkable potential in improving graph-based clustering. To handle the general clustering scenario without a prior graph, these models estimate an initial graph beforehand to apply GCN. Throughout the literature, we have witnessed that 1) most models focus on the initial graph while neglecting the original features. Therefore, the discriminability of the learned representation may be corrupted by a low-quality initial graph; 2) the training procedure lacks effective clustering guidance, which may lead to the incorporation of clustering-irrelevant information into the learned graph. To tackle these problems, the Deep Contrastive Graph Learning (DCGL) model is proposed for general data clustering. Specifically, we establish a pseudo-siamese network, which incorporates auto-encoder with GCN to emphasize both the graph structure and the original features. On this basis, feature-level contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the discriminative capacity, and the relationship between samples and centroids is employed as the clustering-oriented guidance. Afterward, a two-branch graph learning mechanism is designed to extract the local and global structural relationships, which are further embedded into a unified graph under the cluster-level contrastive guidance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DCGL against state-of-the-art algorithms.
