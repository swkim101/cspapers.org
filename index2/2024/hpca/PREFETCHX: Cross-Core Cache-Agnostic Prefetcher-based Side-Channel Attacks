In this paper, we reveal the existence of a new class of prefetcher, the XPT prefetcher, in modern Intel processors which has never been officially detailed. It speculatively issues a load, bypassing last-level cache (LLC) lookups, when it predicts that a load request will result in an LLC miss. We demonstrate that XPT prefetcher is shared among different cores, which enables an attacker to build cross-core side-channel and covertchannel attacks. We propose PREFETCHX, a cross-core attack mechanism, to leak usersâ€™ sensitive data and activities. We empirically demonstrate that PREFETCHX can be used to extract private keys of real-world RSA applications. Furthermore, we show that PREFETCHX can enable side-channel attacks that can monitor keystrokes and network traffic patterns of users. Our two cross-core covert-channel attacks also see a low error rate and a 122KiB/s maximum channel capacity. Due to the cache-independent feature of PREFETCHX, current cache-based mitigations are not effective against our attacks. Overall, our work uncovers a significant vulnerability in the XPT prefetcher, which can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information in both cryptography and non-cryptography-related applications among processor cores.
