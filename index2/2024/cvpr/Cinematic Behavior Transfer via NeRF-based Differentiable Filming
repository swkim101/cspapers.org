In the evolving landscape of digital media and video pro-duction, the precise manipulation and reproduction of visual elements like camera movements and character actions are highly desired. Existing SLAM methods face limitations in dynamic scenes and human pose estimation often focuses on 2D projections, neglecting 3D statuses. To address these is-sues, we first introduce a reverse filming behavior estimation technique. It optimizes camera trajectories by leveraging NeRF as a differentiable renderer and refining SMPL tracks. We then introduce a cinematic transfer pipeline that is able to transfer various shot types to a new 2D video or a 3D vir-tual environment. The incorporation of 3D engine workflow enables superior rendering and control abilities, which also achieves a higher rating in the user study.
