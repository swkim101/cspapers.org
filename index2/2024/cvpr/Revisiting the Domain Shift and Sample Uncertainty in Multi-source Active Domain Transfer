Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) aims to maximally boost model adaptation in a new target domain by actively selecting a limited number of target data to annotate. This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to extend ADA from a single source domain to multiple source domains, termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation (MADA). Not surprisingly, we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work directly in such a setting, mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced by all the source domains. Considering this, we propose a Detective framework that comprehensively considers the domain shift between multi-source domains and target domains to detect the informative target samples. Specifically, the Detective leverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation (DA) model that learns how to adapt the model's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an approximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then compre-hensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in the target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep learning, thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing methods by a considerable margin on three domain adaptation benchmarks. Our project is available at https://github.com/wannature/MADA.
