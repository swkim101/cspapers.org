Although soft prompt tuning is effective in efficiently adapting Vision-Language (V&L) models for downstream tasks, it shows limitations in dealing with distribution shifts. We address this issue with Attribute-Guided Prompt Tuning (ArGue), making three key contributions. 1) In contrast to the conventional approach of directly appending soft prompts preceding class names, we align the model with primitive visual attributes generated by Large language Models (LLMs). We posit that a model's ability to express high confidence in these attributes signifies its ca-pacity to discern the correct class rationales. 2) We intro-duce attribute sampling to eliminate disadvantageous at-tributes, thus only semantically meaningful attributes are preserved. 3) We propose negative prompting, explicitly enumerating class-agnostic attributes to activate spurious correlations and encourage the model to generate highly orthogonal probability distributions in relation to these neg-ative features. In experiments, our method significantly out-performs current state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on both novel class prediction and out-of-distribution general-ization tasks.
