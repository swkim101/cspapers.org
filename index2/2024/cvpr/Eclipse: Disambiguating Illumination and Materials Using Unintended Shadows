Decomposing an object's appearance into representations of its materials and the surrounding illumination is difficult, even when the object's 3D shape is known before-hand. This problem is especially challenging for diffuse objects: it is ill-conditioned because diffuse materials severely blur incoming light, and it is ill-posed because diffuse materials under high-frequency lighting can be indistinguishable from shiny materials under low-frequency lighting. We show that it is possible to recover precise materials and illumination-even from diffuse objects-by exploiting un-intended shadows, like the ones cast onto an object by the photographer who moves around it. These shadows are a nuisance in most previous inverse rendering pipelines, but here we exploit them as signals that improve conditioning and help resolve material-lighting ambiguities. We present a method based on differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracing that uses images of an object to jointly recover its spatially-varying materials, the surrounding illumination environment, and the shapes of the unseen light occluders who in-advertently cast shadows upon it.
