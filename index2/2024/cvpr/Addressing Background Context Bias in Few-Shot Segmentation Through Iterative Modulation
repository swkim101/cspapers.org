Existing few-shot segmentation methods usually extract foreground prototypes from support images to guide query image segmentation. However, different background contexts of support and query images can cause their foreground features to be misaligned. This phenomenon, known as background context bias, can hinder the effectiveness of support prototypes in guiding query image segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel framework with an it-erative structure to address this problem. In each iteration of the framework, we first generate a query prediction based on a support foreground feature. Next, we extract background context from the query image to modulate the support foreground feature, thus eliminating the foreground feature misalignment caused by the different backgrounds. After that, we design a confidence-biased attention to eliminate noise and cleanse information. By integrating these components through an iterative structure, we create a novel network that can leverage the synergies between different modules to improve their performance in a mutually reinforcing manner. Through these carefully designed components and structures, our network can effectively elimi-nate background context bias in few-shot segmentation, thus achieving outstanding performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
