Hyperspectral 3D imaging aims to acquire both depth and spectral information of a scene. However, existing methods are either prohibitively expensive and bulky or compromise on spectral and depth accuracy. In this paper, we present Dispersed Structured Light (DSL), a cost-effective and compact method for accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL modifies a traditional projectorcamera system by placing a sub-millimeter thick diffraction grating film front of the projector. This configuration enables dispersing structured light based on light wavelength. To utilize the dispersed structured light, we devise a model for dispersive projection image formation and a per-pixel hyperspectral 3D reconstruction method. We validate DSL by instantiating a compact experimental prototype. DSL achieves spectral accuracy of 18.8 nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and depth error of 1 mm, outperforming prior work on practical hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL promises accurate and practical hyperspectral 3D imaging for diverse application domains, including computer vision and graphics, cultural heritage, geology, and biology.
