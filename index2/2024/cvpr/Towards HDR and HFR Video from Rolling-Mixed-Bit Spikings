The spiking cameras offer the benefits of high dynamic range (HDR), high temporal resolution, and low data redundancy. However, reconstructing HDR videos in high-speed conditions using single-bit spikings presents challenges due to the limited bit depth. Increasing the bit depth of the spikings is advantageous for boosting HDR performance, but the readout efficiency will be decreased, which is unfavorable for achieving a high frame rate (HFR) video. To address these challenges, we propose a readout mechanism to obtain rolling-mixed-bit (RMB) spikings, which involves inter-leaving multi-bit spikings within the single-bit spikings in a rolling manner, thereby combining the characteristics of high bit depth and efficient readout. Furthermore, we introduce RMB-Net for reconstructing HDR and HFR videos. RMB-Net comprises a cross-bit attention block for fusing mixed-bit spikings and a cross-time attention block for achieving temporal fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our method. For instance, pure 3 -bit spikings result in 3 times of data volume, whereas our method achieves comparable performance with less than 2% increase in data volume.
