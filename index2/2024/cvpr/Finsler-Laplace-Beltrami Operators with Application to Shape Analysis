The Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) emerges from studying manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. It is often called the swiss army knife of geometry processing as it allows to capture intrinsic shape information and gives rise to heat diffusion, geodesic distances, and a mul-titude of shape descriptors. It also plays a central role in geometric deep learning. In this work, we explore Finsler manifolds as a generalization of Riemannian manifolds. We revisit the Finsler heat equation and derive a Finsler heat kernel and a Finsler-Laplace-Beltrami Operator (FLBO): a novel theoretically justified anisotropic Laplace-Beltrami operator (ALBO). In experimental evaluations we demon-strate that the proposed FLBO is a valuable alternative to the traditional Riemannian-based LBO and ALBOs for spa-tialfiltering and shape correspondence estimation. We hope that the proposed Finsler heat kernel and the FLBO will inspire further exploration of Finsler geometry in the Computer vision community.
