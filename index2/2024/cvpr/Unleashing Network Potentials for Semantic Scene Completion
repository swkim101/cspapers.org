Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to predict complete 3D voxel occupancy and semantics from a single-view RGB-D image, and recent SSC methods commonly adopt multi-modal inputs. However, our investigation reveals two limitations: ineffective feature learning from single modalities and overfitting to limited datasets. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel SSC framework - Adversarial Modality Modulation Network (AMMNet) - with a fresh perspective of optimizing gradient updates. The proposed AMMNet introduces two core modules: a cross-modal modulation enabling the interdependence of gradient flows between modalities, and a customized adversarial training scheme leveraging dynamic gradient competition. Specifically, the cross-modal modulation adaptively re-calibrates the features to better excite representation potentials from each single modality. The adversarial training employs a minimax game of evolving gradients, with customized guidance to strengthen the generator's perception of visual fidelity from both geometric completeness and semantic correctness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AMMNet outperforms state-of-the-art SSC methods by a large margin, providing a promising direction for improving the effectiveness and generalization of SSC methods.
