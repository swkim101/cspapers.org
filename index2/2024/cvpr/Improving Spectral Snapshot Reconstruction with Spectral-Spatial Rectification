How to effectively utilize the spectral and spatial char-acteristics of Hyperspectral Image (HSI) is always a key problem in spectral snapshot reconstruction. Recently, the spectra-wise transformer has shown great potential in capturing inter-spectra similarities of HSI, but the classic design of the transformer, i.e., multi-head division in the spectral (channel) dimension hinders the modeling of global spectral information and results in mean effect. In addition, previous methods adopt the normal spatial priors without taking imaging processes into account and fail to address the unique spatial degradation in snapshot spectral reconstruction. In this paper, we analyze the influence of multi-head division and propose a novel Spectral-Spatial Recti-fication (SSR) method to enhance the utilization of spectral information and improve spatial degradation. Specifically, SSR includes two core parts: Window-based Spectra-wise Self-Attention (WSSA) and spAtial Rectification Block (ARB). WSSA is proposed to capture global spectral in-formation and account for local differences, whereas ARB aims to mitigate the spatial degradation using a spatial alignment strategy. The experimental results on simulation and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules, and we also provide models at multiple scales to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. https://github.com/ZhangJC-2k/SSR
