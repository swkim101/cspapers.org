Inferring scene geometry from images via Structure from Motion is a long-standing and fundamental problem in computer vision. While classical approaches and, more re-cently, depth map predictions only focus on the visible parts of a scene, the task of scene completion aims to reason about geometry even in occluded regions. With the popularity of neural radiance fields (NeRFs), implicit represen-tations also became popular for scene completion by pre-dicting so-called density fields. Unlike explicit approaches e.g. voxel-based methods, density fields also allow for ac-curate depth prediction and novel-view synthesis via image-based rendering. In this work, we propose to fuse the scene reconstruction from multiple images and distill this knowl-edge into a more accurate single-view scene reconstruction. To this end, we propose Multi- View Behind the Scenes (MVBTS) to fuse density fields from multiple posed images, trained fully self-supervised only from image data. Using knowledge distillation, we use MVBTS to train a single-view scene completion network via direct supervision called KDBTS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on occu-pancy prediction, especially in occluded regions.
