Centralised servers provide on-demand resources to process offloaded workloads from computing nodes. While server-based computing has been successful for applications with soft timing constraints, it falls short for safety-critical real-time systems with hard timing requirements. To bridge this gap, we develop a job-level admission test to satisfy the requirements for real-time applications deployed on a server by extending the “(M, K)-firm weakly hard” model to server systems, ensuring timely processing of server requests. We introduce an admission policy to regulate the workload and prevent deadline misses while attempting to admit more requests than the minimum required by the initial (M, K) constraints. The admission policy is designed to allow an optimal resource allocation to applications deployed on the server. 11This work is an extension of our work-in-progress paper at RTAS'24 [1].
