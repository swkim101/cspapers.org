Efficient traffic delivery is a key aspect of Internet operations. To achieve this goal, network operators rely on expanding their footprint and performing inbound traffic engineering to influence other ASes' route decisions. Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are fundamental elements as they allow the interconnection of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes). The decision of where to interconnect directly impacts the AS' traffic delivery as each IXP offers different connectivity options. We analyze routing data from five relevant IXPs to understand the announced address space, whether ASes connected to multiple IXPs use traffic engineering to indicate a preferable IXP to exchange traffic, and the traffic engineering techniques used to try to influence other ASes' routing decisions. While previous research focused on understanding the ecosystem and benefits of joining IXPs [2, 4], the traffic engineering aspects have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by this gap, we analyzed routing data from five IXPs. Our study examines the announced address space, evaluates whether ASes connected to multiple IXPs employ traffic engineering to signal a preferred IXP for traffic exchange, and explores the traffic engineering techniques utilized to influence routing decisions of other ASes. We identify that half of the IXP members announce their entire address space at the IXP. We also observe that ASes connected to multiple IXPs tend to announce the same prefixes in both. Finally, when giving preference to a particular IXP, most ASes use a single inbound traffic engineering technique but have no clear preference for a given technique.
