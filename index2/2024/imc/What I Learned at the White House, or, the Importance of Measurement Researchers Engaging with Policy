Computing systems now impact almost every aspect of our daily lives. As these systems evolve and develop, they often raise new challenges to our security and privacy, as well as to our commitments to equity and justice. To identify and mitigate the risks that these new technologies present, it is crucial to have scientific and technological experts participate in the conversation. But fully addressing these issues in government-through legislation, regulation, policy development, and executive actions-requires that experts engage with policy and legislative processes, to be ''in the room where it happens.'' In this talk, I'll reflect on my 18 months serving at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) as Deputy U.S. Chief Technology Officer for Privacy. I'll provide an overview of the Biden-Harris Administration's work on fast-moving technologies such as AI as well as long-standing challenges such as privacy. I'll describe OSTP's role within the Executive Office of the President, and how OSTP works with and across the government to coordinate federal science and technology policy. Finally, I'll discuss the importance of members of computing-and the IMC community in particular-engaging with government. And I'll highlight opportunities to do so, ranging from responding to requests for information, to collaborative research projects, to tours of service and even careers in government.
