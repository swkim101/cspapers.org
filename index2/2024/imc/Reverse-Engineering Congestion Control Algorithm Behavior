The rise of proprietary and novel congestion control algorithms (CCAs) opens questions about the future of Internet utilization, latency, and fairness. However, fully analyzing how novel CCAs impact these properties requires understanding the inner workings of these algorithms. We thus aim to reverse-engineer deployed CCAsâ€™ behavior from collected packet traces to facilitate analyzing them. We present Abagnale, a program synthesis pipeline that helps users automate the reverse-engineering task. Using Abagnale, we discover simple expressions capturing the behavior of 9 of the 16 CCAs distributed with the Linux kernel and analyze 7 CCAs from a graduate networking course.
