In this study, we present PublicDNSEnum, a lightweight and accurate tool to enumerate anycast instances of public DNS services. Leveraging the open and forwarding features of DNS resolvers, PublicDNSEnum enables researchers to trigger and conduct anycast enumeration of public DNS anycast instances on a single vantage host. It transforms a massive number of open forwarders into distributed measurement nodes by utilizing the forwarding relationship between open forwarders and public DNS. Experiments on Google Public DNS show that PublicDNSEnum achieves better recall than the state-of-the-art technique, including iGreedy.
