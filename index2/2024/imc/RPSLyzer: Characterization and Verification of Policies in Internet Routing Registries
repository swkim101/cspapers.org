The Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) enables operators to specify routing policies in public registries. These policies contain information for traffic engineering, troubleshooting routing incidents, and automatically configuring route filters to improve security. RPSL information is also valuable for researchers to better understand the Internet. However, the RPSL's complexities make these policies challenging to interpret programmatically. We introduce RPSLyzer, a tool that can parse and interpret 99.99% of RPSL policies. We use RPSLyzer to characterize the RPSL policies of 78,701 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and verify 779 million BGP routes against these policies. We find RPSL usage varies widely among ASes, identify common RPSL misuses that explain most route verification failures, and offer operators recommendations to improve RPSL usage.
