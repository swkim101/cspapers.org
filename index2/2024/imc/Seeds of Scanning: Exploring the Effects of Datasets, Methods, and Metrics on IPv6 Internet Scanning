Large-scale Internet scanning is a vital research tool. While IPv4 can be exhaustively probed, the size of IPv6 precludes complete enumeration, limiting large-scale measurement. Target Generation Algorithms (TGAs)—algorithms which ingest lists of prediscovered addresses (“seeds”) and produce new addresses to scan—have begun bridging this IPv6 measurement gap. To date, there has been limited exploration of how changes in seed addresses, scanning methods, and dataset composition impact TGA-driven IPv6 host discovery. In this work, we provide a roadmap for how to use TGAs for Internet-widescanningbyevaluatinghowchangestoinputdatasets, preprocessing,liveness,aliasdetection,andmetricsimpactTGA performance.Wealsoexplorehowchoiceofscantarget—ICMP Echo,TCP80,TCP443,orUDP53—acrossbothinputsandoutputs, impactdiscoveredaddresses.
