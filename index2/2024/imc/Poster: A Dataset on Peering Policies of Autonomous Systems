This paper presents a methodology for extracting and structuring information from Internet Autonomous Systems peering policy documents using natural language processing techniques. We trained a named entity recognition model to identify and extract key entities related to peering practices. The resulting structured dataset, made publicly available, provides valuable insights into autonomous system peering requirements, preferences, and routing practices. This dataset serves as a foundation for understanding and modelling the peer selection processes of autonomous systems on the Internet. Our ongoing work focuses on developing a policy-aware approach to select peering partners based on compatibility scores derived from the extracted policy requirements.
