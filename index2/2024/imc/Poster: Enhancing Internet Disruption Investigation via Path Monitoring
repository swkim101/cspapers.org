Large-scale Internet disruptions, ranging from complete disconnections to service degradations, are increasingly common, due to factors such as government-ordered shutdowns, infrastructure failures, and sophisticated traffic manipulation techniques. While existing detection platforms are effective at identifying complete disconnections, they fail to detect service degradations, such as those caused by throttling, intentional rerouting, or network attacks, which degrade performance without blocking connectivity. In this poster, we discuss our plan to improve Internet disruption investigation through additional metrics (loss, latency) and measurement techniques (traceroutes) to help identify such events and provide researchers with the network-level information necessary for investigation. Our method not only helps to identify service degradations missed by traditional connectivity checks but also provides data for generating insights into the underlying causes and impacts of Internet disruptions.
