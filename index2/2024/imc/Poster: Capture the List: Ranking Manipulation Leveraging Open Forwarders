Domain top lists are widely used in Internet measurement and security analysis among the Internet community. To improve the manipulation resistance and stability of top lists, many efforts have been devoted, such as the passive DNS (pDNS)-based top list, Secrank, and the aggregated list, Tranco. However, it remains unexamined how robust these newly-built top lists are against ranking manipulation. In this study, we study the pitfall of the pDNS data and propose RaMOF, a novel Ranking Manipulation approach based on Open Forwarders, leveraging the inherent forwarding relationships between open forwarders and public DNS services. Our experiments show that both pDNS-based top lists and aggregated lists are prone to be affected by RaMOF attacks.
