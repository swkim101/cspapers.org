Modern websites are complex and fetch content from a multitude of different servers or domains. When measuring the complexity of the modern web, an open question is how content that is fetched from these domains contribute to the rendered output of the website. In this poster, we present the Web Dependency Analyzer, a tool that is designed to automatically infer the domains that a website depends on and further analyze the impact of each domain on the rendered output of the site. Our Web Dependency Analyzer instructs a headless web browser to infer the resource dependencies from a large set of input domains and outputs the visual impact of the unavailability of each domain.
