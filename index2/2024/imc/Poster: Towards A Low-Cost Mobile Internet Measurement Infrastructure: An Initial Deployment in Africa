Africa lags behind in broadband connectivity and performance. The internet cost remains significantly higher compared to the Global North, and users experience network delays, availability issues, and slow speeds. Several studies demonstrated that measuring internet performance in Africa will provide a better understanding of the reasons underpinning poor broadband performance and ultimately driving substantial improvements. While internet measurement is critical on the continent, effective measurement requires robust infrastructure. We recognize that robust network measurement is expensive but need to be context-based and involve all the internet stakeholders from users to regulators to service providers and more. However, current measurement tools are mostly designed in the West and do not necessarily reflect Africa's broadband measurement challenges. To address this, we propose in this work a cost-effective and context-based mobile broadband measurement infrastructure.
