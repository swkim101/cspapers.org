Optimizing mobile networks in the rapidly evolving field of wireless communication is increasingly challenging due to two main issues associated with current methods. First, the technical complexity of the Radio Access Network (RAN) with multiple technologies, frequency bands, and cell sizes makes it difficult for manual processing to keep pace with the growing number of issues to be resolved. Second, network optimization usually focuses on data gathered by network equipment, i.e. base stations, and overlooks user-side information, which can offer data with better spatial precision and more accurate Quality of Service (QoS) as seen by the end user. One of the main problems for alternative mobile network optimization methods that exploit user-related information is that they also require network-related knowledge, such as the deployed infrastructure and network load, which may not be available. However, network quality measurements at the User Equipment (UE), such as Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) in LTE networks, contain information about the total power received in the entire cell bandwidth, from which a proxy for cell load may be derived. In this work, we propose a generalized method to derive cell load from RSRQ, and test it in a commercial mobile network using crowdsourced measurements.
