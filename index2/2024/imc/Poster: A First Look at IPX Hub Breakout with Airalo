This study examines Airalo, a "thick" Mobile Network Aggregator. We analyze its unique use of multiple base operators for eSIM provisioning and its decoupling of internet gateways from operators' home countries. Our methodology combines measurements from volunteers in 24 countries using a mix of personal and instrumented Android devices, providing a comprehensive analysis of Airalo's operational model and impact on global mobile connectivity.
