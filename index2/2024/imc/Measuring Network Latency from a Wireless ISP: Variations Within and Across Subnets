While Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have traditionally focused on marketing network throughput, it is becoming increasingly recognized that network latency also plays a significant role for the quality of experience. However, many ISPs lack the means to continuously monitor the latency of their network. In this work, we present a method to continuously monitor and aggregate network latency per subnet directly in the Linux kernel by leveraging eBPF. We deploy this solution on a middlebox in an ISP network and collect an extensive dataset of latency measurements for both the internal and external parts of the network. We find that our monitoring solution can monitor all subscriber traffic while maintaining a low overhead of only around 1% additional CPU utilization. Our analysis of the latency data reveals a wide latency tail in the last-mile access, which grows during busy periods in the evening. Furthermore, we dissect the external network latency and uncover the latency profiles for the most popular autonomous systems.
