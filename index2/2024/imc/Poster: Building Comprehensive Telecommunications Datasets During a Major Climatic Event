In May 2024, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, endured a month of severe rainfall, leading to extensive infrastructure damage in more than 400 cities. This major climatic event caused widespread disruptions to the state's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, electrical plants, data centers, communication systems, and homes, affecting millions of people. In this paper, we describe the datasets we are collecting from various sources, including official reports, IXP connectivity and routing information, Internet quality measurements, and failure reports from data centers, the ISPs assotiation in the region, and the Brazilian National Research and Education Network. These datasets are being used to provide the first analyses of how these events affected the resilience of the Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure in Rio Grande do Sul. We plan to make these datasets available to the community for future studies on the climate impact on communications infrastructure and to better identify the challenges faced when resilience is critically tested. Additionally, we hope this data can outline improvements in ICT infrastructure to enhance operations and aid in the reconstruction process.
