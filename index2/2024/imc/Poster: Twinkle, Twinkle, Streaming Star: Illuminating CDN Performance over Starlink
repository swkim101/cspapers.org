Low-Earth-Orbit satellite networks (LSNs) are enabling low-latency high-bandwidth internet connectivity at a global scale. However, majority of the traffic on the Internet is currently handled by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which rely on geographical proximity to deliver content. In this work, we examine CDN performance for the commercial largest LSN, i.e. Starlink, by performing active measurements through our web browser plugin and passive analysis of Cloudflare speed tests globally. Comparing this to terrestrial networks, we highlight significant performance degradation for Starlink users due to the asymmetries between satellite and terrestrial infrastructure.
