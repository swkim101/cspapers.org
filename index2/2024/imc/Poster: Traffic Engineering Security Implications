Traffic delivery is fundamental for user experience on the Internet. To achieve this, Autonomous Systems (ASes) rely on their multiple connectivity options and manipulate prefix announcements to influence neighboring ASes' route decisions. One crucial aspect not yet investigated is how traffic engineering techniques may affect the prefix suitability of being hijacked or impacted by a route leak. We aim to examine how AS's connectivity and inbound traffic engineering techniques influence routing security. We use the PEERING Testbed combined with data and control plane measurements to offer systematical analyses of these aspects. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that connectivity plays an important role and that using ASPP directly influences the security impacts.
