QUIC, a rapidly evolving protocol, has gained prominence with its standardization and increased adoption as HTTP/3 on the World Wide Web. Originating from Google in 2014, QUIC has seen significant changes in transitioning from Google QUIC (gQUIC) to an IETF standard in 2021. Understanding the performance of the current version of QUIC in comparison to its predecessors is crucial given its evolution and widespread adoption. This study conducts a comprehensive performance evaluation of two versions of QUIC: Google QUIC version 37 (gQUICv37, 2017) and IETF QUIC version 1 (QUICv1, 2021). Following parameters and methodologies established by a notable QUIC paper from 2017, we replicate their experiments on gQUICv37 and extend it to QUICv1, leveraging the Emulab testbed to facilitate reproducible research. We show that the performance advantages of QUIC over TCP, given by core features like 0-RTT and multiple streams, are consistent in gQUICv37 and QUICv1. However, notable performance differences arise between the versions due to the implementation of the new BBR congestion control algorithm and an updated loss-detection strategy in QUICv1, resulting in improved performance for QUICv1 under packet reordering scenarios. By utilizing Emulab and sharing our scripts, we enable replication and extension of our study for future QUIC versions.
