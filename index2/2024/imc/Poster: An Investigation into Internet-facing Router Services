Routers are the core building block of the Internet infrastructure. Maintaining a secure router deployment is critical for protecting networks and providing uninterrupted, smooth operation. In this work, we take a first step toward analyzing routers' security on the Internet. We focus on the potential attack surface for routers, i.e., publicly exposed services. Specifically, we investigate what services are commonly running on known router IPv4 addresses. While exposed services may not pose an immediate risk, they do highlight failure to follow best practices, e.g., strict access control lists. We found that more than 40% of known router IPv4 addresses have at least one public-facing service. We also highlight the lack of consistency in applying network-wide security policies.
