While personalized recommendations improve user experience by aligning information with interests, they are alleged to narrow information acquisition, leading to a filter bubble. Prior studies have shown mixed findings on whether these systems limit or enhance content diversity. This study examines whether the YouTube recommendation system forms the filter bubbles and allows exits from the filter bubbles by ensuring the diversity of information. To assess the information dynamics by user-accessible data, we propose embedding similarity analysis based on feed-level video information. Through simulations of diverse user scenarios, our results demonstrate the dual role of recommendation systems in both fostering and hindering information diversity. It highlights the user's role in breaking the filter bubble on YouTube and suggests applications that help users recognize the current state of personalization.
