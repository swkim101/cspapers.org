As the entry point to the DNS hierarchy, the DNS root zone, served by the DNS root server system, is essential for the Internet. It consists of 13 deployments managed by 12 independent root server operators. Due to its importance, the root zone deserves special scrutiny, which it has received from researchers and operators alike. In this study, we measure all root servers over a period of 174 days from 675 vantage points in 523 networks and 62 countries using IPv4 and IPv6. Using this data, we first investigate the co-location between root servers, finding that almost 70% of clients observe co-location of at least two servers. Second, we monitor the integrity of zone transfers, finding rare issues like bitflips or stale zone files. Finally, by enriching our data with passive ISP and IXP data, we quantify the role of IPv6 for performance and behavior under change, finding that even seemingly similar subsets of root servers can differ considerably.
