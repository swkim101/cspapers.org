In this paper, we address the prevalent issue of account takeover (ATO) fraud, which significantly impacts businesses through stolen user information. Websites have adopted risk-based authentication , incorporating browser fingerprinting techniques to counteract this threat. However, attackers have adapted by using anti-detect browsers, referred to as fraud browsers , to spoof user information effectively. While traditional fingerprinting methods are capable of identifying fraud browsers, they encounter scalability and performance challenges in risk-based systems. To address these issues, we developed Browser Polygraph, an ML-based tool that applies coarse-grained privacy-preserving fingerprints to assess browser authenticity and assigns risk factors to suspicious sessions. Coarse-grained fingerprints, by design, cannot be used for user tracking but only for fraud detection purposes. Deployed at a major financial company, Browser Polygraph has flagged suspicious sessions, enabling more targeted identification of potential fraud, thus enhancing the companyâ€™s ability to tackle ATO attempts.
