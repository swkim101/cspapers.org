QUICv2 and the "Greasing the QUIC Bit'' have features designed to prevent the ossification (aka slowed progress in evolution) of the QUIC protocol. Historically, network middleboxes can become reliant on, for example, specific values or uses of header fields in QUIC packets. When changes are made to the fields, even though allowed by the specifications or for a new version of QUIC, middleboxes can negatively impact valid traffic or force a fallback to an older version of the protocol. QUIC, a modern transport protocol, already encrypts all of its payload and most of its headers, making it less susceptible to a middlebox inspection and interference. However, there are still a few fields that are visible to observers. To counter ossification, QUIC has two extensions: QUICv2 and Greasing the QUIC Bit. Despite their importance, there has been no comprehensive study examining whether these anti-ossification features are actually adopted on the Internet. Adoption is crucial, as only widespread use can prevent middleboxes from ossifying QUIC. We take the first step in comprehensively measuring the adoption of QUICv2 and the ''Greasing the QUIC Bit''. Unfortunately, our preliminary internet measurement of these features show minimal adoption so far, with less than 0.013% of QUICv1 domains in our sample supporting the Greasing the QUIC bit and fewer than 0.003% adopting QUICv2. Future work will map out which domains, software stacks, and entities are leaders in adoption.
