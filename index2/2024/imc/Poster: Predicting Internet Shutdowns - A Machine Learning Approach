Internet shutdowns, often enforced by governments to control communication and access to information, have significant socio-political and economic implications. This study presents a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of internet shutdowns, developing an Internet Shutdown Risk Score using public datasets from 125 countries. A Random Forest classifier, achieving an AUC of 0.97, was used to calculate risk scores. Key features were identified using the Shapley algorithm, highlighting factors like political unrest, economic conditions, and digital infrastructure. Case studies in Pakistan, India, and Sudan demonstrate rising shutdown risks due to protests from 2019 to 2022. Globally, the Internet Shutdown Risk Index has been consistently high since 2019, indicating increased threats of internet shutdowns in politically unstable regions.
