We investigate how environmental data collected from a low-cost, distributed Internet-of-Things platform can be used to identify factors affecting air quality in highly dense urban environments. In this work, we focus on the the case of Bangkok. We use data collected from the SEA-HAZEMON platform to analyze the incidence of several parameters on PMx level and assess its potential to forecast CO2 emission.
