The advent of regulation, such as the Digital Markets Act, will foster greater interoperability across competing digital platforms. In such regulatory environments, decentralized platforms like Mastodon have pioneered the principles of social data portability. Such platforms are composed of thousands of independent servers, each of which hosts their own social community. To enable transparent interoperability, users can easily migrate their accounts from one server provider to another. In this paper, we examine 8,745 users who switch their server instances in Mastodon. We use this as a case study to examine account portability behavior more broadly. We explore the factors that affect usersâ€™ decision to switch instances, as well as the impact of switching on their social media engagement and discussion topics. This leads us to build a classifier to show that switching is predictable, with an F1 score of 0.891. We argue that Mastodon serves as an early exemplar of a social media platform that advocates account interoperability and portability. We hope that this study can bring unique insights to a wider and open digital world in the future.
