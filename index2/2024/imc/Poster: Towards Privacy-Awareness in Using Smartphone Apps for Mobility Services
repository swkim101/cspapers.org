This poster presents the first steps towards a data-driven methodology to design material for raising awareness on personal data collection and use by smartphone apps for mobility services (e.g., trip planning). Through an online survey, we collected a sample of 300 responses from regular users of these apps in the Paris region, in France, who share their perspectives on privacy concerns and their need to be better informed.
