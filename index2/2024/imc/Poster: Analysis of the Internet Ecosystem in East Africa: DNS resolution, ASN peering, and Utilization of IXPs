Although the Internet ecosystem in East Africa has experienced significant growth as evidenced by the 115% increment in Internet users in Sub-Sharan Africa, we understand very little about the infrastructure's performance which is crucial, particularly in DNS resolution, ISP peering, and the use of IXPs. Previous studies highlighting the importance of IXPs and their positive impact on connectivity are qualitative with limited participants, limiting their completeness. To achieve a nuanced understanding of the East African Internet landscape, a more extensive and diverse sample size is needed, integrating both context from qualitative with the scale from quantitative methods. Additionally, prior studies focus on the period following the installation of submarine fiber-optic cables, which may not fully capture the current state of the Internet ecosystem. This study aims to use a mixed methods approach to provide a comprehensive assessment of the Internet infrastructure in East Africa.
