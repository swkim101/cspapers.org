Argumentation mining (AM) aims to detect the arguments and their inherent relations from ar-gumentative textual compositions. Prior meth-ods are afflicted by a sequential feature decoding paradigm, wherein they initially address the features of argumentation components (ACs) for argumentative relation type classification (ACTC) subtask. Then, these features are amal-gamated in pairs for argumentative relation identification (ARI) subtask. Finally, the AC pairs and ascertained pertinent relations are employed for argumentative relation type classification (ARTC) subtask. However, these meth-ods merely rely on a shared encoder to implicitly capture the interactions of the three sub-tasks, which cannot explicitly and comprehensively model the inter-relationship among sub-tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method PITA for PromptIng Task interAction to model the inter-relationships among the three subtasks within a generative framework. Specifically, we
