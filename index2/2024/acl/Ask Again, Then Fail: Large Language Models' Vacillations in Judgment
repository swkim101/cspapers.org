We observe that current large language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct. This wavering presents a signiﬁcant challenge for generating reliable responses and building user trust. To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a F OLLOW - UP Q UESTIONING M ECHANISM along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, conﬁrming its widespread presence in current large language models. Furthermore, to mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models, and develop a training-based framework U NWAVERING -FQ that teaches large language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental re-sults conﬁrm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of large language models.
