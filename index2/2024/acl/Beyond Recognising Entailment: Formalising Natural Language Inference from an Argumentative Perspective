In argumentation theory, argument schemes 001 provide a foundation that offers a character-002 isation of stereotypical patterns of inference. 003 There has been little work done in provid-004 ing computational approaches to identify these 005 schemes in natural language. Moreover, ad-006 vancements in recognizing textual entailment 007 lack a standardized definition, which makes 008 it challenging to compare methods trained on 009 different datasets. In this work, we propose a 010 rigorous approach to align entailment recog-011 nition with argumentation theory. Wagemansâ€™ 012 Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA), a taxon-013 omy of argument schemes, provides the ap-014 propriate framework to unify these two fields. 015 To operationalise the theoretical model, we in-016 troduce a tool to assist humans in annotating 017 arguments according to the PTA. Beyond pro-018 viding insights into non-expert annotator train-019 ing, we present Kialo-PTA24, the first multi-020 topic dataset for the PTA. We benchmark the 021 performance of pre-trained language models 022 on various aspects of argument analysis. Our 023 experiments show that the task of argument 024 canonicalisation poses a significant challenge 025 for state-of-the-art models, suggesting an in-026 ability to represent argumentative reasoning 027 and a direction for future investigation. 028
