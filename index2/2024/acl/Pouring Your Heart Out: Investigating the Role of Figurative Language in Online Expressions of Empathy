Empathy is a social mechanism used to support and strengthen emotional connection with others, including in online communities. However, little is currently known about the nature of these online expressions, nor the particular factors that may lead to their improved detection. In this work, we study the role of a specific and complex subcategory of linguistic phenomena, figurative language, in online expressions of empathy. Our extensive experiments reveal that incorporating features regarding the use of metaphor, idiom, and hyperbole into empathy detection models improves their performance, resulting in impressive maximum F 1 scores of 0.942 and 0.809 for identifying posts without and with empathy, respectively.
