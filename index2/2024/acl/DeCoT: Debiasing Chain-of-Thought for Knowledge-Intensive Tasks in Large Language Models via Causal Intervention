Large language models (LLMs) often require 001 task-relevant knowledge to augment their inter-002 nal knowledge through prompts. However, sim-003 ply injecting external knowledge into prompts 004 does not guarantee that LLMs can identify 005 and use relevant information in the prompts to 006 conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, especially 007 when the LLM’s internal knowledge is derived 008 from the biased information on the pretraining 009 data. In this paper, we propose a novel causal 010 view to formally explain the internal knowl-011 edge bias of LLMs via a Structural Causal 012 Model (SCM). We review the chain-of-thought 013 (CoT) prompting from a causal perspective, and 014 discover that the biased information from pre-015 trained models can impair LLMs’ reasoning 016 abilities. When the CoT reasoning paths are 017 misled by irrelevant information from prompts 018 and are logically incorrect, simply editing fac-019 tual information is insufficient to reach the cor-020 rect answer. To estimate the confounding effect 021 on CoT reasoning in LLMs, we use external 022 knowledge as an instrumental variable. We fur-023 ther introduce CoT as a mediator to conduct 024 front-door adjustment and generate logically 025 correct CoTs where the spurious correlation be-026 tween LLMs’ pretrained knowledge and task 027 queries is reduced. With extensive experiments, 028 we validate that our approach enables more 029 accurate CoT reasoning and enhances LLM 030 generation on knowledge-intensive tasks. 031
