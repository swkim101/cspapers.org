End-to-end speech translation (ST) presents no-001 table disambiguation challenges as it neces-002 sitates simultaneous cross-modal and cross-003 lingual transformations. While word sense dis-004 ambiguation is an extensively investigated topic 005 in textual machine translation, the exploration 006 of disambiguation strategies for ST models re-007 mains limited. Addressing this gap, this pa-008 per introduces the concept of speech sense dis-009 ambiguation (SSD), specifically emphasizing 010 homophones - words pronounced identically 011 but with different meanings. To facilitate this, 012 we first create a comprehensive homophone 013 dictionary and an annotated dataset rich with 014 homophone information established based on 015 speech-text alignment. Building on this unique 016 dictionary, we introduce AmbigST, an inno-017 vative homophone-aware contrastive learning 018 approach that integrates a homophone-aware 019 masking strategy. Our experiments on different 020 MuST-C and CoVoST ST benchmarks demon-021 strate that AmbigST sets new performance stan-022 dards. Specifically, it achieves SOTA results on 023 BLEU scores for English to German, Spanish, 024 and French ST tasks, underlining its effective-025 ness in reducing speech sense ambiguity. Data, 026 code, and scripts will be released. 027
