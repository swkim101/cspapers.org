Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to determine whether the author of a text is in favor, against, or neutral toward a target that is un-seen during training. In this paper, we present EZ-STANCE, a large E nglish Z SSD dataset with 47,316 annotated text-target pairs. In contrast to VAST (Allaway and McKeown, 2020), which is the only other large existing ZSSD dataset for English , EZ-STANCE is 2.5 times larger, includes both noun-phrase targets and claim targets that cover a wide range of domains, provides two challenging subtasks for ZSSD: target-based ZSSD and domain-based ZSSD, and contains much harder examples for the neutral class. We evaluate EZ-STANCE us-ing state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, we propose to transform ZSSD into the NLI task by applying simple yet effective prompts to noun-phrase targets. Our experimental results show that EZ-STANCE is a challenging new benchmark, which provides significant research opportunities on English ZSSD.
