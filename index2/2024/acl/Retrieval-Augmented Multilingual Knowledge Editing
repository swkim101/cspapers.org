Knowledge represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) is quite often incorrect and can also become obsolete over time. Updating knowledge via fine-tuning is computationally resource-hungry and not reliable, and so knowledge editing (KE) has developed as an effective and economical alternative to inject new knowledge or to fix factual errors in LLMs. Although there has been considerable interest in this area, current KE research exclusively focuses on the monolingual setting, typically in English. However, what happens if the new knowledge is supplied in one language, but we would like to query the LLM in a different language? To address the problem of multilingual knowledge editing, we propose Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE) to update new knowledge in LLMs. ReMaKE can perform model-agnostic knowledge editing in multilingual settings. ReMaKE concatenates the new knowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with prompts. Our experimental results show that ReMaKE outperforms baseline knowledge editing methods by a significant margin and is the first KE method to work in a multilingual setting. We provide our multilingual knowledge editing dataset (MzsRE) in 12 languages, which along with code, and additional project information is available at https://github.com/Vicky-Wil/ReMaKE.
