Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications. Recently, the utilization of Large Language Models (LLM) in TSF has demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, surpassing most task-specific forecasting models. The success of LLM-based forecasting methods underscores the importance of causal dependence modeling and pre-trained knowledge transfer. However, challenges persist in directly applying LLM to TSF, i.e., the unacceptable parameter scales for resource-intensive model optimization, and the significant gap of feature space between structural numerical time series and natural language. To this end, we propose LeRet, a Language-empowered Retentive network for TSF. Technically, inspired by the causal extraction in LLM, we propose a causal dependence learner, enhanced by a patch-level pre-training task, to capture sequential causal evolution. To minimize the gap between numeric and language, we initialize a language description protocol for time series and design a TS-related language knowledge extractor to learn from language description, avoiding training with large-scale parameters. Finally, we dedicatedly achieve a Language-TS Modality Integrator for the fusion of two types data, and enable language-empowered sequence forecasting. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our LeRet, especially reveal superiority on few-shot, and zero-shot forecasting tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/hqh0728/LeRet.
