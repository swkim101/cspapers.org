The field of social choice theory investigates how individual preferences are aggregated to reach collective decisions. While traditional social choice addresses problems such as choosing a winning candidate based on voter rankings or fairly allocating resources among individuals with the same entitlement, the wide range of decision-making scenarios in real-world applications calls for an extension beyond these basic frameworks. In this paper, I present an overview of my efforts to expand the reach of social choice theory in the domains of fair division, voting, and tournaments. Furthermore, I discuss avenues and challenges of bringing the developed theory closer to practice.
