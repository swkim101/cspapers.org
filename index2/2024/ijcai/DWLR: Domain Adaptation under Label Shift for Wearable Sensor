Wearable sensors play a crucial role in real-world scenarios, such as human activity recognition, sleep monitoring and electrocardiogram monitoring. However, deploying classifiers on them is challenged by distribution shifts across users and devices. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is proposed to address this, yet existing methods mostly focus on feature distribution shift, neglecting the potential misclassification due to label shift. In this paper, we propose Domain adaptation under label shift for Wearable sensor with Learnable Reweighting (DWLR) to handle both feature and label shifts. Specifically, DWLR employs learnable reweighting to align label distributions between source and target domains. It incorporates elements of information gain during the reweighting process to counter potential distribution shift that could emerge from over-reliance on data with high-confidence pseudo labels. Importantly, since wearable sensor data is time-series data, and can be subjected to distribution shifts originating from either the time domain, the frequency domain, or both, DWLR performs reweighting and alignment separately in these two domains to more robustly handle potential feature distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on three distinct wearable sensor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DWLR, yielding a remarkable average performance improvement of 5.85%.
