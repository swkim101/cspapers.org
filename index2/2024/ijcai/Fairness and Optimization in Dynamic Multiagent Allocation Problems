In many allocation problems, understanding individual agents' needs, wants, and tradeoffs is crucial for providing fair and efficient solutions. This paper begins with motivating applications and critical definitions. We review existing results, such as advising agents on relaxing restrictions for improved resource allocation, optimizing task allocation in online settings without rejection of a task, and more. We conclude by outlining three potential directions for future research.
