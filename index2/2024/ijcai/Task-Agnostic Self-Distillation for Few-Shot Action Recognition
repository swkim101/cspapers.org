Task-oriented matching is one of the core aspects of few-shot Action Recognition. Most previous works leverage the metric features within the support and query sets of individual tasks, without considering the metric information across different matching tasks. This oversight represents a significant limitation in this task. Specifically, the task-specific metric feature can decrease the generalization ability and ignore the general matching feature applicable across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-distillation framework for few-shot action recognition that learns the task-agnostic metric features and generalizes them to different tasks. First, to extract the task-agnostic metric information, we design a task-based self-distillation framework to learn the metric features from the training process progressively. Additionally, to enable the model with fine-grained matching capabilities, we design a multi-dimensional distillation module that extracts more detailed relations from the temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions within video pairs and improves the representative performance of metric features for each individual task. After that, the few-shot predictions can be obtained by feeding the embedded task-agnostic metric features to a common feature matcher. Extensive experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate our methodâ€™s superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
