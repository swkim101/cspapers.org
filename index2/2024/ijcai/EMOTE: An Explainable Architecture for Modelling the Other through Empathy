Empathy allows us to assume others are like us and have goals analogous to our own. This can also at times be applied to multi-agent games - e.g. Agent 1's attraction to green balls is analogous to Agent 2's attraction to red balls. 

Drawing inspiration from empathy, we propose EMOTE, a simple and explainable inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach designed to model another agent's action-value function and from it, infer a unique reward function. This is done by referencing the learning agent's own action value function, removing the need to maintain independent action-value estimates for the modelled agents whilst simultaneously addressing the ill-posed nature of IRL by inferring a unique reward function. We experiment on minigrid environments showing EMOTE: (a) produces more consistent reward estimates relative to other IRL baselines (b) is robust in scenarios with composite reward and action-value functions (c) produces human-interpretable states, helping to explain how the agent views other agents.
