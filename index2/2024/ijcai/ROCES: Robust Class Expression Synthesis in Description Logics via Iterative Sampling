We consider the problem of class expression learning using cardinality-minimal sets of examples. Recent class expression learning approaches employ deep neural networks and have demonstrated tremendous performance improvements in execution time and quality of the computed solutions. However, they lack generalization capabilities when it comes to the number of examples used in a learning problem, i.e., they often perform poorly on unseen learning problems where only a few examples are given. In this work, we propose a generalization of the classical class expression learning problem to address the limitations above. In short, our generalized learning problem (GLP) forces learning systems to solve the classical class expression learning problem using the smallest possible subsets of examples, thereby improving the learning systems' ability to solve unseen learning problems with arbitrary numbers of examples. Moreover, we develop ROCES, a learning algorithm for synthesis-based approaches to solve GLP. Experimental results suggest that post training, ROCES outperforms existing synthesis-based approaches on out-of-distribution learning problems while remaining highly competitive overall.
