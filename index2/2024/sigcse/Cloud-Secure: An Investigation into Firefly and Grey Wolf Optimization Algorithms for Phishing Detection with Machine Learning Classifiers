This paper delves into the exploration of Firefly and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithms, aiming to enhance phishing detection within the realm of cloud security. The primary focus lies in harnessing the potential of machine learning classifiers, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, and optimizing their functionality through the integration of Firefly and GWO algorithms. The research methodology spans various stages, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning model selection, integration of optimization algorithms, model parameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation. The incorporation of optimization algorithms is strategically employed to elevate feature selection and hyperparameter optimization, ultimately augmenting the classification accuracy of machine learning models. The overarching objective is to establish more resilient phishing detection systems capable of dynamically adapting to the ever-changing nature of phishing campaigns in cloud environments. The insights derived from this research have the potential to significantly contribute to the reinforcement of cloud security, safeguarding sensitive data and fortifying organizations against the pervasive threat of phishing attacks. This study not only sheds light on the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity but also underscores the synergy between machine learning and optimization nature-based algorithms, emerging as a robust defense against the continuously evolving cyber menace. The findings presented in this paper offer a substantial glimpse into the intricate domain of cloud security, where the fusion of machine learning and optimization algorithms stands as a potent force against emerging cyber threats.
