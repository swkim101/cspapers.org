Capstone or senior design courses are a key feature of most Computer Science programs as they provide students with authentic project experiences. Capstone courses usually focus on technical skill development, but we recognize that students will greatly benefit from developing communication skills. Within Computer Science, mastering such skills is essential for explaining and documenting system design, tackling development as a team, or leading large projects. Additionally, computer scientists need to be able to communicate their expertise to outside audiences such as funders, policymakers, customers, etc. However, studies have shown that students lack experience-based training to communicate functionally and practically. In this paper, we describe our experience with a targeted intervention within a capstone course in Computer Science. During the course, students complete a senior project while receiving training on team and project management, public speaking, and leadership. We evaluated the impact of the intervention on improving students' speaking skills and confidence by deploying surveys before and after the intervention. We observed a significant improvement in confidence and mastery of technical and non-technical oral communication skills. We also highlight how this training was particularly beneficial for underrepresented students within the discipline.
