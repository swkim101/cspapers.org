This study utilizes large language models to extract foundational programming concepts in programming assignments in a CS1 course. We seek to answer the following research questions: RQ1. How effectively can large language models identify knowledge components in a CS1 course from programming assignments? RQ2. Can large language models be used to extract program-level knowledge components, and how can the information be used to identify students' misconceptions? Preliminary results demonstrated a high similarity between course-level knowledge components retrieved from a large language model and that of an expert-generated list.
