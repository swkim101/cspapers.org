Generative AI has the potential to become disruptive technology for computer science education. Therefore, computer science educators must be familiar with the threats they should deal with and with the opportunities that generative-AI opens for the computer science education community. In the workshop, we explore the integration of several generative-AI tools and applications in computer science education. Activities include lesson design, code development, test design and assessment. We address the students' and the educators' perspectives. In addition, we explore computer science practices and soft skills to be applied with these tools as well as immediate and future applications and implications for computer science education and for the society. AT the end of the workshop, the participants will be able to use these generative AI tools in their daily educational computer science activities and beyond.
