Research suggests that despite the growing number of Black women who intend to major in computer science, adverse experiences in hostile computing degree programs contribute to their leaving the field as an act of resistance. The Black women who choose to persist utilize various mechanisms to help them navigate hostile environments within computing. One such mechanism is social capital where Black women leverage their social connections with others in the field of computing. As a part of a larger study that explores the role that social capital plays for Black women in computing, we used the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS) to ask 14 Black women in three virtual focus groups about the social influences that impact their ability to persist in computing. Results reveal that spirituality is a large part of persistence in computing. However, SCCBS privileges certain religious denominations as part of the narrative of what constitutes acceptable religious practices in the United States. Black women criticize the SCCBS as being non-inclusive of the Black experience in the U.S. Furthermore, Black women indicate that spirituality more so than religious affiliations provides strong social connections that affirm their sense of self while providing a community of support.
