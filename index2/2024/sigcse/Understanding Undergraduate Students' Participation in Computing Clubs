Employers in the tech industry have expectations for students' involvement outside of the classroom. One avenue where students engage with computing communities of practice is student organizations or clubs. Given the lack of empirical studies on students' involvement in clubs in computing, we designed a study that aims to understand computing undergraduate students' participation in clubs and to explore what students get out of their participation in these informal learning environments. We report findings from a multi-institutional survey-based study consisting of 673 undergraduate computing students from three universities in the United States. We found that 41% of the computing students across all years participate in at least one club related to their major. Forty-seven percent of female students participated in a club compared with thirty-eight percent of male students. Through inductive content analysis, we found that students participated in six types of clubs: computing areas, professional societies, affinity groups for underrepresented students, project-based development, Greek organizations, and other types of clubs. Overall, clubs allow students to explore computing areas, develop technical and professional skills, network with industry professionals, prepare for jobs, build a community, meet and socialize with like-minded peers, and gain motivation to sustain in computing. Our work provides empirical insights into computing students' club participation and insights to our community on the importance of types of clubs that can complement students' experiences in formal education supporting students' professional development.
