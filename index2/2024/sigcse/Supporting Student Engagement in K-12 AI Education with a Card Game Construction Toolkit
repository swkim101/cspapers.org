With the growing prevalence of AI, the need for K-12 AI education is becoming more crucial, which is prompting active research in developing engaging AI learning activities. In this paper, we present our work on a game construction toolkit for middle school students and educators that enables them to tailor an AI-focused unplugged card game activity. In our prior work, we designed, developed, and piloted an unplugged card game activity where players predict the identity of a person based on hand-drawn features extracted from a set of facial cards. The activity aims to teach AI concepts aligned with one of the big ideas in AI utilizing techniques from facial recognition. During our pilot testing of the activity, we discovered that creating face cards that capture students' interest is a crucial factor in promoting student engagement. As a result, we designed a card game construction toolkit that allows students and educators to craft their own face card decks using photos that are personally interesting to them, looking to foster engagement and improve replayability of the activity. The toolkit's design is focused on ensuring easy accessibility and features a simple web-based interface that allows users to download and print their customized cards. We expect this toolkit will enhance the usability and educational effectiveness of our unplugged K-12 AI education activity.
