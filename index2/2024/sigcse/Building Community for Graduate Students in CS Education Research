In this Birds of a Feather (BoF) session, we aim to foster a safe and open environment that allows CS education (CSEd) graduate students to share about their graduate experiences and learn from each other about graduate school, conducting research, and navigating the inherently multi-disciplinary space of CSEd. We have two main goals: (1) create specific networking opportunities between CSEd graduate students attending SIGCSE TS (hereafter just "SIGCSE") in order to foster a community of support, and (2) elicit discussions on the triumphs and tribulations that come as part of being a CSEd-focused graduate student. We plan for all attendees to leave our session with connections to fellow CSEd graduate students from other institutions (through email and a dedicated Slack) and a greater awareness of the community available to them within CS education research.
