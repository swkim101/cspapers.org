Lab assignments, in which students build and program robots to accomplish tasks in various environments, are a central component in many undergraduate robotics classes. Such activities require that students operationalize concepts learned in class. However, physical robots are prone to uncertain real-world behavior, making debugging challenging and causing many students to feel stressed about being graded based on their robot's performance. Therefore, we incorporated retakes into our undergraduate robotics class, allowing students to learn from their mistakes and master class content while improving their robots. Initial results show that students widely embrace retakes, use the opportunity to improve, and feel less stressed about the assignments.
