Have you had a college instructor who changed your academic path? Nearly everyone has. If you are an educator, you have the opportunity to impact your students' learning well beyond your course by helping them to build a more robust educational foundation that may be used as a platform for years to come. During this keynote, we will examine several highly impactful concepts that can make a real difference in a student's learning and life. These are concepts you can apply in your class to help students see the power of reflection, understand their strengths and challenges better, and guide them as they build skills that will help them explore areas they have yet to consider.
