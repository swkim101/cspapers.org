The persistent gender gap in technical fields, particularly in computer science (CS), remains a complex challenge. This paper draws upon recognized gender differences in aptitude, interest, and the educational environment. It builds upon established theoretical foundations, including Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory [9] and Eccles's Expectancy-Value Theory [3][2], to explore innovative strategies for engaging underrepresented groups, specifically female students, in CS. Central to our approach is an innovative curriculum that integrates the realms of math, computing, and music. Recognizing the intrinsic connection between music and mathematical patterns, our pedagogical model simplifies complex CS concepts, transforming topics like looping, algorithms, and conditional statements into engaging, relatable lessons. Additionally, our curriculum incorporates foundational elements of robotics, enhancing its practical applicability and real-world relevance. This groundbreaking educational paradigm not only simplifies technical concepts but also leverages students' innate passion for music, creating an intuitive and enjoyable learning environment. By blending artistic creativity with scientific precision, this approach sets a new standard for curriculum design and offers educators a pioneering roadmap to address the gender gap in CS. Our study aligns with SIGCSE's mission, marking a fresh, inclusive trajectory for the future of technology education.
