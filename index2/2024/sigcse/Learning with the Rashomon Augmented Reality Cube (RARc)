We attempted to address the challenge of effectively conveying the innovative literary device known as the Rashomon effect (tRe), using a digital tool. We opted for Augmented Reality (AR) in combination with MERGE cubes for this purpose. These cubes served as a practical medium for illustrating the complexities of tRe, a narrative technique renowned for its ability to offer multiple perspectives on a single event or storyline. This narrative device is known for its ability to create narrative uncertainty, withholding a clear and absolute truth, and instead exposing the readers to an assortment of interpretations. The Rashomon Augmented Reality Cube (RARc) was designed with two main goals in mind. Firstly, it was created to provide a vivid visual representation of the Rashomon effect. This not only makes storytelling engaging but also serves as a stepping stone for students to explore a variety of interpretations. Secondly, it was conceived as an educational tool for introducing students to key CT principles, such as abstraction, solution design, and computational innovations. By instilling these principles, students acquire problem-solving skills that are increasingly essential in our technology-driven world. This AR tool, known as the RARc, serves as a hands-on digital activity crafted for creative writers, with a particular focus on engaging female participants. It encourages them to unleash their creativity and explore the nuances of storytelling within an immersive and interactive learning experience. In this paper, we share development and implementation strategies that were utilized throughout the design of the RARc.
