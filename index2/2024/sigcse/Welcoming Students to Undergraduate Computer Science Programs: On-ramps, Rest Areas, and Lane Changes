Studying computer science is a journey: people start at different times, travel at different paces, and pause along the way. In this experience report, we describe a peer-led, year-long program designed to welcome students to Computer Science and Engineering as a discipline, department, and academic program. We detail the logistical, curricular, and personnel structures of this program, highlighting design choices we made to (a) open multiple ways to join the program all year, (b) de-emphasize "getting ahead", (c) prioritize reflection, and (d) connect students to existing resources. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of peer mentors in leading and shaping this space. We share our own lessons learned, as well as reflections from students and mentors on the value of this learning community outside of formal classroom structures.
