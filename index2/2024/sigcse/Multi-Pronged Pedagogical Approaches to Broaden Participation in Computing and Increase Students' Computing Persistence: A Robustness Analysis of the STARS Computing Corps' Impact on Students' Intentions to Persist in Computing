Multi-pronged programs that involve students in a combination of proven interventions (i.e., tutoring other students, building community, developing skills, etc.) constitute one pedagogical approach to increasing the number and diversity of computing professionals. In this manuscript, we evaluate the efficacy of one such multi-pronged program, the STARS Computing Corps, a Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance program funded by the National Science Foundation. These analyses improve upon previous efforts to assess the efficacy of STARS by examining dosage effects of the program, adding controls for students' initial intentions to pursue computing, and conducting these analyses at various points in a student's participation in STARS. We also conduct analyses to determine the efficacy of various STARS activities. Controlling for students' initial intentions to persist in computing, we find robust evidence that spending more time each week on STARS' activities positively predicts students' intentions to persist in a computing career, and that STARS has a heightened positive impact on Black and Hispanic students. We do not find evidence that the number of semesters a student spends in STARS is predictive of computing persistence, nor do we find differences in the efficacy of various STARS activities. In sum, these results suggest that STARS has a positive impact on students' intentions to persist in computing and that multi-pronged programs like STARS should focus on the intensity of participation (as opposed to the length of participation or a particular activity) to increase students' desire to persist in computing careers.
