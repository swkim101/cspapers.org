In this workshop National Science Foundation (NSF) program directors from two different directorates will share information about programs and funding opportunities focused on institutional and PI research capacity building. As is well known, NSF offers a wide variety of funding opportunities to promote discovery in science and engineering, accelerate technology and innovation, and advance diversity in science and engineering. This workshop aims to improve participants' knowledge about 1) capacity building programs in NSF, specifically in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Directorate for STEM Education (EDU) directorates, 2) writing competitive NSF proposals, and 3) designing effective project evaluation plans and budgets. The workshop will include a panel of successful principal investigators (PIs) who will share their insights on successful grant-writing and implementation. This workshop will provide an opportunity for the participants to engage with NSF program directors, an NSF evaluator, and successful PIs that could potentially help them identify appropriate funding opportunities and develop a strong NSF proposal. The workshop will include a mix of presentations, panel discussion, hands-on activities, and question and answer session.
