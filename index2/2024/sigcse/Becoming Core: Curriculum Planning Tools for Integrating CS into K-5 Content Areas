In the K-5 setting, introduction of computer science (CS) through integration with other content areas is a promising pathway to expand CS access in a manner which is meaningful, accessible, sustainable, and scalable. We have developed a suite of planning tools to support CS-novice elementary classroom teachers (N = 44) to develop CS-embedded units through iterative planning and feedback. A unit template, grounded in best practices like Universal Design for Learning and Understanding by Design, progresses through foci on CS Connections, Unpacking, Instructional Resources, Assessment, and Supports & Meaning to teach CS and another area side-by-side. A matched set of checklists prompt self-reflection while rubrics define high-quality attributes for use in self, peer, or expert feedback. Our experience using these tools has been positive; 100% of survey respondents agreed the tools were successful in supporting the design process (N = 19). Our experience with these tools has shown a proof-of-concept for elementary classroom teachers as designers of CS-embedded units. Grounded in and responsive to teachers' real-world target content area curriculum expectations, these units offer a path to institutionalizing CS.
