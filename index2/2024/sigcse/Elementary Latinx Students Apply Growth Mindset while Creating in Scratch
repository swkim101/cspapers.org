The Latinx population is underrepresented in secondary computer science (CS) courses as well as in the STEM workforce. By exposing Latinx students to positive coding experiences and encouraging a growth mindset earlier in school, Latinx participation in CS may likely increase. This poster presents the results of examining the reflections upper-elementary students recorded in their journals after completing a structured Scratch coding project. Students were prompted to share problems they faced, how they responded to those problems, and what they were proud of in their project.
