Teacher support is pivotal for promoting collaborative learning. Students often face challenges in self-regulating their learning within small group settings, especially when presented with open-ended learning opportunities. Analyzing 542 moments of support in small group work with the MOSAIC protocol during a unit on physical computing suggests a relationship between support type and activity design. Students showed more initiative in seeking support in more complex tasks. Teacher support focused on small groups rather than the entire class during complex or open-ended activities. Support focus on the direction of the task is the most common type across all activities. Support for collaboration was most frequent in the activity requiring students to coordinate knowledge developed individually. This analysis provides insights into potential areas for enhancing student support in a CS classroom, particularly for collaboration.
