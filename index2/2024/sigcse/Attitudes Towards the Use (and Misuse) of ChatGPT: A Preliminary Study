ChatGPT is the front end to a powerful large language model that has garnered widespread attention in many fields of study, including computer science (CS), where it promises to be transformational. As educators, we are just starting to grapple with the ramifications of this new technology, including implications for what we teach, how we teach, and how we grade. The decisions educators make moving forward depend heavily on the prevalence of students' use (and misuse) of ChatGPT in the classroom. Further, predictors of nefarious use could aid educators as well. We conducted an online survey to capture CS student awareness of, experience with, and attitudes toward ChatGPT. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that awareness of ChatGPT is generally high, and it is more frequently being used as a study tool than to complete students' work for them. Most students are aware of the potential for abuse in academic pursuits, but a notable minority of students admit to using it unscrupulously and to the potential for it to interfere with their learning. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider as educators modify their approaches and develop guidelines for ChatGPT usage in their classrooms.
