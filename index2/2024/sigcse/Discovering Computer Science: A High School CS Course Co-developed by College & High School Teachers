We present a new high school level computer science (CS) curriculum that is a key component of a comprehensive college/high school partnerships program supporting secondary CS education in New York State. The year-long curriculum offers a broad introduction to CS and is designed using best practices for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. It was collaboratively designed and implemented by a team of college CS faculty and high school CS teachers participating in a research-practice partnership. This year (AY2023-2024) the curriculum is being taught in 27 school districts representing high-needs, rural, and suburban communities. Preliminary analysis of student data is included.
