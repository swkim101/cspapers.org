Remarkable advancements in the recolorization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have simplified the process of modifying NeRF's color attributes. Yet, with the potential of NeRF to serve as shareable digital assets, there's a concern that malicious users might alter the color of NeRF models and falsely claim the recolorized version as their own. To safeguard against such breaches of ownership, enabling original NeRF creators to establish rights over recolorized NeRF is crucial. While approaches like CopyRNeRF have been introduced to embed binary messages into NeRF models as digital signatures for copyright protection, the process of recolorization can remove these binary messages. In our paper, we present GeometrySticker, a method for seamlessly integrating binary messages into the geometry components of radiance fields, akin to applying a sticker. GeometrySticker can embed binary messages into NeRF models while preserving the effectiveness of these messages against recolorization. Our comprehensive studies demonstrate that GeometrySticker is adaptable to prevalent NeRF architectures and maintains a commendable level of robustness against various distortions.
