The recent popular radiance field models, exemplified by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), Instant-NGP and 3D Gaussian Splatting, are designed to represent 3D content by that training models for each individual scene. This unique characteristic of scene representation and per-scene training distinguishes radiance field models from other neural models, because complex scenes necessitate models with higher representational capacity and vice versa. In this paper, we propose content-aware radiance fields, aligning the model complexity with the scene intricacies through Adversarial Content-Aware Quantization (A-CAQ). Specifically, we make the bitwidth of parameters differentiable and trainable, tailored to the unique characteristics of specific scenes and requirements. The proposed framework has been assessed on Instant-NGP, a well-known NeRF variant and evaluated using various datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a notable reduction in computational complexity, while preserving the requisite reconstruction and rendering quality, making it beneficial for practical deployment of radiance fields models.
