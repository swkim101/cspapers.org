We propose a dense image prediction out-of-distribution detection algorithm, called PixOOD, which does not require training on samples of anomalous data and is not designed for a specific application which avoids traditional training biases. In order to model the complex intra-class variability of the in-distribution data at the pixel level, we propose an online data condensation algorithm which is more robust than standard K-means and is easily trainable through SGD. We evaluate PixOOD on a wide range of problems. It achieved state-of-the-art results on four out of seven datasets, while being competitive on the rest.
