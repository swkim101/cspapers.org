We propose a novel and low-cost test-time adversarial defense by devising interpretability-guided neuron importance ranking methods to identify neurons important to the output classes. Our method is a training-free approach that can significantly improve the robustness-accuracy tradeoff while incurring minimal computational overhead. While being among the most efficient test-time defenses (4x faster), our method is also robust to a wide range of black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks that break previous test-time defenses. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-1k on the standard RobustBench benchmark (with average gains of 2.6%, 4.9%, and 2.8% respectively). We also show improvements (average 1.5%) over the state-of-the-art test-time defenses even under strong adaptive attacks.
