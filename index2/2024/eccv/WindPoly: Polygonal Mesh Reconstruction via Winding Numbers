Polygonal mesh reconstruction of a raw point cloud is a valuable topic in the field of computer graphics and 3D vision. Especially to 3D architectural models, polygonal mesh provides concise expressions for fundamental geometric structures while effectively reducing data volume. However, there are some limitations of traditional reconstruction methods: normal vector dependency, noisy points and defective parts sensitivity, and internal geometric structure lost, which reduce the practicality in real scene. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient polygonal mesh reconstruction method to address the issues in architectural point cloud reconstruction task. It is an iterative adaptation process to detect planar shapes from scattered points. The initial structural polygonal mesh can be established in the constructed convex polyhedral space without assistance of normal vectors. Then, we develop an efficient polygon-based winding number strategy to orient polygonal mesh with global consistency. The significant advantage of our method is to provide a structural reconstruction for architectural point clouds and avoid point-based normal vector analysis. It effectively improves the robustness to noisy points and defective parts. More geometric details can be preserved in the reconstructed polygonal mesh. Experimental results show that our method can reconstruct concise, oriented and faithfully polygonal mesh that are better than results of state-of-the-art methods.
