Recently, the growing capabilities of deep generative models have underscored their potential in enhancing image classification accuracy. However, existing methods often demand the generation of a disproportionately large number of images compared to the original dataset, while having only marginal improvements in accuracy. This computationally expensive and time-consuming process hampers the practicality of such approaches. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency of image generation by focusing on the specific needs and characteristics of the model. With a central tenet of active learning, our method, named ActGen, takes a training-aware approach to image generation. It aims to create images akin to the challenging or misclassified samples encountered by the current model and incorporates these generated images into the training set to augment model performance. ActGen introduces an attentive image guidance technique, using real images as guides during the denoising process of a diffusion model. The model's attention on class prompt is leveraged to ensure the preservation of similar foreground object while diversifying the background. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance method, which employs two losses to generate more challenging samples and prevent the generated images from being too similar to previously generated ones. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance with a significantly reduced number of generated images.
