Human pose estimation (HPE) from Radio Frequency vision (RF-vision) performs human sensing using RF signals that penetrate obstacles without revealing privacy (e.g., facial information). Recently, mmWave radar has emerged as a promising RF-vision sensor, providing radar point clouds by processing RF signals. However, the mmWave radar has a limited resolution with severe noise, leading to inaccurate and inconsistent human pose estimation. This work proposes mmDiff, a novel diffusion-based pose estimator tailored for noisy radar data. Our approach aims to provide reliable guidance as conditions to diffusion models. Two key challenges are addressed by mmDiff: (1) miss-detection of parts of human bodies, which is addressed by a module that isolates feature extraction from different body parts, and (2) signal inconsistency due to environmental interference, which is tackled by incorporating prior knowledge of body structure and motion. Several modules are designed to achieve these goals, whose features work as the conditions for the subsequent diffusion model, eliminating the miss-detection and instability of HPE based on RF-vision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmDiff outperforms existing methods significantly, achieving state-of-the-art performances on public datasets.
