Computer vision has long relied on two kinds of correspondences: pixel correspondences in images and 3D correspondences on object surfaces. Is there another kind, and if there is, what can they do for us? In this paper, we introduce correspondences of the third kind we call reflection correspondences and show that they can help estimate camera pose by just looking at objects without relying on the background. Reflection correspondences are point correspondences in the reflected world, i.e., the scene reflected by the object surface. The object geometry and reflectance alters the scene geometrically and radiometrically, respectively, causing incorrect pixel correspondences. Geometry recovered from each image is also hampered by distortions, namely generalized bas-relief ambiguity, leading to erroneous 3D correspondences. We show that reflection correspondences can resolve the ambiguities arising from these distortions. We introduce a neural correspondence estimator and a RANSAC algorithm that fully leverages all three kinds of correspondences for robust and accurate joint camera pose and object shape estimation just from the object appearance. The method expands the horizon of numerous downstream tasks, including camera pose estimation for appearance modeling (e.g., NeRF) and motion estimation of reflective objects (e.g., cars on the road), to name a few, as it relieves the requirement of overlapping background.
