In the past few years, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have achieved tremendous success in various fields. Naturally, how to transfer the rich knowledge in such huge pre-trained models to downstream tasks and datasets becomes a hot topic. During downstream adaptation, the most challenging problems are overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, which can cause the model to overly focus on the current data and lose more crucial domain-general knowledge. Existing works use classic regularization techniques to solve the problems. As solutions become increasingly complex, the ever-growing storage and inference costs are also a significant problem that urgently needs to be addressed. While in this paper, we start from an observation that proper random noise can suppress overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Then we regard quantization error as a kind of noise, and explore quantization for regularizing vision-language model, which is quite efficiency and effective. Furthermore, to improve the model's generalization capability while maintaining its specialization capacity at minimal cost, we deeply analyze the characteristics of the weight distribution in prompts, conclude several principles for quantization module design and follow such principles to create several competitive baselines. The proposed method is significantly efficient due to its inherent lightweight nature, making it possible to adapt on extremely resource-limited devices. Our method can be fruitfully integrated into many existing approaches like MaPLe, enhancing accuracy while reducing storage overhead, making it more powerful yet versatile. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets shows great superiority of our method sufficiently. Code is available at https://github.com/beyondhtx/QPrompt.
