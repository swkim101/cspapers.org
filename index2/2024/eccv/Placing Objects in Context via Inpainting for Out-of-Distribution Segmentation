When deploying a semantic segmentation model into the real world, it will inevitably encounter semantic classes that were not seen during training. To ensure a safe deployment of such systems, it is crucial to accurately evaluate and improve their anomaly segmentation capabilities. However, acquiring and labelling semantic segmentation data is expensive and unanticipated conditions are long-tail and potentially hazardous. Indeed, existing anomaly segmentation datasets capture a limited number of anomalies, lack realism or have strong domain shifts. In this paper, we propose the Placing Objects in Context (POC) pipeline to realistically add any object into any image via diffusion models. POC can be used to easily extend any dataset with an arbitrary number of objects. In our experiments, we present different anomaly segmentation datasets based on POC-generated data and show that POC can improve the performance of recent state-of-the-art anomaly fine-tuning methods across several standardized benchmarks. POC is also effective for learning new classes. For example, we utilize it to augment Cityscapes samples by incorporating a subset of Pascal classes and demonstrate that models trained on such data achieve comparable performance to the Pascal-trained baseline. This corroborates the low synth2real gap of models trained on POC-generated images. Code: https://github.com/naver/poc
