Existing camouflaged object detection~(COD) methods depend heavily on large-scale pixel-level annotations.However, acquiring such annotations is laborious due to the inherent camouflage characteristics of the objects.Semi-supervised learning offers a promising solution to this challenge.Yet, its application in COD is hindered by significant pseudo-label noise, both pixel-level and instance-level.We introduce CamoTeacher, a novel semi-supervised COD framework, utilizing Dual-Rotation Consistency Learning~(DRCL) to effectively address these noise issues.Specifically, DRCL minimizes pseudo-label noise by leveraging rotation views' consistency in pixel-level and instance-level.First, it employs Pixel-wise Consistency Learning~(PCL) to deal with pixel-level noise by reweighting the different parts within the pseudo-label.Second, Instance-wise Consistency Learning~(ICL) is used to adjust weights for pseudo-labels, which handles instance-level noise.Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CamoTeacher not only achieves state-of-the-art compared with semi-supervised learning methods, but also rivals established fully-supervised learning methods.Our code will be available soon.
