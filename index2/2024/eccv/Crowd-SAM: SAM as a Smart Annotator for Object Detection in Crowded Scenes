In computer vision, object detection is an important task that finds its application in many scenarios. However, obtaining extensive labels can be challenging, especially in crowded scenes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed as a powerful zero-shot segmenter, offering a novel approach to instance segmentation tasks. However, the accuracy and efficiency of SAM and its variants are often compromised when handling objects in crowded and occluded scenes. In this paper, we introduce Crowd-SAM, a SAM-based framework designed to enhance SAM's performance in crowded and occluded scenes with the cost of few learnable parameters and minimal labeled images. We introduce an efficient prompt sampler (EPS) and a part-whole discrimination network (PWD-Net), enhancing mask selection and accuracy in crowded scenes. Despite its simplicity, Crowd-SAM rivals state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised object detection methods on several benchmarks including CrowdHuman and CityPersons.
