Wide-angle lens distortion in portrait photography presents a significant challenge for capturing photo-realistic and aesthetically pleasing images. Such distortions are especially noticeable in facial regions. In this work, we propose encapsulating the generative face prior as a guided natural manifold to facilitate the correction of facial regions. Moreover, a notable central symmetry relationship exists in the non-face background, yet it has not been explored in the correction process. This geometry prior motivates us to introduce a novel constraint to explicitly enforce symmetry throughout the correction process, thereby contributing to a more visually appealing and natural correction in the non-face region. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin, excelling not only in quantitative measures such as line straightness and shape consistency metrics but also in terms of perceptual visual quality.
