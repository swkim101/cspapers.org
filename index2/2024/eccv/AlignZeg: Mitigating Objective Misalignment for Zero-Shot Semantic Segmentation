A serious issue that harms the performance of zero-shot visual recognition is named objective misalignment, i.e., the learning objective prioritizes improving the recognition accuracy of seen classes rather than unseen classes, while the latter is the true target to pursue. This issue becomes more significant in zero-shot image segmentation because the stronger (i.e., pixel-level) supervision brings a larger gap between seen and unseen classes. To mitigate it, we propose a novel architecture named AlignZeg, which embodies a comprehensive improvement of the segmentation pipeline, including proposal extraction, classification, and correction, to better fit the goal of zero-shot segmentation. (1) Mutually-Refined Proposal Extraction. AlignZeg harnesses a mutual interaction between mask queries and visual features, facilitating detailed class-agnostic mask proposal extraction. (2) Generalization-Enhanced Proposal Classification. AlignZeg introduces synthetic data and incorporates multiple background prototypes to allocate a more generalizable feature space. (3) Predictive Bias Correction. During the inference stage, AlignZeg uses a class indicator to find potential unseen class proposals followed by a prediction postprocess to correct the prediction bias. Experiments demonstrate that AlignZeg markedly enhances zero-shot semantic segmentation, as shown by an average 3.8% increase in hIoU, primarily attributed to a 7.1% improvement in identifying unseen classes, and we further validate that the improvement comes from alleviating the objective misalignment issue.
