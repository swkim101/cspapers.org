In this work, we describe a method for large-scale 3D cell-tracking through a segmentation selection approach. The proposed method is effective at tracking cells across large microscopy datasets on two fronts: (i) It can solve problems containing millions of segmentation instances in terabyte-scale 3D+t datasets; (ii) It achieves competitive results with or without deep learning, which requires 3D annotated data, that is scarce in the fluorescence microscopy field. The proposed method computes cell tracks and segments using a hierarchy of segmentation hypotheses and selects disjoint segments by maximizing the overlap between adjacent frames. We show that this method achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D images from the cell tracking challenge and has a faster integer linear programming formulation. Moreover, our framework is flexible and supports segmentations from off-the-shelf cell segmentation models and can combine them into an ensemble that improves tracking.
