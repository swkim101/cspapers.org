The rapid growth of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering, enabling real-time production of high-quality renderings. However, the previous 3DGS-based methods have limitations in urban scenes due to reliance on initial Structure-from-Motion(SfM) points and difficulties in rendering distant, sky and low-texture areas. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid optimization method named HO-Gaussian, which combines a grid-based volume with the 3DGS pipeline. HO-Gaussian eliminates the dependency on SfM point initialization, allowing for rendering of urban scenes, and incorporates the Point Densitification to enhance rendering quality in problematic regions during training. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian Direction Encoding as an alternative for spherical harmonics in the rendering pipeline, which enables view-dependent color representation. To account for multi-camera systems, we introduce neural warping to enhance object consistency across different cameras. Experimental results on widely used autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that HO-Gaussian achieves photo-realistic rendering in real-time on multi-camera urban datasets.
