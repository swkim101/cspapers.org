Knowledge distillation is an effective method for training lightweight vision models. However, acquiring teacher supervision for training samples is often costly, especially from large-scale models like vision transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we develop a simple framework to reduce the supervision cost of ViT distillation: masking out a fraction of input tokens given to the teacher. By masking input tokens, one can skip the computations associated with the masked tokens without requiring any change to teacher parameters or architecture. We find that masking patches with the lowest student attention scores is highly effective, saving up to 50% of teacher FLOPs without any drop in student accuracy, while other masking criterion leads to suboptimal efficiency gains. Through in-depth analyses, we reveal that the student-guided masking provides a good curriculum to the student, making teacher supervision easier to follow during the early stage and challenging in the later stage.
