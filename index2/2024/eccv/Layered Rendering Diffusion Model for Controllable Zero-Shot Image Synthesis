This paper introduces innovative solutions to enhance spatial controllability in diffusion models reliant on text queries. We first introduce vision guidance as a foundational spatial cue within the perturbed distribution. This significantly refines the search space in a zero-shot paradigm to focus on the image sampling process adhering to the spatial layout conditions. To precisely control the spatial layouts of multiple visual concepts with the employment of vision guidance, we propose a universal framework, Layered Rendering Diffusion (LRDiff), which constructs an image-rendering process with multiple layers, each of which applies the vision guidance to instructively estimate the denoising direction for a single object. Such a layered rendering strategy effectively prevents issues like unintended conceptual blending or mismatches while allowing for more coherent and contextually accurate image synthesis. The proposed method offers a more efficient and accurate means of synthesising images that align with specific layout and contextual requirements. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in two specific layout-to-image tasks: bounding box-to-image and instance maskto-image. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to enable spatially controllable editing
