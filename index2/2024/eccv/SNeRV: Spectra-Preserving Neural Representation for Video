Neural representation for video (NeRV), which employs a neural network to parameterize video signals, introduces a novel methodology in video representations. However, existing NeRV-based methods have difficulty in capturing fine spatial details and motion patterns due to spectral bias, in which a neural network learns high-frequency (HF) components at a slower rate than low-frequency (LF) components. In this paper, we propose spectra-preserving NeRV (SNeRV) as a novel approach to enhance implicit video representations by efficiently handling various frequency components. SNeRV uses 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose video into LF and HF features, preserving spatial structures and directly addressing the spectral bias issue. To balance the compactness, we encode only the LF components, while HF components that include fine textures are generated by a decoder. Specialized modules, including a multi-resolution fusion unit (MFU) and a high-frequency restorer (HFR), are integrated into a backbone to facilitate the representation. Furthermore, we extend SNeRV to effectively capture temporal correlations between adjacent video frames, by casting the extension as additional frequency decomposition to a temporal domain. This approach allows us to embed spatio-temporal LF features into the network, using temporally extended up-sampling blocks (TUBs). Experimental results demonstrate that SNeRV outperforms existing NeRV models in capturing fine details and achieves enhanced reconstruction, making it a promising approach in the field of implicit video representations.
