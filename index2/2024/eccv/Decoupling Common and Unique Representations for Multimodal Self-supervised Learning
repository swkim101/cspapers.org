The increasing availability of multi-sensor data sparks wide interest in multimodal self-supervised learning. However, most existing approaches learn only common representations across modalities while ignoring intra-modal training and modality-unique representations. We propose Decoupling Common and Unique Representations (DeCUR), a simple yet effective method for multimodal self-supervised learning. By distinguishing inter- and intra-modal embeddings through multimodal redundancy reduction, DeCUR can integrate complementary information across different modalities. We evaluate DeCUR in three common multimodal scenarios (radar-optical, RGB-elevation, and RGB-depth), and demonstrate its consistent improvement regardless of architectures and for both multimodal and modality-missing settings. With thorough experiments and comprehensive analysis, we hope this work can provide valuable insights and raise more interest in researching the hidden relationships of multimodal representations.
