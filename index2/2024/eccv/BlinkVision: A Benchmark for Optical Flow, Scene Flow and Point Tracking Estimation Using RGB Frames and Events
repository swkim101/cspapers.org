Recent advances in event-based vision suggest that these systems complement traditional cameras by providing continuous observation without frame rate limitations and a high dynamic range, making them well-suited for correspondence tasks such as optical flow and point tracking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for correspondence tasks that include both event data and images. To address this gap, we propose BlinkVision, a large-scale and diverse benchmark with multiple modalities and dense correspondence annotations. BlinkVision offers several valuable features: 1) Rich modalities: It includes both event data and RGB images. 2) Extensive annotations: It provides dense per-pixel annotations covering optical flow, scene flow, and point tracking. 3) Large vocabulary: It contains 410 everyday categories, sharing common classes with popular 2D and 3D datasets like LVIS and ShapeNet. 4) Naturalistic: It delivers photorealistic data and covers various naturalistic factors, such as camera shake and deformation. BlinkVision enables extensive benchmarks on three types of correspondence tasks (optical flow, point tracking, and scene flow estimation) for both image-based and event-based methods, offering new observations, practices, and insights for future research.
