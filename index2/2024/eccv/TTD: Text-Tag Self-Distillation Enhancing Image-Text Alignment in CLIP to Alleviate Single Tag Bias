We identify a critical bias in contemporary CLIP-based models, which we denote as single tag bias. This bias manifests as a disproportionate focus on a singular tag (word) while neglecting other pertinent tags, stemming from CLIP's text embeddings that prioritize one specific tag in image-text relationships. When deconstructing text into individual tags, only one tag tends to have high relevancy with CLIP's image embedding, leading to biased tag relevancy. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-step fine-tuning approach, Text-Tag Self-Distillation (TTD), to address this challenge. TTD first extracts image-relevant tags from text based on their similarity to the nearest pixels then employs a self-distillation strategy to align combined masks with the text-derived mask. This approach ensures the unbiased image-text alignment of the CLIP-based models using only image-text pairs without necessitating additional supervision. Our technique demonstrates model-agnostic improvements in multi-tag classification and segmentation tasks, surpassing competing methods that rely on external resources.
