To enhance perception performance in complex and extensive scenarios within the realm of autonomous driving, there has been a noteworthy focus on temporal modeling, with a particular emphasis on streaming methods. The prevailing trend in streaming models involves the utilization of stream queries for the propagation of temporal information. Despite the prevalence of this approach, the direct application of the streaming paradigm to the construction of vectorized high-definition maps (HD-maps) fails to fully harness the inherent potential of temporal information. This paper introduces the Stream Query Denoising (SQD) strategy as a novel approach for temporal modeling in high-definition map (HD-map) construction. SQD is designed to facilitate the learning of temporal consistency among map elements within the streaming model. The methodology involves denoising the queries that have been perturbed by the addition of noise to the ground-truth information from the preceding frame. This denoising process aims to reconstruct the ground-truth information for the current frame, thereby simulating the prediction process inherent in stream queries. The SQD strategy can be applied to those streaming methods (e.g., StreamMapNet) to enhance the temporal modeling. The proposed SQD-MapNet is the StreamMapNet equipped with SQD. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 show that our method is remarkably superior to other existing methods across all settings of close range and long range. The code will be available soon.
