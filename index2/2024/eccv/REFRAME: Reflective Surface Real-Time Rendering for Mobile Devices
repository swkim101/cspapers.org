This work tackles the challenging task of achieving real-time novel view synthesis for reflective surfaces across various scenes. Existing real-time rendering methods, especially those based on meshes, often have subpar performance in modeling surfaces with rich view-dependent appearances. Our key idea lies in leveraging meshes for rendering acceleration while incorporating a novel approach to parameterize view-dependent information. We decompose the color into diffuse and specular, and model the specular color in the reflected direction based on a neural environment map. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable reconstruction quality for highly reflective surfaces compared to state-of-the-art offline methods, while also efficiently enabling real-time rendering on edge devices such as smartphones.
