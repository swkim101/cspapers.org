Images tell stories, trigger emotions, and let us recall memories -- they make us think. Thus, they have the ability to attract and hold one's attention, which is the definition of being"interesting". Yet, the appeal of an image is highly subjective. Looking at the image of my son taking his first steps will always bring me back to this emotional moment, while it is just a blurry, quickly taken snapshot to most others. Preferences vary widely: some adore cats, others are dog enthusiasts, and a third group may not be fond of either. We argue that every image can be interesting to a particular observer under certain circumstances. This work particularly emphasizes subjective preferences. However, our analysis of 2.5k image collections from diverse users of the photo-sharing platform Flickr reveals that specific image characteristics make them commonly more interesting. For instance, images, including professionally taken landscapes, appeal broadly due to their aesthetic qualities. In contrast, subjectively interesting images, such as those depicting personal or niche community events, resonate on a more individual level, often evoking personal memories and emotions.
