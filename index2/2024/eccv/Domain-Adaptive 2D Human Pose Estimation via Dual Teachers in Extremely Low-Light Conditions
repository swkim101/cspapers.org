Existing 2D human pose estimation research predominantly concentrates on well-lit scenarios, with limited exploration of poor lighting conditions, which are a prevalent aspect of daily life. Recent studies on low-light pose estimation require the use of paired well-lit and low-light images with ground truths for training, which are impractical due to the inherent challenges associated with annotation on low-light images. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that eliminates the need for low-light ground truths. Our primary novelty lies in leveraging two complementary-teacher networks to generate more reliable pseudo labels, enabling our model achieves competitive performance on extremely low-light images without the need for training with low-light ground truths. Our framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, our model is trained on well-lit data with low-light augmentations. In the second stage, we propose a dual-teacher framework to utilize the unlabeled low-light data, where a center-based main teacher produces the pseudo labels for relatively visible cases, while a keypoints-based complementary teacher focuses on producing the pseudo labels for the missed persons of the main teacher. With the pseudo labels from both teachers, we propose a person-specific low-light augmentation to challenge a student model in training to outperform the teachers. Experimental results on real low-light dataset (ExLPose-OCN) show, our method achieves 6.8% (2.4 AP) improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, despite no low-light ground-truth data is used in our approach, in contrast to the SOTA method.
