Learning rotation-invariant distinctive features is a fundamental requirement for point cloud registration. Existing methods often use rotation-sensitive networks to extract features, while employing rotation augmentation to learn an approximate invariant mapping rudely. This makes networks fragile to rotations, overweight, and hinders the distinctiveness of features. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel position-aware rotation-equivariant network, for efficient, light-weighted, and robust registration. The network can provide a strong model inductive bias to learn rotation-equivariant/invariant features, thus addressing the aforementioned limitations. To further improve the distinctiveness of descriptors, we propose a position-aware convolution, which can better learn spatial information of local structures. Moreover, we also propose a feature-based hypothesis proposer. It leverages rotation-equivariant features that encode fine-grained structure orientations to generate reliable model hypotheses. Each correspondence can generate a hypothesis, thus it is more efficient than classic estimators that require multiple reliable correspondences. Accordingly, a contrastive rotation loss is presented to enhance the robustness of rotation-equivariant features against data degradation. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods in terms of registration recall while being lightweight and keeping a fast speed. Moreover, experiments on rotated datasets demonstrate its robustness against rotation variations. Code is available at https://github.com/yaorz97/PARENet.
