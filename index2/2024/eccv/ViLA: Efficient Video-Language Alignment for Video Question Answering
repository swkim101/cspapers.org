In this work, we propose an efficient Video-Language Alignment (ViLA) network. Our ViLA model addresses both efficient frame sampling and effective cross-modal alignment in a unified way. In our ViLA network, we design a new learnable text-guided Frame-Prompter together with a new cross-modal distillation (QFormer-Distiller) module. Pre-trained large image-language models have shown promising results on problems such as visual question answering (VQA). However, how to efficiently and effectively sample video frames when adapting pre-trained large image-language model to video-language alignment is still the major challenge. Compared with prior work, our ViLA model demonstrates the capability of selecting key frames with critical contents, thus improving the video-language alignment accuracy while reducing the inference latency +3.3% on NExT-QA Temporal with 3.0X speed up). Overall, our ViLA network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the video question-answering benchmarks: +4.6% on STAR Interaction, +2.2% on STAR average with 3.0X speed up, ours 2-frames out-perform SeViLA 4-frames on the VLEP dataset with 4.2X speed-up.
