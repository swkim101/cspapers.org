Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging field. It automates the design and training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) when data cannot be centralized due to privacy, communication costs, or regulatory restrictions. Recent federated NAS methods not only reduce manual effort but also help achieve higher accuracy than traditional FL methods like FedAvg. Despite the success, existing federated NAS methods still fall short in satisfying diverse deployment targets common in on-device inference like hardware, latency budgets, or variable battery levels. Most federated NAS methods search for only a limited range of neuro-architectural patterns, repeat them in a DNN, thereby restricting achievable performance. Moreover, these methods incur prohibitive training costs to satisfy deployment targets. They perform the training and search of DNN architectures repeatedly for each case. SuperFedNAS addresses these challenges by decoupling the training and search in federated NAS. SuperFedNAS co-trains a large number of diverse DNN architectures contained inside one supernet in the FL setting. Post-training, clients perform NAS locally to find specialized DNNs by extracting different parts of the trained supernet with no additional training. SuperFedNAS takes O(1) (instead of O(N)) cost to find specialized DNN architectures in FL for any N deployment targets. As part of SuperFedNAS, we introduce MaxNet - a novel FL training algorithm that performs multi-objective federated optimization of a large number of DNN architectures ($\approx 5*10^8$) under different client data distributions. Overall, SuperFedNAS achieves upto 37.7% higher accuracy for the same MACs or upto 8.13x reduction in MACs for the same accuracy than existing federated NAS methods.
