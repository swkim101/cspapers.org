Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has gathered notable interest since it can liberate training from dependency on depth annotations. In monocular video training case, recent methods only conduct view synthesis between existing camera views, leading to insufficient guidance. To tackle this, we try to synthesize more virtual camera views by flow-based video frame interpolation (VFI), termed as temporal augmentation. For multi-frame inference, to sidestep the problem of dynamic objects encountered by explicit geometry-based methods like ManyDepth, we return to the feature fusion paradigm and design a VFI-assisted multi-frame fusion module to align and aggregate multi-frame features, using motion and occlusion information obtained by the flow-based VFI model. Finally, we construct a unified self-supervised learning framework, named Mono-ViFI, to bilaterally connect single- and multi-frame depth. In this framework, spatial data augmentation through image affine transformation is incorporated for data diversity, along with a triplet depth consistency loss for regularization. The single- and multi-frame models can share weights, making our framework compact and memory-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can bring significant improvements to current advanced architectures. Source code is available at https://github.com/LiuJF1226/Mono-ViFI.
