In the current state of 3D object detection research, the severe scarcity of annotated 3D data, substantial disparities across different data modalities, and the absence of a unified architecture, have impeded the progress towards the goal of universality. In this paper, we propose \textbf{OV-Uni3DETR}, a unified open-vocabulary 3D detector via cycle-modality propagation. Compared with existing 3D detectors, OV-Uni3DETR offers distinct advantages: 1) Open-vocabulary 3D detection: During training, it leverages various accessible data, especially extensive 2D detection images, to boost training diversity. During inference, it can detect both seen and unseen classes. 2) Modality unifying: It seamlessly accommodates input data from any given modality, effectively addressing scenarios involving disparate modalities or missing sensor information, thereby supporting test-time modality switching. 3) Scene unifying: It provides a unified multi-modal model architecture for diverse scenes collected by distinct sensors. Specifically, we propose the cycle-modality propagation, aimed at propagating knowledge bridging 2D and 3D modalities, to support the aforementioned functionalities. 2D semantic knowledge from large-vocabulary learning guides novel class discovery in the 3D domain, and 3D geometric knowledge provides localization supervision for 2D detection images. OV-Uni3DETR achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various scenarios, surpassing existing methods by more than 6\% on average. Its performance using only RGB images is on par with or even surpasses that of previous point cloud based methods. Code and pre-trained models will be released later.
