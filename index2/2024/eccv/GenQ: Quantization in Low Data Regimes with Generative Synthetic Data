In the realm of deep neural network deployment, low-bit quantization presents a promising avenue for enhancing computational efficiency. However, it often hinges on the availability of training data to mitigate quantization errors, a significant challenge when data availability is scarce or restricted due to privacy or copyright concerns. Addressing this, we introduce GenQ, a novel approach employing an advanced Generative AI model to generate photorealistic, high-resolution synthetic data, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that struggle to accurately mimic complex objects in extensive datasets like ImageNet. Our methodology is underscored by two robust filtering mechanisms designed to ensure the synthetic data closely aligns with the intrinsic characteristics of the actual training data. In case of limited data availability, the actual data is used to guide the synthetic data generation process, enhancing fidelity through the inversion of learnable token embeddings. Through rigorous experimentation, GenQ establishes new benchmarks in data-free and data-scarce quantization, significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency, thereby setting a new standard for quantization in low data regimes.
