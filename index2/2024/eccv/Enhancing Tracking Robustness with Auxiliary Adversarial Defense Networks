Adversarial attacks in visual object tracking have significantly degraded the performance of advanced trackers by introducing imperceptible perturbations into images. However, there is still a lack of research on designing adversarial defense methods for object tracking. To address these issues, we propose an effective auxiliary pre-processing defense network, AADN, which performs defensive transformations on the input images before feeding them into the tracker. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with other visual trackers as a plug-and-play module without parameter adjustments. We train AADN using adversarial training, specifically employing Dua-Loss to generate adversarial samples that simultaneously attack the classification and regression branches of the tracker. Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB100, LaSOT, and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that AADN maintains excellent defense robustness against adversarial attack methods in both adaptive and non-adaptive attack scenarios. Moreover, when transferring the defense network to heterogeneous trackers, it exhibits reliable transferability. Finally, AADN achieves a processing time of up to 5ms/frame, allowing seamless integration with existing high-speed trackers without introducing significant computational overhead.
