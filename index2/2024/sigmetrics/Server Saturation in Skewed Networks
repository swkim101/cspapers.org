We use bipartite graphs to model compatibility constraints that arise between tasks and servers in data centers, cloud computing systems and content delivery networks. We prove that servers with skewed graph neighborhoods saturate with tasks in a limiting regime. The neighborhood of a server is skewed if it contains a diverging number of dispatchers with uniformly bounded degrees.
