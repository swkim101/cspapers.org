The widespread use of the Domain Name System (DNS) as a namespace for websites, email addresses, and other applications has led to proposals for integrating domain names into additional applications. An important quality for DNS integrations is synchronization, i.e., there is evidence that a current registrant of a domain name associated with the integration has chosen to participate in the integration. Failure to maintain synchronization may result in avoidable risks to users, however no study has detailed the scope of synchronization concerns across DNS integrations. To that end, this paper presents preliminary results from three novel DNS integrations that show between 1% and 40% of integrated domain name are not clearly synchronized and as such further study is merited to understand the risks and solutions that may be available. Furthermore, feedback on an IETF draft is proposed as one avenue through which researchers could provide input to address this problem space.
