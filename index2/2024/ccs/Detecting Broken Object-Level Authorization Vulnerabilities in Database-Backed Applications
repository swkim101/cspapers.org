Broken object-level authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities are among the most critical security risks facing database-backed applications. However, there is still a significant gap in our systematic understanding of these vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we conducted an in-depth study of 101 real-world BOLA vulnerabilities from opensource applications. Our study revealed the four most common object-level authorization models in database-backed application. The insights gained from our study inspired the development of a new tool called BolaRay. This tool employs a combination of SQL and static analysis to automatically infer the distinct types of object-level authorization models, and subsequently verify whether existing implementations enforce appropriate checks for these models. We evaluated BolaRay using 25 popular database-backed applications, which led to the identification of 193 true vulnerabilities, including 178 vulnerabilities that have never been reported before, at a false positive rate of 21.86%. We reported all newly identified vulnerabilities to the corresponding maintainers. To date, 155 vulnerabilities have been confirmed, with 52 CVE IDs granted.
