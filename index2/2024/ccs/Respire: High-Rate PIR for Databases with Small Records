Private information retrieval (PIR) is a key building block in many privacy-preserving systems, and recent works have made significant progress on reducing the concrete computational costs of single-server PIR. However, existing constructions have high communication overhead, especially for databases with small records. In this work, we introduce Respire, a lattice-based PIR scheme tailored for databases of small records. To retrieve a single record from a database with over a million 256-byte records, the Respire protocol requires just 6.1 KB of online communication; this is a 5.9x reduction compared to the best previous lattice-based scheme. Moreover, Respire naturally extends to support batch queries. Compared to previous communication-efficient batch PIR schemes, Respire achieves a 3.4-7.1x reduction in total communication while maintaining comparable throughput (200-400 MB/s). The design of Respire relies on new query compression and response packing techniques based on ring switching in homomorphic encryption.
