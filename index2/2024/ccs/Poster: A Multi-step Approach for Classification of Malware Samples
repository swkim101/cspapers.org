The rapid spread of unknown malware has prompted many companies and researchers to improve their detection and classification systems. Cyber security companies must deal with the newest malware samples captured by their honeypots, aiming to analyze and classify them to develop several countermeasures. This process could only be feasible with a strong ground truth baseline; companies could only securely store the samples, waiting for further developments. This paper proposes a multi-step approach to support the classification process of unknown malware samples. Specifically, our approach first leverages well-known classification techniques and third-party services to collect as much information as possible about the samples and combines them with Machine Learning (ML)-based techniques to classify the remaining samples. Our case study, conducted on industrial data, shows how the combination offers superior performance than using each method individually.
