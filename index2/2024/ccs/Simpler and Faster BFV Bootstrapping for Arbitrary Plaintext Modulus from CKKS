. Bootstrapping is currently the only known method for constructing fully homomorphic encryptions. In the BFV scheme specifically, bootstrapping aims to reduce the error of a ciphertext while preserving the encrypted plaintext. The existing BFV bootstrapping methods follow the same pipeline, relying on the evaluation of a digit extraction polynomial to annihilate the error located in the least significant digits. However, due to its strong dependence on performance, bootstrapping could only utilize a limited form of plaintext modulus, such as a power of a small prime number. In this paper, we present a novel approach to instantiate BFV bootstrapping, distinct from the previous digit extraction-based method. The core idea of our bootstrapping is to utilize CKKS bootstrapping as a subroutine, so the performance of our method mainly depends on the underlying CKKS bootstrapping rather than the plaintext modulus. We implement our method at a proof-of-concept level to provide concrete benchmark results. When performing the bootstrapping operation for a 51-bits plaintext modulus, our method improves the previous digit extraction-based method by a factor of 37.9 in latency and 29.4 in throughput. Additionally, we achieve viable bootstrapping performance for large plaintext moduli, such as 144-bits and 234-bits, which has never been measured before.
