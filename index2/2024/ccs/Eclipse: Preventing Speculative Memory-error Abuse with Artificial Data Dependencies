Historically, researchers have treated memory safety-based and speculative execution attacks as two separate domains. Recent work has introduced Speculative Memory-error Abuse (SMA) attacks, which combine memory corruption vulnerabilities with Spectre-like primitives. Using SMA, an attacker can leak sensitive program information and defeat a wide variety of memory-corruption miti-gations, including (K)ASLR, software-based XOM, and even ARM PA, eventually carrying out an end-to-end (architecturally-visible) exploit. We present Eclipse : a novel protection scheme against SMA attacks. Eclipse works by propagating artificial data dependencies onto sensitive data, preventing the CPU from using attacker-controlled data during speculative execution. We demonstrate that Eclipse provides comprehensive protection against speculative-probing and PACMAN-style attacks, two prominent examples of SMA attacks that target both the x86(-64) and ARM architectures. We evaluate the performance of Eclipse on x86-64 and demonstrate that it introduces minimal overhead, compared to alternative hardening approaches, incurring ≈ 0%–9 . 5% slowdown on SPEC CPU 2017, up to 8 . 6% slowdown in real-world applications, and negligible overhead in the Linux kernel.
