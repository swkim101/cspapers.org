Our motivation is to create new research forum bringing together diverse researchers from academia, government, and the healthcare industry to report on latest research efforts on cybersecurity in healthcare. As this is the inaugural workshop, our immediate goal for HealthSec'24 is to encourage, jumpstart, grow, and support an interdisciplinary community of researchers focused on cybersecurity in healthcare. To our knowledge this is the first cybersecurity research forum of any kind to have participation from credentialed medical doctors with backgrounds and/or responsibilities related to cybersecurity in healthcare.
