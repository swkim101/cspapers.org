Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything else. In some applications of PSI, a server holds a large set and runs a PSI protocol with multiple clients, each with its own smaller set. In this setting, existing protocols fall short: they either achieve only semi-honest security, or else require the server to run the protocol from scratch for each execution. We design an efficient protocol for this setting with simulation-based security against malicious adversaries. In our protocol, the server publishes a one-time, linear-size encoding of its set. Then, multiple clients can independently execute a PSI protocol with the server, with complexity linear in the size of each client’s set. To learn the intersection, a client can download the server’s encoding, which can be accelerated via content-distribution or peer-to-peer networks since the same encoding is used by all clients; alternatively, clients can fetch only the relevant parts of the encoding using verifiable private information retrieval. A key ingredient of our protocol is an efficient instantiation of an oblivious verifiable unpredictable function, which may be of independent interest. Our implementation shows that our protocol is highly efficient. For a server holding 10 8 elements and each client holding 10 3 elements, the size of the server’s encoding is 800MB; an execution of the protocol uses 60MB of communication, runs in under 5s in a WAN network with 120 Mbps bandwidth, and costs only 0.017 USD when utilizing network-caching infrastructures, a 5 × saving compared to a state-of-the-art PSI protocol.
