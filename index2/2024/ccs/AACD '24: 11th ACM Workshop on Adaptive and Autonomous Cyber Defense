The eleventh ACM Workshop on Adaptive and Autonomous Cyber Defense (AACD) will be held on October 14, 2024, in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). AACD represents a cutting-edge approach to cybersecurity, where systems leverage AI and machine learning to dynamically detect, respond to, and mitigate evolving cyber threats in real time, minimizing the need for human intervention. A key aspect of this approach is adaptability-autonomous systems can assess attacker behavior, anticipate future threats, and adjust their defenses proactively. As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated, this transition from static defense strategies to dynamic, automated responses offers organizations a more resilient way to protect against emerging threats. The workshop will focus on discussing the challenges and opportunities inherent in this advanced cybersecurity paradigm.
