The sixth Workshop on CPS & IoT Security and Privacy is set to take place in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, on October 18, 2024, in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'24). This workshop marks the amalgamation of two workshops held in 2019: one focused on the security and privacy of cyber-physical systems, while the other one centered on the security and privacy of IoT. The primary objective of this workshop is to create a collaborative forum that brings together academia, industry experts, and governmental entities, encouraging them to contribute cutting-edge research, share demonstrations or hands-on experiences, and engage in discussions. This year, our call for contributions encompassed a broad spectrum, including full research papers, work-in-progress submissions, and one-page abstracts. The workshop program includes eight full-length papers on the security and privacy of CPS/IoT, alongside six shorter papers that present original or work-in-progress research. Furthermore, the workshop will feature one distinguished keynote presentation by Prof. Alvaro Cardenas, a world-renowned expert in CPS security. The talk will offer insights into how the state of CPS security has evolved since 2007. The complete CPSIoTSec'24 workshop proceedings are available at https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3691550.
