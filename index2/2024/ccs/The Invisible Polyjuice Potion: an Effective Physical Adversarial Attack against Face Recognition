Face recognition systems have been targeted by recent physical adversarial machine learning attacks, which attach or project visible patterns on adversaries’ faces to trick backend FR models. While these attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in the literature, they often rely on visibly suspicious patterns, are susceptible to environmental noise, or exhibit limited success rates in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel physical adversarial attack against deep face recognition systems, namely Agile (adversarial glasses with infrared laser). It generates adjustable, invisible laser perturbations and emits them into the camera CMOS to launch dodging and impersonation attacks against facial biometrics systems. To do so, we first theoretically model physical adversarial perturbations and convert them to the digital domain. The generated synthesized attack signals are utilized to guide real-world laser settings. Our experiments with real-world attackers and a benchmark face database show that Agile is highly effective in DoS, dodging, and imperson-ation attacks. More importantly, the candidate impersonation target and optimal attack settings identified by Agile ’s attack synthesis approach are highly consistent with real-world physical attack re-sults. The grey-box and black-box evaluation against commercial FR models also confirms the effectiveness of the Agile attack.
