Nowadays Communication Security usually refers to digital communication and in particular via the Internet. We explain why the topic should be broadened to include any communication, in particular when done in person, e.g., with co-authors, colleagues, reporters, etc. Thousands of papers have been written on blockchain, and consensus. Despite this, the problem of Byzantine attack has been ignored in some important apps! One of these examples is (Outlook) Calendar. Moreover, the Byzantine attack can also be used in the political world. We explain how using it may undermine the security of nations. Finally, we observe that topics on which a lot of research has been done, such as Private Set Intersection have ignored the problem of Byzantine attacks. Although the Byzantine general problem is typically described in a peer-to-peer setting, we show that it can also occur in other scenarios.
