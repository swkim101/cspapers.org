Data within a system travels through an I/O path from its generation in an application to its final storage on a device. Ensuring data security and privacy is a significant design concern, but heavily modulated storage stacks complicate understanding the data, thus presenting challenges to maintaining these properties. For example, the firmware in a storage device cannot interpret the semantics of an I/O request from the host, making it challenging to employ a semantic-aware malware defense in the storage device. Additionally, the evolution of storage media can weaken data privacy protection guarantees due to varying physical characteristics. Preserving the guarantee of data security and privacy requires understanding storage semantics, which provides insights into the data content and the architectural components within the storage system. This thesis characterizes security and privacy weaknesses in the I/O path while proposing solutions to advance data security and privacy by leveraging storage semantics. We correlate I/O requests with their semantic attributes to facilitate data security. We also demonstrate how these requests can mitigate vulnerabilities found in previous privacy-preserving storage solutions by considering the knowledge of physical storage devices. We show that data security and privacy can be vastly improved by identifying security vulnerabilities and developing new security mechanisms based on storage semantics.
