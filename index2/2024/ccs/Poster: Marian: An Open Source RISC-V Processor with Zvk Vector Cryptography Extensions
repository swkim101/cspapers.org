The RISC-V Vector Cryptography Extensions (Zvk) were ratified in 2023 and integrated into the main ISA manuals in 2024. These extensions support high-speed symmetric cryptography (AES, SHA2, SM3, SM4) operating on the vector register file and offer significant performance improvements over scalar cryptography extensions (Zk) due to data parallelism. As a ratified extension, Zvk is supported by compiler toolchains and is already being integrated into popular cryptographic middleware such as OpenSSL. We report on Marian, the first open-source hardware implementation of a vector processor with the Zvk extensions. The design is based on the PULP "Ara" vector unit, which itself is an extension of the popular CVA6 processor. The implementation is in SystemVerilog and has been tested using Virtex Ultrascale+ FPGA prototyping, with a planned tapeout targeting a 22nm process node. We offer an analysis of the architectural requirements that vector cryptography imposes on a processor, as well as the initial estimates of performance and area for our implementation.
