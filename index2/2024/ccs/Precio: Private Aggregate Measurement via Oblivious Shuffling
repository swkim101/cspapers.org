We introduce Precio, a new secure aggregation method for computing layered histograms and sums over secret shared data in a client-server setting. Precio is motivated by ad conversion measurement scenarios, where online advertisers and ad networks want to measure the performance of ad campaigns without requiring privacy-invasive techniques, such as third-party cookies. Precio has linear (communication) complexity in the number of data points and guarantees differentially private outputs. We formally analyze its security and privacy and present a thorough performance evaluation. The protocol supports much larger domains than Prio. It supports much more flexible aggregates than the DPF-based solution and in some settings has up to four orders of magnitude better performance
