The increasing attack surface of modern cars and the new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity (like UNECE R155) made cybersecurity an important part of car design. The "CSCS’24 Cyber Security in Cars Workshop" is designed to address current topics in the rapidly evolving automotive cybersecurity domain. The goal is to bring together academia and industry to find novel solutions for cybersecurity problems in the automotive domain. CSCS’24 is the first CSCS workshop co-located with ACM CCS. Nonetheless, it is founded on a series of events known as the "ACM Cyber Security in Cars Symposium (CSCS symposium)" that lasted from 2017 until 2023. CSCS’24 welcomes any theoretical or practical contributions to the rich field of automotive cybersecurity, including secure auto-motive communication, ECU system security, and aspects of Cyber Security Management Systems (CSMS).
