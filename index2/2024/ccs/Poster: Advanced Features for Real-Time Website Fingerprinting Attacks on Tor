The Tor network has been identified as vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WF) attacks. Existing WF attacks have proven effective against the Tor network. However, prior research has mostly been limited to controlled experimental settings, leading to questions about the practicality of WF attacks in real-time environments. Recent advancements in feature engineering and machine learning aim to address this by exploring real-world scenarios, though they often overlook the preprocessing time required to design features from raw network traffic data. To tackle these issues, this research focuses on developing more efficient and high-performing feature vectors for WF attacks in real-time by analyzing previously successful feature vectors. The results indicate that advanced features, particularly those in a compact feature set, deliver competitive performance with reduced training times for real-time WF attacks. This study enhances our understanding of the feasibility of real-time WF attacks on Tor networks in practical settings and may inform future security improvements.
