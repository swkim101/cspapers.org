Mobile super apps are revolutionizing mobile computing by offering diverse services through integrated "miniapps'', creating comprehensive ecosystems akin to app stores like Google Play and Apple's App Store. While these platforms, such as WeChat, Alipay, and TikTok, enhance user convenience and functionality, they also raise significant security and privacy concerns due to the vast amounts of user data they handle. In response, the Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Superapps (SaTS 2024) aims to address these critical issues by fostering collaboration among researchers and practitioners to explore solutions that protect users and enhance security within the super app landscape.
