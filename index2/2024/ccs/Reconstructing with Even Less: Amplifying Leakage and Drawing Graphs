Leakage-abuse attacks using access pattern leakage from range queries have been shown to reconstruct encrypted databases. However, prior work is either restricted to one-dimensional databases or requires access to all possible responses in two-dimensions. In this paper, we explore what an adversary can achieve with minimal leakage, focusing on denser databases, and present a leakage abuse attack from access pattern of range queries in multiple dimensions. Our attack employs a novel technique to systematically amplify access pattern leakage, inferring a large number of new query responses that have not been requested by the user. Let m be the size of the database domain. Our attack works on d-dimensional databases and achieves approximate reconstruction. For dense databases and a parameter 0 < λ < 1, our attack fully reconstructs an inner portion of size λm of the database (referred to as the λ-core) after observing O(m log m) queries, uniformly at random. These are significant improvements over previous attacks that require the full set of responses, which has size O(m2). We are the first to leverage graph drawing techniques for database reconstruction attacks. We implement our attack and evaluate it with experiments on real-world databases, achieving accurate reconstructions after observing a small percentage of the responses.
