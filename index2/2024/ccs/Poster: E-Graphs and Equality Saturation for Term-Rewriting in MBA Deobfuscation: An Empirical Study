Obfuscation is a powerful software protection technique. It changes a program into a more complicated one while preserving its semantics. Malware distributors also employ this method, to protect their malware from being understood by malware analysts. Thus, it is crucial to deobfuscate malware in a timely manner, to enable a prompt action to malware. This poster presents an efficient deobfuscation method using e-graph and equality saturation, a recent attention-gathering optimization technique, known for inherent theoretical efficiency in term-rewriting. Among the various deobfuscation techniques, we focus on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation, which is one of the most popular obfuscation methods due to its unparalleled strength and efficiency. We implement an e-graph and equality-saturation-based term-rewrite MBA deobfuscator, called EMBA, to simplify various sets of MBA-obfuscated expressions. By comparing its performance with state-of-the-art deobfuscators, we have shown that the equality saturation-based method has promising properties in MBA deobfuscation.
