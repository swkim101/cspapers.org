—The recently standardized secure group messaging protocol “Messaging Layer Security” (MLS) is designed to ensure asynchronous communications within large groups, with an almost-optimal communication cost and the same security level as point-to-point secure messaging protocols such as “Signal”. In particular, the core sub-protocol of MLS, a Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) called TreeKEM, must generate a common group key that respects the fundamental security properties of “post-compromise security” and “forward secrecy” which mitigate the effects of user corruption over time.
