Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks on the Tor anonymity network identify websites accessed via Tor by recognizing the traffic patterns -- sequences of packet directions and timing -- associated with accessing a particular site. Previous work has shown that modern WF attacks can function when trained and tested against consistent high or low settings of the Tor "security slider,'' which impacts the traffic pattern produced by a download. In this work we show that training and testing against traces with a mixture of settings can improve the performance of WF attacks in some cases. Thus research seeking to evaluate WF defenses should consider both scenarios to ensure the most consistent evaluations.
