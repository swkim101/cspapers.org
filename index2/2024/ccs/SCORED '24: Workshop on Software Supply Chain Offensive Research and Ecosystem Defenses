Recent attacks on the software supply chain have shed light on the fragility and importance of ensuring the security and integrity of this vital ecosystem. Addressing the technical and social challenges to building trustworthy software for deployment in sensitive and/or large-scale enterprise or governmental settings requires innovative solutions and an interdisciplinary approach. The Workshop on Software Supply Chain Offensive Research and Ecosystem Defenses (SCORED) is the leading venue for bringing together industry practitioners, academics, and policymakers to present and discuss security vulnerabilities, novel defenses against attacks, project demos, adoption requirements and best practices in the software supply chain. The complete SCORED '24 workshop proceedings are available at: https://doi.org/10.1145/3689944
