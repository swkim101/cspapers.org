. We present Protoss , a new balanced PAKE protocol with optimal communication eﬃciency. Messages are only 160 bits long and the computational complexity is lower than all previous approaches. Our protocol is proven secure in the random oracle model and features a security proof in a strong security model with multiple parties and multiple sessions, while allowing for generous attack queries including multiple Test -queries. Moreover, the proof is in the practically relevant single-bit model (that is harder to achieve than the multiple-bit model) and tightly reduces to the Strong Square Diﬃe-Hellman assumption (SSQRDH). This allows for very eﬃcient, theoretically-sound instantiations and tight compositions with symmetric primitives.
