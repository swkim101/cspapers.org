The CCSW workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore all aspects of security in cloud-centric and outsourced computing. In CCSW 2024, based on the papers that have been accepted, the workshop is focused on applied cryptographic schemes and protocols for the cloud, cloud-based leakage related attacks and their countermeasures, trusted computing technology in clouds, binary analysis of software for cloud protection, network security mechanisms using AI anomaly detection as well as security for emerging cloud programming models (like extended Berkeley Packet Filter, eBPF, programs). Throughout the years, the workshop particularly encourages novel paradigms and controversial ideas not covered by traditional cloud security research, serving as a fertile ground for creative debate and interaction in security-sensitive areas of computing impacted by cloud technologies. The workshop received 20 submissions, 15 of which passed through a thorough review process of at least 3 reviewers, and 7 of them were accepted for publication and presentation.
