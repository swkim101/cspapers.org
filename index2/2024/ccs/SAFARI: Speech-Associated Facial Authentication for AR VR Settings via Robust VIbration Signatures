In AR/VR devices, the voice interface, serving as one of the primary AR/VR control mechanisms, enables users to interact naturally using speeches (voice commands) for accessing data, controlling applications, and engaging in remote communication/meetings. Voice authentication can be adopted to protect against unauthorized speech inputs. However, existing voice authentication mechanisms are usually susceptible to voice spoofing attacks and are unreliable under the variations of phonetic content. In this work, we propose SAFARI, a spoofing-resistant and text-independent speech authentication system that can be seamlessly integrated into AR/VR voice interfaces. The key idea is to elicit phonetic-invariant biometrics from the facial muscle vibrations upon the headset. During speech production, a user’s facial muscles are de-formed for articulating phoneme sounds. The facial deformations associated with the phonemes are referred to as visemes. They carry rich biometrics of the wearer’s muscles, tissue, and bones, which can propagate through the head and vibrate the headset. SAFARI aims to derive reliable facial biometrics from the viseme-associated facial vibrations captured by the AR/VR motion sensors. Particularly, it identifies the vibration data segments that contain rich viseme patterns (prominent visemes) less susceptible to phonetic variations. Based on the prominent visemes, SAFARI learns on the correlations among facial vibrations of different frequencies to extract biometric representations invariant to the phonetic context.
