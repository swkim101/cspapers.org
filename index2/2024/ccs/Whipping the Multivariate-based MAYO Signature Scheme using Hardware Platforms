NIST issued a new call in 2023 to diversify the portfolio of quantum-resistant digital signature schemes since the current portfolio relies on lattice problems. The MAYO scheme, which builds on the Un-balanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) problem, is a promising candidate for this new call. MAYO introduces emulsifier maps and a novel ‘whipping’ technique to significantly reduce the key sizes compared to previous UOV schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the implementation aspects of MAYO and proposes several optimization techniques that we use to implement a high-speed hardware accelerator. The first optimization technique is the partial unrolling of the emulsification process to increase parallelization. The second proposed optimization is a novel memory structure enabling the parallelization of significant bottlenecks in the MAYO scheme. In addition to this, we present a flexible transposing technique for the data format used in MAYO that can be expanded to other UOV-based schemes. We use these techniques to design the first high-speed ASIC and FPGA accelerator that supports all operations of the MAYO scheme for different NIST security levels. Compared with state-of-the-art, like HaMAYO [23] and UOV [7], our FPGA design shows a performance benefit of up to three orders of magnitude in both latency and area-time-product. Furthermore, we lower the BRAM consumption by up to 2 . 8 × compared to these FPGA implementations. Compared to high-end CPU implementations, our ASIC design allows between 2 . 81 × and 60 . 14 × higher throughputs. This increases the number of signing operations per second from 483 to 13424, thereby fostering performant deployment of the MAYO scheme in time-critical applications.
