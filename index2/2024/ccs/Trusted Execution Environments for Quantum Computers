The cloud-based environments in which today's and future quantum computers will operate, raise concerns about the security and privacy of user's intellectual property. Quantum circuits submitted to cloud-based quantum computer providers represent sensitive or proprietary algorithms developed by users that need protection. Further, input data is hard-coded into the circuits and leakage of the circuits can expose users' data. Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their hardware and software design. % In classical computing, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an area on the main processor of a device that is separated from the system's main operating system, which ensures data is stored, processed and protected in a secure environment. Similar to the classical computing, by leveraging trusted hardware, we propose Trusted Execution Environments for quantum computers. The proposed thesis will explore the feasibility and the security of the quantum computer Trusted Execution Environment architecture as a novel security primitive. In this prospectus, the challenges and approaches are outlined, current results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed work and a timeline of future work is given.
