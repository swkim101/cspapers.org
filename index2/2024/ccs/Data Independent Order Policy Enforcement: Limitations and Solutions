Order manipulation attacks such as frontrunning and sandwich-ing have become an increasing concern in blockchain applications such as DeFi. To protect from such attacks, several recent works have designed order policy enforcement (OPE) protocols to order transactions fairly in a data-independent fashion. However, while the manipulation attacks are motivated by monetary profits, the defenses assume honesty among a significantly large set of participants. In existing protocols, if all participants are rational , they may be incentivized to collude and circumvent the order policy without incurring any penalty. Thisworkmakestwokeycontributions. First,weexplorewhether the need for the honesty assumption is fundamental. Indeed, we show that it is impossible to design OPE protocols under some requirements when all parties are rational. Second, we explore the tradeoffs needed to circumvent the impossibility result. In the process, we propose a novel concept of rationally binding transactions that allows us to construct AnimaguSwap 1 , the first content-oblivious Automated Market Makers (AMM) interface that is secure under rationality. We report on a prototype implementation of Ani-maguSwap and performance evaluation results demonstrating its practicality.
