The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks and the evolution of security risks make it challenging for organizations to understand their impact on businesses. The habitual reliance on the judgment of cyber security experts and communication gaps between cyber security team and board members, responsible for making strategic cyber security investment decisions further weaken organization's capability to respond to cyber threats. Existing research lacks a transparent approach to quantify security risks and their impact on businesses. This paper introduces a novel CYSEM that express security risk in financial terms, through integrating Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model, elaborated with cyber security cost typologies. CYSEM facilitates communication among multi-stakeholders and improves transparency and quality of investment decision-making at the strategic level. We evaluate the CYSEM using a case study, which has showed its effectiveness in understanding the impact of cyber threat from an economics perspective.
