Autonomous cybersecurity represents a significant evolution in information security, where systems independently detect, respond to, and neutralize cyber threats without the need for human intervention. This level of autonomy is a more advanced stage in cybersecurity, enabling systems not only to execute tasks but also to interpret contexts, make decisions, and adapt strategies in realtime. The shift towards autonomy promises enhanced adaptability, faster response times, and a reduction in human error. This domain stands out for its unique blend of advanced Machine Learning (ML) systems such as Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven and Quantum Machine Learning (QML)-based agents with cybersecurity automation techniques such as automated patch management systems, automated incident response systems to forge self-reliant cybersecurity systems. The AutonomousCyber workshop provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in this field.
