. With the demand of cryptocurrencies, threshold ECDSA recently regained popularity. So far, several methods have been proposed to construct threshold ECDSA, including the usage of OT and homomorphic encryptions (HE). Due to the mismatch between the plaintext space and the signature space, HE-based threshold ECDSA always requires zero-knowledge range proofs, such as Paillier and Joye-Libert (JL) encryptions. However, the overhead of range proofs constitutes a major portion of the total cost. In this paper, we propose eﬀicient batch range proofs to improve the eﬀiciency of threshold ECDSA. At the heart of our eﬀiciency improvement is a new technical tool called Multi-Dimension Forking Lemma , as a generalization of the well-known general forking lemma [Bellare and Neven, CCS 2006]. Based on our new tool, we construct eﬀicient batch range proofs for Paillier and JL encryptions, and use them to give batch multiplication-to-addition (MtA) protocols, which are crucial to most threshold ECDSA. Our constructions improve the prior Paillier-based MtA by a factor of 2 and the prior JL-based MtA by a factor of 3, in both computation and bandwidth in an amortized way. Our batch MtA can be used to improve the eﬀiciency of most Paillier and JL based threshold ECDSA. As three typical examples, our benchmarking results show:
