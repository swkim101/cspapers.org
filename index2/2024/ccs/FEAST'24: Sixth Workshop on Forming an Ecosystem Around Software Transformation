The Sixth Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST) revives the series, with the original five events taking place from 2016-2020. FEAST is concerned with all aspects of achieving effective, robust, and appraisable late-stage transformation of software for security. Late-stage transformations allow third parties to deeply tailor existing software to their mission, customizing it with little to no access to source code or support from the original developer. Research has shown that late-stage software customization is of particular benefit to security-conscious software consumers who must use closed-source or source-free binary software components in mission-critical settings, or who must harden software against newly emerging attacks not anticipated during the softwareâ€™s original design and development. However, there is still a long way to go toward achieving sound and robust transformations whose holistic benefits to deployed software are fully appraisable. Motivated by these outstanding challenges, FEAST continues in its goal to form an active ecosystem of strategies and tools for accomplishing source-free binary code transformation reliably and on-demand.
