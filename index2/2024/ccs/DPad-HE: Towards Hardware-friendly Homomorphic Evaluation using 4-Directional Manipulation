Module Learning with Errors (MLWE) based approaches for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) have garnered attention due to their potential to enhance hardware-friendliness and implementation efficiency. However, despite these advantages, their overall performance still trails behind traditional schemes based on Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE). This indicates that while MLWE-based constructions hold promise, there remain significant challenges to overcome in bridging the performance gap with RLWE-based FHE schemes. By uncovering the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance of prior schemes and pinpointing the fundamental differences in the design of MLWE-based FHE compared to traditional approaches, the paper introduces DPad-HE with a novel design incorporating manipulation in the module rank dimension. The newly introduced operations, rank-up, and rank-down, effectively regulate the scale of gadget decomposition, reducing the computational workload of key-switching by several times. Taking CKKS as a case study, the evaluation showcases the comprehensive advantages of DPad-HE over the state-of-the-art MLWE-based scheme, resulting in a performance boost of 1.26× to 5.71×, a reduction in key size from 1/3 to 3/4, with enhanced noise control. To test the hardware-friendliness of the solution, DPad-HE is also implemented on GPU. Notably, DPad-HE demonstrates that, for the first time, the execution latency of MLWE-based schemes can achieve comparable performance with traditional RLWE ones, especially on the GPU platform where a speedup up to 1.41× is witnessed. Additionally, this paper provides a lightweight conversion method between RLWE and MLWE ciphertexts, allowing for flexible selection of RLWE and MLWE settings during a single complete evaluation process. This opens up new possibilities for both RLWE-based and MLWE-based FHEs.
