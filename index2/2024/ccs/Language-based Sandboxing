Existing sandboxing techniques require a lot of manual efforts in retrofitting legacy programs and do not provide a unified framework for reasoning about whole-program properties. To address these issues, we propose a language-based approach that makes sandbox a first-class concept in the language. The composability of sandboxes with other language features can enable programmers to do faster compartmentalization and end-to-end reasoning of safety properties.
