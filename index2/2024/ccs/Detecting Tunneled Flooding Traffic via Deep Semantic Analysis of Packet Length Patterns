Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection services capture various flooding attacks by analyzing traffic features. However, existing services are unable to accurately detect tunneled attack traffic because the tunneling protocols encrypt both packet headers and payloads, which hide the traffic features used for detection, and can thus evade these detection services. In this paper, we develop Exosphere, which detects tunneled attack traffic by analyzing packet length patterns, without investigating any information in packets. Specifically, it utilizes a deep learning based method to analyze the semantics of packet patterns, i.e., the features represent the strong correlations between flooding packets with similar length patterns, and classify attack traffic according to these semantic features. We prove that the strong correlations of packet length patterns ensure the theoretical guarantee of applying semantic analysis to recognize correlated attack packets. We prototype Exosphere with FPGAs and deploy it in a real-world institutional network. The experimental results demonstrate that Exosphere achieves 0.967 F1 accuracy, while detecting flooding traffic generated by unseen attacks and misconfigurations. Moreover, it achieves 0.996 AUC accuracy on existing datasets including various stealthy attacks, and thus significantly outperforms the existing deep learning models. It achieves accuracy comparable to the best performances achieved by 12 state-of-the-art methods that cannot detect tunneled flooding traffic, while improving their efficiency by 6.19 times.
