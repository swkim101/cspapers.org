â€”To transform cybersecurity and privacy research into a highly integrated, community-wide effort, researchers need a common, rich, representative research infrastructure that meets the needs across all members of the research community, and facilitates reproducible science. To meet researcher needs, USC Information Sciences Institute and Northeastern University have been funded by the NSF mid-scale research infrastructure program to build Security and Privacy Heterogeneous Environment for Reproducible Experimentation (SPHERE). This research infrastructure will offer access to an unprecedented variety of user-configurable hardware, software, and network resources, it will offer six user portals geared toward different populations of users, and it will support reproducible research via a combination of infrastructure services and community engagement activities.
