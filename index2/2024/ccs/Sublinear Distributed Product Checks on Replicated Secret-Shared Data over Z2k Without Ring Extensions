Multiple works have designed or used maliciously secure honest majority MPC protocols over Z 2 𝑘 using replicated secret sharing ( e.g. Koti et al. USENIX’21). A recent trend in the design of such MPC protocols is to first execute a semi-honest protocol, and then use a check that verifies the correctness of the computation requiring only sublinear amount of communication in terms of the circuit size. The so-called Galois ring extensions are needed in order to execute such checks over Z 2 𝑘 , but these rings incur incredibly high computation overheads, which completely undermine any potential benefits the ring Z 2 𝑘 had to begin with. Inthisworkwerevisitthetaskofdesigningsublineardistributed product checks on replicated secret-shared data over Z 2 𝑘 among three parties with an honest majority. We present a novel technique for verifying the correctness of a set of multiplication (in fact, inner product) triples, involving a sublinear cost in terms of the number of multiplications. Most importantly, unlike previous works, our tools do not rely on Galois ring extensions, which are computationally expensive , and only require computation over rings of the form Z 2 ℓ . In terms of communication, our checks are 3 ∼ 5 × lighter than existing checks using ring extensions, which is already quite remarkable. However, our most noticeable improvement is in terms of computation: our checks are 17 . 7 ∼ 44 . 2 × better than previous approaches, for many parameter regimes of interest. Our
