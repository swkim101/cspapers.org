Network crimes committed through anonymous networks pose significant challenges to regulators. Identifying different types of traffic and implementing effective supervision are crucial for maintaining network security. In this demo, we present an end-to-end anonymous traffic analysis system that integrates traffic capturing, protocol parsing, feature extraction, traffic classification, and analysis result presentation, enabling comprehensive analysis of traffic on routers from end to end. Our system can be deployed on the data center network to capture network traffic routed by the routers. It automatically analyzes Tor network traffic, HTTPS encrypted traffic, and Tor network App traffic, identifies the target website or App type associated with the traffic, and displays the identification results via the visual interface.
