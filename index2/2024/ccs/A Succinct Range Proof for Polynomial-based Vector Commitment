â€”Range proofs serve as a protocol for the prover to prove to the verifier that a committed number resides within a specified range, such as [0 , 2 n ) , without disclosing the actual value. These proofs find extensive application in various domains, including anonymous cryptocurrencies, electronic voting, and auctions. However, the efficiency of many existing schemes diminishes significantly when confronted with batch proofs encompassing multiple elements. The pivotal challenge arises from their focus on the commitment to a singular element rather than a vector. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces MissileProof, a zero-knowledge, succinct, non-interactive argument of knowledge tailored for the range proof of a vector commitment. Our core contribution lies in reducing this argument to a bi-to-uni variate SumCheck problem and the bivariate polynomial ZeroTest problem, and design two polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOPs) for each problem. Our principal innovation involves the transformation of this argument into a bi-to-uni variate SumCheck problem and the bivariate polynomial ZeroTest problem. To tackle these challenges, we devise two Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proofs (PIOPs) for each problem.
