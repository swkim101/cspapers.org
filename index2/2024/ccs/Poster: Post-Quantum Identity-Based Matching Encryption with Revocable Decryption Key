In recent years, scholars have developed Identity-Based Matching Encryption (IB-ME), which enables both the sender and the receiver to specify identities, ensuring ciphertext confidentiality only when these identities match. Building on this concept, our work introduces Revocable Identity-Based Matching Encryption (RIB-ME), which incorporates a revocable mechanism to withdraw decryption rights from unauthorized users. Current RIB-ME schemes rely on a variant of the Diffie-Hellman assumption, rendering it susceptible to quantum computing attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose a generic construction of RIB-ME inspired by Wang et al. Our approach employs two-level Revocable Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (RHIBE) and Identity-Based Signature (IBS) and is compatible with post-quantum encryption schemes. This enables the development of a generic construction of RIB-ME and the creation of the first post-quantum RIB-ME through the use of post-quantum constructions.
