Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) plays a pivotal role as the de facto inter-domain routing protocol on the Internet. However, BGP threats continually emerge and undermine the Internet reliability. Existing BGP threat detection methods based on machine learning require substantial labeled data and expert involvement, making them costly and labor-intensive. Moreover, they fail to learn rich information from massive unlabeled BGP data consistently generated on the Internet. In this paper, we propose FIRE that enables few-shot inter-domain routing threat detection with large-scale multi-modal pre-training. FIRE conducts domain-specific pre-training tasks to acquire rich BGP implicit knowledge from massive unlabeled BGP data for few-shot learning. Our experiments show that FIRE can be fine-tuned to precisely identify BGP threats with only a few labeled samples, e.g., a 93.2% precision in route leak detection with merely 8 events for fine-tuning.
