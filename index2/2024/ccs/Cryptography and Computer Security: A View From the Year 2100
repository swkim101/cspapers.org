What will computer security look like in the year 2100? This talk will begin with a few predictions that aim to suggest a few research directions in the present. We will then transition to the exciting area of applied zero knowledge proofs, an area that has seen tremendous growth in recent years. We will describe some of the new ideas in the space and focus on a number of remarkable real-word applications of these techniques. The talk will be self contained and accessible to all.
