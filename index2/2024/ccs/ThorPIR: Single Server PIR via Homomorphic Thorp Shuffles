Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a two player protocol where the client, given some query x ∈ [ N ] interacts with the server, which holds a N -bit string DB in order to privately retrieve DB [ x ]. In this work, we focus on the single server client-preprocessing model, initially idealized by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2020), where the client and server first run some joint preprocessing algorithm, after which the client can retrieve elements of the server’s string DB privately in time sublinear in N . All known constructions of single server client-preprocessing PIR rely on one of the following two paradigms: (1) a linear-bandwidth offline phase where the client downloads the whole database from the server, or (2) a sublinear-bandwidth offline phase where however the server has to compute a large-depth ( O λ ( N )) circuit under FHE in order to execute the preprocessing phase. Inthis paper, we construct a single server client-preprocessing PIR scheme which achieves both sublinear offline bandwidth (the client does not have to download the whole database offline) and a low-depth (i.e. O λ (1)), highly parallelizable preprocessing circuit. We estimate that on a single thread, our scheme’s preprocessing time should be more than 350x times faster than in prior single server client-preprocessing PIR constructions. Moreover, with parallelization, the latency reduction would be even more drastic. In addition, this construction also allows for updates in O λ (1) time, something not achieved before in this model.
