In this work we study the efficiency of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) arguments of knowledge, particularly exploring Multi-Verifier ZK (MVZK) protocols as a midway point between Non-Interactive ZK and Designated-Verifier ZK, offering versatile applications across various domains. We introduce a new MVZK protocol designed for the preprocessing model, allowing any constant fraction of verifiers to be corrupted, potentially colluding with the prover. Our contributions include the first MVZK over rings. Unlike recent prior works on fields in the dishonest majority case, our protocol demonstrates communication complexity independent of the number of verifiers, contrasting the linear complexity of previous approaches. This key advancement ensures improved scalability and efficiency. We provide an end-to-end implementation of our protocol. The benchmark shows that it achieves a throughput of 1.47 million gates per second for 64 verifiers with 50% corruption, and 0.88 million gates per second with 75% corruption.
