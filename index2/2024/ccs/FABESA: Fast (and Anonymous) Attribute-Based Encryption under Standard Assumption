Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) provides fine-grained access con-troltoencrypteddataandfindsapplicationsinvariousdomains.The practicality of ABE schemes hinges on the balance between security and efficiency. The state-of-the-art adaptive secure ABE scheme, proven to be adaptively secure under standard assumptions (FAME, CCS’17),islessefficientcomparedtothefastestone(FABEO,CCS’22) whichisonlyprovensecureundertheGenericGroupModel(GGM). ThesetraditionalABEschemesfocussolelyonmessageprivacy.To addressscenarioswhereattributevalueinformationisalsosensitive, AnonymousABE(A 2 BE) ensures the privacy of both the message and attributes. However, most A 2 BE schemes suffer from intricate designs with low efficiency, and the security of the fastest key-policy A 2 BE (proposed in FEASE, USENIX’24) relies on the GGM. In this paper, we propose novel fast key-policy and ciphertext-policy ABE schemes that (1) support both AND and OR gates for access policies, (2) have no restriction on the size and type of policies or attributes, (3) achieve adaptive security under the standard DLIN assumption, and (4) only need 4 pairings for decryption. As our ABE constructionsautomaticallyprovideciphertextanonymity,weeasily transformourABEschemestoA 2 BE schemes while maintaining the same features and high-level efficiency.

Specifically, our ABE schemes perform better than FAME and are close to FABEO. Our key-policy A 2 BE scheme performs close to the one in FEASE and our ciphertext-policy A 2 BE outperforms the state-of-the-art (Cui et al., ProvSec’16).
