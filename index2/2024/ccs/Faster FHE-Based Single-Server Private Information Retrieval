This work introduces KsPIR, a new practically efficient single-server private information retrieval (PIR) system that outperforms the state-of-the-art Spiral (Menon and Wu, S&P 2022) in terms of server response times. We achieve this by proposing novel dimension folding methods, inspired by recent advancements in fully homomorphic encryption. Our methods offer two significant advantages: firstly, they feature simpler designs that eliminate the need for ciphertext expansion steps in Spiral. Secondly, and more importantly, we propose two types of designs that offer distinct advantages - the first type enables preprocessing of the most resource-intensive computation in the offline stage before receiving the query, thereby optimizing online response time; the second type optimizes overall response time without requiring preprocessing in the offline stage, accomplished through a highly optimized baby-step-giant-step matrix-vector homomorphic multiplication. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the concrete performance of KsPIR, and the results confirm an approximately 10.7 times faster online throughput than that of Spiral for the first type, and 5.8 times faster overall throughput for the second type.
