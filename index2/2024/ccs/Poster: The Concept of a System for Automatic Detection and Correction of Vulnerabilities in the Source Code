Defects in the source code that affect security are one of the main elements used to carry out cyber attacks. Examining source code for vulnerabilities is a difficult and expensive process. As a result, specialized software is needed for this. Due to the development of various artificial intelligence methods, improving existing vulnerability detection methods is possible. In particular, it is possible to reduce the number of false positives and enable the detection of complex vulnerabilities that require understanding the broader context of the code. The article presents the concept of a system for automatic analysis of vulnerabilities in source code, along with the challenges and problems related to its design and use.
