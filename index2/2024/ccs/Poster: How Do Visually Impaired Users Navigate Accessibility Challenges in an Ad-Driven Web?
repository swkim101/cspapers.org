Website accessibility is crucial for inclusiveness and regulatory compliance. While third-party advertisements (ads) are essential for funding free web services, they pose significant accessibility challenges. When developers lease space to ad-serving technologies like DoubleClick, they lose control over the accessibility of ad content. Even highly accessible websites can have their adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) undermined by third-party ads. We conduct an investigation into the accessibility of ads across 430K website elements, including nearly 100K ad elements. Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of inaccessible ads and their impact on overall website accessibility. Our findings reveal that 67% of websites experience increased accessibility violations due to ads, with common issues including Focus Visible (WCAG 2.4.7) and On Input (WCAG 3.2.2). Ad-serving technologies such as Taboola, DoubleClick, and RevContent frequently serve ads that do not meet WCAG standards. Inaccessible ads can significantly increase privacy risks for users with disabilities, as these ads may force them to engage with potentially unsafe or misleading content without proper accessibility features to protect their information.
