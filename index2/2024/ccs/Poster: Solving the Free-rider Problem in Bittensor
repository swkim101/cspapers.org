The design and operation of https://bittensor.com/ Bittensor is a decentralized and anonymous system where actors are incentivized by rewards to provide utilities. To ensure that it is a fair game, utilities obtained by copying other participants should be identified and punished. Our first contribution is to apply a commitment scheme to address this free-rider problem. Under appropriate conditions, we show theoretically and empirically that a commitment scheme dissuades copying by reducing the rewards to the copier. In particular, this dissuasive power is a function of the duration between the commit- and reveal-steps. Our second contribution is to propose the liquid alpha solution to amplify the effect of the commitment scheme.
