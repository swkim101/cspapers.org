Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a promising primitive for evaluating arbitrary circuits while maintaining the user's privacy with an optimal round of communications. However, extending FHE to Threshold FHE and transitioning from two-party to multi-party settings presents some challenges, such as distributed key generation or decryption. When focusing on distributed decryption, it requires an exponentially large ciphertext modulus, which degrades communication efficiency. In this PhD thesis research description, we explore possible solutions using polynomially large ciphertext modulus. As the first approach, we introduce a construction simpler than that of Boudgoust and Scholl [Asiacrypt'23] in the same setting, assuming the circuit privacy, which is challenging to achieve with polynomially large modulus in practice. We then introduce a new approach with additional communication rounds for distributed decryption using Multi-Party Computations (MPC). It can be viewed as a trade-off between the general multi-round MPC and the round-optimal Threshold FHEs but with a polynomially large ciphertext modulus rather than the exponentially large modulus. While keeping the round optimality for the homomorphic evaluations, the computation result can be obtained via a constant-round distributed decryption, regardless of the function to be evaluated.
