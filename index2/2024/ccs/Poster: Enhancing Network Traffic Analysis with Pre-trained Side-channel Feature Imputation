The recent advances in learning-based methodologies has underscored their efficacy in deducing patterns from the side-channel features of encrypted network traffic. Nonetheless, the distribution of these features has been identified as susceptible, particularly in the expansive and intricate network topologies characteristic of the modern Internet. The unpredictability of traffic bursts can result in packet loss during retransmission, thereby generating fragmented feature patterns. Unfortunately, current approaches struggle to adapt to such fragmented features, often leading to a substantial decline in performance. To surmount this challenge, this paper introduces a pre-training-based augmentation framework, denoted as N端wa, which imputes the side-channel features of encrypted network traffic. The crux of N端wa lies in its ability to reconstruct the side-channel features, with a particular focus on the temporal attributes of the missing packets within a traffic session. N端wa is comprised of a word-level Sequence2Embedding module, a Traffic Noise-based Self-supervised Pre-trained Masking Strategy, and a Traffic Side-Channel Feature Imputation Module. Experiments across four diverse real-world scenarios substantiate N端wa's capacity to restore the performance of prevalent temporal models while maintaining the integrity of the imputed features.
