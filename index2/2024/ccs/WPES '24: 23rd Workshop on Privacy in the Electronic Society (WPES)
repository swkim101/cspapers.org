We are excited to welcome you to the 23nd Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES'24). The WPES workshop has a long-standing tradition of showcasing work from academia, industry, and government presenting novel research on theoretical and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems. We requested two types of submissions: Full papers (up to 12 pages of results in the ACM double-column format, excluding bibliography and appendices) and short papers (up to 4 pages for results) that are preliminary or that simply require few pages to describe.
