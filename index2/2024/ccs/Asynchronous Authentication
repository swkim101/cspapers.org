A myriad of authentication mechanisms embody a continuous evolution from verbal passwords in ancient times to contemporary multi-factor authentication. Nevertheless, digital asset heists and numerous identity theft cases illustrate the urgent need to revisit the fundamentals of user authentication. We abstract away credential details and formalize the general, common case of asynchronous authentication, with unbounded message propagation time. Our model, which might be of independent interest, allows for eventual message delivery, while bounding execution time to maintain cryptographic guarantees. Given credentials' fault probabilities (e.g., loss or leak), we seek mechanisms with the highest success probability. We show that every mechanism is dominated by some Boolean mechanism -- defined by a monotonic Boolean function on presented credentials. We present an algorithm for finding approximately optimal mechanisms. Previous work analyzed Boolean mechanisms specifically, but used brute force, which quickly becomes prohibitively complex. We leverage the problem structure to reduce complexity by orders of magnitude. The algorithm is readily applicable to practical settings. For example, we revisit the common approach in cryptocurrency wallets that use a handful of high-quality credentials. We show that adding low-quality credentials improves security by orders of magnitude.
