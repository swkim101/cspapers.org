Login pages, including those for processes like sign-up, registration, and password recovery are interfaces that implement access control to company services or functionalities. Insufficient security on these pages could allow malicious individuals to gain access to services and network of an organization and launch attacks. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the security of 73.4k login interfaces of the 100-top European companies from the Fortune report, which we call EU100. We find over 9 million vulnerabilities, which we analyze from a technical perspective, and categorize them according to the hosting model. Our work provides details on the most commonly observed vulnerabilities on login pages across different sectors and according to the hosting strategy adopted by each company.
