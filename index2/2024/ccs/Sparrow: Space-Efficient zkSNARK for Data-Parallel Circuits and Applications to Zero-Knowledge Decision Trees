Space-efficient SNARKs aim to reduce the prover's space overhead which is one the main obstacles for deploying SNARKs in practice, as it can be prohibitively large (e.g., orders of magnitude larger than natively performing the computation). In this work, we propose Sparrow, a novel space-efficient zero-knowledge SNARK for data-parallel arithmetic circuits with two attractive features: (i) it is the first space-efficient scheme where, for a given field, the prover overhead increases with a multiplicative sublogarithmic factor as the circuit size increases, and (ii) compared to prior space-efficient SNARKs that work for arbitrary arithmetic circuits, it achieves prover space asymptotically smaller than the circuit size itself. Our key building block is a novel space-efficient sumcheck argument with improved prover time which may be of independent interest. Our experimental results for three use cases (arbitrary data parallel circuits, multiplication trees, batch SHA256 hashing) indicate Sparrow outperforms the prior state-of-the-art space-efficient SNARK for arithmetic circuits Gemini (Bootle et al., EUROCRYPT'22) by 3.2-28.7x in total prover space and 3.1-11.3x in prover time. We then use Sparrow to build zero-knowledge proofs of tree training and prediction, relying on its space efficiency to scale to large datasets and forests of multiple trees. Compared to a (non-space-efficient) optimal-time SNARK based on the GKR protocol, we observe prover space reduction of 16-240x for tree training while maintaining essentially the same prover and verifier times and proof size. Even more interestingly, our prover requires comparable space to natively perform the underlying computation. E.g., for a 400MB dataset, our prover only needs 1.4x more space than the native computation.
