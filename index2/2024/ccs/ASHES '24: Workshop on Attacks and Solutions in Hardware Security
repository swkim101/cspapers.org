The workshop on "Attacks and Solutions in HardwarE Security (ASHES)" welcomes any theoretical and practical works on hardware security, including attacks, solutions, countermeasures, proofs, classification, formalization, and implementations. Besides mainstream research, ASHES puts some focus on new and emerging scenarios: This includes the Internet of Things (IoT), nuclear weapons inspections, arms control, consumer and infrastructure security, or supply chain security, among others. ASHES also welcomes works on special purpose hardware, such as lightweight, low-cost, and energy-efficient devices, or non-electronic security systems.
