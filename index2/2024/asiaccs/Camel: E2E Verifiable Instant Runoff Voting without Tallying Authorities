Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is one example of ranked-choice voting. It provides many known benefits when used in elections, such as minimising vote splitting, ensuring few votes are wasted, and providing resistance to strategic voting. However, the voting and tallying procedures for IRV are much more complicated than those of plurality and are both error-prone and tedious. Many automated systems have been proposed to simplify these procedures in IRV. Some of these also employ cryptographic techniques to protect the secrecy of ballots and enable verification of the tally. Nearly all of these cryptographic systems require a set of trustworthy tallying authorities (TAs) to perform the decryption of votes and/or running of mix servers, which adds significant complexity to the implementation and election management. We address this issue by proposing Camel: an E2E verifiable solution for IRV that requires no TAs. Camel employs a novel representation and a universally verifiable shifting procedure for ballots that facilitate the elimination of candidates as required in an IRV election. We combine these with a homomorphic encryption scheme and zero-knowledge proofs to protect the secrecy of the ballots and enable any party to verify the well-formedness of the ballots and the correctness of the tally in an IRV election. We examine the security of Camel and prove it maintains ballot secrecy by limiting the learned information (namely the tally) against a set of colluding voters.
