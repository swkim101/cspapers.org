Programmable packet scheduling enables the integration of scheduling algorithms into switches without the need for hardware redesign. The Push-In First-Out (PIFO) queue facilitates a programmable packet scheduler, supporting a single scheduling algorithm flexibly. However, hierarchical scheduling required in Multi-Tenant Data Centers (MTDCs) remains non-programmable. Dynamic and diverse hierarchical scheduling algorithms necessitate alterations in both the number of PIFO queues and their connection topology, posing a significant challenge to support them on fixed hardware. In this paper, we introduce the virtualized PIFO (vPIFO) system, a hardware virtualization solution for programmable hierarchical packet scheduling in MTDCs. The vPIFO system, leveraging a single physical PIFO, can flexibly establish PIFO Trees with diverse shapes, thereby enabling network operators to customize fine-grained traffic scheduling. We present a high-performance and large-scale hardware design for the vPIFO and implement a prototype on FPGA and ASIC. The synthesized results on GlobalFoundries 28nm technology showcase that vPIFO can flexibly support hierarchical scheduling within the scale of 128 PIFO instances while achieving an impressive speed of 400 Gbps with 6 levels of hierarchical scheduling. To the best of our knowledge, vPIFO is the first hardware virtualization work for packet schedulers to support accurate programmable hierarchical scheduling.
