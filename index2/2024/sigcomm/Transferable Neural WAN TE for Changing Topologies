Recently, researchers have proposed ML-driven traffic engineering (TE) schemes where a neural network model is used to produce TE decisions in lieu of conventional optimization solvers. Unfortunately existing ML-based TE schemes are not explicitly designed to be robust to topology changes that may occur due to WAN evolution, failures or planned maintenance. In this paper, we present HARP, a neural model for TE explicitly capable of handling variations in topology including those not observed in training. HARP is designed with two principles in mind: (i) ensure invariances to natural input transformations (e.g., permutations of node ids, tunnel reordering); and (ii) align neural architecture to the optimization model. Evaluations on a multi-week dataset of a large private WAN show HARP achieves an MLU at most 11% higher than optimal over 98% of the time despite encountering significantly different topologies in testing relative to training data. Further, comparisons with state-of-the-art ML-based TE schemes indicate the importance of the mechanisms introduced by HARP to handle topology variability. Finally, when predicted traffic matrices are provided, HARP outperforms classic optimization solvers achieving a median reduction in MLU of 5 to 10% on the true traffic matrix.
