BGP data collection platforms as currently architected face fundamental challenges that threaten their long-term sustainability. Inspired by recent work, we analyze, prototype, and evaluate a new optimization paradigm for BGP collection. Our system scales data collection with two components: analyzing redundancy between BGP updates and using it to optimize sampling of the incoming streams of BGP data. An appropriate definition of redundancy across updates depends on the analysis objective. Our contributions include: a survey, measurements
