Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) represents an innovative paradigm for enhancing spectrum and hardware utilization for both sensing and communication. A specific type of ISAC, radar backscatter communication, involves low-power nodes embedding data onto radar signal reflections rather than generating new signals. However, existing radar backscatter techniques only facilitate uplink communication from the tag to the radar, neglecting downlink communication. This paper introduces BiScatter, an integrated radar backscatter communication and sensing system that enables simultaneous uplink and downlink backscatter communication, radar sensing, and backscatter localization. This is achieved through the design of chirp-slope-shift-keying modulation on top of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars, complemented by passive differential circuitry at the backscatter tags for low-power decoding. BiScatter also presents a packet structure compatible with off-the-shelf radars that offer accurate data processing and synchronization between radar and tag. We prototype this backscatter network in both 9GHz and 24GHz, demonstrating its capability to extend across different frequency bands. Our evaluations demonstrate that BiScatter supports two-way backscatter communication with BER lower than 10 âˆ’ 3 up to 7m range and centimeter-level tag localization accuracy on top of off-the-shelf FMCW radars. The presented approach significantly augments the versatility and efficiency of ISAC for low-power devices.
