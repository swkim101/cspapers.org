Sketches are useful for network measurement thanks to their low resource overheads and theoretically bounded accuracy. However, their network-wide deployment suffers from the trade-off between optimality and scalability: (1) Most solutions rely on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers to provide the optimal decisions. But they are time-consuming and can hardly scale to large-scale deployment scenarios. (2) While heuristics achieve scalability, they deteriorate resource and performance overheads. We propose Eagle, a framework that achieves scalable and near-optimal network-wide sketch deployment. Our key idea is to decompose network-wide sketch deployment into sub-problems. Such decomposition allows Eagle to (1) simultaneously optimize switch resource consumption and end-to-end performance (retaining optimality), and (2) incorporate time-saving techniques into sub-problem solving (achieving scalability). Compared to existing solutions, Eagle improves scalability by up to 255Ã— with negligible loss of optimality. It has also saved administrators in a production network days of efforts and reduced the operation time from O(hour) to O(second).
