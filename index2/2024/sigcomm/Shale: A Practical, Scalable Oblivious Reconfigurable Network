Circuit-switched technologies have long been proposed for handling high-throughput traffic in datacenter networks, but recent developments in nanosecond-scale reconfiguration have created the enticing possibility of handling low-latency traffic as well. The novel Oblivious Reconfigurable Network (ORN) design paradigm promises to deliver on this possibility. Prior work in ORN designs achieved latencies that scale linearly with system size, making them unsuitable for large-scale deployments. Recent theoretical work showed that ORNs can achieve far better latency scaling, proposing theoretical ORN designs that are Pareto optimal in latency and throughput. Inthiswork, we bridge multiple gaps between theory and practice to develop Shale, the first ORN capable of providing low-latency networking at datacenter scale while still guaranteeing high throughput. By interleaving multiple Pareto optimal schedules in parallel, both latency-and throughput-sensitive flows can achieve optimal performance. To achieve the theoretical low latencies in practice, we design a new congestion control mechanism which is best suited to the characteristics of Shale. In datacenter-scale packet simulations, our design compares favorably with both an in-network congestion mitigation strategy, modern receiver-driven protocols such as NDP, and an idealized analog for sender-driven protocols. We implement an FPGA-based prototype of Shale, achieving orders of magnitude better resource scaling than existing ORN proposals. Finally, we extend our congestion control solution to handle node and link failures.
