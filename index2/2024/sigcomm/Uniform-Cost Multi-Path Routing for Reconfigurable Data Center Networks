Reconfigurable data center networks (RDCNs) are arising as a promising data center network (DCN) design in the post-Moore’s law era. However, the constantly reconfigured network topology in RDCNs invalidates the assumption of using hop count as the cost metric for routing, e.g., the status quo Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing (ECMP) in traditional DCNs. Unfortunately, existing routing solutions in RDCNs stick to the old assumption and deliver suboptimal performance either high in latency or low in bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, we redefine the cost metric for RDCN routing with uniform cost to unify the effects of topology disruption and hop count on latency and bandwidth efficiency. We propose Uniform-Cost Multi-Path routing (UCMP), an ECMP equivalent for RDCNs, where minimizing uniform cost leads flows of various sizes to the right balance between latency and bandwidth efficiency. Our simulation shows that UCMP achieves 53% to 98% lower flow completion time (FCT) and 1.55 × bandwidth efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art RDCN routing strategy, and our testbed implementation demonstrates sustainable switch resource usage of UCMP as RDCNs scale.
