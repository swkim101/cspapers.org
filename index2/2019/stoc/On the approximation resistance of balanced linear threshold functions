In this paper, we show that there exists a balanced linear threshold function (LTF) which is unique games hard to approximate, refuting a conjecture of Austrin, Benabbas, and Magen. We also show that the almost monarchy predicate P(x) = sign((k−4)x1 + ∑i=2kxi) is approximable for sufficiently large k.
