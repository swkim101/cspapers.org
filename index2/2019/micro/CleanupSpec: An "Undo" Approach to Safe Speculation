Speculation-based attacks affect hundreds of millions of computers. These attacks typically exploit caches to leak information, using speculative instructions to cause changes to the cache state. Hardware-based solutions that protect against such forms of attacks try to prevent any speculative changes to the cache sub-system by delaying them. For example, InvisiSpec, a recent work, splits the load into two operations: the first operation is speculative and obtains the value and the second operation is non-speculative and changes the state of the cache. Unfortunately, such a "Redo" based approach typically incurs slowdown due to the requirement of extra operations for correctly speculated loads, that form the large majority of loads. In this work, we propose CleanupSpec, an "Undo"-based approach to safe speculation. CleanupSpec is a hardware-based solution that mitigates these attacks by undoing the changes to the cache sub-system caused by speculative instructions, in the event they are squashed on a mis-speculation. As a result, CleanupSpec prevents information leakage on the correct path of execution due to any mis-speculated load and is secure against speculation-based attacks exploiting caches (we demonstrate a proof-of-concept defense on Spectre Variant-1 PoC). Unlike a Redo-based approach which incurs overheads for correct-path loads, CleanupSpec incurs overheads only for the wrong-path loads that are less frequent. As a result, CleanupSpec only incurs an average slowdown of 5.1% compared to a non-secure baseline. Moreover, CleanupSpec incurs a modest storage overhead of less than 1 kilobyte per core, for tracking and undoing the speculative changes to the caches.
