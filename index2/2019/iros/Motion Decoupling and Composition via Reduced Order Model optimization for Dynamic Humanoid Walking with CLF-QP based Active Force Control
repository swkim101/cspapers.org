In this paper, 3D humanoid walking is decoupled into periodic and transitional motion, each of which is decoupled into planar walking in the sagittal and lateral plane. Reduced order models (ROMs), i.e. actuated Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (aSLIP) models and Hybrid-Linear Inverted Pendulum (H-LIP) models, are utilized for motion generation on the desired center of mass (COM) dynamics for each type of planar motion. The periodic motion is planned via point foot (underactuated) ROMs for dynamic motion with minimum ankle actuation, while the transitional motion is planned via foot-actuated ROMs for fast and smooth transition. Composition of the planar COM dynamics yields the desired COM dynamics in 3D, which is embedded on the humanoid via control Lyapunov function based Quadratic programs (CLF-QPs). Additionally, the ground reaction force profiles of the aSLIP walking are used as desired references for ground contact forces in the CLF-QPs for smooth domain transitions. The proposed framework is realized on a lower-limb exoskeleton in simulation wherein different walking motions are achieved.
