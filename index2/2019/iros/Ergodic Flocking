Designing efficient control strategies is well studied. Due to recent technological advancements and applications to the field of robotics, exploring ways to design optimal control for multi robot systems is gaining interest. In this respect, ergodicity has been successfully applied as an effective control technique for tracking and coverage. Generating flocking behaviour is a problem with many interesting special cases that include both tracking and coverage. The main contribution of this paper is the application of ergodicity to emulate flocking behaviour. Our approach is appealing, as control and communication are all assumed to be local, and so this behaviour is self-organized. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective.
