One of the critical challenges in deploying the cleaning robots is the completion of covering the entire area. Current tiling robots for area coverage have fixed forms and are limited to cleaning only certain areas. The reconfigurable system is the creative answer to such an optimal coverage problem. The tiling robot’s goal enables the complete coverage of the entire area by reconfiguring to different shapes according to the area’s needs. In the particular sequencing of navigation, it is essential to have a structure that allows the robot to extend the coverage range while saving energy usage during navigation. This implies that the robot is able to cover larger areas entirely with the least required actions. This paper presents a complete path planning (CPP) for hTetran, a polyabolo tiled robot, based on a TSP-based reinforcement learning optimization. This structure simultaneously produces robot shapes and sequential trajectories whilst maximizing the reward of the trained reinforcement learning (RL) model within the predefined polyabolo-based tileset. To this end, a reinforcement learning-based travel sales problem (TSP) with proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm was trained using the complementary learning computation of the TSP sequencing. The reconstructive results of the proposed RL-TSP-based CPP for hTetran were compared in terms of energy and time spent with the conventional tiled hypothetical models that incorporate TSP solved through an evolutionary based ant colony optimization (ACO) approach. The CPP demonstrates an ability to generate an ideal Pareto optima trajectory that enhances the robot’s navigation inside the real environment with the least energy and time spent in the company of conventional techniques.
