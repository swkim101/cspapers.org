Among the various pneumatic actuators, thin McKibben muscles are particularly attractive owing to their high performance in terms of high contraction ratio, high flexibility, and productivity. One of the challenges for thin McKibben muscles and other pneumatic actuators is the fact that they generally need air hoses and air sources like compressors. This necessarily leads to bulky systems. To solve this problem, we propose and study a new approach to driving pneumatic actuators that exploits electrolysis/synthesis of water by a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). This method could in-principle have high applicability to thin McKibben muscles. However, one challenge must still be addressed for the realization of an electrically driven thin McKibben muscle: the development of a tube-shaped soft PEFC. This paper proposes an electrically driven thin McKibben muscle with a tube-shaped soft PEFC realized through a flowing non-electrolytic plating method. First, the proposed thin McKibben muscle is briefly described. Then, a novel method for plating a tube-shaped soft PEFC using reflux is introduced, and its fundamental operation is tested. After the evaluation of the PEFC, we report a prototype realization of the proposed thin McKibben muscle. The developed prototype has a length of over 170 mm, a diameter of 4 mm, and high flexibility for bending. Finally, we elaborate on a driving experiment through which fundamental characteristics were experimentally evaluated. The prototype thin McKibben muscle succeeded in electrically controlling contraction and expansion motion with a flexible and bendable structure.
