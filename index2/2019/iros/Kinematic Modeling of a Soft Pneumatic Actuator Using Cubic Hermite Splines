Soft material robotic systems provide increased adaptability and flexibility compared to conventional rigid metal robots. The soft systems benefit from their inherent compliance, which enables them to be used in applications that require safe interaction between humans and robots or manipulation in cluttered environment. Despite advancements in recent years research on soft material robots still needs to make progress in terms of modeling for model based control or path planning. The high nonlinearity of soft material robots makes efficient and accurate modeling difficult. In this work we introduce a kinematic modeling approach based on cubic hermite splines. The method is applied to a soft pneumatic actuator and evaluated against the widely used constant curvature approach. The hermite spline offers the possibility of accurate shape reconstruction from simulated or measured deformation data. Both the shape of a robotâ€™s segment and its orientation can be approximated this way. In this paper a machine learning approach is used to train the kinematic relation between actuating pressure and configuration parameters.
