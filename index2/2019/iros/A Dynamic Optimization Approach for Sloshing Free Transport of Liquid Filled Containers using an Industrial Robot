The handling of liquid filled containers is a challenging task in industrial manufacturing processes. Without an appropriate trajectory sloshing of the liquid occurs during point-to-point motion. This paper presents a time optimal trajectory planning approach that is used for feedforward motion control and prevents the liquid filled container from sloshing. For this, a model of the liquid inside the container is included into the formulation of a constrained dynamic optimization problem to achieve rest-to-rest motion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles. The presented approach is validated by simulation and on an experimental setup using an industrial robot handling the container.
