This work presents a successful implementation of a nonlinear optimization-based Regularized Predictive Control (RPC) for legged locomotion on the MIT Cheetah 3 robot platform. Footstep placements and ground reaction forces at the contact feet are simultaneously solved for over a prediction horizon in real-time. Often in academic literature not enough attention is given to the implementation details that make the theory work in practice and many times it is precisely these details that end up being critical to the success or failure of the theory in real world applications. Nonlinear optimization for real-time legged locomotion control in particular is one of the techniques that has shown promise, but falls short when implemented on hardware systems subjected to computation limits and undesirable local minima. We discuss various algorithms and techniques developed to overcome some of the challenges faced when implementing nonlinear optimization-based controllers for dynamic legged locomotion.
