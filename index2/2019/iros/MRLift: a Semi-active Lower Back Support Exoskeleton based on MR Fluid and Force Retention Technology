Wearable robots suffer from issues of usability, cost-performance, and battery life. These drawbacks hinder the development of their market and their implementation in healthcare and industry. Back support exoskeletons in particular rely heavily on mechanical storing of energy but are still mostly using traditional mechanical elements and actuators to achieve the task. The core technology of our work, named MRLink, uses a smart fluid in combination with a compression spring to produce a unique energy store-and-release functionality. With only 5 Watts MRLink can produce over 500N of braking force. The braking force, variable viscosity, can be continuously controlled through the supply current. With appropriate selection of the spring and control method, the required assist energy can be acquired from body weight and movement dynamics, stored momentarily and, released at the appropriate timing to assist the body motion. The MRLink does not require an external power source like pneumatic actuators, does not require gearboxes and large batteries like DC motors, and comes in a compact package. Thus, this technology has the potential to significantly contribute to wearable exoskeletons in general, and back support exoskeletons in particular. In this work we present the development of a back support exoskeleton prototype based on MRLink, we describe its functional details, and a pilot test partially verifying the proposed functions.
