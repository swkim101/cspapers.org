Mixing is important for microfluidic systems and placing obstacles in a flow path for generating advection, or splitting/recombination flows, is a very popular method for enhancing the mixing. In this paper, we present experimental investigations on such microfluidic mixing with four different shapes of trapezoidal obstacles and tested them in a 1000-fold span of Reynolds number (Re). The obstacles have four different base ratios 1, 3, 6 and 9, which indicate the ratios between the upper and lower bases of a trapezoid. Two different dyes, yellow and blue, were used for visualizing and evaluating the performance of mixing. The results show that, when the base ratio is 1, the mixing surprisingly becomes worse with the increase of the flowrate. When the ratio is 3 or 6, the mixing performance is first reduced with the increase of Re and then went through a transition around Re of 10 before it rapidly increases. When the ratio is 9, two transition points were found around Re of 10 and 100, respectively. The work provides useful information for realizing shape-dependent mixing performance, as well as for developing an intelligent lab-on-a-chip system.
