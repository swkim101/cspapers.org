One of the big attractions of low-dimensional models for gait design has been the ability to compute solutions rapidly, whereas one of their drawbacks has been the difficulty in mapping the solutions back to the target robot. This paper presents a set of tools for rapidly determining solutions for “humanoids” without removing or lumping degrees of freedom. The main tools are: (1) C-FROST, an open-source C++ interface for FROST, a direct collocation optimization tool; and (2) multi-threading. The results will be illustrated on a 20-DoF floating-base model for a Cassie-series bipedal robot through numerical optimization and physical experiments.
