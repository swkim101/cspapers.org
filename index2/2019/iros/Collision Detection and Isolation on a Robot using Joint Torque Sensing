As robotic systems become more flexible and intelligent, they must be able to move into environments with a high degree of uncertainty or clutter, such as our homes, workplaces, and the outdoors. In these unstructured scenarios, it is possible that the body of the robot collides with its surroundings. As such, it would be desirable to characterise these contacts in terms of their location and interaction forces. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and isolating collisions between a robotic manipulator and its environment, using only on-board joint torque and position sensing. The algorithm is based on a particle filter and, under some assumptions, is able to identify the contact location anywhere on the robot body. It requires the robot to perform small exploratory movements, progressively integrating the new sensing information through a Bayesian framework. The approach was tested and benchmarked in simulation, with respect to its accuracy and robustness. Validation using a robot with joint torque sensing in a real environment demonstrated the applicability of the method to real-world scenarios.
