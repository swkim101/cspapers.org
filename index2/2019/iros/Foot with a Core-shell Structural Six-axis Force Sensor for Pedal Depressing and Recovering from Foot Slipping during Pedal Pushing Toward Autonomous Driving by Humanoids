To realize a robust automobile driving behavior of musculoskeletal tendon-driven humanoids, we developed a six-axis force measurement module with a core-shell structure. This sensor enables space saving, high load capacity and wholebody sensing at the same time. By developing a foot unit incorporating a core-shell structural force sensor on its toe, we realized behaviors of depressing a pedal and recovering from foot slipping during the depressing with a lifesized musculoskeletal humanoid ”Musashi”.
