This paper explores the use of robots to autonomously assemble parts with variations in colors and textures. Specifically, we focus on peg-in-hole assembly with some initial position uncertainty and holes located on surfaces of different colors and textures. Two in-hand cameras and a force-torque sensor are used to account for the position uncertainty. A program sequence comprising learning-based visual servoing, spiral search, and impedance control is implemented to perform the peg-in-hole task with feedback from the above sensors. Contributions are mainly made in the learning-based visual servoing component of the sequence, where a deep neural network is trained with various sets of synthetic data generated using the concept of domain randomization to predict where a hole is. In the experiments and analysis section, the network is analyzed and compared, and a real-world robotic system to insert pegs to holes using the proposed method is implemented. The results show that the implemented peg-in-hole assembly system can perform successful peg-in-hole insertions on surfaces with various colors and textures. It can generally speed up the entire peg-in-hole process, especially when the initial position uncertainty is large.
