In this study, a novel four degrees of freedom (DoF) robotic link mechanism and its torque analysis based on extended coaxial spherical joint module (E-CoSMo) are introduced. The E-CoSMo is a previously developed 4-DoF point-centered rotational parallel mechanism with coaxial actuators. The use of the E-CoSMo on robotic system is expected to improve dynamic performance since all actuators are mounted on fixed base. Furthermore, output torque is amplified in a specific axial direction, due to a coaxial parallel mechanism. Torque analysis of the mechanism is derived based on kinematics of a virtual 4-DoF serial linkages and the E-CoSMo. A virtual force-based position control simulation is performed for verifying the torque analysis. Due to the valid torque analysis, the norm of position error is less than 0. 7mm. It is confirmed that the output torque is amplified compare to actuator torques, which is a special feature of the E-CoSMo. Control experiments using prototype are also carried out to validate the feasibility.
