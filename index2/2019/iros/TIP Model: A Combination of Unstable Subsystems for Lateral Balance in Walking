Balancing or postural stability is one of important locomotor subfunctions in bipedal gaits. The inverted pendulum and virtual pivot point (VPP) are common modeling approaches to analyze balance control in human and robot walking. In this paper, we employ the VPP concept to investigate posture control in the frontal plane. The outcomes demonstrate that unlike posture control in the sagittal plane, the VPP in the frontal plane is place below center of mass. This finding explains a novel hybrid strategy for lateral stability in human walking. The here proposed model shows that switching between unstable inverted virtual pendulums generate stable posture control in the frontal plane. This outcome is consistent within a group of seven human subjects walking at normal and slow speeds.
