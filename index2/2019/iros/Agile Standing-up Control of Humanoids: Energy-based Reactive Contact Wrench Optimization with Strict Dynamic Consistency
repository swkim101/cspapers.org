This paper presents a dynamic whole-body control method for humanoids to render agile and stable standing-up motion based on energy concepts. First, to cope with the standing-up problem with multiple contacts in hierarchical tasks, an enhanced operational-space based whole-body control (WBC) framework is proposed, which offers optimal torque resolutions guaranteeing strict dynamic consistency with inequality constraints formulated by quadratic programming. Second, agile standing-up control strategy with dynamic push and rise actions is newly developed based on the notion of the total energy. The optimal pushing wrenches at contacts are computed to obtain sufficient energy to accelerate the center-of-mass (CoM) of the robot as quick as possible, and the total energy is then controlled to attain rapid rise-up motion and to stabilize the body of the robot. Consequently, the robot can effectively and actively stand up to recover from a certain pose in which cannot be accomplished by any quasi-static motion. The proposed method is numerically experimented and validated with dynamic parameters from the real humanoid COMAN+, fulfilling different types of standing-up actions.
