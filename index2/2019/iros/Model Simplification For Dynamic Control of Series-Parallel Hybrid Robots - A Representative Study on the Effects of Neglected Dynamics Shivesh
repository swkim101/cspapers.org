It is becoming increasingly popular to use parallel mechanisms as modular subsystem units in the design of various robots for their superior stiffness, payload-to-weight ratio and dynamic properties. This leads to series-parallel hybrid robotic systems which pose several challenges in their modeling and control e.g. resolution of loop closure constraints, large size of their spanning tree etc. These robots are typically position-controlled and when equipped with real time dynamic control, often a simplified inverse dynamic model of these systems is utilized. However, the trade-offs of this model simplification has not been studied previously. This paper presents a representative study of the neglected dynamics by introducing some error metrics which are useful in highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of such model simplification. The study is guided with the help of a series-parallel humanoid leg which has been recently developed at DFKI-RIC.
