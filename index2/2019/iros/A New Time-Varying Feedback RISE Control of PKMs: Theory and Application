In this paper, we propose a novel time-varying feedback control strategy based on the Robust Integral of the Sign of the Error (RISE). The main motivation is to enhance the tracking performance of RISE controller at high dynamic operating conditions. RISE control law ensures a semi-global asymptotic tracking without introducing severe restrictions on the uncertain and nonlinearly parametrized systems. More nonlinearities are added to the original RISE control law by replacing the static feedback gains with nonlinear ones which depend on the system state variables. The proposed contribution is implemented in real-time experiments on a non-redundant three-degrees-of-freedom parallel manipulator named Delta. Comparing to the standard RISE controller, experimental results show better tracking performances of the proposed time-varying feedback RISE controller.
