Humanoid robots are expected to conduct tasks on behalf of humans in places such as a disaster scattered environment. Although humanoid robots have potentials to walk on uneven ground unlike wheeled robots, it is difficult to reach a given destination without falling down based on only visual information. In this paper, to reach the destination safely, we propose the autonomous safe locomotion system applying vision and sole reaction force to the footstep planning. Considering force information in addition to visual information, the robot can plan a path avoiding unstable footholds. The planned path is safer than a path which is planned based on only visual information. In our system, the robot checks if the foothold is safe or not by the foothold ascertainment motion. In addition to that, the robot saves the results of the motion to the database with the foothold label given by the visual classifier. To judge foothold safety, stiffness of the foothold is estimated from the reaction force and stepping amount. We propose the system considering these requirements for safe locomotion for bipedal robots and show experimental results using a real bipedal robot CHIDORI.
