In an autonomous scientific exploration system, the terrain map generated from mapping process integrates sensing information from multiple aspects and lays the base for decision making processes. With the increasing challenges in planetary exploration, equipping planetary rovers with the principles of terramechanics is becoming more and more common, especially on rough or intricate terrain. However, it is difficult for conventional maps with elevation information only to reflect terrain mechanical properties, which play important roles in terramechanics-based simulation or motion control. This study extracts the dominant parameters in terrain bearing and shearing models, and presents a multi-layered grid map with fundamental geometric and mechanical elements. A corresponding mapping scheme based on dense visual input is designed to reconstruct elevation in the map and predict terrain mechanical parameters of the entire visual field. Experiments are conducted to verify the practicability of the approach proposed in a Mars emulation yard with a rover prototype.
