In this paper a force controller via energy tanks is implemented for novel applications in aerial contour follow. This control approach allows the aerial vehicle to trace out a boundary whilst in continuous contact with a surface by means of an actively compliant manipulator. This represents the first step towards tactile-based aerial navigation, which can be used to complement more traditional mapping approaches such as visual SLAM. Key results show that the energy-based approach can be used to apply a continuous shear force through the manipulator while the vehicle remains in contact with the surface of interest. Results also show the robustness and repeatability of this approach for prolonged aerial interaction, and the potential for future use in more complex, un-modeled environments.
