Upon the advent of Industry 4.0, collaborative robotics and intelligent automation gain more and more traction for enterprises to improve their production processes. In order to adapt to this trend, new programming, learning and collaborative techniques are investigated. Program-bydemonstration is one of the techniques that aim to reduce the burden of manually programming collaborative robots. However, this is often limited to teaching to grasp at a certain position, rather than grasping a certain object. In this paper, we propose a method that learns to grasp an arbitrary object from visual input. While other learning-based approaches for robotic grasping require collecting a large dataset, manually or automatically labeled in a real or simulated world, our approach requires a single demonstration.We present results on grasping various objects with the Franka Panda collaborative robot after capturing a single image from a wrist mounted RGB camera. From this image we learn a robot controller with a convolutional neural network to adapt to changes in the objectâ€™s position and rotation with less than 5 minutes of training time on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, achieving over 90% grasp success rate.
