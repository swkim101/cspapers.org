We present a novel transformable multilinked aerial robot which consists of link modules with 1 DoF thrust vectoring mechanism. Commonly used UAV is underactuated due to its simplicity and high flight duration, but can not control the position and orientation independently. To overcome this problem, fully actuated multirotor aerial robots have been developed. In our previous work we developed fully actuated multilinked aerial robot which can transform in the air. However, the transformation range was limited because of a singularity problem. In this paper we propose a new design of link module with a tilted rotor and 1 DoF thrust vectoring joint which enables to avoid singularity forms and keep the flight stable during transformation. We describe modeling and control for the fully actuated multilinked multirotor. Then we propose a transformation planning method utilizing the 1 DoF thrust vectoring angle with consideration of guaranteed minimum force/torque. Finally we perform an aerial transformation experiment with a real platform to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed design and methods.
