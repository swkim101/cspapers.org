The biomimetic approach in robotics is promising: nature has found many good solutions through millions of years of evolution. However, creating a design that enables fast and energy-efficient locomotion remains a major challenge. This paper focuses on the development of a full leg mechanism for a fast and energy-efficient 4-legged robot inspired by a cheetah morphology. In particular, we analyze how the allocation of flexible elements and their stiffness affects the cost of transport and peak power characteristics for vertical jumps and a galloping motion. The study includes the femur and full leg mechanismâ€™s locomotory behavior simulation, capturing its interaction with the ground.
