Cutting skills are important for robots to acquire not only because of a need from kitchen automation, but also because of the technical challenge for robotic manipulation. Modeling of fracture and deformation during a cutting action, often based on the finite element method (FEM), provides the force and shape information used in knife control to implement a skill such as slice, chop, or dice. However, an object’s 3D mesh model can be computationally prohibitive for achieving a desired accuracy since numerous tiny elements must be used near the knife’s moving edge. To address this issue, we represent the object as evenly spaced slices normal to the cutting plane such that cutting of each slice requires only a 2D mesh. Fracture and force can be then interpolated between every two adjacent slices. Experiment with an Adept arm and an ATI force/torque (F/T) sensor has demonstrated reasonable accuracy in force ad shape modeling.
