Contact-based operation in moving process is a challenging problem for aerial manipulators. It requires the whole system to maintain steady contact with external environment, to track some predefined trajectories on surfaces, and simultaneously to present some fixed contact force. Aiming at this problem, a hybrid force/motion control framework is proposed in this paper. In this framework, contact force control and position control are performed separately in two orthogonal subspaces: constrained space and free-flight space. To control the contact force, the closed-loop unmanned aerial vehicle is first theoretically shown to behave dynamically as a spring-mass-damper system. Further, an inverse-dynamics-based controller is proposed. To control the moving along the contact surface, trajectory planning and position controller are combined to achieve the steady behavior in a free-flight subspace. In the end, an aerial manipulator system with a roller-type end-effector was designed, and practical flight experiments was performed. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective and validity.
