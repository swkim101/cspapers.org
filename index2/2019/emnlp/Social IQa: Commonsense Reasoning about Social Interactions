Research Agenda As a researcher I strive to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that foster positive social interactions and lead to more equitable systems. My work focuses on pragmatic formalisms that measure factuality, intent, and social bias of language. For example, given the false statement “Water boiled with garlic cures coronavirus,” my work uses commonsense reasoning to bridge the gap between what is explicitly stated and implicit knowledge like implied actions, e.g. “people should drink garlic water.” These formalisms can support building AI systems to address critical applications like fact-checking and content moderation. I have identified three key thrusts of research to investigate:
