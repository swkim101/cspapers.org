In taxi ride-sharing, multiple customers are allotted to the same taxi as long as they are compatible, i.e., if none of them suffers a detour beyond a permissible threshold. To attract customers to ride-sharing, taxi operators promise a reduced fare upfront. As a result, if the taxi fails to pair the initial customer with additional compatible passengers, the taxi operator incurs a financial loss. Hence, it is important to ensure that the taxi finds compatible customers once it has picked up the initial customer. In the current scenario, the appearance of subsequent compatible customers is left to luck: a taxi moves along the shortest (or quickest) path for the existing customer and hopes to find additional compatible customers on its way. In this paper, we ask: Is the shortest path the optimal path for ride-sharing? To investigate this question, we develop a route recommendation algorithm called Share, which predicts the route with the highest probability of finding compatible customers, while staying within the detour limits. Through extensive evaluations on real datasets, we show that Share reduces failure rate in ride-sharing by up to 40%, while also improving waiting time for customers by 20%. Technically, the route recommendation problem is NP-hard. We overcome this bottleneck, by reducing the search space of the entire road network into a smaller directed acyclic graph, on which we perform dynamic programming to identify the optimal route. This strategy allows us to answer queries within 0.2 seconds, and thereby making Share deployable on real road conditions.
