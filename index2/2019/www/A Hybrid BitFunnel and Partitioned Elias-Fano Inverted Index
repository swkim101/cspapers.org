Search engines encounter a time vs. space trade-off: search responsiveness (i.e., a short query response time) comes at the cost of increased index storage. We propose a hybrid method which uses both (a) the recently published mapping-matrix-style index BitFunnel (BF) for search efficiency, and (b) the state-of-the-art Partitioned Elias-Fano (PEF) inverted-index compression method. We use this proposed hybrid method to minimize time while satisfying a fixed space constraint, and to minimize space while satisfying a fixed time constraint. Each document is stored using either BF or PEF, and we use a local search strategy to find an approximately optimal BF-PEF partition. Since performing full experiments on each candidate BF-PEF partition is impractically slow, we use a regression model to predict the time and space costs resulting from candidate partitions (space accuracy 97.6%; time accuracy 95.2%). Compared with a hybrid mathematical index (Ottaviano et al., 2015), the time cost is reduced by up to 47% without significantly exceeding its size. Compared with three mathematical encoding methods, the hybrid BF-PEF index allows performing list intersection between around 16% to 76% faster (without significantly increasing the index size). Compared with BF, the index size is reduced by 45% while maintaining an intersection time comparable to that of BF.
