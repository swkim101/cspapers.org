We present GraviTIE (Global Representation and Visualization of Text and Image Embeddings, pronounced ”gravity”), an interactive visualization system for large-scale image datasets. GraviTIE operates on datasets consisting of images equipped with unstructured and semi-structured text, relying on multi-modal unsupervised learning methods to produce an interactive similarity map. Users interact with the similarity map through pan and zoom operations, as well as keyword-oriented queries. GraviTIE makes no assumptions about the form, scale, or content of the data, allowing it to be used for exploratory analysis, assessment of unsupervised learning methods, data curation and quality control, data profiling, and other purposes where flexibility and scalability are paramount. We demonstrate GraviTIE on three real datasets: 500k images from the Russian misinformation dataset from Twitter, 2 million art images, and 5 million scientific figures.
