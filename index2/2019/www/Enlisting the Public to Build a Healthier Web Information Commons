Over the past three years, platforms, governments and a plethora of nonprofit initiatives have prioritized fighting online misinformation through a variety of different means. Yet the current framework is too fragmented to deliver global results. The big tech platforms have data, but no public accountability. Governments (mostly) have democratic legitimacy, but little information on what is actually going on in the platforms they're itching to regulate. And nonprofit initiatives too often lack the scale to affect change at the level needed. What if we came up with a dramatically new deliberative process that involves a global community of concerned citizens ready to share information and participate in consultations to improve collective decision-making? What if a more accountable, diverse and verifiable Web were still possible?
