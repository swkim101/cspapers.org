The curation of a knowledge base is a crucial but costly task. In this work, we propose to take advantage of the edit history of the knowledge base in order to learn how to correct constraint violations. Our method is based on rule mining, and uses the edits that solved some violations in the past to infer how to solve similar violations in the present. The experimental evaluation of our method on Wikidata shows significant improvements over baselines.
