With the flourishing of location based social networks, posting check-ins has become a common practice to document one's daily life. Users usually do not consider check-in records as violations of their privacy. However, through analyzing two real-world check-in datasets, our study shows that check-in records are vulnerable to linkage attacks. Specifically, adversary is able to uniquely re-identify over 52<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="li-ieq1-2947416.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>66 percent users in other anonymous mobility datasets and 60<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="li-ieq2-2947416.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>80 percent users have more than 60 percent probability leaking unreported mobility records. In addition, we further demonstrate that the privacy sensitivity of check-in records can be more accurately measured by including the information of additional mobility data compared with only looking at check-ins. Based on this observation, we design a <italic>partition-and-group</italic> framework to integrate the information of check-ins and additional mobility data to attain a novel privacy criterion—<italic><inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$k^{\tau, l}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="li-ieq3-2947416.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-anonymity</italic>. It ensures adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge cannot use check-ins to re-identify users in other anonymous datasets or learning unreported mobility records. The proposed framework achieves favorable performance against state-of-art baseline in terms of improving check-in utility by 24<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="li-ieq4-2947416.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>57 percent while providing stronger privacy guarantee at the same time. We believe this study will open a new angle in attaining both privacy-preserving and useful check-in services.
