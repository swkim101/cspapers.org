Rumors can cause devastating consequences to individual and/or society. Analysis shows that widespread of rumors typically results from deliberately promoted information campaigns which aim to shape collective opinions on the concerned news events. In this paper, we attempt to fight such chaos with itself to make automatic rumor detection more robust and effective. Our idea is inspired by adversarial learning method originated from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We propose a GAN-style approach, where a generator is designed to produce uncertain or conflicting voices, complicating the original conversational threads in order to pressurize the discriminator to learn stronger rumor indicative representations from the augmented, more challenging examples. Different from traditional data-driven approach to rumor detection, our method can capture low-frequency but stronger non-trivial patterns via such adversarial training. Extensive experiments on two Twitter benchmark datasets demonstrate that our rumor detection method achieves much better results than state-of-the-art methods.
