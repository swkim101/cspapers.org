The text snippets presented in web search results provide users with a slice of page content that they can quickly scan to help inform their click decisions. However, little is known about how these snippets are generated or how they relate to a user's search query. Motivated by the growing body of evidence suggesting that search engine rankings can influence undecided voters, we conducted an algorithm audit of the political partisanship of Google Search snippets relative to the webpages they are extracted from. To accomplish this, we constructed lexicon of partisan cues to measure partisanship and construct a set of left- and right-leaning search queries. Then, we collected a large dataset of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) by running our partisan queries and their autocomplete suggestions on Google Search. After using our lexicon to score the machine-coded partisanship of snippets and webpages, we found that Google Search's snippets generally amplify partisanship, and that this effect is robust across different types of webpages, query topics, and partisan (left- and right-leaning) queries.
