The problem of selecting a group of vertices under certain constraints that maximize their joint centrality arises in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we extend the notion of current flow closeness centrality (CFCC) to a set of vertices in a graph, and investigate the problem of selecting a subset S to maximizes its CFCC C(S), with the cardinality constraint |S| = k. We show the NP-hardness of the problem, but propose two greedy algorithms to minimize the reciprocal of C(S). We prove the approximation ratios by showing the monotonicity and supermodularity. A proposed deterministic greedy algorithm has an approximation factor and cubic running time. To compare with, a proposed randomized algorithm gives -approximation in nearly-linear time, for any ? > 0. Extensive experiments on model and real networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, with the randomized algorithm being applied to massive networks with more than a million vertices.
