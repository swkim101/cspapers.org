In this paper, we address the keyphrase extraction problem as sequence labeling and propose a model that jointly exploits the complementary strengths of Conditional Random Fields that capture label dependencies through a transition parameter matrix consisting of the transition probabilities from one label to the neighboring label, and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory networks that capture hidden semantics in text through the long distance dependencies. Our results on three datasets of scholarly documents show that the proposed model substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches for keyphrase extraction.
