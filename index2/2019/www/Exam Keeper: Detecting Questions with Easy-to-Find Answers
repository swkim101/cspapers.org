We present Exam Keeper, a tool to measure the availability of answers to exam questions for ESL students. Exam Keeper targets two major sources of answers: the web, and apps. ESL teachers can use it to estimate which questions are easily answered by information on the web or by using automatic question answering systems, which should help teachers avoid such questions on their exams or homework to prevent students from misusing technology.
