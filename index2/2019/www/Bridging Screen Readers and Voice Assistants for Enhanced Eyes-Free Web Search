People with visual impairments often rely on screen readers when interacting with computer systems. Increasingly, these individuals also make extensive use of voice-based virtual assistants (VAs). We conducted a survey of 53 people who are legally blind to identify the strengths and weaknesses of both technologies, as well as the unmet opportunities at their intersection. We learned that virtual assistants are convenient and accessible, but lack the ability to deeply engage with content (e.g., read beyond the first few sentences of Wikipedia), and the ability to get a quick overview of the landscape (list alternative search results & suggestions). In contrast, screen readers allow for deep engagement with content (when content is accessible), and provide fine-grained navigation & control, but at the cost of increased complexity, and reduced walk-up-and-use convenience. In this demonstration, we showcase VERSE, a system that combines the positive aspects of VAs and screen readers, and allows other devices (e.g., smart watches) to serve as optional input accelerators. Together, these features allow people with visual impairments to deeply engage with web content through voice interaction.
