Advances in mobile, wearable and embedded sensing technology have created new opportunities for research into a variety of health conditions. This has led to the field of mobile health (mHealth), which covers a full spectrum of works, including but not limited to disease surveillance, treatment support, epidemic outbreak tracking, and chronic disease management. An important sub-field which has been rising in the past years is the application of mHealth technology in the field of mental and behavioral health, enabling researchers to study stress, depression, mood, personality change, schizophrenia, physical activity and addictive behavior, among other things.
