The 8th Workshop on Pervasive Urban Applications (PURBA 2019) aims to build on the success of the previous workshops organized in conjunction with the Pervasive (2011-12) and UbiComp (2013, 2015-18) to continue to disseminate the results of the latest research outcomes and developments of ubiquitous computing technologies for urban applications. All workshop contributions are published in supplemental proceedings of the UbiComp 2019 conference and included in the ACM Digital Library.
