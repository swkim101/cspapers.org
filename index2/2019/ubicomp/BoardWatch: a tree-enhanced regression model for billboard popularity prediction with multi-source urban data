Predicting the popularity of outdoor billboards is crucial for many applications such as guidance of billboard placement and estimation of advertising cost. Recently, some researchers have worked on leveraging single traffic data to access the performance of billboards, which often leads to coarse-grained performance estimation and undesirable ad placement plans. To solve the problem, we propose a data-driven system, named BoradWatch, for fine-grained billboard popularity prediction. In particular, we extract three types of critical features based on multi-source urban data, including billboard profile, geographic feature and commercial feature. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model named Tree-Enhanced Regression Model (TERM) based on extracted features for prediction, which takes full advantage of the feature transformation of decision trees model to enhance the prediction performance of the linear model. Experiment results on real-world outdoor billboard data and multi-source urban data demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.
