Augmented Reality (AR) adds additional layers of information on top of real environments. Recently, Pervasive AR extends this concept through an AR experience that is continuous in space, being aware of and responsive to the user's context and pose (position and orientation). This paper focus on an exploratory user study with 27 participants meant to better understand some aspects of Pervasive AR, such as how users explore, select, recognize and manipulate virtual content in uninterrupted AR experiences, as well as their preferences. The approach used to provide this sort of engaging experiences allows the creation of indoor persistent location-based experiences, with a high level of accuracy and resilience to changes in dynamic environments. Results concerning user acceptance of uninterrupted AR experiences were encouraging. In particular, users were positively impressed by the continuous display of virtual content and were willing to use this technology more often and in different contexts.
