Commercial smart eyewear products designed for day-today use have drastically improved in recent years. However, the current utility and applications of smart eyewear can be easily substituted with other smart wearables. In this paper, we propose the integration of an artificial agent capable of performing gaze-based intention recognition on smart eyewear to extend the device capabilities. As smart eyewear affords unobtrusive tracking of the user's gaze while the user interacts naturally with the world, it serves as a perfect platform to discreetly identify the user's intentions through gaze, allowing the agent to provide relevant, personalised and proactive assistance. We believe that integration our proposed agent in smart eyewear is an achievable goal in the coming years with the rapid progressions in computer vision, wearable technology and socially interactive artificial agents. This paper, therefore, discusses our proof-of-concept intention-aware agent, followed by its future opportunities and existing challenges for its integration in smart eyewear.
