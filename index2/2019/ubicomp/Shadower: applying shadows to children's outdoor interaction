Shadows are ubiquitous in our life. Through the phenomena of shadows, we focus on a novel way which can change people's perspectives of observing surroundings and create a natural outdoor interaction for children in their daily life. In this paper, we present a mobile AR game which uses shadows as clues with a treasure hunting game mechanism to make a connection with children and outdoor surroundings. In the field experiment at a kindergarten, children(n=6) participated in the outdoor interaction experience with Shadower. We conducted a preliminary user study with Smileyometer strategy to evaluate children's reaction to our prototype. Qualitative results indicate that the use of shadows from the outdoor environment as AR makers have the potential to expand the approach to facilitate children's engagement through their outdoor interaction.
