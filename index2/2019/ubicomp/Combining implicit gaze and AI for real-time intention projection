Intention recognition is the process of using behavioural cues to infer an agent's goals or future behaviour. In face-to-face communication, our gaze implicitly signals our point of interest within the environment and therefore, inadvertently leaks our unspoken intentions to others. In our published body of work, we leverage this implicit function of gaze together with the tendency of humans to plan before executing their actions, resulting in an artificial agent that can project humans intentions while human players engage in a competitive game. In this demo, we created a path-planning game to demonstrate the capability of our artificial agent in a playful manner. The agent projects future plans of players by combining the use of implicit gaze of human players with an AI planning-based model. The demo aims to illustrate that gaze is intentional and that socially interactive agents can harness gaze as a natural input implicitly to assist humans collaboratively with knowledge of their intentions.
