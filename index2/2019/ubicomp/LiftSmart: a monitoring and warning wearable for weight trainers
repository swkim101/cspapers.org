In this paper, we demonstrate LiftSmart, a novel smart wearable to detect, track and analyse weight training activities. LiftSmart is the first wearable for weight training that is based on unsupervised machine learning techniques to eliminate the use of labelled data, which is expensive to collect, computationally intensive, and requires the tuning of multiple key parameters.
