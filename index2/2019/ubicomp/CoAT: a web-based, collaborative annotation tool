During the dataset creation process for activity and context recognition research, manual annotation of ground truth events can be a time-consuming and error-prone task. In the typical use case, one or more annotators have to go over the videos recorded during the experiments and label what happens at what time of the experiment. In this paper, we introduce a new open source, web-based tool to assist researchers to create event annotations easily and to leverage group work by supporting intuitive collaboration features. We provide an overview of the main technical components and their respective technologies used to realize the tool. The first version of the tool with the core features for video annotation is implemented and publicly available. By using containerized services, the deployment involves only a small number of steps and dependencies. We point out some possible direction for future development and customization options for using the tool in other annotation tasks.
