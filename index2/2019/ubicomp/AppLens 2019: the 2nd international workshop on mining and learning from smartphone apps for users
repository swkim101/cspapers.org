Smartphone apps are becoming ubiquitous in our everyday life. Apps on smartphones sense users' behaviors and activities, providing a lens for understanding users, which is an important point in the community of ubiquitous computing. In UbiComp 2018, we successfully held the first International workshop AppLens 2018: mining and learning from smartphone apps for users. In UbiComp 2019, we would like to run the second International workshop AppLens 2019. It seeks for participants interested in characterizing users from their use of smartphone apps, discovering cultural and social phenomenon by analyzing app usage, recognizing app usage behaviors, studying smartphone apps, user privacy issues, etc. In order to attract more participants, we will open two app datasets. This workshop will include paper sessions, invited talks, and a panel session, to provide a forum for the participants to communicate and discuss issues to promote the emerging research field. Moreover, we will select a few accepted papers to be extended and published in a prestigious journal special issue.
