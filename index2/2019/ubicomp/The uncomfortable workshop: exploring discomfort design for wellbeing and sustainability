According to the latest science of human performance, we are wired to thrive and adapt from discomfort. This workshop explores how to leverage that science to improve human wellbeing and to improve sustainability as a side-effect of designing ubiquitous technology to prepare, practice and perform discomfort, for social benefit. We will use Design Jams as a key activity to explore and build up this Uncomfortable Design Methodology. There will be prizes.
