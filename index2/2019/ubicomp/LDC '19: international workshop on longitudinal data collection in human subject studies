Individuals increasingly use mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous devices capable of unobtrusive collection of vast amounts of scientifically rich personal data over long periods (months to years), and in the context of their daily life. However, numerous human and technological factors challenge longitudinal data collection, often limiting research studies to very short data collection periods (days to weeks), spawning recruitment biases, and affecting participant retention over time. This workshop is designed to bring together researchers involved in longitudinal data collection studies to foster an insightful exchange of ideas, experiences, and discoveries to improve the studies' reliability, validity, and perceived meaning of longitudinal mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous data collection for the participants.
