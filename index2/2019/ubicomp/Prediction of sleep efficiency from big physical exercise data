Physical exercise can improve sleep quality. However, how to perform physical exercise to achieve the best possible improvements is not clear. In this article, we build predictive models based on volume real data collected from wearable devices to predict the sleep efficiency related to users' daily exercise information. As far as we know, this is the first study to investigate insights of prediction of sleep efficiency from volume physical exercise data collected from real world.
