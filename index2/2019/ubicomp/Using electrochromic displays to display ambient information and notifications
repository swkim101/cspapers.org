Ambient Displays are a promising means to reduce notification overload and work towards the vision of Calm Computing. In this paper, we present electrochromic displays as a novel class of displays to convey information. electrochromic displays are non-light-emitting, flexible, free-form, transparent, energy-efficient, easily integrated, and slow-switching, making them ideal candidates for information that changes over time and does not require immediate user attention. We describe the key features of electrochromic displays as well as application areas and provide an outlook into future developments of the technology.
