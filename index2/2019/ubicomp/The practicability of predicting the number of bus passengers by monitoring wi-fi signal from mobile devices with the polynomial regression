Traveling by public transportation is a daily activity for many people, so the number of passenger can provide useful congestion information to passengers. In this paper, we describe a practicability study of using the polynomial regression method for predicting the number of waiting passengers at the bus stop by passively monitoring the activity Wi-Fi signal from mobile devices. We also show our experimental results by comparing the predicted number of passengers to the actually observed number of passengers at the bus stop.
