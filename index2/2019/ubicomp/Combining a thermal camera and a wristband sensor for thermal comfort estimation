We propose a method to estimate thermal comfort by combining a thermal camera and a wristband sensor. A wristband sensor continuously monitors physiological data (i.e. heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity). On the other hand, a thermal camera captures temperature distribution of facial parts only when a user's face is in the camera frame. When a thermal camera cannot capture the user's face, our method estimates thermal comfort based on the current features obtained by the wristband sensor and the past estimation results using the thermal camera. To investigate the effectiveness in the reduction of energy consumption by air conditioning, we evaluate our method by collecting data from 15 subjects for 128 days. The results show our method achieves F-measure of 0.85 for estimating thermal comfort allowing shifts to the neighboring classes.
