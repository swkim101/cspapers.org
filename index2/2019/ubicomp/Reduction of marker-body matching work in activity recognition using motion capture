In this paper, activity recognition is performed using an optical motion capture system that can measure three-dimensional position information of reflective markers attached to the body. The individual markers detected by motion capture are automatically associated with which part of the body they are attached to. However, due to the overlapping of obstacles and other body parts and misplacement of the markers, these may be hidden from the camera and enter a blind spot, which may frequently cause a marker to be associated to different body parts erroneously. Usually, these errors need to be corrected manually after measurement, but this work is very time consuming, cumbersome and requires some skill. In this research, it is thought that there is no problem in recognizing the activity even if the process of spending the effort of correcting the correspondence between the marker after measurement and the body is omitted in the activity recognition using the motion capture. Because feature quantities are extracted from activity data when performing action recognition, even if an error occurs in part of the marker data, the effect is small because the correct feature quantities are selected and other marker data can compensate for an error. In addition, in this paper, we proposed a method to recognize the activity using the data when the human body template preparation required before Mocap data measurement is omitted, which is one of marker body matching work. The verification showed that even if the marker body matching operation was omitted, it was possible to recognize the action with high accuracy.
