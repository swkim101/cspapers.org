Blossoming coffee culture give a rise to coffee shops in many cities around the world. In today's coffee industry, it is no longer customer satisfaction that is important but the customer experience. This work presents a development of an intelligent coffee plate system called iCoff, which aims at enhancing coffee shop's customer experience with a platform that allows a barista to communicate with a coffee drinker as well as enables the coffee drinker to learn more about his/her coffee, such as ingredients, temperature, and weight through an interactive coffee plate. This paper describes its hardware and software components as well as a preliminary user experience study result. It is an applied ubiquitous/pervasive technology in the context of coffee shop experience as part of our today's urban living.
