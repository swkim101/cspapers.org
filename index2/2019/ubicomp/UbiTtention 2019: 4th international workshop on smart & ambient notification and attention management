Users are increasingly being confronted with a tremendous amount of information proactively provided via notifications from versatile applications and services, through multiple devices and screens in their environment ubiquitously. However, human attention is limited. Further, the latest computing trends including versatile IoT devices, and contexts, such as smart cities and vehicles, are further competing for limited attention. To counter this challenge, "attention management", including attention representation, sensing, prediction, analysis, and adaptive behavior is needed in our computing systems. Following the successful UbiTtention 2016, 2017 and 2018 workshops with up to 50 participants, the UbiTtention 2019 workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore the management of human attention and notifications across versatile devices and contexts to overcome information overload and over-choice.
