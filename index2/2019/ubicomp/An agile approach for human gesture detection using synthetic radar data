A large and diversified dataset is the cornerstone for the analysis of many real world systems. Data collection, especially involving living beings, is a time and effort consuming approach. Data augmentation using analytical models is gaining traction in computing systems because of data scarcity in real world applications. In this paper, we demonstrate a case study of data explosion for radar based human gesture detection. We present a physical model based simulation framework for obtaining radar signals corresponding to different human gestures. Radar based public datasets have not yet been so easily available because of its high cost and less availability. On the contrary, Kinect based datasets are easily available because of its market dominance and commercialization of devices such as Xbox Kinect. Thus, for the simulation framework, we have used the publicly available dataset for gaming gestures based on Kinect data (obtained from Microsoft Cambridge joint initiative). This Kinect data containing the coordinates of joint positions of human skeletons performing different gaming gestures is then fed to a radar based simulation framework to calculate the radar data. Furthermore, we have tuned different parameters in this simulation framework and exploded it to generate radar micro Doppler signatures in a controlled way, keeping in mind the physical constraints. On this exploded data, machine learning algorithms have been applied to evaluate gesture detection accuracy. The enlarged dataset for four gestures has shown an accuracy of around 94.7 % for 10 fold cross validation in training phase. A comparison of simulated radar data with respect to experimentally obtained hardware radar data for different gestures has also been reported to show the relevance of the proposed method.
