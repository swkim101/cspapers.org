Advancements in wearable biosensor technologies in recent years enable us to witness an unprecedented boom, as interest in fitness health data grow exponentially. Learning about one's metrics and sharing of this data in various platforms has arguably become a demand and practice for daily life. This research aims to discover potential applications of wearable technology and fitness health data by taking on the existing ubiquitous computing hardware and software technologies on wearable biosensors and push them further to a new level by proposing a methodology and visualization for users response to their surroundings, and how this application could become a critical feedback mechanism for individual users as well as planners, decision makers and designers for our built environment.
