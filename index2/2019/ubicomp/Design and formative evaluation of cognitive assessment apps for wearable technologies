Cognitive functioning is a crucial aspect of the individual's mental health and it affects human's daily activities. We have developed the Ubiquitous Cognitive Assessment Tool (UbiCAT) including three cognitive assessment apps on the Fitbit smartwatch. In this paper, we present the design and formative evaluation of the UbiCAT apps conducted with 5 participants who had a background in design and/or human-computer interaction. Moreover, we investigated the adoption of the wearable devices by our participants.
