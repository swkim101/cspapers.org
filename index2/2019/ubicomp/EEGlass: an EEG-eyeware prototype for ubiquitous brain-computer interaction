Contemporary Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) are progressively becoming socially acceptable by approaching the size and design of normal eyewear. Apart from the exciting interaction design prospects, HMDs bear significant potential in hosting an array of physiological sensors very adjacent to the human skull. As a proof of concept, we illustrate EEGlass, an early wearable prototype comprised of plastic eyewear frames for approximating the form factor of a modern HMD. EEGlass is equipped with an Open-BCI board and a set of EEG electrodes at the contact points with the skull for unobtrusively collecting data related to the activity of the human brain. We tested our prototype with 1 participant performing cognitive and sensorimotor tasks while wearing an established Electroencephalography (EEG) device for obtaining a baseline. Our preliminary results showcase that EEGlass is capable of accurately capturing resting state, detect motor-action and Electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts. Further experimentation is required, but our early trials with EEGlass are promising in that HMDs could serve as a springboard for moving EEG outside of the lab and in our everyday life, facilitating the design of neuroadaptive systems.
