Smart textiles are being used by multiple technologies for various health care applications. In my recent research, I have designed a textile-based smart sanitary napkin sensor. It helps in identifying multiple gynaecological diseases by regular monitoring of menstrual blood loss volume. This paper talks about the technical and physical challenges I faced during the designing of the smart sensor and the potential possibilities of future research to address these challenges.
