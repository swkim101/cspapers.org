This study investigates the effect of different types of cues in terms of modality and message form applied in a turn-taking interaction with a virtual agent. We divided the message form to implicit and explicit, and modality to visual and auditory. The results from a 2 (message form: implicit vs. explicit) x 2 (modality: auditory vs. visual) between subject experiment revealed that implicit auditory cue has a significantly positive effect on inducing the perceived contingency and perceived intelligence in human-agent conversation. These results suggest that designing continuous turn-taking cue should be carefully crafted with elaborated research in various aspects such as social psychology and technical usability. Finally, Implication and limits of these findings are discussed.
