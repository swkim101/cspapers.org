Natural, public places in cities serve often as a place for recreation and relaxation. Additionally, such places often signify historic and social importance about which visitors would like to know more. Screens and other currently existing technology would, however, destroy the natural beauty of such a place. Attention-aware and unobtrusive interfaces seem to offer a solution to this problem. In our approach, we conducted a qualitative survey with 19 people and an epoch√© at a decommissioned cemetery which is mainly used for recreation and leisure time. Overall, the results show that the majority would like to know more about the deceased with the information closely placed to the grave, but without disturbing the natural, mystical atmosphere of the cemetery. In this work in progress report, we present our research approach to attention-aware, unobtrusive and context-sensitive interactive prototypes that keep the natural beauty and recreational characteristics of such a place.
