In this paper, we explore wearable ambient display as a clothing accessory. A majority of wearable display research so far focuses on using displays as a channel to present concrete information and notifications. The aim of our research is to develop an understanding and identify the preferred characteristics of wearable displays as an everyday accessory and embellishment. We designed the Scarf Set headphones in the form of a hooded scarf, as an instance to explore the design space. The Scarf Set is used as a probe to provoke conversation around wearable displays as an everyday clothing and accessory item. The initial user study shows that our participants appreciated the interactive features enabled by the wearable display, but the constant changing and movement, which are part of the interaction, were not liked.
