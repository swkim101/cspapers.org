Much of the research in wearable technology focuses on the primary user's experiences and interactions. However, many wearables are inherently social - even public - by nature as they are visible to nearby others. Wearables carry meanings about the wearer (e.g., lifestyle, attitudes, interests, social status). Some wearables are even designed to enable interaction between collocated users or enhance group-experience. While the functions of the technology are often seen to justify its existence, reaching high acceptance of technology requires that also social and cultural aspects are considered. In this workshop, we look into the dynamic and communicative nature of wearable technology designed for both individuals and groups. We are particularly interested in social experiences emerging around personal wearables and the possibilities for technology enhancing group experiences. The goal of this workshop is to bring together a community of researchers, designers, and practitioners who have designed or are interested in designing wearable technology to discuss research agenda and challenges in designing wearable technology as social, communicative artefacts.
