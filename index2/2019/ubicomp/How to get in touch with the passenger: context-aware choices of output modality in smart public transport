Public transport plays an essential role in sustainable urban mobility. The increasing availability of public transport data and the dissemination of interactive devices in the public and in public transport specifically provide a basis for smart mobility systems. Urban mobility is characterized by rapid context changes and a very personalized and situational information need of users. Smart mobility systems therefore support users in their mobility in intelligent ways and bring together ubiquitous and mobile computing, the Internet of Things as well as context-awareness. In this paper, we focus on the delivery of mobility information in public transport and present a model and an adaptation scheme for context-aware choices of output modality and device. Our approach enables a smart mobility system to choose output modality and device based on the user's situation and their preferences as part of a context-aware application design. The model and adaptation process are part of our ongoing work in the field of context-aware smart mobility applications.
