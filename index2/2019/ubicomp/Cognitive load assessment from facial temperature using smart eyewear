In this paper we present an approach to detection and estimation of the cognitive load[8, 9] by measuring temperature changes of the forehead and the nose bridge using smart eyewear. The presented system consists of a pair of glasses with four temperature sensors attached. We have found signs of a correlation between the facial temperature changes and cognitive load using this approach, which makes it possible to develop a wearable device to quantitatively estimate cognitive engagement. Although are still working on investigating the effect on facial temperature from different types of cognitive tasks and different difficultly levels, we believe this approach could spark interesting discussions during the workshop.
