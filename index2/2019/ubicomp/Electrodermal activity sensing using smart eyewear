In this paper we present a system prototype capable of assessing electrodermal activity (EDA), also referred to as galvanic skin response (GSR) in smart eyewear form-factor. EDA has a long history in psychological research and has been used for ground truth recording in multiple scenarios. Human skin sweating has been proven to be relation to the emotional state of the user, and we believe that this could enable us to build systems that could potentially help us gain deeper insights into our behaviour, emotions and stress factors throughout the day. In this paper we discuss the background of EDA studies, discuss the presented concept and potential applications. We hope this work could inspire fruitful discussions and potential collaborations during the workshop.
