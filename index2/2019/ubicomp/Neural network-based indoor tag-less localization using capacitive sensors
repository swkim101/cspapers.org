Many applications aim to make smarter the indoor environments where most people spend much of their time (home, office, transportation, public spaces), but they need long-term low-cost human sensing and monitoring capabilities. Small capacitive sensors match well most requirements, like privacy, power, cost, and unobtrusiveness, and, importantly, they do not rely on wearables or specific human interactions. However, long-range capacitive sensors often need advanced data processing to increase their performance. Our ongoing research experimental results show that four 16 cm X 16 cm capacitive sensors deployed in a 3 m X 3 m room can taglessly track the movement of a person with a root mean square error as low as 26 cm. Our system uses a median and low-pass filter for sensor signal conditioning before an autoregressive neural network that we trained to infer the location of the person in the room.
