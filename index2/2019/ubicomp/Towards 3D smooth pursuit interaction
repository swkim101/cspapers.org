In this position paper, we encourage the use of novel 3D gaze tracking possibilities in the field of gaze-based interaction. Smooth pursuit offers great benefits over other gaze interaction approaches, like the ability to work with uncalibrated eye trackers, but also has disadvantages like the produced visual clutter in more complex user interfaces. We examine the basic concept of smooth pursuits, its hardware and algorithmic requirements and how this can be applied to real world problems. Then we evaluate how the recent change in availability of 3D eye tracking hardware can be used to approach the challenges of 2D smooth pursuit interaction. We take a look at different research opportunities, show concrete ideas and discuss why they are relevant for future research.
