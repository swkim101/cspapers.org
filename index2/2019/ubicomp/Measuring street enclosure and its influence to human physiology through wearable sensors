In this paper, we explore the influence of street space visual qualities on human physiology and perception of comfort at selected street corners (i.e., Fumin, Changde, Xinle and Donghu Road, Jing'an district, Shanghai). The visual qualities of the street were identified by the physical space variations, sky visibility, wall continuity and the cross-sectional proportion. These three variables contribute to the "enclosure index", a dimensionless numeral which defines the occupant perception of the street space. We used a custom biosensor kit to collect 15 participants' average heart rates for one minute measured at aforementioned street corners. We compared participant's heart rates when they looked toward the intersection (open street space) and looked down the street (enclosed street space) and we asked them to complete a questionnaire on comfort level. The data of questionnaire was then compared to the corresponding heart rates. Results demonstrated that heart rates of participants who looked at the street view (more enclosed) were lower than those when looking in corner view (less enclosed).
