Advancements in ubiquitous technologies and artificial intelligence have paved the way for the recent rise of digital personal assistants in everyday life. The Fourth International Workshop on Ubiquitous Personal Assistance (UPA'19) aims to continue discussing the latest research developments and outcomes on digital personal assistants. UPA'19 builds on the success of our three previous workshops, organized in conjunction with UbiComp'16-18. We welcome contributions focusing on the advancements toward digital assistants that provide a high level of personalization, through proactive and effective support of users' activities, in an unobtrusive manner. All workshop contributions will be published in the supplemental proceedings of the Ubicomp/ISWC 2019 conference and included in the ACM Digital Library.
