Movements of human eyes provide useful insights for understanding human's physical and mental condition and ability, which has high attention in various industrial and academic fields. Although many methods for sensing eye movements have been proposed, each method has some problems in sensing eye movements constantly in all situations. In this research, in order to realize a device which constantly recognizes eye movements in every scene, we adopted a sensing technology using uplift movements of a skin accompanying eye movements. The proposed method attached a infrared distance sensor to an inside of glasses so as to sense eye movements based on the change in a distance between eyes and a distance sensor. Then, necessary parameters such as eye movements directions are recognized based on an extracted feature quantity using a machine learning. We conducted two kinds of experiments at early-stage and confirmed the feasibility of our proposed method on eye movements recognition.
