Accurate and efficient estimation of caloric expenditure during daily activities is desirable in tracking personal activity and health. Kinetic energy harvesting (KEH) has created an opportunity for wearable devices with limited battery power to realize long-term human health monitoring. We postulate to use the data of KEH device as a new source for calorie estimation instead of accelerometer. In this paper, we utilize the output voltage of kinetic energy harvester to classify activity intensity types and then develop activity-specific regression models combined with anthropometric characteristics for caloric expenditure estimation by random forest. To validate our approach, we build a KEH hardware platform and collect the dataset of seven different activities in free-living conditions from ten participants. Experiment results validate that the KEH device can act as a substitute for accelerometer to estimate calorie expenditure.
