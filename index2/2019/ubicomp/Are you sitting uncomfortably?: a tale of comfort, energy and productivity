Maintaining a consistent indoor temperature causes one of the largest energy demands in UK. UK buildings are famously poorly insulated and expensive to heat and cool. This is set to become ever more challenging in a warming and rapidly changing climate. What if we allowed ourselves to be more uncomfortable and took more charge of our thermal comfort? Wouldn't we then be healthier, more thermally delighted, more productive? Would we not also save energy and related carbon emissions? We offer this provocation, and set the challenge to identify how this should change the role of future ubiquitous environments.
