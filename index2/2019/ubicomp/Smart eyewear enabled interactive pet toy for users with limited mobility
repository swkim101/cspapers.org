Smart eyewear that detects eye movements and head motions have been applied to studies on detecting oneâĂŹs mental state [5], engagement level in social interactions, and measuring concentration [4]. However, applications for these smart eyewear that offers intriguing and novel interactive experience has seldom been used as wearable device-control. As an application of this type of wearable, we used J!NS MEME that enables head motion data to control smart devices with hands-free operation in a pet toy system to facilitate human-animal interaction for people in cases of limited mobility either due to physical disability or the lack of enough space allowance. For our study, we primarily focused on exploring interaction possibilities between pet owners, who experience physical limitations due to the latter context, and their pets. The study result shows a promising start for opening up new interaction opportunities for our targeted audience in the context of physical limitation; however, the impact on those with physical disabilities is still arguable as it is yet to be evaluated. Nevertheless, since smart eyewear can act as an unobtrusive and useful body extension for people with limited mobility, we believe that it can be an alternative input option that can be applied not just to human-animal interaction but also to wider domains such smart devices and home systems for these users.
