Temperature is an important source of information for personal health, weather forecasting, and thermal management in buildings and computing infrastructure, etc. Temperature measurement can be achieved via low-cost hardware with reasonable accuracy. However, large-scale distributed thermal sensing is non-trivial and currently relies on dedicated hardware. In this paper, we design the first software sonic thermometer (SST) using commercial-off-the-shelf acoustic-enabled devices. We utilize on-board dual microphones on commodity mobile devices to estimate sound speed, which has a known relationship with temperature. SST is portable, contactless, and cost-effective, making it suitable for ubiquitous sensing. We implement SST on an Android smartphone and an acoustic sensing platform. Evaluation results show that SST can achieve a median accuracy of 0.54dGC even at varying humidity levels.
