This paper outlines a pilot study aimed at identifying salient themes in the awareness of health and well-being and the effects that this can have on one's home life and work behavior. We also sought to identify the factors that lead to lapses in one's awareness of health and well-being issues. Interviews were conducted with individuals who are known to work for extended durations (taxi / Uber drivers). A number of proven methods were used for the collection of pertinent data (i.e., sensing technologies, self-reported information, and interpersonal observations). Finally, design guidelines are presented for the development of technology-based solutions aimed at raising awareness of health and well-being among workers in high-stress occupations.
