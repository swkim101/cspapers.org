Nowadays, 4G devices are pervasive and most of the homes and offices in modern cities are covered by LTE signals. While it is very attractive to leverage ubiquitous LTE signals and use hand gestures to control the home appliances remotely, there is no work on such contactless gesture interaction systems reported yet. In this work, we present an LTE-based contactless gesture interaction system to recognize various hand gestures around a 4G terminal like mobile phone, which can be used to control the switch, channel and volume of a TV set remotely without holding any devices. The results show that the proposed system can recognize different hand gestures accurately leveraging LTE signals without training, and achieve remote TV control in real time in different settings.
