The paper describes the various problems and challenges encountered during the development and remote data collection in a cross-platform hybrid application developed for remote monitoring of participants and what solutions were implemented to mitigate them. These problems and challenges are universal for hybrid applications and this paper digs deep into these in the domain of large-scale, long-duration mHealth research studies. From technical issues to issues with user compliance, this paper discusses the core problems inherent to these types of studies and technologies, and how to mitigate them.
