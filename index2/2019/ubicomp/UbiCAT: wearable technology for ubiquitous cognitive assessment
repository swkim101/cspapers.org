The Ubiquitous Cognitive Assessment Tool (UbiCAT) is a wearable technology designed for 'in-the-wild' cognitive assessment. UbiCAT includes three smartwatch-based applications adapted from the Stroop color-word, n-back, and two-choice reaction time tests, respectively. UbiCAT aims to measure selective attention and processing speed, working memory, and inhibition control. UbiCAT can be used for real-life cognitive assessment and for experiments on human cognitive performance. Within the field of ubiquitous computing, it contributes to the cognition-aware systems.
