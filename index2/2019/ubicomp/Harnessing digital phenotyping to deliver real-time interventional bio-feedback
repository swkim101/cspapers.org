With the decreasing cost and increasing capability of sensor and mobile technology along with the proliferation of data from social media, ambient environment and other sources, new concepts for digital prognostic and technological quantification of well-being are emerging. These concepts are referred to as digital phenotyping. One of the main challenges facing the development of these technologies is the design of easy to use and personalised devices which benefit from interventional feedback by leveraging on-device processing in real-time. Tangible interfaces designed for well-being possess the capabilities to reduce anxiety or manage panic attacks, thus improving the quality of life for both the general population and vulnerable members of society. Real-time biofeedback paired with Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities for mental well-being to be inferred allowing individually personalised interventional feedback to be automatically applied. This research explores future directions for bio-feedback including the opportunity to fuse multiple AI enabled feedback mechanisms that can then be utilised collectively or individually.
