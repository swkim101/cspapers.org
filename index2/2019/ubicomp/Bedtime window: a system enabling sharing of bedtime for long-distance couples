We present a design of an always-on system connecting long-distance couples at bedtime, a time and space partners normally share together. The system offers a novel, real-time shared inking space for creative interactivity, a slow photo stream to balance privacy and remote presence. It adapts to the local light level in order to stay in the background, but can be also configured to reflect the remote light level to provide an additional communication channel.
