In this poster accompanying the MobiCom 2019 paper, we describes how to enable infant monitoring capability using white noise. Specifically, we design a set of novel algorithms that can extract the minute infant breathing motion as well as position information from white noise which is random in both the time and frequency domain. Our study demonstrates that the system achieves high correlation between the measured respiratory rate and the ground truth.
