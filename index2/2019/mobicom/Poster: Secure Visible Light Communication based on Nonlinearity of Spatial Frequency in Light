Quick response (QR) codes are becoming pervasive due to their rapid readability and the popularity of smartphones with built-in cameras. QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we address this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQR code), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a MoirÃ© pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQR codes is $> 98%$. The decryption rate for cameras positioned $20\degree$ off axis or $> 10cm$ from the designated location drops to $0%$, indicating that any attackers will be unable to steal a usable image.
