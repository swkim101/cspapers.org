This paper presents a robot for people identification and tracking developed on robot operating system (ROS). It achieves modulized, light-weight, low-cost, and high-performance design goals even with the existence of distributed sensors. The key idea is to utilize wearable devices to enhance the people tracking capability of a robot through instant wireless communications and multi-sensory data fusion. Experimental results in a realistic environment demonstrate that our robot can keep tracking a specific person at a safe distance even without seeing the biological features of the person, who walks in a crowd with complex trajectories.
