The need of skills other than technical from software developers is becoming evident. The DevOps movement is an example of that applied to operational tasks. Startup development methodologies focus on business activities in innovative organizations. Several universities offer courses based on these methodologies to software engineering students, mainly to improve their creativity, problem solving, and business skills. This paper investigates how software engineering students learned startup development methodologies and discusses what are the challenges and benefits in their learning process. We conducted a multi-method study in three different universities. The data was collected in two phases and analyzed using thematic analysis. Our study reveals that students realized the importance of collaboration with other courses and the importance of user involvement in development. However, students tend to over-simplify concepts, trying to adapt them to what they are familiar with. The results indicate the necessity of business education for technical students and directions for improvements.
