As outlined in the ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013 Guidelines section on Social Issues and Professional Practice, "Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social [and] ethical ... issues." In this panel, we demonstrate diverse approaches used to achieve this goal with respect to civic engagement. Drawing from experiences with non-major, introductory computing, mobile applications, software engineering, and interdisciplinary courses, we discuss how to move beyond surface-level discussions of ethical case studies toward an integration of civic engagement activities and personal reflection into standard computing curriculum.
