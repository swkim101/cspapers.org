Girls Who Code (GWC) Clubs are springing up all around the country, with almost 90,000 girls involved from all 50 states. Have you ever wondered what it takes to get a club started? How do clubs make use of the curriculum that GWC provides? Do clubs ever take their girls on field trips to local places that would show them the possibilities of what they can do in computing? Maybe you're already involved with a club and would like to know what other clubs are doing, or you're doing some cool things with your club that you'd like to share. Or maybe you've been thinking about getting a club started and would like some ideas. This BOF will provide a platform for the discussion of starting and running a GWC club, as well as for sharing ideas of the interesting things clubs have been doing.
