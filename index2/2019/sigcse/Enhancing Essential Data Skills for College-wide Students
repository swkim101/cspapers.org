In the Big Data era, essential data skills are critical for everybody in full participation of the workforce and modern society to better understand decisions from diverse levels of society. However not all graduates exit college with these needed skills. In this poster, the author(s) report on the integrating of data literacy into a college-wide computer and information literacy course with collaborative practices of project-based learning, which aims at increasing students' awareness of data science and boosting essential data skills of college-wide students. In the poster, we will demonstrate our module design on training essential data skills through examples, case students, and team-based projects within a college-wide computer and information literacy course. We will also present our comparative analysis on one data-enhanced course session with other two course regular sessions as control. In the data-enhanced session, students formed a team, choose a topic in the engaging context, specified questions that they want to ask and answered through data, analyzed data from different perspectives, evaluated results, and present in the course poster session. Two measures are used in assessing the effectiveness of exploratory and collaborative learning in data literacy: student performance in a poster session and student perceptions on Likert scales. Thus far the evaluation results and statistical analysis showed the innovative practice significantly intrigued students' interest in data science and boosted students' fundamental data skills, for both computer science or non-computer science majors.
