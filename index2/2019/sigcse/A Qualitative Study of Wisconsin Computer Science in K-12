The number of students enrolling into CS(Computer Science) is currently recovering from a period of declining numbers. Although the number of students enrolling in CS isn't declining anymore, there is still a lot of ground to be covered as far as student enrollment in CS goes. This is because the number of computer science jobs, on the other hand, is and has been steadily rising. The disconnect between students enrolling in CS and the increase of Jobs for CS leaves a deficiency for in the CS work field for qualified workers. We wish to look for ways to increase K-12 student interest in CS related fields in an attempt to increase the number of students pursuing CS. This first starts with the teachers teaching the class. To address these issues, we investigated the implementation of teachers who had been through Computer Science professional developments in the K12 school environment. Using the data, gathered from a qualitative study approach, we present results found from interviews conducted on K12 teachers from all across Wisconsin to demonstrate the impact of professional development on teacher's ability to teach.
