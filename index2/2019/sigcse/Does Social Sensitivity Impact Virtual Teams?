Working effectively as part of a team is an incredibly important skill to learn. Most jobs require interacting and working with others and the outcome of a team project relies on the processes of the group members. Naturally, a positive team experience yields better results than a negative experience. The biggest indicators of a positive team experience are communication and collaboration, which are both soft skills associated with the social sensitivity of the group members. Previous research has found that social sensitivity influences the amount of communication and the ultimate performance of traditional face-to-face teams. However, virtual teamwork is becoming more common. Does social sensitivity have a similar influence in virtual teams? Virtual teams have different interactions than face-to-face teams because they use communication technologies, which can hinder certain human cognitive processes. Our current research focuses on the influence of social sensitivity on the amount of communication and the performance of students who work as a virtual team using text-based communication in Discord. We find that teams with higher average levels of social sensitivity communicate more and perform better, even if they work in a virtual environment using only text messaging.
