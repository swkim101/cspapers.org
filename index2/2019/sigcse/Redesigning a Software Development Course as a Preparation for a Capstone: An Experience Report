Students need a wide variety of skills before they can successfully engage in real-world projects with paying customers. Some of these skills, such as the "soft skills" of communicating with a non-technical customer and working in a larger team to collaboratively develop a project, are generally not present in Computer Science courses. In this paper, we discuss our experience teaching these skills and explain the structure of our redesigned Software Development course and how it aligns with the Capstone experience. The main novelty of our approach is the specific implementation of the rotating project manager role and the introduction of the final portfolio reflection. We believe that the concepts we introduced during our redesign can be useful to any educator wanting to include collaborative project-based work in their courses. To enable faculty to apply and enhance these concepts, the resources that we used in this course, which include activities, templates, guidelines, rubrics, and questionnaires, are available as an open source project at https://team-repo.github.io/.
