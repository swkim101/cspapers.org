Much research has been conducted demonstrating that women often have different experiences in computer science than their male classmates. Self-esteem research provides one way we can understand the effects of these experiences as self-esteem has long been associated with well-being and academic success. Some experiences may be positive and enhance self-esteem, where others may be negative and decrease self-esteem leaving students to doubt whether they belong in their computing major. This poster presents a workshop for students that is grounded in research on building what is called "authentic" self-esteem. Authentic self-esteem can be understood as a balance between competence (skills) and worthiness (feelings of connectedness and acceptance). Recent research by the poster presenter based on these two factors of self-esteem revealed that female computing student's feelings of worthiness and competence are unbalanced: (1) their feelings of worthiness are lower than their feelings of competence within their computing major; and, (2) the gap is largest among seniors. This gap between competence and worthiness manifests as doubt just at the time that students should be excited about graduation and interviewing for jobs. The workshop presented in this poster was developed with psychologist Christopher Mruk and is based on his Competence and Worthiness Training (CWT) program. The workshop is aimed at providing students with tools to build their authentic self-esteem through helping to close the gap between their feelings of competence and worthiness.
