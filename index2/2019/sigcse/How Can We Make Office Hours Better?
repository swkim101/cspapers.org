Most student personal interactions with the course staff come through office hours. Particularly in large courses, the office hours are predominantly run by teaching assistants (TAs). TAs are best advantaged by support and training from more senior instructional staff, especially faculty. This BOF will provide a forum for discussing mentoring techniques and other individualized support of the TAs (particularly in computer science courses) to improve student learning and experience, as well as longer-term gains to the discipline. Second, we will be discussing what technological support exists, such as queue software or internal wikis, to improve student learning and experience in office hours. Finally, we will discuss ideas for more significant changes in office hour structures that could lead to future collaborations or research experiments.
