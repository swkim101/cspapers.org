This poster session will discuss several dimensions of bias in curricular design that must be considered in the development of curriculum materials in undergraduate computer science education if we are to broaden interest, engagement and ultimately participation. Multiple dimensions of bias were used to identify gender, race and other biases in curricula that led to the authors' redesign of coursework materials and activities in two undergraduate courses: Computer Networks and Cybersecurity. Our goal was to assess current curricula and ultimately redesign curricula to include topics and authentic activities connected to industry while also broadening learner interest, engagement and accessibility. The design of materials intentionally shifted to social problems, data-driven problem solving and other new curricula foci areas that have been shown to broaden interest and engagement. In addition, materials are aligned with national standards and competencies in cybersecurity while maintaining course rigor. The expanded study includes the use of multiple measures to assess the effectiveness of curriculum design in relation to interest and other factors that influence the engagement of learners in their first two years of computer science coursework. The Computer Science Cultural Attitude and Identity Survey (CSAIS) was revised and used to measure constructs that influence the attitudes and identity of undergraduate students in computer science including interest as well as other factors such as self-efficacy and identity.
