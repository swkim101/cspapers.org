Using freely available online automated reasoning tools, we will demonstrate a sequence of engaging reasoning activities that are suitable to introduce beginning programmers and software engineering students to reason logically and symbolically about code. The automated tools have an underlying verification engine that makes it possible for the tool to offer activities and directed logical feedback not possible with typical development environments. The tools have been used in undergraduate classrooms for multiple years by well over a thousand students. The imperative language used by the tool is integrated with the underlying verification engine, and because it closely resembles many commercial languages, it presents little barrier to student usage. A comprehensive activity-based "Reason with Components" tool takes 5-10 minutes of instructor introduction and allows student exploration of contracts, objects, loops, recursion, and reusable concepts. Multiple versions of "Begin to Reason" tools are designed to help students learn the basics of code tracing in intro CS courses "on their own". Students and instructors can create new activities and can fine-tune the existing activities to their specific needs.
