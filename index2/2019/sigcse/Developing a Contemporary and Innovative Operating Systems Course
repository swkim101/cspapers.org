This birds-of-a-feather provides a discussion forum to foster innovation in teaching operating systems (OS) at the undergraduate level. This birds-of-a-feather seeks to generate discussion and ideas around pedagogy for OS and, in particular, how we might develop a contemporary and innovative model, in both content and delivery, for an OS course---that plays a central role in a CS curriculum---and addresses significant issues of misalignment between existing OS courses and employee professional skills and knowledge requirements. We would like to exchange ideas regarding a re-conceptualized course model of OS curriculum and related pedagogy, especially in the areas of mobile OSs and Internet of Things; concurrent programming and synchronization; and cloud computing and big data processing.
