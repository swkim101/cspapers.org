A growing body of evidence indicates that there is a deep effect of noncognitive factors on academic achievement and learning. In this study, we analyzed a set of 31 evaluation instruments designed to measure noncognitive constructs (e.g., self-efficacy, confidence, motivation) within computing education. Using the Lee and Shute framework, we assigned each of the 115 unique constructs found in the instruments into one of the four components (Student Engagement, Learning Strategies, School Climate, Social-familial Influences) and their subcomponents to determine which constructs are most frequently measured. We found that the majority of constructs were designed to measure Student Engagement (Affect and Cognition) and School Climate (Teacher Variables). Constructs measuring Learning Strategies and Social-Familial Influences (e.g., homework strategies, peer influences) occur the least. This study may enable further discussions of what noncognitive factors are/are not currently being measured within the computing education community.
