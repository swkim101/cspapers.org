While it is widely believed that taking a class's prerequisites is critical for success, less is known about how proficiency with the prerequisite knowledge from those courses affects performance in later courses. Specifically, it is unclear how well students understand material from prerequisite courses and whether that understanding may impact their outcomes in the subsequent course. Additionally, in subsequent courses, do students strengthen their knowledge from prerequisite courses and, if they do, does that improvement matter for the subsequent course? This study examines the prerequisite knowledge of 208 students in an upper-division data structures class at a large North American research university. Prerequisite proficiency on entry to the course was surprisingly low, with nearly a third of students demonstrating low proficiency and only a quarter high proficiency. Students modestly improved their proficiency during the term, lifting a third of those with low proficiency to at least medium proficiency. Overall, final exam performance was significantly correlated with prerequisite knowledge. For those with low initial proficiency, improvement in proficiency was significantly correlated with performance on the final. These results suggest that more attention needs to be placed on reinforcing prerequisite knowledge for those with low proficiency.
