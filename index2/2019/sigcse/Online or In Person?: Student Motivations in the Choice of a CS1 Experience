As online offerings have matured and expanded, new efforts have recently been devoted to opening fully-accredited online versions of traditional on-campus classes. Such classes may be offered to on-campus students for greater flexibility during busy semesters, or to allow them to continue to make progress toward their degrees during internships or semesters away from campus. This trend intersects with a growing CS for All movement that sees more and more non-computer science majors enrolling in CS classes. As online offerings expand, it is important for us to understand who enrolls in online sections and the reasons for their choices, both to make sure that learning outcomes are similar across different delivery mechanisms, and to take advantage of opportunities to tailor course content to specific audiences. In this analysis, we look at two versions, one online and one traditional, of a CS1 class offered at a major public research university. We investigate demographic, motivational, and experiential components to identify which types of students are most likely to select each version and what implications this decision has for student success and course design.
