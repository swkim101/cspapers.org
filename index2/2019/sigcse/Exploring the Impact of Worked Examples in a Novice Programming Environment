Research in a variety of domains has shown that viewing worked examples (WEs) can be a more efficient way to learn than solving equivalent problems. We designed a Peer Code Helper system to display WEs, along with scaffolded self-explanation prompts, in a block-based, novice programming environment called \snap. We evaluated our system during a high school summer camp with 22 students. Participants completed three programming problems with access to WEs on either the first or second problem. We found that WEs did not significantly impact students' learning, but may have impacted students' intrinsic cognitive load, suggesting that our WEs with scaffolded prompts may be an inherently different learning task. Our results show that WEs saved students time on initial tasks compared to writing code, but some of the time saved was lost in subsequent programming tasks. Overall, students with WEs completed more tasks within a fixed time period, but not significantly more. WEs may improve students' learning efficiency when programming, but these effects are nuanced and merit further study.
