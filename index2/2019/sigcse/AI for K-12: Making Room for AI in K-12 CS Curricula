As CS expands into more K-12 classrooms and children become familiar with computational thinking, advances in AI pose new challenges for CS educators. Children now enjoy conversing with AI-powered agents such as Alexa and Siri, while their parents worry about the imminent arrival of autonomous robots and self-driving cars. As AI technologies become more prominent in our lives, we need to consider what every child should know about AI. This BOF provides a timely opportunity to introduce CS educators and researchers to several AI for K-12 efforts, including available curricula, tools, and resources. Attendees will discuss how AI can best be incorporated into the K-12 CS curriculum, the tools/resources that will be needed to support students and teachers learning about AI, and how AI education might impact their own work. This BOF is complementary to the SIGCSE 2019 Special Session: AI for K-12 Guidelines Initiative that introduces the current draft of our 'Big Ideas in AI."
