Platform-independent encapsulated and self-contained labs can enhance the delivery of cybersecurity teaching modules in resource-limited academic institutions. Cybersecurity teaching modules usually incorporate hands-on labs using tools such as NETLAB+, NS-3, SEED, GENI, etc. There are two major problems in using such labs; students need to learn the underlying tool before doing labs, and setting-up a lab may require significant IT support and resources. In addition, development and delivery of security labs is barricaded by two other technical realities: built-in security controls in computer systems and networks (e.g. NX-bits, ASL-Randomization, Canaries, Firewalls, etc.), and heterogeneity in students-owned operating environments. In our proposed work, we have studied the concept of container-based educational solutions by leveraging the unique features of Docker containers (i.e., light-weight packaging of code and all of its system dependencies) to build platform-independent encapsulated cybersecurity labs. The benefits of our approach includes, cost-effective teaching environment, scalability over heterogeneous operating platforms, independence from hardware, software, and network controls, and hassle-free learning experience for students. As a proof of concept, we have developed an interoperable encapsulated lab for giving hands-on experience to students in one aspect of cybersecurity, buffer overflow. The lab was created using Docker and uploaded to a central repository. Students can pull this lab from anywhere, and can execute it on any platform that runs Docker daemon. We will use the knowledge and experience gained in this study to build our future research in the areas of building Learning Objects for cybersecurity education.
