Encouraging Reflection in Support of Learning Data Structures Cheryl Resch, University of Florida Christina Gardner-McCune, University of Florida Contact: cheryl.resch@ufl.edu Our research looks at using reflection in teaching Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to promote meaningful learning. This poster examines the differences in reflections produced by two different programming assignments in DSA at the University of Florida. In the first assignment, students were asked to implement a line editor using a linked list and in the reflection prompt students were asked to reflect on the use of the assigned data structure and what they would do differently if they could do the assignment again. In this assignment, the dominant reflection was a simple recounting of material taught in class. In 15% of the reflections, students identified an implementation improvement that could be used. In 25% of the reflections, students identified non-technical issues such as time management when reflecting on what they would do differently if they had to do the assignment again. In the second assignment, students were asked to code Google's page-rank algorithm and were allowed to choose a graph implementation. They were asked to reflect on their implementation and what they would do differently if they could do the assignment again. In this assignment, the dominant reflection, ?%, was about the appropriateness of the chosen graph implementation compared to other implementations. In their reflection on what they would do differently, only 12% of the reflections mentioned non-technical issues. This data suggests that giving students an opportunity to decide the implementation approach and providing more specific reflection prompts produces more technical reflections.
