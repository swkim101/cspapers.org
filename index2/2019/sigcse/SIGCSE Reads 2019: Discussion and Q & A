This special session will allow discussion of how many common goals of CS educators (conveying core CS concepts, creating community for our students, discussing ethics, etc.) can be furthered through the use of literature in CS courses. We will present five goals which are common in CS education, and discuss how incorporating literature relates to them. We will present small case studies showing concrete examples of assignments and courses which have successfully utilized literature in common, core CS courses. We will showcase a Q & A with author Naomi Kritzer, winner of the 2016 Hugo Award for her short story "Cat Pictures Please".
