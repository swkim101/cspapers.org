This Workshop is intended to be a generative space for participants to create a module on ethics in a Computer Science course of their choice. Participants will choose an existing course in the typical CS curriculum; and coalesce around common themes to create a module that integrates critical reflection on ethical choices and societal impact of computing with the practice of computing. The workshop will offer a space to collaboratively work on designing an ethics module for a CS course chosen by the participants. The ethics module would integrate teaching specific concepts and practices in computing alongside a critical reflection of these practices. Ideally, these modules would be flexible enough to fit into curricula at various institutions.
