Software testing is an essential skill for software developers, but it is challenging to get students engaged in this activity. The Code Defenders game aims to address this problem by letting students compete over code under test by either introducing faults ("attacking") or by writing tests ("defending") to reveal these faults. We have empirically established that the game is engaging and players write better tests than outside the game scenario, and we have successfully integrated Code Defenders as a semester-long activity of an undergraduate and graduate level university course on software testing. This demonstration provides an introduction to Code Defenders from a student point of view (How to play the game?) as well as from a teacher point of view (How to set up games for my students, and how to integrate the game into my course?) A laptop is recommended to join in and try out the game.
