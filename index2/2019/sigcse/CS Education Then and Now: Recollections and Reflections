How has CS education changed since SIGCSE first began in 1968? This panel of presenters, with 135 years of teaching instruction between them, will remind some attendees of what used to be and educate newer members on what life was like pre-internet. Topics to be discussed include changes in content, presentation medium, equipment and environment, students and audience, and pedagogy. Audience members will be engaged through peer instruction questions during and between topic discussions and may use their cell phones or laptops to respond to questions. This panel will allow our community to acknowledge the diversity and experience in our organization and celebrate our heritage. We believe old-timers who wish to reminisce and young, new instructors who are interested in a historical aspect will be interested in the session.
