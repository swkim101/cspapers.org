This workshop introduces participants to SciGirls Code, a unique, connected learning model for engaging middle school girls in computer science (CS) in out of school time. The pilot project, which ran nationally at 16 sites across the United States in 2017-18, included: three curriculum strands (mobile apps, robotics, and e-textiles); role model training for female technology professionals; professional development for informal STEM educators; and a research study that investigates the ways in which learning experiences impact the development of girls' computational thinking as well as their interest and attitudes toward computer science. Workshop participants will learn best strategies for engaging girls in CS and see how those strategies play out in a creative robotics activity using Hummingbird robots.
