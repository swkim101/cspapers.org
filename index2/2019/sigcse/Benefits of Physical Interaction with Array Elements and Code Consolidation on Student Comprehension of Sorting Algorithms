This study was a qualitative analysis of introductory-level computer science students' comprehension of sorting algorithms. We asked six students to read and summarize the code of a sorting algorithm. Next, we asked them to trace through the code, first using a provided array with pencil and paper, then again using sticky-notes to represent the array. Focused analysis of one interview found that a student who struggled to comprehend the algorithm during the pencil-and-paper trace quickly gained understanding when physically tracing the sticky-note array. We hypothesize that physical interaction with a sticky-note representation of an array facilitated student comprehension of sorting algorithms by consolidating multiple lines of code (LOC) into a single repeatable action. This research is relevant to computer science educators who may teach sorting algorithms to introductory-level students.
