Rapid and dramatic demographic and technological changes require our nation's schools, colleges, and universities to work with agility in preparing students - particularly those from diverse backgrounds - for careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, including computer science. Exploring the interplay of technology, education, and inclusion over the past 50 years, Dr. Hrabowski examines what this means for our future work in higher education. Computing education provides a critically important case. As the sector evolves rapidly, many well-paid jobs go unfilled and we must explore ways to draw on talent wherever it is found. Emphasizing themes from his TED talk on student success, Dr. Hrabowski focuses our attention on the importance of high expectations and hard work, building community among students, faculty engagement with students, and rigorous assessment of what works. He assesses the way innovative approaches - including course re-design, active and experiential learning, research, and partnerships with companies and agencies - promote student success, inclusive excellence, and achievement for all students both in STEM generally and computer science in particular.
