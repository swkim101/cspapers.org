This lightning talk describes the Maryland Center for Women in Computing (MCWIC) ambassador program that was designed to empower current undergraduate women to lead K-12 outreach efforts for MCWIC and build a community of within the undergraduate students interested in diversity, inclusion and education. For the last 7 years, the MCWIC ambassadors led summer camps, after school programs in schools, weekend workshops, and programs that support current undergraduate population. The program has grown to the point that we now employ over 15 undergraduate students each semester to support these activities. Come to this talk to learn more about how this program was created, how it is sustained, and how the ambassadors benefit from being a part of the program while also serving the greater community.
