As traditional tech talent pools are being been tapped out and unable to meet the growing workforce demand, matriculation at a community college and transfer to a four-year institution for completion of a bachelor's degree plays a crucial role in diversifying the tech workforce. However, the important role of community colleges in the computer science education pipeline is often overlooked. This panel will provide an overview of the computing workforce landscape, discuss the role of community colleges to increase the diversity of students in computer science, and share case studies that highlight promising practices for the inclusion of community colleges in the CS educational pathway.
