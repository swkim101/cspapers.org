The National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education has provided nationally representative data about the status of K-12 science and mathematics education periodically over the past 40 years. In 2018, the sixth iteration of the study, the study's scope was expanded to include a focus on K-12 computer science education and the study renamed The NSSME+. Data come from roughly 1,300 schools, 7,000 K-12 science and mathematics teachers (who were asked about their integration of computer science into their instruction), and 300 teachers of high school computer science. This session will engage participants with results related to computer science education in the U.S., including: how many, and which, students have access to computer science instruction; who teaches computer science and what pre-service preparation and in-service professional development they have; the nature of computer science instruction; and access to resources, including instructional materials, to support instruction.
