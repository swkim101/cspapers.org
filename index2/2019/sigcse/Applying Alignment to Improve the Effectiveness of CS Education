Course alignment refers to the degree to which curriculum, assessments and instruction methods are in agreement with each other. Course alignment can be used by instructors to evaluate the effectiveness of their instructional content and assessments and whether they are meeting their learning objectives. Applying alignment models is time consuming and laborious, making them difficult for a course instructor to use. Current alignment models require a panel of experts to review documents and make judgments about the degree of alignment of the course objectives and assessments. With that in mind, we devised a practical strategy to be used by a course instructor, as part of course design, to assess the alignment between the course content, learning objectives and assessment methods. We developed a process for evaluating the degree of alignment of a course based on attributes from Webb's alignment model and we developed data structures based on Porter's matrix to facilitate the assessment of the alignment. The devised strategy will be applied to various CS courses by instructors and the results of the process will be used to refine the alignment strategy. An alignment process that can be applied timely and simple to follow may encourage instructors to apply it to their course, becoming a common practice for any instructor when modifying their course.
