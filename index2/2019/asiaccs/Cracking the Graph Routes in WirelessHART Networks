As a key response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor-actuator network (WSAN) technology is gaining rapid adoption in process industries because of its advantage in lowering deployment and maintenance cost and effort in industrial facilities, such as steel mills, oil refineries, and chemical plants. Although most industrial applications operate at low data rates, they often require their underlying networks to provide real-time and reliable data deliveries in harsh industrial environments. IEEE 802.15.4-based WSANs are appealing for use in industrial networks, since they operate at low-power and can be manufactured inexpensively. To meet the stringent real-time and reliability requirements, WSANs, such as WirelessHART networks, make a set of unique design choices such as employing the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) and graph routing that distinguish themselves from traditional wireless sensor networks designed for best effort services. However, the security aspects of this increasingly important class of wireless networks are insufficiently investigated in the literature. Our recent work shows that an attacker can reverse engineer the TSCH channel hopping sequences by silently observing the channel activities and put the network in danger of selective jamming attacks, where the attacker jams only the transmission of interest on its specific communication channel in its specific time slot, which makes the attacks energy-efficient and hardly detectable. A critical step for an attacker to launch selective jamming is to identify the routing paths. Our study shows that an attacker can crack the routes used by the graph routing in WirelessHART networks by silently observing the packet transmission activities. In this poster proposal, we present a vulnerability analysis and our case study performed on a 50-device physical testbed using a publicly accessible WirelessHART implementation.
