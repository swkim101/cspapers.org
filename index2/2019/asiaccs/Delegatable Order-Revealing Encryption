Order-revealing encryption (ORE) is a basic cryptographic primitive for ciphertext comparisons based on the order relationship of plaintexts while maintaining the privacy of them. In the data era we are experiencing, cross-dataset transactions become ubiquitous in practice. However, almost all the previous ORE schemes can only support comparisons on ciphertexts from the same user, which does not meet the requirement for the multi-user environment. In this work, we introduce and design ORE schemes with delegation functionality, which is referred to as delegatable ORE (DORE). The "delegation" here is an authorization that allows for efficient ciphertext comparisons among different users. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first ORE that allows an user to delegate the comparison privilege for his ciphertexts, which also opens the door for future explorations. At the heart of the construction and analysis of DORE is a new building tool proposed in this work, named delegatable equality-revealing encoding (DERE), which might be of independent interest.
