Existing works on gang task scheduling mainly focus on the preemptive scheduling case, which contradicts a bit with the non-preemptive executing nature of applying gang scheduling techniques in practice. In this paper, we present a set of non-trivial techniques that can analyze the schedulability of scheduling a hard real-time sporadic gang task system under non-preemptive GEDF on multiprocessors and a utilization-based schedulability test (first-of-its-kind) is derived.
