I We build space-time models of the world through predictive unsupervised learning. I Task1: Future frames prediction. Applications: urban computing, weather forecasting, learning dynamics of complex environments I Task2: Early action recognition. Predicting future percepts from available information. We ask: Can pixel-level predictive learning help percept-level tasks? I Code/models available: github.com/google/e3d_lstm
