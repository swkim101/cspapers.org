Cross-lingual word embeddings are crucial building blocks for multilingual models, and recent studies indicate that they are obtainable without any bilingual resources [4, 8]. However, the reported experimental results (replicated in this study) indicate that the performance of such cross-lingual word embeddings degrades on distant language pairs such as English-Japanese and EnglishFinnish. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to obtain cross-lingual word embeddings by exploiting unambiguously-translatable word pairs such as loanwords and named entities as a dictionary to induce mappings. Given an initial bilingual dictionary (obtained in an unsupervised manner), our method learns a subword alignment model to extract unambiguously translatable word pairs whose surfaces are alignable with each other. We then employ the bilingual dictionary refined with the subword alignment model to induce accurate crosslingual word embeddings. Experimental results indicate that cross-lingual word embeddings obtained with our method were more accurate than those obtained by the state-of-the-art method, especially on distant language pairs.
