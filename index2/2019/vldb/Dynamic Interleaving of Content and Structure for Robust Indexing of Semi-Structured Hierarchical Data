We propose a robust index for semi-structured hierarchical data that supports content-and-structure (CAS) queries specified by path and value predicates. At the heart of our approach is a novel dynamic interleaving scheme that merges the path and value dimensions of composite keys in a balanced way. We store these keys in our trie-based Robust Content-And-Structure index, which efficiently supports a wide range of CAS queries, including queries with wildcards and descendant axes. Additionally, we show important properties of our scheme, such as robustness against varying selectivities, and demonstrate improvements of up to two orders of magnitude over existing approaches in our experimental evaluation.
