With the advent of Bitcoin, the interest of the database community in blockchain systems has steadily grown. Many existing blockchain applications use blockchains as a platform for monetary transactions, however.

Our ResilientDB uses state-of-the-art technologies and includes a novel visualization that helps in monitoring the state of the blockchain application.
