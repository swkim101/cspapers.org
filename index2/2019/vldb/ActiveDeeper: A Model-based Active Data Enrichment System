Carbonaceous aerosols (CAs) are major components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that dramatically influence the energy budget of Earth. However, accurate assessment of the climatic impacts of CAs is still challenging due to the large uncertainties remaining in the measurement of their optical properties. In this respect, a modified versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system integrated into optical instruments (VACES-OPTS) was set up to increase particle concentration and amplify signal-noise ratio during optical measurement. Based on the novel technique, this study was able to lower the detection limit of CAs by an order of magnitude under high temporal resolution (2 h) and small sampling flow (6 L min-1). Besides, stable and reliable optical data were obtained for absorption apportionment and source identification of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC). In the field application of the new system, high absorption coefficient of CAs in Shanghai, China was witnessed. Further analysis of the contribution of black carbon BC and BrC to light absorption revealed that BrC could account for over 15% of the total absorption at 370 nm. According to the potential source contribution function model (PSCF) classification, CAs with strong light absorption in urban Shanghai originated not only from highly polluted inland China but also from active marine ship emissions.
