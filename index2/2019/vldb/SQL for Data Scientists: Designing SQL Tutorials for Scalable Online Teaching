The SQL query language is the 'lingua franca' of transactional databases, and is essential for scalable data analytics. Learning SQL requires practical exercises with databases, including those parts of SQL with side-effects such as DDL statements, triggers, and stored procedures. Teaching this effectively to a non-technical audience is a challenge, especially in times of COVID-19 without face-to-face classes. The Grok Learning platform allows to design self-paced online tutorials with auto-graded exercises - but it was originally built for teaching programming languages. In this demo, we show how we extended the Grok platform to teach SQL for Data Scientists with comprehensive online learning. Grok supports a rich user interface with interactive examples where students can explore and experiment with each example query. This is ideal for learning declarative querying. Each query is executed in its own sandbox on a freshly initialised database instance which allows to teach all parts of SQL including DDL statements, stored procedures, triggers and UDFs. At the same time, the platform scales to thousands of concurrent users, while maintaining interactive response times.
