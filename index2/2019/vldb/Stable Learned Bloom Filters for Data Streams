Bloom filter and its variants are elegant space-efficient probabilistic data structures for approximate set membership queries. It has been recently shown that the space cost of Bloom filters can be significantly reduced via a combination with pre-trained machine learning models, named Learned Bloom filters (LBF). LBF eases the space requirement of a Bloom filter by undertaking part of the queries using a classifier. However, current LBF structures generally target a static member set. Their performances would inevitably decay when there is a member update on the set, while this update requirement is not uncommon for real-world data streaming applications such as duplicate item detection, malicious URL checking, and web caching. To adapt LBF to data streams, we propose the Stable Learned Bloom Filters (SLBF) which addresses the performance decay issue on intensive insertion workloads by combining classifier with updatable backup filters. Specifically, we propose two SLBF structures, Single SLBF (s-SLBF) and Grouping SLBF (g-SLBF). The theoretical analysis on these two structures shows that the expected false positive rate (FPR) of SLBF is asymptotically a constant over the insertion of new members. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that SLBF introduces a similar level of false negative rate (FNR) but yields a better FPR/storage trade-off compared with the state-of-the-art (non-learned) Bloom filters optimized on data streams.
