This demonstration enables participants to explore large data sets via voice interfaces. The focus of the demonstration is on methods generating concise speech descriptions of query results, specified by users via voice input. The technical novelty of the demonstrated system lies in the fact that processing overheads are mostly moved into a pre-processing phase, generating speeches for batches of queries defined via templates. Visitors can access the demo via smart speakers on-site or via their own smart phones. They will be able to customize the generated voice descriptions and to tune voice output methods.
