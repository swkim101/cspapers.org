Reidentification-risk analysis and anonymity have received a great deal of attention in the last two decades. While the research community has been developing several privacy notions and the algorithms to achieve them, these tools have faced difficulties in being transferred to the wider audience of practitioners, for they require a considerable amount of data privacy technical knowledge.We demonstrate X2R2 (Explainable Explorative Reidentification Risk), a data anonymization tool for the laymen. X2R2 guides the user through a transparent explorative process, during which the existing reidentification risks are explained and quantified, possible data transformation options are recommended, and the consequences of these operations, in terms of privacy risk and data utility, are clearly shown.
