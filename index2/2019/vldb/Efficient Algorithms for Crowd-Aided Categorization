We study the problem of utilizing human intelligence to categorize a large number of objects. In this problem, given a category hierarchy and a set of objects, we can ask humans to check whether an object belongs to a category, and our goal is to find the most cost-effective strategy to locate the appropriate category in the hierarchy for each object, such that the cost (i.e., the number of questions to ask humans) is minimized. There are many important applications of this problem, including image classification and product categorization. We develop an online framework, in which category distribution is gradually learned and thus an effective order of questions are adaptively determined. We prove that even if the true category distribution is known in advance, the problem is computationally intractable. We develop an approximation algorithm, and prove that it achieves an approximation factor of 2. We also show that there is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the problem. Furthermore, we propose an online strategy which achieves nearly the same performance guarantee as the offline optimal strategy, even if there is no knowledge about category distribution beforehand. Experiments on a real crowdsourcing platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
