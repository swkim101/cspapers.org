Depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental and important algorithm in graph analysis. It is the basis of many graph algorithms such as computing strongly connected components, testing planarity, and detecting biconnected components. The result of a DFS is normally shown as a DFS-Tree. Given the frequent updates in many real-world graphs (e.g., social networks and communication networks), we study the problem of DFS-Tree maintenance in dynamic directed graphs. In the literature, most works focus on the DFS-Tree maintenance problem in undirected graphs and directed acyclic graphs. However, their methods cannot easily be applied in the case of general directed graphs. Motivated by this, we propose a framework and corresponding algorithms for both edge insertion and deletion in general directed graphs. We further give several optimizations to speed up the algorithms. We conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.
