Recent work has shown how to use non-recursive Datalog as a programming language for view update strategies in relational databases. In this paper, we extend the idea by considering recursions in the Datalog language for more interesting view definitions (forward transformation) and update strategies (backward transformation), especially over relations that store complex data structures such as trees and graphs. Firstly, we present how recursive bidirectional transformations over such relations can be formulated in Datalog and encapsulated in high-order logic predicates. Secondly, we discuss the validation problem for well-behavedness of the recursive Datalog programs.
