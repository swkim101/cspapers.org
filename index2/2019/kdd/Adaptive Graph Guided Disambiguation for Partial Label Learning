In partial label learning, a multi-class classifier is learned from the ambiguous supervision where each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels among which only one is valid. An intuitive way to deal with this problem is label disambiguation, i.e., differentiating the labeling confidences of different candidate labels so as to try to recover ground-truth labeling information. Recently, feature-aware label disambiguation has been proposed which utilizes the graph structure of feature space to generate labeling confidences over candidate labels. Nevertheless, the existence of noises and outliers in training data makes the graph structure derived from original feature space less reliable. In this paper, a novel partial label learning approach based on adaptive graph guided disambiguation is proposed, which is shown to be more effective in revealing the intrinsic manifold structure among training examples. Other than the sequential disambiguation-then-induction learning strategy, the proposed approach jointly performs adaptive graph construction, candidate label disambiguation and predictive model induction with alternating optimization. Furthermore, we consider the particular human-in-the-loop framework in which a learner is allowed to actively query some ambiguously labeled examples for manual disambiguation. Extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of adaptive graph guided disambiguation for learning from partial label examples.
