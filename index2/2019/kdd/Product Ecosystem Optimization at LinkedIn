Artificial Intelligence (AI) is behind practically every product experience at LinkedIn. From ranking the member's feed to recommending new jobs, AI is used to fulfill our mission to connect the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. While product functionality can be decomposed into separate components, they are deeply interconnected; thus, creating interesting questions and challenging AI problems that need to be solved in a sound and practical manner. In this talk, I will provide an overview of lessons learned and approaches we have developed to address these problems, including scaling to large problem sizes, handling multiple conflicting objective functions, efficient model tuning, and our progress toward using AI to optimize the LinkedIn product ecosystem more holistically.
