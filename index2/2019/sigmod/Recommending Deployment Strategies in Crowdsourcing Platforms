We initiate the study of how to recommend deployment strategies to the task designers in crowdsourcing platforms. The work proposes the first ever optimization based formalism of the task deployment strategies based on different parameters that the task designers have in mind during deployment and present principled algorithms that are designed using computational geometry techniques.
