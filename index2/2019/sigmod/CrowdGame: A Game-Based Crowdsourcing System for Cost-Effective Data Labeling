Large-scale data labeling has become a major bottleneck for many applications, such as machine learning and data integration. This paper presents CrowdGame, a crowdsourcing system that harnesses the crowd to gather data labels in a cost-effective way. CrowdGame focuses on generating high-quality labeling rules to largely reduce the labeling cost while preserving quality. It first generates candidate rules, and then devises a game-based crowdsourcing approach to select rules with high coverage and accuracy. CrowdGame applies the generated rules for effective data labeling. We have implemented CrowdGame and provided a user-friendly interface for users to deploy their labeling applications. We will demonstrate CrowdGame in two representative data labeling scenarios, entity matching and relation extraction.
