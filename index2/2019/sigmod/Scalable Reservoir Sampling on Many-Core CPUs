Database systems need to be able to convert queries to efficient execution plans. As recent research has shown, correctly estimating cardinalities of subqueries is an important factor in the efficiency of the resulting plans [7, 8]. Many algorithms have been proposed in literature that utilize a random sample to estimate cardinalities [6, 9, 13]. Thus, some modern database systems choose to store a materialized uniformly random sample for their relations [3, 6]. Such samples are built and refreshed when statistics are gathered, by loading uniformly random tuples from the relation in disk using random IO.
