The International Workshop on Semantic Big Data (SBD) is already in the fourth year in conjunction with the ACM SIGMOD Conference. By focusing on topics related to Semantic Web and Big Data, it highlights these important research areas to all participants of the SBD workshop and the main conference. Hence, the workshop offers an ideal forum for open discussions and establishment of professional relationships between academic researchers and industrial members of the Semantic Web and database communities.
