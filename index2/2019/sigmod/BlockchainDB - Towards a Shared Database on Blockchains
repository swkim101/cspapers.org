In this demo we present BlockchainDB, which leverages blockchains as storage layer and introduces a database layer on top that extends blockchains by classical data management techniques (e.g., sharding). Further, BlockchainDB provides a standardized key/value-based query interface to facilitate the adoption of blockchains for data sharing use cases. With BlockchainDB we can thus not only improve the performance and scalability of blockchains for data sharing but also decrease the complexity for organizations intending to use blockchains for this use case.
