We present \sys, a declarative, unsupervised root-cause analysis engine that uses time series monitoring data from large complex systems such as data centres. \sys empowers operators to succinctly specify a large number of causal hypotheses to search for causes of interesting events. \sys then ranks these hypotheses, reducing the number of causal dependencies from hundreds of thousands to a handful for human understanding. We show how a declarative language, such as SQL, can be effective in declaratively enumerating hypotheses that probe the structure of an unknown probabilistic graphical causal model of the underlying system. Our thesis is that databases are in a unique position to enable users to rapidly explore the possible causal mechanisms in data collected from diverse sources. We empirically demonstrate how \sys had helped us resolve over 30~performance issues in a commercial product since late 2014, of which we discuss a few cases in detail.
