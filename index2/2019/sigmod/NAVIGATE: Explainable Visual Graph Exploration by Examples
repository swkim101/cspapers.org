We demonstrate NAVIGATE, an explai\underlineNA ble query engine for \underlineVI sual \underlineG r\underlineA ph explora\underlineT ion by \underlineE xamples. NAVIGATE interleavesquery rewriting and query answering to help users (1) search graphs \textslwithout writing complex queries, and (2) understand answers by providing intuitive explanations. Users can visually construct queries and specify missing or unwanted example entities to guide the exploration towards desired answers. NAVIGATE can rewrite queries with answers close to examples, by minimally altering their topological and semantic constraints. Another unique feature is its ability to explain query results by tracing the query manipulation operators that are responsible for transforming the original answers to desirable ones. In addition, NAVIGATE optimizes system response time by referring to dynamically cachedstar views to reduce both query evaluation and rewriting cost at run time. We also demonstrate its ease-of-use, efficiency, and explainable exploration in applications such as recommendation and knowledge base search.
