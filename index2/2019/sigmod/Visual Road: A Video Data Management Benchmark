Recently, video database management systems (VDBMSs) have re-emerged as an active area of research and development. To accelerate innovation in this area, we present Visual Road, a benchmark that evaluates the performance of these systems. Visual Road comes with a data generator and a suite of queries over cameras positioned within a simulated metropolitan environment. Visual Road's video data is automatically generated with a high degree of realism, and annotated using a modern simulation and visualization engine. This allows for VDBMS performance evaluation while scaling up the size of the input data. Visual Road is designed to evaluate a broad variety of VDBMSs: real-time systems, systems for longitudinal analytical queries, systems processing traditional videos, and systems designed for 360 videos. We use the benchmark to evaluate three recent VDBMSs both in capabilities and performance.
