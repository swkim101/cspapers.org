Items from a database are often ranked based on a combination of criteria. The weight given to each criterion in the combination can greatly affect the ranking produced. Often, a user may have a general sense of the relative importance of the different criteria, but beyond this may have the flexibility, within limits, to choose combinations that weigh these criteria differently with an acceptable region. We demonstrate MithraRanking, a system that helps users choose criterion weights that lead to "better'' rankings in terms of having desirable properties while remaining within the acceptable region. The goodness properties we focus on are stability and fairness.
