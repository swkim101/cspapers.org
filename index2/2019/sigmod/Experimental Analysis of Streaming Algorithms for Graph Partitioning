We report a systematic performance study of streaming graph partitioning algorithms. Graph partitioning plays a crucial role in overall system performance as it has a significant impact on both load balancing and inter-machine communication. The streaming model for graph partitioning has recently gained attention due to its ability to scale to very large graphs with limited resources. The main objective of this study is to understand how the choice of graph partitioning algorithm affects system performance, resource usage and scalability. We focus on both offline graph analytics and online graph query workloads. The study considers both edge-cut and vertex-cut approaches. Our results show that the no partitioning algorithms performs best in all cases, and the choice of graph partitioning algorithm depends on: (i) type and degree distribution of the graph, (ii) characteristics of the workloads, and (iii) specific application requirements.
