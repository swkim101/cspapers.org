This Demo presents G-Miner, a distributed system for graph mining. The take-aways for Demo attendees are: (1) a good understanding of the challenges of various graph mining workloads; (2) useful insights on how to design a good system for graph mining by comparing G-Miner with existing systems on performance, expressiveness and user-friendliness; and (3) how to use G-Miner for interactive graph analytics.
