This demo presents a novel data visualization solution for exploring the results of time series anomaly detection systems. When anomalies are reported, there is a need to reason about the results. We introduce Metro-Viz -- a visual tool to assist data scientists in performing this analysis. Metro-Viz offers a rich set of interaction features (e.g., comparative analysis, what-if testing) backed by data management strategies specifically tailored to the workload. We show our tool in action via multiple time series datasets and anomaly detectors.
