The problem of data visualization is to transform data into a visual context such that people can easily understand the significance of data. Nowadays, data visualization becomes especially important, because it is the de facto standard for modern business intelligence and successful data science. This tutorial will cover three specific topics: visualization languages define how the users can interact with various visualization systems; efficient data visualization processes the data and produces visualizations based on well-specified user queries; smart data visualization recommends data visualizations based on underspecified user queries. In this tutorial, we will go logically through these prior art, paying particular attentions on problems that may attract the interest from the database community.
