The last few years have seen the fast and ubiquitous diffusion of JSON as one of the most widely used formats for publishing and interchanging data, as it combines the flexibility of semistructured data models with well-known data structures like records and arrays. The user willing to effectively manage JSON data collections can rely on several schema languages, like JSON Schema, JSound, and Joi, as well as on the type abstractions offered by modern programming and scripting languages like Swift or TypeScript. The main aim of this tutorial is to provide the audience (both researchers and practitioners) with the basic notions for enjoying all the benefits that schema and types can offer while processing and manipulating JSON data. This tutorial focuses on four main aspects of the relation between JSON and schemas: (1) we survey existing schema language proposals and discuss their prominent features; (2) we analyze tools that can infer schemas from data, or that exploit schema information for improving data parsing and management; and (3) we discuss some open research challenges and opportunities related to JSON data.
