Resource interferences caused by concurrent queries is one of the key reasons for unpredictable performance and missed workload SLAs in cluster computing systems. Analyzing these inter-query resource interactions is critical in order to answer time-sensitive questions like 'who is creating resource conflicts to my query'. More importantly, diagnosing whether the resource blocked times of a 'victim' query are caused by other queries or some other external factor can help the database administrator narrow down the many possibilities of query performance degradation. We introduce iQCAR, an inter-Query Contention Analyzer, that attributes blame for the slowdown of a query to concurrent queries. iQCAR models the resource conflicts using a multi-level directed acyclic graph that can help administrators compare impacts from concurrent queries, identify most contentious queries, resources and hosts in an online execution for a selected time window. Our experiments using TPCDS queries on Apache Spark show that our approach is substantially more accurate than other methods based on overlap time between concurrent queries.
