Recently, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field has been experiencing a resurgence. AI broadly covers a wide swath of techniques which include logic-based approaches, probabilistic graphical models, and machine learning/deep learning approaches. Advances in hardware capabilities, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), software components (e.g., accelerated libraries, programming frameworks), and systems infrastructures (e.g., GPU-enabled cloud providers) has led to a wide-spread adaptation of AI techniques to a variety of domains. Examples of such domains include image classification, autonomous driving, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and conversational systems (chatbots). AI techniques not only support multiple datatypes (e.g., free text, images, or speech), but are also available in various configurations, from personal devices to large-scale distributed systems.
