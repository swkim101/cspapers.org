In many software development projects, analysts are required to deal with systems' requirements from unfamiliar domains. Familiarity with the domain is necessary in order to get full leverage from interaction with stakeholders and for extracting relevant information from the existing project documents. Accurate and timely extraction and classification of requirements knowledge support analysts in this challenging scenario. Our approach is to mine real-time interaction records and project documents for the relevant phrasal units about the requirements related topics being discussed during elicitation. We propose to use both generative and discriminating methods. To extract the relevant terms, we leverage the flexibility and power of Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) in dynamic modelling of natural language processing tasks. We used an extended version of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with variable-sized feature vectors to efficiently and dynamically extract and classify requirements-related knowledge from the existing documents. To evaluate the performance of our approach intuitively and quantitatively, we used edit distance and precision/recall metrics. We show in three case studies that the snippets extracted by our method are intuitively relevant and reasonably accurate. Furthermore, we found that statistical and linguistic parameters such as smoothing methods, and words contiguity and order features can impact the performance of both extraction and classification tasks.
