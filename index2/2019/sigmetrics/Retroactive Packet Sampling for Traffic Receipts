Is it possible to design a packet-sampling algorithm that prevents the network node that performs the sampling from treating the sampled packets preferentially? We study this problem in the context of designing a "network-transparency'' system. In this system, networks emit receipts for a small sample of the packets they observe, and a monitor collects these receipts to estimate each network's loss and delay performance. Sampling is a good building block for this system, because it enables a solution that is flexible and combines low resource cost with quantifiable accuracy. The challenge is cheating resistance: when a network's performance is assessed based on the conditions experienced by a small traffic sample, the network has a strong incentive to treat the sampled packets better than the rest. We contribute a sampling algorithm that is provably robust to such prioritization attacks, enables network performance estimation with quantifiable accuracy, and requires minimal resources. We confirm our analysis using real traffic traces.
