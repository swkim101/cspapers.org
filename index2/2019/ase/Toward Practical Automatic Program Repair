Automated program repair (APR) reduces the burden of debugging by directly suggesting likely fixes for the bugs. We believe scalability, applicability, and accurate patch validation are among the main challenges for building practical APR techniques that the researchers in this area are dealing with. In this paper, we describe the steps that we are taking toward addressing these challenges.
