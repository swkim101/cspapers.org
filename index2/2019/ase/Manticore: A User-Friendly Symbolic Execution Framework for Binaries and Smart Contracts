An effective way to maximize code coverage in software tests is through dynamic symbolic executionâ€”a technique that uses constraint solving to systematically explore a program's state space. We introduce an open-source dynamic symbolic execution framework called Manticore for analyzing binaries and Ethereum smart contracts. Manticore's flexible architecture allows it to support both traditional and exotic execution environments, and its API allows users to customize their analysis. Here, we discuss Manticore's architecture and demonstrate the capabilities we have used to find bugs and verify the correctness of code for our commercial clients.
