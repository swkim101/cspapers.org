To detect specific types of bugs and vulnerabilities, static analysis tools must be correctly configured with security-relevant methods (SRM), e.g., sources, sinks, sanitizers and authentication methodsâ€“usually a very labour-intensive and error-prone process. This work presents the semi-automated tool SWAN_ASSIST, which aids the configuration with an IntelliJ plugin based on active machine learning. It integrates our novel automated machine-learning approach SWAN, which identifies and classifies Java SRM. SWAN_ASSIST further integrates user feedback through iterative learning. SWAN_ASSIST aids developers by asking them to classify at each point in time exactly those methods whose classification best impact the classification result. Our experiments show that SWAN_ASSIST classifies SRM with a high precision, and requires a relatively low effort from the user.
