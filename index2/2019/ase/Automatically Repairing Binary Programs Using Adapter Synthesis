Bugs in commercial software and third-party components are an undesirable and expensive phenomenon. Such software is usually released to users only in binary form. The lack of source code renders users of such software dependent on their software vendors for repairs of bugs. Such dependence is even more harmful if the bugs introduce new vulnerabilities in the software. Automatically repairing security and functionality bugs in binary code increases software robustness without any developer effort. In this research, we propose development of a binary program repair tool that uses existing bug-free fragments of code to repair buggy code.
