We present a deterministic polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for computing the algebraic rank of a set of bounded degree polynomials. The notion of algebraic rank naturally generalizes the notion of rank in linear algebra, i.e., instead of considering only the linear dependencies, we also consider higher degree algebraic dependencies among the input polynomials. More speciﬁcally, we give an algorithm that takes as input a set f := { f 1 , . . . , f n } ⊂ F [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] of polynomials with degrees bounded by d , and a rational number (cid:15) > 0 and runs in time O (( nmd(cid:15) ) O ( d 2 (cid:15) ) · M ( n )), where M ( n ) is the time required to compute the rank of an n × n matrix (with ﬁeld entries), and ﬁnally outputs a number r , such that r is at least (1 − (cid:15) ) times the algebraic rank of f . Our key contribution is a new technique which allows us to achieve the higher degree generalization of the results by Bl¨aser, Jindal, Pandey (CCC’17) who gave a deterministic PTAS for computing the rank of a matrix with homogeneous linear entries. It is known that a deterministic algorithm for exactly computing the rank in the linear case is already equivalent to the celebrated Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem which itself would imply circuit complexity lower bounds (Ka-banets, Impagliazzo
