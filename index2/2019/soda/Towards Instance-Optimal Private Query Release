We study efficient mechanisms for the query release problem in differential privacy: given a workload of $m$ statistical queries, output approximate answers to the queries while satisfying the constraints of differential privacy. In particular, we are interested in mechanisms that optimally adapt to the given workload. Building on the projection mechanism of Nikolov, Talwar, and Zhang, and using the ideas behind Dudley's chaining inequality, we propose new efficient algorithms for the query release problem, and prove that they achieve optimal sample complexity for the given workload (up to constant factors, in certain parameter regimes) with respect to the class of mechanisms that satisfy concentrated differential privacy. We also give variants of our algorithms that satisfy local differential privacy, and prove that they also achieve optimal sample complexity among all local sequentially interactive private mechanisms.
