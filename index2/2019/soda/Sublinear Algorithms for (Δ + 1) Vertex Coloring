Any graph with maximum degree ∆ admits a proper vertex coloring with ∆+1 colors that can be found via a simple sequential greedy algorithm in linear time and space. But can one (cid:12)nd such a coloring via a sublinear algorithm? We answer this fundamental question in the af-(cid:12)rmative for several canonical classes of sublinear algorithms including graph streaming, sublinear time, and massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithms. In particular, we design:
