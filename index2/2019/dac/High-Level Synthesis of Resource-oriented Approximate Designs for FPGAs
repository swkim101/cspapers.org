When attempting to make a design fit a set of the heterogeneous resources found in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), designers using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) may resort to approximate approaches. However, current FPGA-oriented approximate HLS tools do not allow specifying constraints on heterogeneous resources such as lookup tables, flip-flops, and multipliers, being instead error-oriented. In this work, we propose a resource-oriented HLS methodology with which designers can specify heterogeneous resource constraints and satisfy them while minimizing the output error, attaining average improvements, over error-oriented approaches, of about 34% and 2.2 dB for mean-squared error and peak signal-to-noise ratio error metrics, respectively.
