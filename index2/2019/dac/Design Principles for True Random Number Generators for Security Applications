The generation of high quality true random numbers is essential in security applications. For secure communication, we also require high quality true random number generators (TRNGs) in embedded and IoT devices. This paper provides insights into modern TRNG design principles and their evaluation, based on standardâ€™s requirements and design experience. We illustrate our approach with a case study of a recently proposed delay chain based TRNG.
