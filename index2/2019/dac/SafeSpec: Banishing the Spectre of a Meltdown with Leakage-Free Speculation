Speculative attacks, such as Spectre and Meltdown, target speculative execution to access privileged data and leak it through a side-channel. In this paper, we introduce (SafeSpec), a new model for supporting speculation in a way that is immune to the side-channel leakage by storing side effects of speculative instructions in separate structures until they commit. Additionally, we address the possibility of a covert channel from speculative instructions to committed instructions before these instructions are committed. We develop a cycle accurate model of modified design of an x86-64 processor and show that the performance impact is negligible.
