In this paper, we address the problem of how to achieve energy-efficient confined-interference communication on a bufferless NoC taking advantage of the low power consumption of such NoC. We propose a novel routing approach called Surfing on a Bufferless NoC (Surf-Bless) where packets are assigned to domains and Surf-Bless guarantees that interference between packets is confined within a domain, i.e., there is no interference between packets assigned to different domains. By experiments, we show that our Surf-Bless routing approach is effective in supporting confined-interference communication and consumes much less energy than the related approaches.
