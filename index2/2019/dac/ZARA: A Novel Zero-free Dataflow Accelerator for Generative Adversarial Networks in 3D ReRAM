Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) recently demonstrated a great opportunity toward unsupervised learning with the intention to mitigate the massive human efforts on data labeling in supervised learning algorithms. GAN combines a generative model and a discriminative model to oppose each other in an adversarial situation to refine their abilities. Existing nonvolatile memory based machine learning accelerators, however, could not support the computational needs required by GAN training. Specifically, the generator utilizes a new operator, called transposed convolution, which introduces significant resource underutilization when executed on conventional neural network accelerators as it inserts massive zeros in its input before a convolution operation. In this work, we propose a novel computational deformation technique that synergistically optimizes the forward and backward functions in transposed convolution to eliminate the large resource underutilization. In addition, we present dedicated control units -a dataflow mapper and an operation scheduler, to support the proposed execution model with high parallelism and low energy consumption. ZARA is implemented with commodity ReRAM chips, and experimental results show that our design can improve GAN’s training performance by averagely 1.6 × ~ 23 × over CMOS-based GAN accelerators. Compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM-based accelerator designs, ZARA also provides 1.15 × ~ 2.1 × performance improvement. CCS CONCEPTS • Hardware → Hardware accelerators;
