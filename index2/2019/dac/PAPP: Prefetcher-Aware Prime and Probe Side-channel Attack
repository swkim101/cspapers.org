CPU memory prefetchers can substantially interfere with prime and probe cache side-channel attacks, especially on in-order CPUs which use aggressive prefetching. This interference is not accounted for in previous attacks. In this paper, we propose PAPP, a PrefetcherAware Prime Probe attack that can operate even in the presence of aggressive prefetchers. Specifically, we reverse engineer the prefetcher and replacement policy on several CPUs and use these insights to design a prime and probe attack that minimizes the impact of the prefetcher. We evaluate PAPP using Cache Side-channel Vulnerability (CSV) metric and demonstrate the substantial improvements in the quality of the channel under different conditions.
