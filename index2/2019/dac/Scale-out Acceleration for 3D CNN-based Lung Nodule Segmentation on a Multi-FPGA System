Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) have become a promising method in lung nodule segmentation. The high computational complexity and memory requirements of 3D CNNs make it challenging to accelerate 3D CNNs on a single FPGA. In this work, we focus on accelerating the 3D CNN-based lung nodule segmentation on a multi-FPGA platform by proposing an efficient mapping scheme that takes advantage of the massive parallelism provided by the platform, as well as maximizing the computational efficiency of the accelerators. Experimental results show that our system integrating with four Xilinx VCU118 can achieve state-of-the-art performance of 14.5 TOPS, in addition with a 29. 4x performance gain over CPU and 10. 5x more energy efficiency over GPU.CCS Concepts â€¢ Computer systems organization $\rightarrow$Special purpose systems.
