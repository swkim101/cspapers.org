Face detection and alignment are highly-correlated, computation-intensive tasks, without being flexibly supported by any facial-oriented accelerator yet. This work proposes the first unified accelerator for multi-face detection and alignment, along with the optimizations on multi-task cascaded convolutional networks algorithm, to implement both multi-face detection and alignment. First, the clustering non-maximum suppression is proposed to significantly reduce intersection over union computation and eliminate the hardware-interfer-ence sorting process, bringing 16.0% speed-up without any loss. Second, a new pipeline architecture is presented to implement the proposal network in more computation-efficient manner, with 41.7% less multiplier usage and 38.3% decrease in memory capacity compared with the similar method. Third, a batch schedule mechanism is proposed to improve hardware utilization of fully-connected layer by 16.7% on average with variable input number in batch process. Based on the TSMC 28 nm CMOS process, this accelerator only consumes 6.7ms at 400 MHz to simultaneously process 5 faces for each image and achieves 1.17 TOPS/W power efficiency, which is $54.8 \times $ higher than the state-of-the-art solution.
