FPGAs, as the most popular reconfigurable fabrics, have dramatically increased their computing capacity in the past years. Taking Xilinx FPGAs for example, the capacity of logic cells in Vertex-7 [8] has $100 \times $ increase than Vertex-4 [7], while the memory capacity has only $10 \times $ increase. The on-chip memory resources of modern FPGAs are scarce and inflexible (as they are located at certain positions). However, recent data-intensive tasks (e.g., machine learning and big-data applications) devote most of their processing time to I/O and data manipulation, leading to a large amount of memory access and data movement [4]. The limited on-chip memory resources in FPGAs restrict their ability to deal with data-intensive tasks in the new era. In addition, the configurable logics and interconnections, which are the main building blocks of modern FPGAs [5], cannot change their primary functionalities (for example, interconnections cannot implement logics), which also limits the flexibility of FPGAs when dealing with different applications.
