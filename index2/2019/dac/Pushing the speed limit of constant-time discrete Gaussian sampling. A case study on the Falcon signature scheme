Sampling from a discrete Gaussian distribution has applications in lattice-based post-quantum cryptography. Several efficient solutions have been proposed in recent years. However, making a Gaussian sampler secure against timing attacks turned out to be a challenging research problem. In this work, we present a toolchain to instantiate an efficient constant-time discrete Gaussian sampler of arbitrary standard deviation and precision. We observe an interesting property of the mapping from input random bit strings to samples during a Knuth-Yao sampling algorithm and propose an efficient way of minimizing the Boolean expressions for the mapping. Our minimization approach results in up to 37% faster discrete Gaussian sampling compared to the previous work. Finally, we apply our optimized and secure Gaussian sampler in the lattice-based digital signature algorithm Falcon, which is a NIST submission, and provide experimental evidence that the overall performance of the signing algorithm degrades by at most 33% only due to the additional overhead of ‘constant-time’ sampling, including the 60% overhead of random number generation. Breaking a general belief, our results indirectly show that the use of discrete Gaussian samples in digital signature algorithms would be beneficial.CCS CONCEPTS• Security and privacy $\rightarrow$ Side-channel analysis and counter-measures; Digital signatures; Hardware attacks and countermeasures; Cryptography.
