Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs) enhance a deep neural network with an external differentiable memory, enabling them to perform complex tasks well beyond the capabilities of conventional deep neural networks. We identify a unique challenge that arises in MANNs due to soft reads and writes to the differentiable memory, each of which requires access to all the memory locations. This characteristic of MANN workloads severely limits the performance of MANNs on CPUs, GPUs, and classical neural network accelerators. We present the first effort to design a hardware architecture that improves the efficiency of MANNs. Leveraging the intrinsic ability of resistive crossbars to efficiently realize in-memory computations, we propose X-MANN, a memory-centric crossbar-based architecture that is specialized to match the compute characteristics observed in MANNs. We design a transposable crossbar processing unit that can efficiently perform the different computational kernels of MANNs. To improve performance of soft writes in X-MANN, we propose an incremental write mechanism that leverages the characteristics of soft write operations. We develop an architectural simulator for X-MANN that utilizes array-level timing and power models of resistive crossbars calibrated from SPICE simulations. Across a suite of MANN benchmarks, X-MANN achieves 23.7×-45.7× speedup and 75.1×-267.1× reduction in energy over state-of-the-art GPU implementations.
