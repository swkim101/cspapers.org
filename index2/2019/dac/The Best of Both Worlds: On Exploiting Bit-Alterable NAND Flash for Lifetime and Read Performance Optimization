With the emergence of bit-alterable 3D NAND flash, programming and erasing a flash cell at bit-level granularity have become a reality. Bit-level operations can benefit the high density, high bit-error-rate 3D NAND flash via realizing the “bit-level rewrite operation,” which can refresh error bits at bit-level granularity for reducing the error correction latency and improving the read performance with minimal lifetime expense. Different from existing refresh techniques, bit-level operations can lower the lifetime expense via removing error bits directly without page-based rewrites. However, since bit-level rewrites may induce a similar amount of latency as conventional page-based rewrites and thus lead to low rewrite throughput, the efficiency of bit-level rewrites should be carefully considered. Such observation motivates us to propose a bit-level error removal (BER) scheme to derive the most-efficient way of utilizing the bit-level operations for both lifetime and read performance optimization. A series of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the BER scheme with encouraging results.
