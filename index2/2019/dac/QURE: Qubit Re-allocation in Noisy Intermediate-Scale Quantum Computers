Concerted efforts by the academia and the industries e.g., IBM, Google and Intel have brought us to the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Qubits, the basic elements of quantum computer, have been proven extremely susceptible to different noises. Recent experiments have exhibited spatial variations among the qubits in NISQ hardware. Therefore, conventional mapping of qubit done without quality awareness results in significant loss of fidelity for a given workload. In this paper, we have analyzed the effects of various noise sources on the overall fidelity of the given workload for a real NISQ hardware. We have also presented novel optimization technique namely, Qubit Re-allocation (QURE) to maximize the sequence fidelity of a given workload. QURE is scalable and can be applied to future large scale quantum computers. QURE can improve the fidelity of a quantum workload up to 1.54X (1.39X on average) in simulation and up to 1.7X in real device compared to variation oblivious qubit allocation without incurring any physical overhead.
