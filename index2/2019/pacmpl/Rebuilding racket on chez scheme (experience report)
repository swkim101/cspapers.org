We rebuilt Racket on Chez Scheme, and it works wellâ€”as long as we're allowed a few patches to Chez Scheme. DrRacket runs, the Racket distribution can build itself, and nearly all of the core Racket test suite passes. Maintainability and performance of the resulting implementation are good, although some work remains to improve end-to-end performance. The least predictable part of our effort was how big the differences between Racket and Chez Scheme would turn out to be and how we would manage those differences. We expect Racket on Chez Scheme to become the main Racket implementation, and we encourage other language implementers to consider Chez Scheme as a target virtual machine.
