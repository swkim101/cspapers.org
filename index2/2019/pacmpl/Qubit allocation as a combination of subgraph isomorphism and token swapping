In 2016, the first quantum processors have been made available to the general public. The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet, such possibility also brought challenges. One challenge is the so called Qubit Allocation problem: the mapping of a virtual quantum circuit into an actual quantum architecture. There exist solutions to this problem; however, in our opinion, they fail to capitalize on decades of improvements on graph theory. In contrast, this paper shows how to model qubit allocation as the combination of Subgraph Isomorphism and Token Swapping. This idea has been made possible by the publication of an approximative solution to the latter problem in 2016. We have compared our algorithm against five other qubit allocators, all independently designed in the last two years, including the winner of the IBM Challenge. When evaluated in "Tokyo", a quantum architecture with 20 qubits, our technique outperforms these state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the quality of the solutions that it finds and the amount of memory that it uses, while showing practical runtime.
