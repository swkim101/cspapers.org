We present an offline method to generate smooth, feasible motion for robot arms such that end-effector pose goals of a 6-DoF path are matched within acceptable limits specified by the user. Our approach aims to accurately match the position and orientation goals of the given path, and allows deviation from these goals if there is danger of self-collisions, joint-space discontinuities or kinematic singularities. Our method generates multiple candidate trajectories, and selects the best by incorporating sparse user input that specifies what kinds of deviations are acceptable. We apply our method to a range of challenging paths and show that our method generates solutions that achieve smooth, feasible motions while closely approximating the given pose goals and adhering to user specifications.
