As inertial and visual sensors are becoming ubiquitous, visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) have prevailed in a wide range of applications from mobile augmented reality to aerial navigation to autonomous driving, in part because of the complementary sensing capabilities and the decreasing costs and size of the sensors. In this paper, we survey thoroughly the research efforts taken in this field and strive to provide a concise but complete review of the related work – which is unfortunately missing in the literature while being greatly demanded by researchers and engineers – in the hope to accelerate the VINS research and beyond in our society as a whole.
