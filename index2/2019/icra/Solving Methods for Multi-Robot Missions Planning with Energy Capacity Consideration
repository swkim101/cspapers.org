We consider a problem minimizing the total duration of accomplishing missions performed by heterogeneous vehicles. The problem respects constraints related to vehiclesâ€™ capabilities and energy capacities. The goal is to determine the best routes of each vehicle deployed by choosing which waypoints to pass and which observations to perform. Each vehicle has a particular distance matrix and a limited energy. In order to provide high quality solutions within reasonable computational time, two decomposition-based approximate methods were implemented: (i) the Multiphase heuristic, and (ii) the Two-Phase iterative heuristic. The performance of the methods is evaluated against the Branch-and-Cut algorithm using generated instances.
