Robotic bronchoscopy has the potential to improve the early detection of lung cancer. For the technology to be broadly adopted, the physician needs to be able to control the robotic bronchoscope in an instinctive and effective manner. In this paper, we describe the algorithms used to manipulate/drive the Auris Monarch Platform, a 10 degree-of-freedom bronchoscope and sheath, using a 3 degree-of-freedom user input. We introduce the concept of paired driving where the devices co-insert and co-articulate depending on their relative insertion. The paper presents safety algorithms such as auto-relax on retract and tension monitoring. The drive modes were developed, optimized, and clinically tested in lung models, human cadavers and live porcine models prior to their commercial release. Clinical studies show that the physician is able to reach significantly deeper in the lung than with classic bronchoscopes.
