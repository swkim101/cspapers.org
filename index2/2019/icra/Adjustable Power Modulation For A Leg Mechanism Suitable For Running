Recent work in the design of mechanical systems for terrestrial locomotion has indicated successful strategies for increasing the energetic performance of a robotic locomotor without upgrading its actuator system. We apply one such strategy, termed power modulation, in a new way: for the design of a leg mechanism useful for running. Power modulation geometrically defines force/torque ratios between robot components to mechanically achieve certain energy transmission characteristics during fast stance dynamics that increase the kinetic power output of the overall system. Furthermore, we investigate the design of a leg mechanism that can adjust to exhibit power modulation. In this way, a leg mechanism would exhibit a low power mode for flat terrain, and can adjust to a high power mode for rough terrain. The latter makes jumping possible and extends the range of available footholds that can be accessed in a single step. To find a suitable leg mechanism, we leverage the Finite Root Generation method to compute a design. The design is advanced to a prototype and basic experiments are conducted to investigate its behavior as adjusted between high-and low-power modes.
