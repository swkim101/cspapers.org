In this paper, we introduce a cargo transportation method with a new type of multi-rotor UAV platform known as T3-multirotor, to achieve stable and constant flight performance regardless of the type of cargo attached to the fuselage. The $T^{3}$-multirotor, which consists of the ‘Thrust Generating Part’ and the ‘Fuselage Part’, can directly control the relative attitude between the two parts using the novel servomechanism. By utilizing the servomechanism with the proposed relative attitude control strategy, the T3-multirotor with cargo attached to the fuselage part can behave as a multi-rotor with only the moment of inertia of the thrust generating part during entire transportation. This allows the T3-multirotor to achieve the reliable performance in the event of any cargo being attached to the fuselage, achieving stable platform motion control. Detailed hardware description and dynamic analysis of T3-Multirotor is performed in this paper, and the validity of the proposed control strategy is also analyzed. The feasibility of the proposed control strategy is verified through experimental results with analysis.
