In a recent study, we developed a minimally actuated wave-like robot and analyzed its kinematics. In this paper, we present the dynamic locomotion analysis of a miniature version of this wave robot. We examine different crawling environments, determine under which conditions it can advance, and evaluate its propulsion force. We first developed two locomotion models to characterize the cases where the robot is crawling between two straight surfaces or over a single flat surface. We specified the conditions in which the robot will advance and the advance time ratio as a function of the friction forces and weight of the robot. Next, we developed highly flexible tube-like shapes that we molded from silicone rubber to experimentally test the forces acting on the robot inside these tubes. Finally, we designed a miniature model of the robot and experimentally validated its crawling conditions (see video).
