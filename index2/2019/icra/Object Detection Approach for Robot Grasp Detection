In this paper, we focus on the robot grasping problem with parallel grippers using image data. For this task, we propose and implement an end-to-end approach. In order to detect the good grasping poses for a parallel gripper from RGB images, we have employed transfer learning for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detection architecture. Our obtained results show that, the adapted network either outperforms or is on-par with the state-of-the art methods on a benchmark dataset. We also performed grasping experiments on a real robot platform to evaluate our methodâ€™s real world performance.
