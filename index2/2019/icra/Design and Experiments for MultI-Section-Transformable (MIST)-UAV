Presented in this paper are the design and experiments for a transformable Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV. This work demonstrates shape-shifting transformation, building upon the conceptual designs put forth in [1] and [2], along with hardware prototyping and component testing from [3]. A deterministic model is presented to characterize the flight of the MIST-UAV in simulation. Experimental results from the platform demonstrate for the first time successful in-air transformation from multi-rotor, tail-sitter, and fixed-wing operation. Experiments also validated transformation repeatability, successfully testing multiple sequential transformations.
