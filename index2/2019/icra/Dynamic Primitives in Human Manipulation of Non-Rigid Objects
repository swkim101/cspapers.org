This study examined strategies humans chose to manipulate an object with complex (nonlinear, underactuated) dynamics, such as liquid sloshing in a cup of coffee. The problem was simplified to the well-known cart-and-pendulum system moving on a horizontal line. This model was implemented in a virtual environment and human subjects manipulated the object via a robotic manipulandum. The task was to maneuver the system from rest to arrive at a target position such that no residual oscillations of the pendulum bob remained. Our goal was to test whether humans simplified control by employing dynamic primitives, specifically submovements. Experimental velocity profiles of the human movements were compared to those predicted by three different control models. Two models used continuous optimization-based control, the third control model was based on Input Shaping. Input Shaping is a method for controlling flexible objects by convolving a motion profile with impulses of appropriate amplitude and timing. To evaluate whether humans used Input Shaping, we decomposed the velocity profiles recorded from humans into submovements, as proxies for the convolved impulses. Comparing the motion profiles from the 3 models with the experimentally measured human profiles showed superior performance of the Input Shaping model. These initial results are consistent with our hypothesis that combining dynamic primitives, submovements, is a competent description of human performance and may provide a simpler alternative to computationally complex optimization-based methods of robot control.
