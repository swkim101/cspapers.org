This paper presents a novel methodology for implementing optimized jumping behavior on quadruped robots. Our method includes efficient trajectory optimization, precise high-frequency tracking controller and robust landing controller for stabilizing the robot body position and orientation after impact. Experimental validation was successfully conducted on the MIT Cheetah 3, enabling the robot to repeatably jump onto and jump down from a desk with the height of 30â€³ (0.76 m). The result demonstrates the advantages of the approach as well as the capability of the robot hardware itself.
