In this paper, we propose a method for selecting the optimal footholds for legged systems. The goal of the proposed method is to find the best foothold for the swing leg on a local elevation map. First, we evaluate the geometrical characteristics of each cell on the elevation map, checks kinematic constraints and collisions. Then, we apply the Convolutional Neural Network to learn the relationship between the local elevation map and the quality of potential footholds. During execution time, the controller obtains the qualitative measurement of each potential foothold from the neural model. This method evaluates hundreds of potential footholds and checks multiple constraints in a single step which takes 10 ms on a standard computer without GPU. The experiments were carried out on a quadruped robot walking over rough terrain in both simulation and real robotic platforms.
