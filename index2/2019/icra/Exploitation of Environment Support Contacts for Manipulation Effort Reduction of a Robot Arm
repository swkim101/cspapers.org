Humans commonly exploit interaction with the environment constraints to assist the execution of the locomanipulation tasks they perform. One particular example is the exploration of contacts during manipulation to relax the loading of those arm joints that are not directly involved in the generation of the manipulation motions and forces, e.g. establishing a contact with the elbow joint to reduce the effort of the upper arm while executing wrist level manipulation.In this paper, we shall explore the possibility of actively (a) utilizing the environment for a non-end-effector support contact towards reducing the joints efforts during manipulation tasks. This is achieved by our proposed control scheme with a three-level hierarchical compliance controller. The highest priority task is assigned to an impedance control that regulates the interaction at the contact control point on the arm in the normal direction of the support plane prior to contact, and is switched to an optimal contact force control for minimizing the joint effort after the contact is built. The second priority task is an impedance control at the same point in the tangential directions of the plane to stabilize the contact. In the end, an impedance behavior at the end-effector is designed to deal with the interaction forces required by the manipulation tasks. The efficacy of the proposed control scheme was corroborated by simulations and experiments, where significant joint effort reduction was observed.
