We investigate decentralised decision-making, in which a robot swarm is tasked with selecting the best-quality option among a set of alternatives. Individual robots are simplistic as they only perform diffusive search, make local noisy estimates of the optionsâ€™ quality, and exchange information with near neighbours. We propose a decentralised algorithm, inspired by house-hunting honeybees, to efficiently aggregate noisy estimations. Individual robots, by varying over time a single decentralised parameter that modulates the interaction strength, balance exploration and agreement. In this way, the swarm first identifies the options under consideration, then rapidly converges on the best available option, even when outnumbered by lower quality options. We present stochastic analyses and swarm robotics simulations to compare the novel strategy with previous methods and to quantify the performance improvement. The proposed strategy limits the spreading of errors within the population and allows swarms of simple noisy units with minimal communication capabilities to make highly accurate collective decisions in predictable time.
