A physically-motivated friction model with a parametric description of the nonlinear dependency of the temperature and velocity as well as the dependency on external load is presented. The fully parametric approach extends a static friction model in the gross sliding regime. We show how it can be seamlessly integrated in standard dynamic friction models such as Lund Grenoble (LuGre) and Generalized-Maxwell-Slip (GMS). Parameters of a Harmonic Drive CSD 25 gear are experimentally identified and the final model is evaluated on a dedicated test-bed. We show the integration and effectiveness in dynamic simulation, friction compensation, and external torque estimation.
