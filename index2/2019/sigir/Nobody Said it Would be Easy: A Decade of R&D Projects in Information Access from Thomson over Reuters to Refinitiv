In this talk, I survey a small, non-random sample of research projects in information access carried out as part of the Thomson Reuters family of companies over the course of a 10+-year period. I analyse into how these projects are similar and different when compared to academic research efforts and attempt a critical (and personal, so certainly subjective) assessment of what academia can do for industry, and what industry can do for research in terms of R&D efforts. I will conclude with some advice for academic-industry collaboration initiatives in several areas of vertical information services (legal, finance, pharma and regulatory/compliance) as well as news.
