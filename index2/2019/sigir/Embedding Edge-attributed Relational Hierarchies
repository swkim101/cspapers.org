Relational embedding methods encode objects and their relations as low-dimensional vectors. While achieving competitive performance on a variety of relational inference tasks, these methods fall short of preserving the hierarchies that are often formed in existing graph data, and ignore the rich edge attributes that describe the relation facts. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method that simultaneously preserve the hierarchical property and the edge information in the edge-attributed relational hierarchies. The proposed method preserves the hierarchical relations by leveraging the non-linearity of hyperbolic vector translations, for which the edge attributes are exploited to capture the importance of each relation fact. Our experiment is conducted on the well-known Enron organizational chart, where the supervision relations between employees of the Enron company are accompanied with email-based attributes. We show that our method produces relational embeddings of higher quality than state-of-the-art methods, and outperforms a variety of strong baselines in reconstructing the organizational chart.
