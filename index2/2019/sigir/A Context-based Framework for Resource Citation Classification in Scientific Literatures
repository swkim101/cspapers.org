In this paper, we introduce the task of resource citation classification for scientific literature using a context-based framework. This task is to analyze the purpose of citing an on-line resource in scientific text by modeling the role and function of each resource citation. It can be incorporated into resource indexing and recommendation systems to help better understand and classify on-line resources in scientific literature. We propose a new annotation scheme for this task and develop a dataset of 3,088 manually annotated resource citations. We adopt a neural-based model to build the classifiers and apply them on the large ARC dataset to examine the revolution of scientific resources from trends in their function over time.
