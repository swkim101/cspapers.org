This doctoral research project investigates using Quantum Theory (QT) to represent language, especially in some dynamic scenarios, e.g. when dealing with dynamic corpora or interactive tasks. The author plans to propose a quantum state driven framework for language problems and generalize it in a high-dimensional tensor space. Dynamics will be modeled by the formalism thereof of quantum evolution governing the update of quantum states. The author argues that this proposal will pave the way towards a new paradigm which may provide some novel insights about how to represent the language and its evolution in dynamic scenarios.
