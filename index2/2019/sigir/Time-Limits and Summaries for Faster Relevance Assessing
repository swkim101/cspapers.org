Relevance assessing is a critical part of test collection construction as well as applications such as high-recall retrieval that require large amounts of relevance feedback. In these applications, tens of thousands of relevance assessments are required and assessing costs are directly related to the speed at which assessments are made. We conducted a user study with 60 participants where we investigated the impact of time limits (15, 30, and 60 seconds) and document size (full length vs. short summaries) on relevance assessing. Participants were shown either full documents or document summaries that they had to judge within a 15, 30, or 60 seconds time constraint per document. We found that using a time limit as short as 15 seconds or judging document summaries in place of full documents could significantly speed judging without significantly affecting judging quality. Participants found judging document summaries with a 60 second time limit to be the easiest and best experience of the six conditions. While time limits may speed judging, the same speed benefits can be had with high quality document summaries while providing an improved judging experience for assessors.
