The recent work on neural ranking has achieved solid relevance improvement, by exploring similarities between documents and queries using word embeddings. It is an open problem how to leverage such an advancement for privacy-aware ranking, which is important for top K document search on the cloud. Since neural ranking adds more complexity in score computation, it is difficult to prevent the server from discovering embedding-based semantic features and inferring privacy-sensitive information. This paper analyzes the critical leakages in interaction-based neural ranking and studies countermeasures to mitigate such a leakage. It proposes a privacy-aware neural ranking scheme that integrates tree ensembles with kernel value obfuscation and a soft match map based on adaptively-clustered term closures. The paper also presents an evaluation with two TREC datasets on the relevance of the proposed techniques and the trade-offs for privacy and storage efficiency.
