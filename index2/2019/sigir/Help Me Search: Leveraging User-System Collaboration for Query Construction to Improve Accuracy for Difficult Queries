In this paper, we address the problem of difficult queries by using a novel strategy of collaborative query construction where the search engine would actively engage users in an iterative process to continuously revise a query. This approach can be implemented in any search engine to provide search support for users via a "Help Me Search" button, which a user can click on as needed. We focus on studying a specific collaboration strategy where the search engine and the user work together to iteratively expand a query. We propose a possible implementation for this strategy in which the system generates candidate terms by utilizing the history of interactions of the user with the system. Evaluation using a simulated user study shows the great promise of the proposed approach. We also perform a case study with three real users which further illustrates the potential effectiveness of the approach.
