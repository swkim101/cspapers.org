Deep learning models have been very successful in many natural language processing tasks. Search engine works with rich natural language data, e.g., queries and documents, which implies great potential of applying deep natural language processing on such data to improve search performance. Furthermore, it opens an unprecedented opportunity to explore more advanced search experience, such as conversational search and chatbot. This tutorial offers an overview on deep learning based natural language processing for search systems from an industry perspective. We focus on how deep natural language processing powers search systems in practice. The tutorial introduces basic concepts, elaborates associated challenges, reviews the state-of-the-art approaches, covers end-to-end tasks in search systems with examples, and discusses the future trend.
