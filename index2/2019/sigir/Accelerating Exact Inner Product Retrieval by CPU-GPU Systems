Recommender systems are widely used in many applications, e.g., social network, e-commerce. Inner product retrieval IPR is the core subroutine in Matrix Factorization (MF) based recommender systems. It consists of two phases: i) inner product computation and ii) top-k items retrieval. The performance bottleneck of existing solutions is inner product computation phase. Exploiting Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the computation intensive workloads is the gold standard in data mining and machine learning communities. However, it is not trivial to apply CPU-GPU systems to boost the performance of IPR solutions due to the nature complex of the IPR problem. In this work, we analyze the time cost of each phase in IPR solutions at first. Second, we exploit the characteristics of CPU-GPU systems to improve performance. Specifically, the computation tasks of IPR solution are heterogeneously processed in CPU-GPU systems. Third, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposal on four standard real datasets.
