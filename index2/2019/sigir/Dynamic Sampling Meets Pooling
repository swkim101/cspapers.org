A team of six assessors used Dynamic Sampling (Cormack and Grossman 2018) and one hour of assessment effort per topic to form, without pooling, a test collection for the TREC 2018 Common Core Track. Later, official relevance assessments were rendered by NIST for documents selected by depth-10 pooling augmented by move-to-front (MTF) pooling (Cormack et al. 1998), as well as the documents selected by our Dynamic Sampling effort. MAP estimates rendered from dynamically sampled assessments using the xinfAP statistical evaluator are comparable to those rendered from the complete set of official assessments using the standard trec_eval tool. MAP estimates rendered using only documents selected by pooling, on the other hand, differ substantially. The results suggest that the use of Dynamic Sampling without pooling can, for an order of magnitude less assessment effort, yield information-retrieval effectiveness estimates that exhibit lower bias, lower error, and comparable ability to rank system effectiveness.
