Answer selection focuses on selecting the correct answer for a question. Most previous work on answer selection achieves good performance by employing an RNN, which processes all question and answer sentences with the same feature extractor regardless of the sentence length. These methods often encounter the problem of long-term dependencies. To address this issue, we propose a Length-adaptive Neural Network (LaNN) for answer selection that can auto-select a neural feature extractor according to the length of the input sentence. In particular, we propose a flexible neural structure that applies a BiLSTM-based feature extractor for short sentences and a Transformer-based feature extractor for long sentences. To the best of our knowledge, LaNN is the first neural network structure that can auto-select the feature extraction mechanism based on the input. We quantify the improvements of LaNN against several competitive baselines on the public WikiQA dataset, showing significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.
