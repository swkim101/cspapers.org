Distributed systems often replicate data at multiple locations to achieve availability despite network partitions. These systems accept updates at any replica and propagate them asynchronously to every other replica. Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) provide a principled approach to the problem of ensuring that replicas are eventually consistent despite the asynchronous delivery of updates. We address the problem of specifying and verifying CRDTs, introducing a new correctness criterion called Replication-Aware Linearizability. This criterion is inspired by linearizability, the de-facto correctness criterion for (shared-memory) concurrent data structures. We argue that this criterion is both simple to understand, and it fits most known implementations of CRDTs. We provide a proof methodology to show that a CRDT satisfies replication-aware linearizability that we apply on a wide range of implementations. Finally, we show that our criterion can be leveraged to reason modularly about the composition of CRDTs.
