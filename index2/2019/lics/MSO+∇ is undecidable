This paper is about an extension of monadic second-order logic over the full binary tree, which has a quantifier saying “almost surely a branch <tex>$\pi \in\{0,1\}^{\omega}$</tex> satisfies a formula <tex>$\varphi(\pi)$</tex>”, This logic was introduced by Michalewski and Mio; we call it <tex>$\mathrm{MSO}+\nabla$</tex> following notation of Shelah and Lehmann. The logic <tex>$\mathrm{Mso}+\nabla$</tex> subsumes many qualitative probabilistic formalisms, including qualitative probabilistic <tex>$check$</tex>, probabilistic LTL, or parity tree automata with probabilistic acceptance conditions. We show that it is undecidable to check if a given sentence of <tex>$\mathrm{MSO}+\nabla$</tex> is true in the full binary tree<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>Independently and in parallel another proof of this result was given employing different techniques in [3]..
