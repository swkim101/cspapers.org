Checking whether two pushdown automata with restricted silent actions are weakly bisimilar was shown decidable by SÃ©nizergues (1998, 2005). We provide the first known complexity upper bound for this famous problem, in the equivalent setting of first-order grammars. This ACKERMANN upper bound is optimal, and we also show that strong bisimilarity is primitive-recursive when the number of states of the automata is fixed.
