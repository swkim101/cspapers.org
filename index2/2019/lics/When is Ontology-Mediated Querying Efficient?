In ontology-mediated querying, description logic (DL) ontologies are used to enrich incomplete data with domain knowledge which results in more complete answers to queries. However, the evaluation of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) over relational databases is computationally hard. This raises the question when OMQ evaluation is efficient, in the sense of being tractable in combined complexity or fixed-parameter tractable. We study this question for a range of ontology-mediated query languages based on several important and widely-used DLs, using unions of conjunctive queries as the actual queries. For the DL $\mathcal{ELHI}_{\perp}$, we provide a characterization of the classes of OMQs that are fixed-parameter tractable. For its fragment $\mathcal{ELH}_{\perp}^{dr}$, which restricts the use of inverse roles, we provide a characterization of the classes of OMQs that are tractable in combined complexity. Both results are in terms of equivalence to OMQs of bounded tree width and rest on a reasonable assumption from parameterized complexity theory. They are similar in spirit to Grohe's seminal characterization of the tractable classes of conjunctive queries over relational databases. We further study the complexity of the meta problem of deciding whether a given OMQ is equivalent to an OMQ of bounded tree width, providing several completeness results that range from NP to 2ExpTIME, depending on the DL used. We also consider the DL-Lite family of DLs, including members that, unlike $\mathcal{ELHI}_{\perp}$, admit functional roles.
