Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and its enhancements are among the strongest algorithms for Multi-Agent Path Finding. Recent work introduced an admissible heuristic to guide the high-level search of CBS. In this work, we prove the limitation of this heuristic, as it is based on cardinal conflicts only. We then introduce two new admissible heuristics by reasoning about the pairwise dependencies between agents. Empirically, CBS with either new heuristic significantly improves the success rate over CBS with the recent heuristic and reduces the number of expanded nodes and runtime by up to a factor of 50.
