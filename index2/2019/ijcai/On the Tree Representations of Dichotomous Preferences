We study numerous restricted domains of dichotomous preferences with respect to some tree structures. Particularly, we study the relationships among these domains and the ones proposed by Elkind and Lackner [2015]. We also show that recognizing all the restricted domains proposed in this paper is polynomial-time solvable. Finally, we explore the complexity of winner determination for several important approval-based multiwinner voting rules when restricted to these domains.
