Game AI is of great importance as games are simulations of reality. Recent research on game AI has shown much progress in various kinds of games, such as console games, board games and MOBA games. However, the exploration in RTS games remains a challenge for their huge state space, imperfect information, sparse rewards and various strategies. Besides, the typical card-based RTS games have complex card features and are still lacking solutions. We present a deep model SEAT (selection-attention) to play card-based RTS games. The SEAT model includes two parts, a selection part for card choice and an attention part for card usage, and it learns from scratch via deep reinforcement learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on Clash Royale, a popular mobile card-based RTS game. Empirical results show that the SEAT model agent makes it to reach a high winning rate against rule-based agents and decision-tree-based agent.
