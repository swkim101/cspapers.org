Extreme classification seeks to assign each data point, the most relevant labels from a universe of a million or more labels. This task is faced with the dual challenge of high precision and scalability, with millisecond level prediction times being a benchmark. We propose DEFRAG, an adaptive feature agglomeration technique to accelerate extreme classification algorithms. Despite past works on feature clustering and selection, DEFRAG distinguishes itself in being able to scale to millions of features, and is especially beneficial when feature sets are sparse, which is typical of recommendation and multi-label datasets. The method comes with provable performance guarantees and performs efficient task-driven agglomeration to reduce feature dimensionalities by an order of magnitude or more. Experiments show that DEFRAG can not only reduce training and prediction times of several leading extreme classification algorithms by as much as 40%, but also be used for feature reconstruction to address the problem of missing features, as well as offer superior coverage on rare labels.
