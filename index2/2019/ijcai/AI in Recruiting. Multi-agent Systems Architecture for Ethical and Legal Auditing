Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain-specific applications may have different ethical and legal implications. One of the current questions of AI is the challenges behind the analysis of job video-interviews. There are pros and cons to using AI in recruitment processes, and potential consequences for candidates, companies and states. Furthermore, the deficit of regulation of these systems reinforces the need for external and neutral auditing of the types of analysis made in interviews. We, therefore, propose a Multi-agent system architecture for neutral auditing to guarantee an inclusive and accurate AI and to reduce the potential discrimination in the job market.
