Designing agents capable of explaining complex sequential decisions remains a significant open problem in human-AI interaction. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in developing approaches for generating such explanations for various decision-making paradigms. One such approach has been the idea of explanation as model-reconciliation. The framework hypothesizes that one of the common reasons for a user's confusion could be the mismatch between the user's model of the agent's task model and the model used by the agent to generate the decisions. While this is a general framework, most works that have been explicitly built on this explanatory philosophy have focused on classical planning settings where the model of user's knowledge is available in a declarative form. Our goal in this paper is to adapt the model reconciliation approach to a more general planning paradigm and discuss how such methods could be used when user models are no longer explicitly available. Specifically, we present a simple and easy to learn labeling model that can help an explainer decide what information could help achieve model reconciliation between the user and the agent with in the context of planning with MDPs.
