The ability to enhance deep representations with prior knowledge is receiving a lot of attention from the AI community as a key enabler to improve the way modern Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) learn. In this paper we introduce our approach to this task, which comprises of a knowledge extraction algorithm, a knowledge injection algorithm and a common intermediate knowledge representation as an alternative to traditional neural transfer. As a result of this research, we envisage a knowledge-enhanced ANN, which will be able to learn, characterise and reuse knowledge extracted from the learning process, thus enabling more robust architecture-agnostic neural transfer, greater explainability and further integration of neural and symbolic approaches to learning.
