In this demonstration, we present ATTENet, a novel visual analytic system for detecting and explaining suspicious affiliated-transaction-based tax evasion (ATTE) groups. First, the system constructs a taxpayer interest interacted network, which contains economic behaviors and social relationships between taxpayers. Then, the system combines basic features and structure features of each group in the network with network embedding method structure2Vec, and then detects suspicious ATTE groups with random forest algorithm. Last, to explore and explain the detection results, the system provides an ATTENet visualization with three coordinated views and interactive tools. We demonstrate ATTENet on a non-confidential dataset which contains two years of real tax data obtained by our cooperative tax authorities to verify the usefulness of our system.
