Trust evaluation of people and information on Twitter is critical for maintaining a healthy online social environment. How to evaluate the trustworthiness of users and tweets becomes a challenging question. In this demo, we show how our proposed CoTrRank approach deal with this problem. This approach models users and tweets in two coupled networks and calculate their trust values in different trust spaces. In particular, our solution provides a configurable way when mapping the calculated raw evidences to the trust values. The CoTrRank demo system has an interactive interface to show how our proposed approach produces more effective and adaptive trust evaluation results comparing with baseline methods.
