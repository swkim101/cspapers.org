Data present in a wide array of platforms that are part of today's information systems lies at the foundation of many decision making processes, as we have now come to depend on social media, videos, news, forums, chats, ads, maps, and many other data sources for our daily lives. In this article, we first discuss how such data sources are involved in threats to systems' integrity, and then how they can be leveraged along with knowledge-based tools to tackle a set of challenges in the cybersecurity domain. Finally, we present a brief discussion of our roadmap for research and development in the near future to address the set of ever-evolving cyber threats that our systems face every day.
