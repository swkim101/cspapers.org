Open-ended video question answering aims to automatically generate the natural-language answer from referenced video contents according to the given question. Currently, most existing approaches focus on short-form video question answering with multi-modal recurrent encoder-decoder networks. Although these works have achieved promising performance, they may still be ineffectively applied to long-form video question answering due to the lack of long-range dependency modeling and the suffering from the heavy computational cost. To tackle these problems, we propose a fast hierarchical convolutional self-attention encoder-decoder network. Concretely, we first develop a hierarchical convolutional self-attention encoder to efficiently model long-form video contents, which builds the hierarchical structure for video sequences and captures question-aware long-range dependencies from video context. We then devise a multi-scale attentive decoder to incorporate multi-layer video representations for answer generation, which avoids the information missing of the top encoder layer. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.
