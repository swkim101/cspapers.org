In systems with multiple potentially deceptive agents, any single agent may have to assess the trustworthiness of other agents in order to decide with which agents to interact. In this context, indirect trust refers to trust established through third-party advice. Since the advisers themselves may be deceptive or unreliable, agents need a mechanism to assess and properly incorporate advice. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods for computing indirect trust in numerous simulations, demonstrating that the best ones tend to be of prohibitively large complexity. We propose a new and easy to implement method for computing indirect trust, based on a simple prediction with expert advice strategy as is often used in online learning. This method either competes with or outperforms all tested systems in the vast majority of the settings we simulated, while scaling substantially better. Our results demonstrate that existing systems for computing indirect trust are overly complex; the problem can be solved much more efficiently than the literature suggests.
