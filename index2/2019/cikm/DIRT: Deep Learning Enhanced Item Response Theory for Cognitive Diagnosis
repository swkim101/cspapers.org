Cognitive diagnosis is the cornerstone of modern educational techniques. One of the most classic cognitive diagnosis methods is Item Response Theory (IRT), which provides interpretable parameters for analyzing student performance. However, traditional IRT only exploits student response results and has difficulties in fully utilizing the semantics of question texts, which significantly restricts its application. To this end, in this paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective framework to enhance the semantic exploiting process, which we termed Deep Item Response Theory (DIRT). In DIRT, we first use a proficiency vector to represent student proficiency on knowledge concepts and represent question texts and knowledge concepts by dense embedding. Then, we use deep learning to enhance the process of diagnosing parameters of student and question by exploiting question texts and the relationship between question texts and knowledge concepts. Finally, with the diagnosed parameters, we adopt the item response function to predict student performance. Extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and the interpretability of DIRT framework.
