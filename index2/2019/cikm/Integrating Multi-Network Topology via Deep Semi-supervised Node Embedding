Node Embedding, which uses low-dimensional non-linear feature vectors to represent nodes in the network, has shown a great promise, not only because it is easy-to-use for downstream tasks, but also because it has achieved great success on many network analysis tasks. One of the challenges has been how to develop a node embedding method for integrating topological information from multiple networks. To address this critical problem, we propose a novel node embedding, called DeepMNE, for multi-network integration using a deep semi-supervised autoencoder. The key point of DeepMNE is that it captures complex topological structures of multiple networks and utilizes correlation among multiple networks as constraints. We evaluate DeepMNE in node classification task and link prediction task on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepMNE shows superior performance over seven state-of-the-art single-network and multi-network embedding algorithms.
