Modern online auction-based advertising systems combine item and user features to promote ad creatives with the most revenue.However, new ad creatives have to display for certain initial users before enough click statistics could collected and utilized in later ads ranking and bidding processes. This leads to a well-known challenging cold start problem.In this paper, we argue that the content of the creatives intrinsically determines their performance (e.g. ctr, cvr), and we add a pre-ranking stage based on the content. The stage prunes inferior creatives and thus makes online impressions more effective. Since the pre-ranking stage can be executed offline, we can use deep features and take their well generalization to navigate the cold start problem.Specifically, we propose Pre Evaluation Ad Creation Model (PEAC), a novel method to evaluate creatives even before they were shown in the online ads system. Our proposed PEAC only utilizes ads information such as verbal and visual content, but requires no user data as features. During the online A/B testing, PEAC shows significant improvement in revenue. The method has been implemented and deployed in the large scale online advertising system at ByteDance. Furthermore, we provide detailed analysis on what the model learns, which also gives suggestions for ad creative design.
