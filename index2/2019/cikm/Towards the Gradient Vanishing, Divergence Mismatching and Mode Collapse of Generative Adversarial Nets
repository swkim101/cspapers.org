Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a powerful generative model. However, it suffers from gradient vanishing, divergence mismatching and mode collapse. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel GAN, which consists of one generator G and two discriminators (D1, D2). Focusing on the gradient vanishing, Spectral Normalization (SN) and ResBlock are first adopted in D1 and D2. Then, Scaled Exponential Linear Units (SELU) is adopted at last half layers of D2 to further address the problem. To divergence mismatching, relativistic discriminator is adopted in our GAN to make the loss function minimization in the training of generator equal to the theoretical divergence minimization. Concentrating on the mode collapse, D1 rewards high scores for the samples from the data distribution, while D2 favors the samples from the generator conversely. In addition, the minibatch discrimination is adopted in D1 to further address the problem. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our GAN can obtain the highest inception score (IS) and lowest Frechet Inception Distance (FID) compared with other state-of-the-art GANs.
