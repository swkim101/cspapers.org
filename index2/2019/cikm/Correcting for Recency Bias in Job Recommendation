Users are known to interact more with fresh content in certain temporally associated domains such as news search or job seeking, leading to an uneven distribution of interactions over items of different degrees of freshness. Data collected under such an "aging effect'' is usually used unconditionally on all sort of recommendation tasks, and as a result more recently published content may be over-represented during model training and evaluation. In this study, we characterize this temporal influence as a recency bias, and present an analysis in the domain of job recommendation. We show that, by correcting for recency bias using an unbiased learning to rank approach, one can improve the quality of recommendation significantly over a recent neural collaborative filtering model on RecSys Challenge 2017 data.
