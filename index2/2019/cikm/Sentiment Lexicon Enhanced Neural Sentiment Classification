Sentiment classification is an important task in the sentiment analysis field. Many deep learning based sentiment classification methods have been proposed in recent years. However, these methods usually rely on massive labeled texts to train sentiment classifiers, which are expensive and time-consuming to annotate. Luckily, many high-quality sentiment lexicons have been constructed and can cover a large number of sentiment words. Since sentiment words are the basic units to convey sentiments in texts, these sentiment lexicons have the potential to improve the performance of neural sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose two approaches to exploit sentiment lexicons to enhance neural sentiment classification. In our first approach we use sentiment lexicons to learn sentiment-aware attentions. We propose a word sentiment classification task to classify the sentiments of words in a sentence based on their hidden representations in the attention network of neural sentiment classification models. We jointly train this task with neural sentiment classifier to facilitate the attention network to recognize and highlight sentiment-bearing words. In our second approach we use sentiment lexicons to learn sentiment-aware word embeddings. We design an auxiliary task to classify the sentiments of words in sentiment lexicons based on their word embeddings, and jointly train this task with neural sentiment classifier to encode sentiment information in sentiment lexicons to word embeddings. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.
