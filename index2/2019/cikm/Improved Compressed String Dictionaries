We introduce a new family of compressed data structures to efficiently store and query large string dictionaries in main memory. Our main technique is a combination of hierarchical Front-coding with ideas from longest-common-prefix computation in suffix arrays. Our data structures yield relevant space-time tradeoffs in real-world dictionaries. We focus on two domains where string dictionaries are extensively used and efficient compression is required: URL collections, a key element in Web graphs and applications such as Web mining; and collections of URIs and literals, the basic components of RDF datasets. Our experiments show that our data structures achieve better compression than the state-of-the-art alternatives while providing very competitive query times.
