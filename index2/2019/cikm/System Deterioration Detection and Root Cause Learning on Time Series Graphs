System deterioration detection and root cause analysis is crucial for today's industrial society. However, the design and operation of mechanic system is getting more and more complex, which makes it hard at identifying deterioration with noisy data. Our research focuses on solving such problem on time-evolving sensor graphs in a streaming setting. Given a sequence of graphs, the ability to identify 1) any gradual and stable structured change and 2) the root cause components is of importance for early warning and system diagnosis. Existing methods either raise too many false alerts on instant changes or are too sensitive to noise. To address these problems, we propose Robust Failure Detection and Diagnosis (RoFaD). RoFaD can capture failure propagation given a time series of graph. By optimizing a matrix-based Taylor expansion, RoFaD can identify system deterioration in the presence of noise and immediate changes, and diagnose the root cause components. Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that RoFaD is more effective than the popular baselines.
