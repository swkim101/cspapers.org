In this paper, we propose an interactive multi-grained joint model for targeted sentiment analysis. Firstly, different from previous works, we leverage the correlation between target and sentiment clues and deeply strengthen interaction between them because targets are highly related to the sentiment clues in a sentence. Moreover, we apply a multi-layer structure to consider multi-grained target and sentiment tagging information more comprehensively. Also, we design two specific loss functions to prevent a word from being both part of a target and a sentiment clue simultaneously, and to align the boundary information of two labeling subsystems. We conduct experiments on English and Spanish datasets and the experimental results show that our approach substantially outperforms a variety of previous models and achieves new state-of-the-art results on these datasets.
