Author identification based on heterogeneous bibliographic networks, which is to identify potential authors given an anonymous paper, has been studied in recent years. However, most of the existing works merely consider the relationship between authors and anonymous papers, while ignore the relationships between authors. In this paper, we take the relationships among authors into consideration to study the problem of author set identification, which is to identify an author set rather than an individual author related to an anonymous paper. The proposed problem has important applications to new collaborator discovery and group building. We propose a novel Author Set Identification approach, namely ASI. ASI first extracts a task-guided embedding to learn the low-dimensional representations of nodes in bibliographic network. And then ASI leverages the learned embedding to construct a weighted paper-ego-network, which contains anonymous paper and candidate authors. Finally, converting the optimal author set identification to the quasi-clique discovery in the constructed network, ASI utilizes a local-search heuristic mechanism under the guidance of the devised density function to find the optimal quasiclique. Extensive experiments on bibliographic networks demonstrate that ASI outperforms the state-of-art baselines in author set identification.
