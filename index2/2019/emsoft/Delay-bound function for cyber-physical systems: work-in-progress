Most of the todays cyber-physical systems are delay tolerant. These systems can tolerate transient overloads which occur when the computation demand is greater than the available resource supply during a time interval, but recovers from the overload after a finite amount of time. In this paper, we propose a delay bound function, which is derived to check schedulability of workloads of different critical components. We characterize the criticality of a component by defining requirements on safety or performance. A safety requirement enforces a maximum delay that a high-criticality component can tolerate, while a performance requirement specifies the cumulative delay during a time interval for a low-criticality component. Using functions to specify delay requirements facilitates timing analysis for components of different levels of criticality in a cyber-physical system.
