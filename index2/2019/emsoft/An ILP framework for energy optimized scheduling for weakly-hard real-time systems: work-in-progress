In this work, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model to schedule a set of weakly-hard real-time tasks on a heterogeneous multiprocessor system to minimize energy consumption with the predictable performance. The ILP model provides an optimal solution in terms of energy consumption by selecting the appropriate frequency for each task with (m,k) weakly-hard deadline constraint.
