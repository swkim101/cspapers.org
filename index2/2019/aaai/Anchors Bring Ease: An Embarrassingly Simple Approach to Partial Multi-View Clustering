Clustering on multi-view data has attracted much more attention in the past decades. Most previous studies assume that each instance appears in all views, or there is at least one view containing all instances. However, real world data often suffers from missing some instances in each view, leading to the research problem of partial multi-view clustering. To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective Anchorbased Partial Multi-view Clustering (APMC) method, which utilizes anchors to reconstruct instance-to-instance relationships for clustering. APMC is conceptually simple and easy to implement in practice, besides it has clear intuitions and non-trivial empirical guarantees. Specifically, APMC firstly integrates intra- and inter- view similarities through anchors. Then, spectral clustering is performed on the fused similarities to obtain a unified clustering result. Compared with existing partial multi-view clustering methods, APMC has three notable advantages: 1) it can capture more non-linear relations among instances with the help of kernel-based similarities; 2) it has a much lower time complexity in virtue of a noniterative scheme; 3) it can inherently handle data with negative entries as well as be extended to more than two views. Finally, we extensively evaluate the proposed method on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of APMC over state-of-the-art approaches.
