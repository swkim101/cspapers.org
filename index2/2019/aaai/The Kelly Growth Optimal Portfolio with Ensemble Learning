As a competitive alternative to the Markowitz mean-variance portfolio, the Kelly growth optimal portfolio has drawn sufficient attention in investment science. While the growth optimal portfolio is theoretically guaranteed to dominate any other portfolio with probability 1 in the long run, it practically tends to be highly risky in the short term. Moreover, empirical analysis and performance enhancement studies under practical settings are surprisingly short. In particular, how to handle the challenging but realistic condition with insufficient training data has barely been investigated. In order to fill voids, especially grappling with the difficulty from small samples, in this paper, we propose a growth optimal portfolio strategy equipped with ensemble learning. We synergically leverage the bootstrap aggregating algorithm and the random subspace method into portfolio construction to mitigate estimation error. We analyze the behavior and hyperparameter selection of the proposed strategy by simulation, and then corroborate its effectiveness by comparing its out-of-sample performance with those of 10 competing strategies on four datasets. Experimental results lucidly confirm that the new strategy has superiority in extensive evaluation criteria.
