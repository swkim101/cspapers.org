This paper introduces a novel deep learning based method, named bridge neural network (BNN) to dig the potential relationship between two given data sources task by task. The proposed approach employs two convolutional neural networks that project the two data sources into a feature space to learn the desired common representation required by the specific task. The training objective with artificial negative samples is introduced with the ability of mini-batch training and itâ€™s asymptotically equivalent to maximizing the total correlation of the two data sources, which is verified by the theoretical analysis. The experiments on the tasks, including pair matching, canonical correlation analysis, transfer learning, and reconstruction demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of BNN, which may provide new insights into the aspect of common representation learning.
