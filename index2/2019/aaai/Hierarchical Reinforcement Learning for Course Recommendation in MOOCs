The proliferation of massive open online courses (MOOCs) demands an effective way of personalized course recommendation. The recent attention-based recommendation models can distinguish the effects of different historical courses when recommending different target courses. However, when a user has interests in many different courses, the attention mechanism will perform poorly as the effects of the contributing courses are diluted by diverse historical courses. To address such a challenge, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to revise the user profiles and tune the course recommendation model on the revised profiles.Systematically, we evaluate the proposed model on a real dataset consisting of 1,302 courses, 82,535 users and 458,454 user enrolled behaviors, which were collected from XuetangXâ€”one of the largest MOOCs in China. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models (improving 5.02% to 18.95% in terms of HR@10).
