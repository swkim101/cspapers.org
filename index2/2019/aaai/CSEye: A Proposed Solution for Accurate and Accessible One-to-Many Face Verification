Facial verification is a core problem studied by researchers in computer vision. Recently published one-to-one comparison models have successfully achieved accuracy results that surpass the abilities of humans. A natural extension to the one-to-one facial verification problem is a one-to-many classification. In this abstract, we present our exploration of different methods of performing one-to-many facial verification using low-resolution images. The CSEye model introduces a direct comparison between the features extracted from each of the candidate images and the suspect before performing the classification task. Initial experiments using 10-to-1 comparisons of faces from the Labelled Faces of the Wild dataset yield promising results.
