We introduce a model of probabilistic verification into the standard mechanism design setting. The principal uses a statistical test to verify the truthfulness of type reports. Testing generates a binary outcome---pass or fail---that depends stochastically on the agent's true type and report. The principal commits to a mechanism that assigns a test to each message and then a decision based on the test outcome. Under quasilinear preferences, we solve for the optimal mechanism by introducing a new expression for the virtual value. When verification is more accurate, the optimal allocation is more efficient and a greater share of the surplus goes to the principal.
