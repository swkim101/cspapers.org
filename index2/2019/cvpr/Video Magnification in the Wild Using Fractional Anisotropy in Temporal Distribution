Video magnification methods can magnify and reveal subtle changes invisible to the naked eye. However, in such subtle changes, meaningful ones caused by physical and natural phenomena are mixed with non-meaningful ones caused by photographic noise. Therefore, current methods often produce noisy and misleading magnification outputs due to the non-meaningful subtle changes. For detecting only meaningful subtle changes, several methods have been proposed but require human manipulations, additional resources, or input video scene limitations. In this paper, we present a novel method using fractional anisotropy (FA) to detect only meaningful subtle changes without the aforementioned requirements. FA has been used in neuroscience to evaluate anisotropic diffusion of water molecules in the body. On the basis of our observation that temporal distribution of meaningful subtle changes more clearly indicates anisotropic diffusion than that of non-meaningful ones, we used FA to design a fractional anisotropic filter that passes only meaningful subtle changes. Using the filter enables our method to obtain better and more impressive magnification results than those obtained with state-of-the-art methods.
