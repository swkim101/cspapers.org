In the classic local window filtering seismic data denoising methods, the target sample is usually placed at the center of the given fixed-scale filter kernel. When the target sample is located on the structure edges, the filter kernel will cross the structure edges and leads to blurry structure edges. Multiscale adaptive right-angle side window filtering (MRSF) has better edge preservation capability. However, its 2-D filter kernel and eight right-angle side windows cannot better adapt to complex data, limiting its denoising capability. We extend the 2-D multiscale filter kernel in MRSF with the 3-D multiscale filter kernel. Meanwhile, we extend the eight 2-D right-angle side windows in MRSF with multiple 2-D and 3-D trapezoidal side windows. Finally, we propose the high-dimensional multiscale adaptive trapezoidal side window filtering (HMTSF). Synthetic and field 3-D seismic data examples demonstrate the good denoising capability of HMTSF.
