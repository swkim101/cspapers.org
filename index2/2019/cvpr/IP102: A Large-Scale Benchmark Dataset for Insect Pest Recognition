Insect pests are one of the main factors affecting agricultural product yield. Accurate recognition of insect pests facilitates timely preventive measures to avoid economic losses. However, the existing datasets for the visual classification task mainly focus on common objects, e.g., flowers and dogs. This limits the application of powerful deep learning technology on specific domains like the agricultural field. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset named IP102 for insect pest recognition. Specifically, it contains more than 75, 000 images belonging to 102 categories, which exhibit a natural long-tailed distribution. In addition, we annotate about 19, 000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upperlevel category. Furthermore, we perform several baseline experiments on the IP102 dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods. Experimental results show that this dataset has the challenges of interand intra- class variance and data imbalance. We believe our IP102 will facilitate future research on practical insect pest control, fine-grained visual classification, and imbalanced learning fields. We make the dataset and pre-trained models publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102.
