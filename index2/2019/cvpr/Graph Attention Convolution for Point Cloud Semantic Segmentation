This document provides additional details and further analyses of the proposed graph attention convolution (GAC) in the main paper. In Section B we describe more details on the network architectures and training parameters. Section C provides a proof of Theorem 1, and the further analysis of our GAC is shown in Section D. Finally, we show more visualizations of our point cloud semantic segmentation results in Section E.
