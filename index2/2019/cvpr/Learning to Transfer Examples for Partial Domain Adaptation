Domain adaptation is critical for learning in new and unseen environments. With domain adversarial training, deep networks can learn disentangled and transferable features that effectively diminish the dataset shift between the source and target domains for knowledge transfer. In the era of Big Data, large-scale labeled datasets are readily available, stimulating the interest in partial domain adaptation (PDA), which transfers a recognizer from a large labeled domain to a small unlabeled domain. It extends standard domain adaptation to the scenario where target labels are only a subset of source labels. Under the condition that target labels are unknown, the key challenges of PDA are how to transfer relevant examples in the shared classes to promote positive transfer and how to ignore irrelevant ones in the source domain to mitigate negative transfer. In this work, we propose a unified approach to PDA, Example Transfer Network (ETN), which jointly learns domain-invariant representations across domains and a progressive weighting scheme to quantify the transferability of source examples. A thorough evaluation on several benchmark datasets shows that ETN consistently achieves state-of-the-art results for various partial domain adaptation tasks.
