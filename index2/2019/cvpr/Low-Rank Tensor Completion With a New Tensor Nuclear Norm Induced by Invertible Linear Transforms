This work studies the low-rank tensor completion problem, which aims to exactly recover a low-rank tensor from partially observed entries. Our model is inspired by the recently proposed tensor-tensor product (t-product) based on any invertible linear transforms. When the linear transforms satisfy certain conditions, we deduce the new tensor tubal rank, tensor spectral norm, and tensor nuclear norm. Equipped with the tensor nuclear norm, we then solve the tensor completion problem by solving a convex program and provide the theoretical bound for the exact recovery under certain tensor incoherence conditions. The achieved sampling complexity is order-wise optimal. Our model and result greatly extend existing results in the low-rank matrix and tensor completion. Numerical experiments verify our results and the application on image recovery demonstrates the superiority of our method.
