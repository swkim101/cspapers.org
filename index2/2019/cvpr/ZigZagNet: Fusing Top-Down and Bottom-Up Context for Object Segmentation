Multi-scale context information has proven to be essential for object segmentation tasks. Recent works construct the multi-scale context by aggregating convolutional feature maps extracted by different levels of a deep neural network. This is typically done by propagating and fusing features in a one-directional, top-down and bottom-up, manner. In this work, we introduce ZigZagNet, which aggregates a richer multi-context feature map by using not only dense top-down and bottom-up propagation, but also by introducing pathways crossing between different levels of the top-down and the bottom-up hierarchies, in a zig-zag fashion. Furthermore, the context information is exchanged and aggregated over multiple stages, where the fused feature maps from one stage are fed into the next one, yielding a more comprehensive context for improved segmentation performance. Our extensive evaluation on the public benchmarks demonstrates that ZigZagNet surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy for both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks.
