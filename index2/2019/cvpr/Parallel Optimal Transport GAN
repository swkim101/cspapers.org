Temporal connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) is one of the most successful end to end (E2E) ASR frameworks. However, due to the token independence assumption in decoding, an external language model (LM) is required which destroys its fast parallel decoding property. Several studies have been proposed to transfer linguistic knowledge from a pretrained LM (PLM) to the CTC based ASR. Since the PLM is built from text while the acoustic model is trained with speech, a cross-modal alignment is required in order to transfer the context dependent linguistic knowledge from the PLM to acoustic encoding. In this study, we propose a novel cross-modal alignment algorithm based on optimal transport (OT). In the alignment process, a transport coupling matrix is obtained using OT, which is then utilized to transform a latent acoustic representation for matching the context-dependent linguistic features encoded by the PLM. Based on the alignment, the latent acoustic feature is forced to encode context dependent linguistic information. We integrate this latent acoustic feature to build conformer encoder-based CTC ASR system. On the AISHELL-1 data corpus, our system achieved 3.96 % and 4.27 % character error rate (CER) for dev and test sets, respectively, which corresponds to relative improvements of 28.39 % and 29.42% compared to the baseline conformer CTC ASR system without cross-modal knowledge transfer.
