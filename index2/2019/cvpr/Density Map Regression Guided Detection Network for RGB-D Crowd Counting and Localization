To simultaneously estimate head counts and localize heads with bounding boxes, a regression guided detection network (RDNet) is proposed for RGB-D crowd counting. Specifically, to improve the robustness of detection-based approaches for small/tiny heads, we leverage density map to improve the head/non-head classification in detection network where density map serves as the probability of a pixel being a head. A depth-adaptive kernel that considers the variances in head sizes is also introduced to generate high-fidelity density map for more robust density map regression. Further, a depth-aware anchor is designed for better initialization of anchor sizes in detection framework. Then we use the bounding boxes whose sizes are estimated with depth to train our RDNet. The existing RGB-D datasets are too small and not suitable for performance evaluation on data-driven based approaches, we collect a large-scale RGB-D crowd counting dataset. Experiments on both our RGB-D dataset and the MICC RGB-D counting dataset show that our method achieves the best performance for RGB-D crowd counting and localization. Further, our method can be readily extended to RGB image based crowd counting and achieves comparable performance on the ShanghaiTech Part\_B dataset for both counting and localization.
