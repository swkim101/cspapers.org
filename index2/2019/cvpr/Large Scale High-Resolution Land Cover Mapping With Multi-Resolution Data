Here we provide a description and screenshots of the web application described in the main paper. Users are able to “paint” over existing basemaps (in this case the ESRI World Imagery or OpenStreetMap) with either precomputed model output or on-the-fly model output computed on a server. Users can change the opacity of the painted land cover layer to see how it aligns with the observed imagery, change class weights to create a better fit, and submit the corrections to be included in future rounds of model training or loaded by other users.
