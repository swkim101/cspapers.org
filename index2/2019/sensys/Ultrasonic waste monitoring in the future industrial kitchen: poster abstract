This paper presents the initial results of ultrasonic waste monitoring during the operation of one industrial kitchen. Undifferentiated, paper and plastic waste bins were monitored, and a heuristic-based waste disposal event detector was developed and evaluated. The results show that it is possible to identify disposal events in the three waste bins. Furthermore, it is also possible to determine when paper and plastic are compressed to make additional room.
