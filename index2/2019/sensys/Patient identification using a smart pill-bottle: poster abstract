In this work, we investigate the identification of persons taking medication using a sensor-equipped pill-bottle. The bottle embeds inertial sensors in both the cap and body, making the added hardware un-obtrusive, low-cost, and wireless. Our system uses inertial data to build a patient discrimination model using classification techniques. We evaluated the system using 16 subjects. Our results show that using binary Support Vector Machine (SVM), the system can discriminate one patient among 16 subjects with 94 % accuracy. Identifying the exact person in a set of 3 subjects has an accuracy higher than 91 %..
