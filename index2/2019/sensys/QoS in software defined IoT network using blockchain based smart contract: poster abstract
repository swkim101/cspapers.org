Internet of things (IoT) has made human life simpler through its numerous applications by interconnecting various devices and people together in a heterogeneous network. The number of users associated with IoT in different sectors such as media, intelligent transportation, and healthcare are increasing rapidly, therefore generating a large amount of data each day. Because of this, maintaining quality in the network has become an important aspect for end-to-end data delivery. Software defined networking thus provides flexibility and programmability to the network due to its global approach of network management. To adapt with the dynamic nature of QoS, blockchain technique with its encryption mechanism and distributed consensus algorithm can be deployed on SDN. In this paper, we propose the use of blockchain technology in Software-Defined Internet of Things to deliver high QoS at a low price.
