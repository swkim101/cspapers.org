Considering location data for friendship prediction has become prevalent due to the huge success of online social networks. However, few studies have focused on investigating the possibility of using mobility information in a dense place such as a campus. The research direction for those mobility networks should be treated differently. We propose a CNN-based noble framework for friendship prediction, which starts from collecting location data to a classification model to learn their relation between friendships and mobility. From the experiment, we show that our system outperforms empirical supervised learning techniques and also can be useful for friendship prediction of the future.
