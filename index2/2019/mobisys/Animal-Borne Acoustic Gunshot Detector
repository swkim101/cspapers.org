Poaching is one of the primary drivers of wildlife decline [1]. Animalborne sensors, particularly GPS-equipped collars, are used to enhance real-time wildlife protection. Innovations that can be integrated into these systems can immediately scale, offering broad application. GPS tracking data streams have been valuable to resolve a number of conservation challenges, but these systems have not been particularly effective in identifying poaching in real-time. Detecting poaching events is a critical need to provide actionable information for law enforcement.
