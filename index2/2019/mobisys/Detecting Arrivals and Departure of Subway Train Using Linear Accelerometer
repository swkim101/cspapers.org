Subway is one of the public transport which carries people at the exact time. In the metropolis all over the world, it transfers countless people in the rush hour. Since there is no traffic jam in the subway, accuracy is one of the most crucial characters of the subway. However, subway trains are often delayed by some reasons like an accident. The delay can make many people confused and inconvenient. In this context, the need for dynamic timetable model which corrects the error of timetable in real time has emerged. Since the method to detect train moving is necessary to modify timetable, various solutions are proposed in the indoor positioning way, such as Wi-Fi fingerprint, magnetometer and so on. A method using Wi-Fi fingerprint is a primary way in indoor positioning, but it is tough to build a radio map for every single station. Shin et al. suggested a solution using a magnetometer, with simple judging criteria named 'decision peak.' This research proved that a magnetometer is a practical solution. Nonetheless, it can not detect the train moving in some cases. We propose a new method to detect the subway moving using a linear accelerometer, based on the essence of the problem.
