In this paper we design and implement Freedom, a mobile VR system that deliver high quality VR content on today's mobile devices using 4G/LTE cellular networks. Compared to existing state-of-the-art, Freedom does not rely on any video frame pre- rendering or viewpoint prediction. We send a latency-adaptive VAM frame that contains pixels around the FoV. This allows the clients to render locally at a high refresh rate of 60 Hz to accommodate and compensate for the user's head movements before the next server update arrives. We demonstrate that Freedom is the first system in the world that can support dynamic and live 8K resolution VR content, while adapting to the real-world latency variations experienced in cellular networks. Compared to streaming the whole 360Â° panoramic VR content, we show that Freedom achieves up to 80% bandwidth savings. Finally, we provide detailed end to end latency measurements of actual VR systems by running extensive experiments in a private LTE testbed using a Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC).
