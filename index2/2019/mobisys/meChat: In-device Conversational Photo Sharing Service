In this demo, we demonstrate an in-device conversational photo sharing service, termed meChat, which helps users share in-device photos easily in messaging applications by searching conversation-related photos automatically. In particular, meChat understands the semantics of on-going conversation and in-device photos by projecting both of them into a single semantic space. Subsequently, it retrieves in-device photos related to the conversation context. Through this process, meChat makes it easy for the users to share the photos while communicating in messaging applications. In addition, it is worth noting that meChat works in a stand-alone, privacy-protecting manner without sending out any in-device photos and conversations to the external servers. This is different from existing photo services (e.g., Google Photos) which resort on the cloud server.
