In order to utilize a unmanned aerial device such as a drone in terms of reconnaissance, surveillance and disaster management, a technique capable of performing real-time human detection is needed. In this study, we introduce a method of human detection by constructing environment similar to a drone by installing wide angle lens camera on the ceiling. Tiny-Yolo, which is a kind of Convolutional Neural Network, was used as recognition technology. Camera sensors were installed on ceilings in various places inside the building to collect training data for human detection. The Training was performed based on 4,000 pieces of collected data, and the accuracy of recognition was measured. As a result, 95.37% precision and 96.60% recall were obtained.
