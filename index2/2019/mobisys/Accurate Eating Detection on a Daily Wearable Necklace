While there are many research proposals for wearable Automatic Dietary Monitoring (ADM) systems that detect eating of a user, it is difficult to notice real-world users wearing such devices in public. We propose a new wearable ADM system that could be used daily by real-world users. It is designed in a form of necklace, providing natural and firm contact of sensor on user's skin to accurately capture eating activities. At our preliminary experiments, our wearable ADM system detected eating of a user with 86.1% accuracy.
