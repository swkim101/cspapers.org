Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) represents an emerging category of applications that bring users interactive experiences with the physical experiencesnvironment. In such applications, users can place virtual objects in real-world space, and view them through a camera view. In this work, we develop a framework that supports multi-users interactions for MAR apps, where one user places a virtual object that can be recognized by other users.
