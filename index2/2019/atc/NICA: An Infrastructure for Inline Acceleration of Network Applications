With rising network rates, cloud vendors increasingly deploy
FPGA-based SmartNICs (F-NICs), leveraging their inline
processing capabilities to offload hypervisor networking
infrastructure. However, the use of F-NICs for accelerating
general-purpose server applications in clouds has been limited.
NICA is a hardware-software co-designed framework for
inline acceleration of the application data plane on F-NICs in
multi-tenant systems. A new ikernel programming abstraction,
tightly integrated with the network stack, enables application
control of F-NIC computations that process application
network traffic, with minimal code changes. In addition, NICA’s
virtualization architecture supports fine-grain time-sharing of
F-NIC logic and provides I/O path virtualization. Together
these features enable cost-effective sharing of F-NICs across
virtual machines with strict performance guarantees.
We prototype NICA on Mellanox F-NICs and integrate
ikernels with the high-performance VMA network stack and
the KVM hypervisor. We demonstrate significant acceleration
of real-world applications in both bare-metal and virtualized
environments, while requiring only minor code modifications
to accelerate them on F-NICs. For example, a transparent
key-value store cache ikernel added to the stock memcached
server reaches 40 Gbps server throughput (99% line-rate)
at 6 μs 99th-percentile latency for 16-byte key-value pairs,
which is 21× the throughput of a 6-core CPU with a
kernel-bypass network stack. The throughput scales linearly for up
to 6 VMs running independent instances of memcached.
