Multi-tenant cloud computing provides great benefits in terms of resource sharing,  elastic pricing, and scalability, however, it also changes the security landscape and  introduces the need for strong isolation between the tenants, also inside the  network. This paper is motivated by the observation that while multi-tenancy is  widely used in cloud computing, the virtual switch designs currently used for network virtualization lack sufficient support for tenant isolation. Hence, we  present, implement, and evaluate a virtual switch architecture, MTS, which brings  secure design best-practice to the context of multi-tenant virtual networking: compartmentalization of virtual switches, least-privilege execution, complete  mediation of all network communication, and reducing the trusted computing base  shared between tenants. We build MTS from commodity components, providing an incrementally deployable and inexpensive upgrade path to cloud operators. Our  extensive experiments, extending to both micro-benchmarks and cloud  applications, show that, depending on the way it is deployed, MTS may produce 1.5-2x the throughput compared to state-of-the-art, with similar or better latency and  modest resource overhead (1 extra CPU). MTS is available as open source software.
