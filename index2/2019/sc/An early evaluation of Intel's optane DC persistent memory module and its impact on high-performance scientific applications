Memory and I/O performance bottlenecks in supercomputing simulations are two key challenges that must be addressed on the road to Exascale. The new byte-addressable persistent non-volatile memory technology from Intel, DCPMM, promises to be an exciting opportunity to break with the status quo, with unprecedented levels of capacity at near-DRAM speeds. Here, we explore the potential of DCPMM in the context of two high-performance scientific applications in terms of outright performance, efficiency and usability for both its Memory and App Direct modes. In Memory mode, we show equivalent performance and better efficiency for a CASTEP simulation that is limited by memory capacity on conventional DRAM-only systems without any changes to the application. For IFS, we demonstrate that a distributed object-store over NVRAM reduces the data contention created in weather forecasting data producer-consumer workflows. In addition, we also present the achievable memory bandwidth performance using STREAM.
