This paper investigates a problem of broad practical interest, namely, the reconstruction of a large-dimensional low-rank tensor from highly incomplete and randomly corrupted observations of its entries. Although a number of papers have been dedicated to this tensor completion problem, prior algorithms either are computationally too expensive for large-scale applications or come with suboptimal statistical performance. Motivated by this, we propose a fast two-stage nonconvex algorithm—a gradient method following a rough initialization—that achieves the best of both worlds: optimal statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the proposed algorithm provably completes the tensor and retrieves all low-rank factors within nearly linear time, while at the same time enjoying near-optimal statistical guarantees (i.e., minimal sample complexity and optimal estimation accuracy). The insights conveyed through our analysis of nonconvex optimization might have implications for a broader family of tensor reconstruction problems beyond tensor completion.
