Chattopadhyay, Mande and Sherif (CMS19) recently exhibited a total Boolean function, the sink function, that has polynomial approximate rank and polynomial randomized communication complexity. This gives an exponential separation between randomized communication complexity and logarithm of the approximate rank, refuting the log-approximate-rank conjecture. We show that even the quantum communication complexity of the sink function is polynomial, thus also refuting the quantum log-approximate-rank conjecture. Our lower bound is based on the fooling distribution method introduced by Rao and Sinha (Theory Comput., 2018) for the classical case and extended by Anshu, Touchette, Yao and Yu (STOC, 2017) for the quantum case. We also give a new proof of the classical lower bound using the fooling distribution method.
