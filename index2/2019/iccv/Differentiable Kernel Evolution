This paper proposes a differentiable kernel evolution (DKE) algorithm to find a better layer-operator for the convolutional neural network. Unlike most of the other neural architecture searching (NAS) technologies, we consider the searching space in a fundamental scope: kernel space, which encodes the assembly of basic multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations into a conv-kernel. We first deduce a strict form of the generalized convolutional operator by some necessary constraints and construct a continuous searching space for its extra freedom-of-degree, namely, the connection of each MAC. Then a novel unsupervised greedy evolution algorithm called \textit{gradient agreement guided searching} (GAGS) is proposed to learn the optimal location for each MAC in the spatially continuous searching space. We leverage DKE on multiple kinds of tasks such as object classification, face/object detection, large-scale fine-grained and recognition, with various kinds of backbone architecture. Not to mention the consistent performance gain, we found the proposed DKE can further act as an auto-dilated operator, which makes it easy to boost the performance of miniaturized neural networks in multiple tasks.
