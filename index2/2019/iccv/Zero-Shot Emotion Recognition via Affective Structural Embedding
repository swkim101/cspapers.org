Image emotion recognition attracts much attention in recent years due to its wide applications. It aims to classify the emotional response of humans, where candidate emotion categories are generally defined by specific psychological theories, such as Ekmanâ€™s six basic emotions. However, with the development of psychological theories, emotion categories become increasingly diverse, fine-grained, and difficult to collect samples. In this paper, we investigate zero-shot learning (ZSL) problem in the emotion recognition task, which tries to recognize the new unseen emotions. Specifically, we propose a novel affective-structural embedding framework, utilizing mid-level semantic representation, i.e., adjective-noun pairs (ANP) features, to construct an affective embedding space. By doing this, the learned intermediate space can narrow the semantic gap between low-level visual and high-level semantic features. In addition, we introduce an affective adversarial constraint to retain the discriminative capacity of visual features and the affective structural information of semantic features during training process. Our method is evaluated on five widely used affective datasets and the perimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
