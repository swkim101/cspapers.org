Fisheye cameras are notoriously hard to calibrate using traditional plane-based methods. This paper proposes a new calibration method for large field of view cameras. Similarly to planar calibration, it relies on multiple images of a planar calibration grid with dense correspondences, typically obtained using structured light. By relying on the grids themselves instead of the distorted image plane, we can build a rectilinear Generic Virtual Central (GVC) camera. Instead of relying on a single GVC camera, our method proposes a selection of multiple GVC cameras which can cover any field of view and be trivially aligned to provide a very accurate generic central model. We demonstrate that this approach can directly model axial cameras, assuming the distortion center is located on the camera axis. Experimental validation is provided on both synthetic and real fisheye cameras featuring up to a 280deg field of view. To our knowledge, this is one of the only practical methods to calibrate axial cameras.
