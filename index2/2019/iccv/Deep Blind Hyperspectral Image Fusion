Hyperspectral image fusion (HIF) reconstructs high spatial resolution hyperspectral images from low spatial resolution hyperspectral images and high spatial resolution multispectral images. Previous works usually assume that the linear mapping between the point spread functions of the hyperspectral camera and the spectral response functions of the conventional camera is known. This is unrealistic in many scenarios. We propose a method for blind HIF problem based on deep learning, where the estimation of the observation model and fusion process are optimized iteratively and alternatingly during the super-resolution reconstruction. In addition, the proposed framework enforces simultaneous spatial and spectral accuracy. Using three public datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing blind and non-blind methods.
