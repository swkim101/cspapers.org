In this paper, we study closed-form optimal solutions to two-view triangulation with known internal calibration and pose. By formulating the triangulation problem as L-1 and L-infinity minimization of angular reprojection errors, we derive the exact closed-form solutions that guarantee global optimality under respective cost functions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such solutions. Since the angular error is rotationally invariant, our solutions can be applied for any type of central cameras, be it perspective, fisheye or omnidirectional. Our methods also require significantly less computation than the existing optimal methods. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets validate our theoretical derivations.
