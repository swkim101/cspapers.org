Cross-modal hashing encodes the multimedia data into a common binary hash space in which the correlations among the samples from different modalities can be effectively measured. Deep cross-modal hashing further improves the retrieval performance as the deep neural networks can generate more semantic relevant features and hash codes. In this paper, we study the unsupervised deep cross-modal hash coding and propose Deep Joint-Semantics Reconstructing Hashing (DJSRH), which has the following two main advantages. First, to learn binary codes that preserve the neighborhood structure of the original data, DJSRH constructs a novel joint-semantics affinity matrix which elaborately integrates the original neighborhood information from different modalities and accordingly is capable to capture the latent intrinsic semantic affinity for the input multi-modal instances. Second, DJSRH later trains the networks to generate binary codes that maximally reconstruct above joint-semantics relations via the proposed reconstructing framework, which is more competent for the batch-wise training as it reconstructs the specific similarity value unlike the common Laplacian constraint merely preserving the similarity order. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement by DJSRH in various cross-modal retrieval tasks.
