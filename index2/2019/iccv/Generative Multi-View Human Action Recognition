Multi-view action recognition targets to integrate complementary information from different views to improve classification performance. It is a challenging task due to the distinct gap between heterogeneous feature domains. Moreover, most existing methods neglect to consider the incomplete multi-view data, which limits their potential compatibility in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a Generative Multi-View Action Recognition (GMVAR) framework to address the challenges above. The adversarial generative network is leveraged to generate one view conditioning on the other view, which fully explores the latent connections in both intra-view and cross-view aspects. Our approach enhances the model robustness by employing adversarial training, and naturally handles the incomplete view case by imputing the missing data. Moreover, an effective View Correlation Discovery Network (VCDN) is proposed to further fuse the multi-view information in a higher-level label space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.
