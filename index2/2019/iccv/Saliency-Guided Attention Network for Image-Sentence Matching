This paper studies the task of matching image and sentence, where learning appropriate representations to bridge the semantic gap between image contents and language appears to be the main challenge. Unlike previous approaches that predominantly deploy symmetrical architecture to represent both modalities, we introduce a Saliency-guided Attention Network (SAN) that is characterized by building an asymmetrical link between vision and language to efficiently learn a fine-grained cross-modal correlation. The proposed SAN mainly includes three components: saliency detector, Saliency-weighted Visual Attention (SVA) module, and Saliency-guided Textual Attention (STA) module. Concretely, the saliency detector provides the visual saliency information to drive both two attention modules. Taking advantage of the saliency information, SVA is able to learn more discriminative visual features. By fusing the visual information from SVA and intra-modal information as a multi-modal guidance, STA affords us powerful textual representations that are synchronized with visual clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAN can improve the state-of-the-art results on the benchmark Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets by a large margin.
