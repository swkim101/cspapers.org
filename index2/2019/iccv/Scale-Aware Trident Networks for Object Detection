Scale variation is one of the key challenges in object detection. In this work, we ﬁrst present a controlled experiment to investigate the effect of receptive ﬁelds for scale variation in object detection. Based on the ﬁndings from the exploration experiments, we propose a novel Trident Network (TridentNet) aiming to generate scale-speciﬁc feature maps with a uniform representational power. We construct a parallel multi-branch architecture in which each branch shares the same transformation parameters but with different receptive ﬁelds. Then, we adopt a scale-aware training scheme to specialize each branch by sampling object instances of proper scales for training. As a bonus, a fast approximation version of TridentNet could achieve signiﬁcant improvements without any additional parameters and computational cost compared with the vanilla detector. On the COCO dataset, our TridentNet with ResNet-101 backbone achieves state-of-the-art single-model results of 48.4 mAP. Codes are available at https://git.io/fj5vR.
