Moiré pattern is a common image quality degradation caused by frequency aliasing between monitors and cameras when taking screen-shot photos. The complex frequency distribution, imbalanced magnitude in colour channels, and diverse appearance attributes of moiré pattern make its removal a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Moiré pattern Removal Neural Network (MopNet) to solve this problem. All core components of MopNet are specially designed for unique properties of moire patterns, including the multi-scale feature aggregation addressing complex frequency, the channel-wise target edge predictor to exploit imbalanced magnitude among colour channels, and the attribute-aware classifier to characterize the diverse appearance for better modelling Moiré patterns. Quantitative and qualitative experimental comparison validate the state-of-the-art performance of MopNet.
