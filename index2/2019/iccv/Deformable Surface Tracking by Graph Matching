This paper addresses the problem of deformable surface tracking from monocular images. Specifically, we propose a graph-based approach that effectively explores the structure information of the surface to enhance tracking performance. Our approach solves simultaneously for feature correspondence, outlier rejection and shape reconstruction by optimizing a single objective function, which is defined by means of pairwise projection errors between graph structures instead of unary projection errors between matched points. Furthermore, an efficient matching algorithm is developed based on soft matching relaxation. For evaluation, our approach is extensively compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on a standard dataset of occluded surfaces, as well as a newly compiled dataset of different surfaces with rich, weak or repetitive texture. Experimental results reveal that our approach achieves robust tracking results for surfaces with different types of texture, and outperforms other algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency.
