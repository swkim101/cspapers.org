Background: Desmin null mice (Des-/-) develop a multisystem disorder involving cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Myocardial abnormalities include progressive degeneration, cardiomyocyte death,extensivecalciﬁcationandﬁbrosiswhichleadtoadilated cardiomyopathypattern.Theaimof thisstudyistoinvestigatethepresenceofarrhythmiasinaDes-/-mousemodelascomparedtowild type(WT)mice. Methods: Mice lacking desmin were generated by gene targeting via homologous recombination as previously describe. Electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were obtained in 8-months old Des-/-and WT mice (n=17) using a Data Sciences International Telemetry System (St. Paul, MN, USA).
