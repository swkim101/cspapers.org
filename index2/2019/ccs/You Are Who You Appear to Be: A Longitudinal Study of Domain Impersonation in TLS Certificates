The public key infrastructure (PKI) provides the fundamental property of authentication: the means by which users can know with whom they are communicating online. The PKI ensures end-to-end authenticity insofar as it verifies a chain of certificates, but the true final step in end-to-end authentication comes when the user verifies that the website is what they expect. To this end, users are expected to evaluate domain names, but various "domain impersonation" attacks threaten their ability to do so. Indeed, if a user could be easily tricked into believing that amazon.com-offers.com is actually amazon.com, then, coupled with security indicators like a lock icon, users could believe that they have a secure connection to Amazon. We study this threat to end-to-end authentication: (1) We introduce a new classification of an impersonation attack that we call target embedding. This embeds an entire target domain, unmodified, using one or more subdomains of the actual domain. (2) We perform a user study with the specific goal of understanding whether users fall for target embedding, and how its efficacy compares to other popular impersonation attacks (typosquatting, combosquatting, and homographs). We find that target embedding is the most effective against modern browsers. (3) Using all HTTPS certificates collected by Censys, we perform a longitudinal analysis of how target-embedding impersonation has evolved, who is responsible for issuing impersonating certificates, who hosts the domains, where the economic choke-points are, and more. We close with a discussion of counter-measures against this growing threat.
