Among various types of recent information explosion, that in news stream is also a kind of serious problems. This paper studies issues regarding topic modeling of information ﬂow in multilingual news streams. If some-one wants to ﬁnd differences in the topics of Japanese news and Chinese news, it is usually necessary for him/her to carefully watch every article in Japanese and Chinese news streams at every moment. In such a situation, topic models such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and DTM (dynamic topic model) are quite effective in estimating distribution of topics over a document collection such as articles in a news stream. Especially, as a topic model, this paper employs DTM, but not LDA, since it can consider correspondence be-tween topics of consecutive dates. Based on the results of estimating distribution of topics in Japanese / Chinese news streams, this paper proposes how to analyze cross-lingual alignment of topics in time series Japanese / Chinese news streams.
