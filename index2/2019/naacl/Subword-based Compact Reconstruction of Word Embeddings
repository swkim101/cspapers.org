The idea of subword-based word embeddings has been proposed in the literature, mainly for solving the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word problem observed in standard word-based word embeddings. In this paper, we propose a method of reconstructing pre-trained word embeddings using subword information that can effectively represent a large number of subword embeddings in a considerably small fixed space. The key techniques of our method are twofold: memory-shared embeddings and a variant of the key-value-query self-attention mechanism. Our experiments show that our reconstructed subword-based embeddings can successfully imitate well-trained word embeddings in a small fixed space while preventing quality degradation across several linguistic benchmark datasets, and can simultaneously predict effective embeddings of OOV words. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstruction method when we apply them to downstream tasks.
