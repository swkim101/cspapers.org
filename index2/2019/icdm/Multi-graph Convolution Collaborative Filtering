Personalized recommendation is ubiquitous, playing an important role in many online services. Substantial research has been dedicated to learning vector representations of users and items with the goal of predicting a user's preference for an item based on the similarity of the representations. Techniques range from classic matrix factorization to more recent deep learning based methods. However, we argue that existing methods do not make full use of the information that is available from user-item interaction data and the similarities between user pairs and item pairs. In this work, we develop a graph convolution-based recommendation framework, named Multi-Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering (Multi-GCCF), which explicitly incorporates multiple graphs in the embedding learning process. Multi-GCCF not only expressively models the high-order information via a bipartite user-item interaction graph, but integrates the proximal information by building and processing user-user and item-item graphs. Furthermore, we consider the intrinsic difference between user nodes and item nodes when performing graph convolution on the bipartite graph. We conduct extensive experiments on four publicly accessible benchmarks, showing significant improvements relative to several state-of-the-art collaborative filtering and graph neural network-based recommendation models. Further experiments quantitatively verify the effectiveness of each component of our proposed model and demonstrate that the learned embeddings capture the important relationship structure.
