Recommender system is widely used in e-commercial platforms to recommend users suitable items according to users's preferences. In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been paid to the application of recommender system in education. There are many online learning systems that can recommend students suitable courses according to students' learning performances. However, there are few universities using recommender system to recommend students suitable elective courses. It is generally known that students in higher grade take the courses earlier than those in lower grade. Therefore, the elective course scores of sophomores can be predicted by using the course score information from students of higher grades. However, the unbalanced distribution of course-enrollment data makes it hard to predict the scores of the courses that are in a low selection rate. Therefore, we propose a Constrained Matrix Factorization (ConMF) algorithm to predict sophomores' elective course scores, which integrates the course average score into the objective function so as to make up the prediction deviation caused by the unbalanced course selection rate and make more accurate prediction than the traditional Matrix Factorization (MF) approach. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the task of university students' course score prediction.
