In recent years, a massive amount of time-stamped sensor data has been generated and collected by many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as advanced automobiles and health care devices. Given such a large collection of complex sensor sequences, which consists of multiple attributes (e.g., sensor, user, timestamp), how can we automatically find important dynamic time-series patterns and the points of variation? How can we summarize all the complex sensor sequences, and achieve a meaningful segmentation? Also, can we see any hidden user-specific differences and outliers? In this paper we present CUBEMARKER, an efficient and effective method for capturing such multi-aspect features in sensor sequences. CUBEMARKER performs multi-way summarization for all attributes, namely, sensors, users, and time, and specifically it extracts multi-aspect features, such as important time-series patterns (i.e., time-aspect features) and hidden groups of users (i.e., user-aspect features), in complex sensor sequences. Our proposed method has the following advantages: (a) It is effective: it extracts multi-aspect features from complex sensor sequences and enables the efficient and effective analysis of complicated datasets; (b) It is automatic: it requires no prior training and no parameter tuning; (c) It is scalable: our method is carefully designed to be linear as regards dataset size and applicable to a large number of sensor sequences. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that CUBEMARKER is effective in that it can capture meaningful patterns for various real-world datasets, such as those obtained from smart factories, human activities, and automobiles. CUBEMARKER consistently outperforms the best state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and execution speed.
