Urban housing price is widely accepted as an economic indicator of both business and research interest in urban computing. In this work, we propose an effective and fine-grained model for urban subregion housing price predictions. Compared to existing works, our proposal improves the forecasting granularity from city-level to mile-level in spite of data sparsity and complex factors. The fine-grained housing price forecasting has the potential to support a broad scope of applications, ranging from urban planning to housing market recommendations. To achieve that, in this paper, we propose a novel integrated framework, FTD_DenseNet, which incorporates more social and economic features and makes full use of all-level spatiotemporal features. Specifically, the Kalman Filter-based future expection is firstly involved as an influence factor in our model. Extensive empirical studies on real data show the effectiveness of our proposals.
