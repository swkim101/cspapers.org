During software evolution, both production code and test cases evolve frequently. To assure software quality, test cases should evolve in time. However, test case evolution is usually delayed and error-prone. To facilitate this process, this paper proposes a context-aware test case adaptation approach (CAT), which first identifies and generalizes test case adaptation patterns, and then applies these patterns to automatically evolve test cases by analyzing their context. We conducted a preliminary study on three open-source projects and found that CAT correctly adapts 71.91% of test cases.
