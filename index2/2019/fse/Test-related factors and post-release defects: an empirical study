Testing is a very important activity whose purpose is to ensure software quality. Recent studies have studied the effects of test-related factors (e.g., code coverage) on software code quality, showing that they have good predictive power on post-release defects. Despite these studies demonstrated the existence of a relation between test-related factors and software code quality, they considered different factors separately. That led us to conduct an additional empirical study in which we considered these factors all together. The key findings of the study show that, while post-release defects are strongly related to process and code metrics of the production classes, test-related factors have a limited prediction impact.
