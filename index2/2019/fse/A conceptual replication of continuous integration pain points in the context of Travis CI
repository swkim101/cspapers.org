Continuous integration (CI) is an established software quality assurance practice, and the focus of much prior research with a diverse range of methods and populations. In this paper, we first conduct a literature review of 37 papers on CI pain points. We then conduct a conceptual replication study on results from these papers using a triangulation design consisting of a survey with 132 responses, 12 interviews, and two logistic regressions predicting Travis CI abandonment and switching on a dataset of 6,239 GitHub projects. We report and discuss which past results we were able to replicate, those for which we found conflicting evidence, those for which we did not find evidence, and the implications of these findings.
