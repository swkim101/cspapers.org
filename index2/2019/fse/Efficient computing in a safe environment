Modern computer systems are facing security challenges and thus are forced to employ various encryption, mitigation mechanisms, and other measures that affect significantly their performance. In this study, we aim to identify the energy and run-time performance implications of Meltdown and Spectre mitigation mechanisms. To achieve our goal, we experiment on server platform using different test cases. Our results highlight that request handling and memory operations are noticeably affected from mitigation mechanisms, both in terms of energy and run-time performance.
