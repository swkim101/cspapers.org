To protect the privacy and search sensitive data leaks, we must solve multiple challenges (e.g., applicability, portability, and scalability) for developing an appropriate taint analysis for distributed systems.We hence present DistTaint, a dynamic taint analysis for distributed systems against these challenges. It could infer implicit dependencies from partial-ordering method events in executions to resolve the applicability challenge. DistTaint fully works at application-level without any customization of platforms to overcome the portability challenge. It exploits a multi-phase analysis to achieve scalability. By proposing a pre-analysis, DistTaint narrows down the following fine-grained analysis’ scope to reduce the overall cost significantly. Empirical results showed DistTaint’s practical applicability, portability, and scalability to industry-scale distributed programs, and its capability of discovering security vulnerabilities in real-world distributed systems.
