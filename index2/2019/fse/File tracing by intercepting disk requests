Existing file operation tracing methods are always OS-specific. It is a problem for file monitoring in some exotic operating systems and other programs running in privileged mode. We present a file system specific solution that could be work with any guest OS on a virtual machine. This solution works on the basis of intercepting requests to a block device. Our implementation is based on the QEMU emulator and supports ext2 and ext3 file systems.
