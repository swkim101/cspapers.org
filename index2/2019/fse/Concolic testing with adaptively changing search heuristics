We present Chameleon, a new approach for adaptively changing search heuristics during concolic testing. Search heuristics play a central role in concolic testing as they mitigate the path-explosion problem by focusing on particular program paths that are likely to increase code coverage as quickly as possible. A variety of techniques for search heuristics have been proposed over the past decade. However, existing approaches are limited in that they use the same search heuristics throughout the entire testing process, which is inherently insufficient to exercise various execution paths. Chameleon overcomes this limitation by adapting search heuristics on the fly via an algorithm that learns new search heuristics based on the knowledge accumulated during concolic testing. Experimental results show that the transition from the traditional non-adaptive approaches to ours greatly improves the practicality of concolic testing in terms of both code coverage and bug-finding.
