As in other software domains, information flow security is a fundamental aspect of code security in distributed systems. However, most existing solutions to information flow security are limited to centralized software. For distributed systems, such solutions face multiple challenges, including technique applicability, tool portability, and analysis scalability. To overcome these challenges, we present DistTaint, a dynamic information flow (taint) analyzer for distributed systems. By partial-ordering method-execution events, DistTaint infers implicit dependencies in distributed programs, so as to resolve the applicability challenge. It resolves the portability challenge by working fully at application level, without customizing the runtime platform. To achieve scalability, it reduces analysis costs using a multi-phase analysis, where the pre-analysis phase generates method-level results to narrow down the scope of the following statement-level analysis. We evaluated DistTaint against eight real-world distributed systems. Empirical results showed DistTaintâ€™s applicability to, portability with, and scalability for industry-scale distributed systems, along with its capability of discovering known and unknown vulnerabilities.
