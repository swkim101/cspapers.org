Input sanitization and validation of user inputs are well-established protection mechanisms for microservice architectures against XML injection attacks (XMLi). The effectiveness of the protection mechanisms strongly depends on the quality of the sanitization and validation rule sets (e.g., regular expressions) and, therefore, security analysts have to test them thoroughly. In this demo, we introduce JCOMIX, a penetration testing tool that generates XMLi attacks (test cases) exposing XML vulnerabilities in front-end web applications. JCOMIX implements various search algorithms, including random search (traditional fuzzing), genetic algorithms (GAs), and the more recent co-operative, co-evolutionary algorithm designed explicitly for the XMLi testing (COMIX). We also show the results of an empirical study showing the effectiveness of JCOMIX in testing an open-source front-end web application.
