Used as a platform for executing smart contracts, Blockchain technology has yielded new programming languages. We propose a graph-based framework for computing software design metrics for the Solidity programming language, and use this framework in a preliminary study on 505 smart contracts mined from GitHub. The results show that most of the smart contracts are rather straightforward from an objected-oriented point of view and that new design metrics specific to smart contracts should be developed.
