As Agile principles and values become an integral part of the soft-ware development culture, development processes experience significant changes. Requirements engineering, an individual phase occurring at the beginning of the traditional development, is distributed between various activities according to agile. However, how customer communication related problems are solved within the context of agile requirements engineering (RE)? Empirical study of that problem is done using 2 methods: systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews. Problems related to customer communication in agile RE are revealed and composed into patterns. Patterns are to be supplemented with the solutions in the further research.
