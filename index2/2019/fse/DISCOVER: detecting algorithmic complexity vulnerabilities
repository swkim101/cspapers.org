Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities (ACV) are a class of vulnerabilities that enable Denial of Service Attacks. ACVs stem from asymmetric consumption of resources due to complex loop termination logic, recursion, and/or resource intensive library APIs. Completely automated detection of ACVs is intractable and it calls for tools that assist human analysts. We present DISCOVER, a suite of tools that facilitates human-on-the-loop detection of ACVs. DISCOVER's workflow can be broken into three phases - (1) Automated characterization of loops, (2) Selection of suspicious loops, and (3) Interactive audit of selected loops. We demonstrate DISCOVER using a case study using a DARPA challenge app. DISCOVER supports analysis of Java source code and Java bytecode. We demonstrate it for Java bytecode.
