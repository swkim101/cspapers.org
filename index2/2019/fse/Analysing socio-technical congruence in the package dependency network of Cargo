Software package distributions form large dependency networks maintained by large communities of contributors. My PhD research will consist of analysing the evolution of the socio-technical congruence of these package dependency networks, and studying its impact on the health of the ecosystem and its community. I have started a longitudinal empirical study of Cargo's dependency network and the social (commenting) and technical (development) activities in Cargo's package repositories on GitHub, and present some preliminary findings.
