Path balancing technology mapping is a method of mapping a technology-independent logical description of a circuit, such as a Boolean network, into a technology-dependent, gate-level netlist. For a gate-level netlist generated by the path balancing mapper, the difference between lengths of the longest and the shortest paths in the circuit is minimized. To achieve full path balancing, it may be necessary to add buffers on signal paths, and in such a case, the cost of buffers must be properly accounted for. This paper presents a dynamic programming-based technology mapping algorithm that generates a minimum-area mapping solution which is guaranteed to be fully path balanced. The fully path balanced mapping solution is essential to conventional superconductive single flux quantum circuits, which will fail otherwise. The balanced mapping solution is also useful in CMOS circuits to avoid (or minimize) unwanted hazard activity and the resulting wasteful dynamic power dissipation as well as to achieve the maximum throughput in a wave-pipelined circuit. Experimental results show that our path balancing technology mapping algorithm decreases total area, static power consumption, and path balancing overhead of single flux quantum circuits by large factors. For example, it reduces the circuit area by up to 111% and by an average of 26.3% compared to state-of-the-art technology mappers.
