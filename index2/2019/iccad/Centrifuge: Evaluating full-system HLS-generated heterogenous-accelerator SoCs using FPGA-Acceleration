To overcome the end of traditional scaling, modern SoC systems consist of general-purpose compute augmented with large numbers of specialized accelerators. However, building and evaluating these systems is extremely expensive and time-consuming, even in early stages of development. While high-level modeling and back-of-the-envelope calculations can provide early insights into a new system, there are key effects that only manifest at the full-system level. However, full-system design has traditionally required writing RTL or developing complex software models for the entire design. In this paper, we describe a methodology and implement an open-source flow (“Centrifuge”) that can rapidly generate and evaluate heterogeneous SoCs by combining an HLS toolchain with the open-source FireSim FPGA-accelerated simulation platform. Our system can quickly produce complete SoC systems with many integrated HLS-generated accelerators as specified by the user, simulate them quickly and cycle-accurately on FPGAs, and run complete software stacks on top, including booting Linux and running full application frameworks. Our system allows users to easily explore a variety of accelerator integration techniques, by automatically integrating accelerators in several ways—as tightly coupled RoCC accelerators, as accelerators that communicate over the standard on-chip network, and lastly as “disaggregated” accelerators that are directly attached to an Ethernet network between SoCs. By integrating these tools, our methodology allows users to rapidly generate an entire hardware/software stack for a customized SoC that can be fabricated as an ASIC and evaluate its end-to-end performance using cycle-exact FPGA simulation, allowing for agile design-space exploration of novel accelerator-based systems.
