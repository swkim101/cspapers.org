The DARPA IDEA program has brought unprecedented resources and attention to development of open-source EDA. As this session convenes, IDEA is well into its second year, with “alpha” releases in the rear-view mirror, and a public v1.0 unveiling just eight months away. This talk will give a perspective on recent open-source development for digital layout generation. First, any technology should have a roadmap of quantifiable metrics, requirements, and potential solutions – projected on the axis of time. What are key aspects of such a roadmap for open-source EDA technology? Second, what does open-source EDA tell us about ourselves? The goal of open-source is a mirror for the ecosystem of academic research, semiconductor design, and commercial EDA. Who is willing to contribute? Who is capable of contributing? What are bars for “moving the needle” and sustainability?
