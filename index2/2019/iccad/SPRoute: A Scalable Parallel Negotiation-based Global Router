The complexity of global routing increases rapidly as chip designs grow larger. In many global routers, maze routing is the most time-consuming stage. One way to reduce its runtime is parallelization. Existing parallel maze routers work either by identifying and routing independent nets or by partitioning the chip area into non-overlapping regions. In this paper, we describe a scalable parallel global router called SPRoute that initially exploits net-level parallelism, automatically lowers the parallelism when livelock is identified, and finally switches to fine-grain parallelism to guarantee convergence. We evaluate SPRoute on a 28-core machine on the ISPD 2008 global routing contest benchmark suite. It achieves an average speedup of 11.5 with a wirelength penalty of 0.6% on overflow-free benchmarks, and an average speedup of 4.5 with a total overflow penalty of 7% on hard-to-route benchmarks over sequential SPRoute. Compared to FastRoute 4.1, SPRoute achieves an average speedup of 11.0 and 3.1 on overflow-free benchmarks and hard-to-route benchmarks, respectively.
