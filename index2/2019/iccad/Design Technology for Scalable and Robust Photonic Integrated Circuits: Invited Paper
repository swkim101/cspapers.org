Photonic integrated circuit (PIC), as a promising alternative to traditional CMOS circuit, has demonstrated the potential to accomplish on-chip optical signal transmission and computations in ultra-high speed and/or low power consumption. One of the critical challenges of PIC, however, is that its scalability and robustness are limited by cascaded optical power loss and noise error. In this paper, we analyze the scalability and noise robustness challenges facing photonic integrated circuits, for two representative PIC applications: logic computing and neural networks. Automated design algorithms and learning methodologies are proposed to resolve these issues.
