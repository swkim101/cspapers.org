Energy efficiency of an optical network-on-chip (ONoC) largely relies on an effective laser power management strategy. Addressing the limitations of existing techniques, we propose a Task Mapping-Assisted Laser Power Scaling (TMALPS) framework to optimize the energy consumption and the application execution time of an ONoC. Through the combination of task mapping exploration and runtime laser power reconfiguration applied to a wide range of application benchmarks, our TMALPS framework achieves an average of 66% saving of the energy-delay product, compared to a baseline scenario where the optimization techniques are not applied. Significant improvement over existing techniques was also observed. The hardware overhead required to support our TMALPS framework is minimal with intelligent reuse of existing on-chip hardware resource.
