This paper presents InTune, a novel approach for in-circuit tuning of deep learning designs targeting implementations in field-programmable gate array technology. This approach combines two promising techniques: domain-specific adaptation and in-circuit tuning. Domain-specific adaptation exploits domain-specific information in adapting pre-trained models to specific application domains, replacing standard convolution layers with efficient convolution blocks; the effects of such adaptation are then assessed by in-circuit tuning instruments to provide information to application builders for tuning the design. This approach is illustrated by its deployment in tuning deep neural networks, and its potential for a new generation of domain-specific tools with tight integration of synthesis and in-circuit tuning is explored.
