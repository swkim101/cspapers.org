Active cell balancing is the process of equalizing the charge levels of individual cells in a series-connected high power Lithium-Ion battery packs to improve its usable capacity. Several hardware circuit architectures for exchanging charge between the cells and multiple heuristics for controlling the balancing architectures have been proposed in the literature. However, formulating an optimal balancing algorithm that guarantees minimum energy dissipation has not been studied so far. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an optimal cell balancing strategy for minimizing the energy dissipation in a charge equalization process. Our proposed optimization approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, we formulate the charge equalization as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem for identifying the set of charge transfer pairs of cells that will guarantee minimum energy dissipation. For these obtained pairs, we compute the lower bound for the balancing time considering the constraints of the balancing architecture. In the second stage, we propose an iterative scheduling strategy to achieve this lower bound by solving an Integer Linear Programming problem at each iteration. Multiple case studies show that our proposed strategy results up to 41% less energy dissipation than the state-of-the-art approaches and always achieves the computed lower bound for the balancing time.
