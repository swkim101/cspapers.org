Real-time autonomous systems are becoming pervasive in many application domains such as vehicular ad-hoc networks, smart factories and delivery drones. The correct functioning of these real-time systems is timing-critical with hard deadlines. However, although they interact with other systems and exchange inputs/outputs with the physical world, they usually lack security mechanisms, which makes them susceptible to a wide range of attacks with critical consequences. Typically, this is because security mechanisms usually violate the real-time requirements of these systems and cannot be adjusted at runtime to provide the adequate security without compromising performance. In this paper, we propose a consolidated runtime-configurable hardware-assisted security extension called CHASE that supports different levels of security at runtime. Depending on the desired security level and the system real-time, availability or functionality requirements, CHASE can be configured accordingly at runtime, thus enabling the calibration of the security vs. performance trade-off. We analyze CHASE's effectiveness in providing different security guarantees against various adversarial capabilities, and show how this is achieved with reasonable logic overhead and minimal performance overhead.
