In this paper, we propose an efficient performance trade-off modeling method for analog circuit based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). First, we use a single BNN to simultaneously model multiple performances of interest (PoIs) of an analog circuit. This BNN model can be trained by using a novel automatic differential variational inference (ADVI) method with affordable computational cost. Next, the performance trade-off model can be extracted by embedding BNN into Bayesian optimization framework combined with a modified multi-objective evolutionary method. Since the correlations among different PoIs are implicitly encoded in the BNN model, the proposed method can capture the performance trade-off model efficiently and accurately. The numerical experiments demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method can achieve up to 2Ã— runtime reduction without surrendering any accuracy.
