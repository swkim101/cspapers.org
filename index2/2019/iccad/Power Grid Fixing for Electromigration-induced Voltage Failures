Electromigration (EM) is a major reliability concern in chip power grids in the wake of smaller feature sizes. EM degradation of grid metal lines can cause large voltage drops on the grid, leading to timing failures and logic errors. During the design process, modifications to the grid design may be required in order to protect from the risk of such EM-induced voltage drop failures. We consider this problem in light of recent efficient full-chip EM assessment techniques. We present a systematic approach that resizes the grid metal lines to meet a design target lifetime while requiring minimal increase in metal area of the grid.
