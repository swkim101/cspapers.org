High-radix integrated silicon photonic switches promise ultrahigh bandwidth communications required by next generation data centers. To holistically explore the characteristics of high-radix integrated optical switches, this work systematically studies the latency, throughput and energy consumption, with detailed models and various system configurations. Three categories of space switches, blocking, rearrangeable non-blocking and strictly non-blocking switches, are investigated, together with one of the widely used wavelength switches, arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR). The work paves the ways to automatically optimize high-radix integrated silicon photonic switches.
