Data breaches place afected individuals at signifcant risk of identity theft. Yet, prior studies have shown that many consumers do not take protective actions after receiving a data breach notifcation from a company. We analyzed 161 data breach notifcations sent to consumers with respect to their readability, structure, risk communication, and presentation of potential actions. We fnd that notifcations are long and require advanced reading skills. Many companies downplay or obscure the likelihood of the receiver being afected by the breach and associated risks. Moreover, potential actions and ofered compensations are frequently described in lengthy paragraphs instead of clearly listed. Little information is provided regarding an actionâ€™s urgency and efectiveness; little guidance is provided on which actions to prioritize. Based on our fndings, we provide recommendations for designing more usable and informative data breach notifcations that could help consumers better mitigate the consequences of being afected by a data breach.
