. The Wasserstein distance serves as a loss function for unsupervised learning which depends on the choice of a ground metric on sample space. We propose to use a Wasserstein distance as the ground metric on the sample space of images. This ground metric is known as an e ↵ ective distance for image retrieval, since it correlates with human perception. We derive the Wasserstein ground metric on image space and deﬁne a Riemannian Wasserstein gradient penalty to be used in the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) framework. The new gradient penalty is computed e � ciently via convolutions on the L 2 (Euclidean) gradients with negligible additional computational cost. The new formulation is more robust to the natural variability of images and provides for a more continuous discriminator in sample space.
