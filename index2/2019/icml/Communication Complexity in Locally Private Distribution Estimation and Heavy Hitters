We consider the problems of distribution estimation and heavy hitter (frequency) estimation under privacy and communication constraints. While these constraints have been studied separately, optimal schemes for one are sub-optimal for the other. We propose a sample-optimal $\varepsilon$-locally differentially private (LDP) scheme for distribution estimation, where each user communicates only one bit, and requires no public randomness. We show that Hadamard Response, a recently proposed scheme for $\varepsilon$-LDP distribution estimation is also utility-optimal for heavy hitter estimation. Finally, we show that unlike distribution estimation, without public randomness where only one bit suffices, any heavy hitter estimation algorithm that communicates $o(\min \{\log n, \log k\})$ bits from each user cannot be optimal.
