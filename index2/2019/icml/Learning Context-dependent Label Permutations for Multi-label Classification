A key problem in multi-label classiﬁcation is to utilize dependencies among the labels. Chaining classiﬁers are a simple technique for addressing this problem but current algorithms all assume a ﬁxed, static label ordering. In this work, we pro-pose a multi-label classiﬁcation approach which allows to choose a dynamic, context-dependent label ordering. Our proposed approach consists of two sub-components: a simple EM-like algorithm which bootstraps the learned model, and a more principled approach based on reinforcement learning. Our experiments on three public multi-label classiﬁcation benchmarks show that our proposed dynamic label ordering approach based on reinforcement learning outperforms recurrent neural networks with ﬁxed label ordering across both bipartition and ranking measures on all the three datasets. As a result, we obtain a powerful sequence prediction-based algorithm for multi-label classiﬁcation, which is able to efﬁciently and explicitly exploit label dependencies.
