Why are classifiers in high dimension vulnerable to "adversarial" perturbations? We show that it is likely not due to information theoretic limitations, but rather it could be due to computational constraints. 
First we prove that, for a broad set of classification tasks, the mere existence of a robust classifier implies that it can be found by a possibly exponential-time algorithm with relatively few training examples. Then we give a particular classification task where learning a robust classifier is computationally intractable. More precisely we construct a binary classification task in high dimensional space which is (i) information theoretically easy to learn robustly for large perturbations, (ii) efficiently learnable (non-robustly) by a simple linear separator, (iii) yet is not efficiently robustly learnable, even for small perturbations, by any algorithm in the statistical query (SQ) model. This example gives an exponential separation between classical learning and robust learning in the statistical query model. It suggests that adversarial examples may be an unavoidable byproduct of computational limitations of learning algorithms.
