Structured models of decision making often assume an agent is aware of all possible states and actions in advance. This assumption is sometimes untenable. In this paper, we learn inï¬‚uence diagrams from both domain exploration and expert assertions in a way which guarantees convergence to optimal behaviour, even when the agent starts unaware of actions or belief variables that are critical to success. Our experiments show that our agent learns optimal behaviour on small and large decision problems, and that allowing an agent to conserve information upon discovering new possibilities results in faster convergence.
