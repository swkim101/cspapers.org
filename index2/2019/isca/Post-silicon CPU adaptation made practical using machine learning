Processors that adapt architecture to workloads at runtime promise compelling performance per watt (PPW) gains, offering one way to mitigate diminishing returns from pipeline scaling. State-of-the-art adaptive CPUs deploy machine learning (ML) models on-chip to optimize hardware by recognizing workload patterns in event counter data. However, despite breakthrough PPW gains, such designs are not yet widely adopted due to the potential for systematic adaptation errors in the field. This paper presents an adaptive CPU based on Intel SkyLake that (1) closes the loop to deployment, and (2) provides a novel mechanism for post-silicon customization. Our CPU performs predictive cluster gating, dynamically setting the issue width of a clustered architecture while clock-gating unused resources. Gating decisions are driven by ML adaptation models that execute on an existing microcontroller, minimizing design complexity and allowing performance characteristics to be adjusted with the ease of a firmware update. Crucially, we show that although adaptation models can suffer from statistical blindspots that risk degrading performance on new workloads, these can be reduced to minimal impact with careful design and training. Our adaptive CPU improves PPW by 31.4% over a comparable non-adaptive CPU on SPEC2017, and exhibits two orders of magnitude fewer Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations than the state-of-the-art. We show how to optimize PPW using models trained to different SLAs or to specific applications, e.g. to improve datacenter hardware in situ. The resulting CPU meets real world deployment criteria for the first time and provides a new means to tailor hardware to individual customers, even as their needs change.
