We present Plane, Ray, and Point, a set of interaction techniques that utilizes shape constraints to enable quick and precise object alignment and manipulation in virtual reality. Users create the three types of shape constraints, Plane, Ray, and Point, by using symbolic gestures. The shape constraints are used like scaffoldings and limit and guide the movement of virtual objects that collide or intersect with them. The same set of gestures can be performed with the other hand, which allow users to further control the degrees of freedom for precise and constrained manipulation. The combination of shape constraints and bimanual gestures yield a rich set of interaction techniques to support object transformation. An exploratory study conducted with 3D design experts and novice users found the techniques to be useful in 3D scene design workflows and easy to learn and use.
