We propose a paradigm called Skin-On interfaces, in which interactive devices have their own (artificial) skin, thus enabling new forms of input gestures for end-users (e.g. twist, scratch). Our work explores the design space of Skin-On interfaces by following a bio-driven approach: (1) From a sensory point of view, we study how to reproduce the look and feel of the human skin through three user studies;(2) From a gestural point of view, we explore how gestures naturally performed on skin can be transposed to Skin-On interfaces; (3) From a technical point of view, we explore and discuss different ways of fabricating interfaces that mimic human skin sensitivity and can recognize the gestures observed in the previous study; (4) We assemble the insights of our three exploratory facets to implement a series of Skin-On interfaces and we also contribute by providing a toolkit that enables easy reproduction and fabrication.
