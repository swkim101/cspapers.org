A major concern for filmmakers creating 360° video is ensuring that the viewer does not miss important narrative elements because they are looking in the wrong direction. This paper introduces gated clips which do not play the video past a gate time until a filmmaker-defined viewer gaze condition is met, such as looking at a specific region of interest (ROI). Until the condition is met, we seamlessly loop video playback using view-dependent video textures, a new variant of standard video textures that adapt the looping behavior to the portion of the scene that is within the viewer's field of view. We use our desktop GUI to edit live action and computer animated 360° videos. In a user study with casual viewers, participants prefer our looping videos over the standard versions and are able to successfully see all of the looping videos' ROIs without fear of missing important narrative content.
