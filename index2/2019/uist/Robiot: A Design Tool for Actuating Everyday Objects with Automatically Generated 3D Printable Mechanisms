Users can now easily communicate digital information with an Internet of Things; in contrast, there remains a lack of support to automate physical tasks that involve legacy static objects, e.g. adjusting a desk lamp's angle for optimal brightness, turning on/off a manual faucet when washing dishes, sliding a window to maintain a preferred indoor temperature. Automating these simple physical tasks has the potential to improve people's quality of life, which is particularly important for people with a disability or in situational impairment. We present Robiot -- a design tool for generating mechanisms that can be attached to, motorized, and actuating legacy static objects to perform simple physical tasks. Users only need to take a short video manipulating an object to demonstrate an intended physical behavior. Robiot then extracts requisite parameters and automatically generates 3D models of the enabling actuation mechanisms by performing a scene and motion analysis of the 2D video in alignment with the object's 3D model. In an hour-long design session, six participants used Robiot to actuate seven everyday objects, imbuing them with the robotic capability to automate various physical tasks.
