Large-scale computing systems are becoming increasingly more power-constrained, but these systems employ hardware over- provisioning to achieve higher system throughput because applications often do not consume the peak power capacity of nodes. Unfortunately, focusing on system throughput alone can lead to severe unfairness among multiple concurrently-running applications. This paper introduces PERQ, a new feedback-based principled approach to improve system throughput while achieving fairness among concurrent applications.
