People browsing the web deserve privacy by default and an important part of such privacy is to prevent them from being tracked across websites. In this talk, we will cover why cross-site tracking is bad for people and the web, and how Safari prevents this tracking from happening. We will look at how trackers have tried to circumvent protections and what Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention has done about it. Lastly, we will look at two new web APIs—the Storage Access API and Private Click Measurement—as examples of how privacy-preserving functionality can be added to the web platform while still preventing cross-site tracking.
