Stack Overflow is the most popular discussion platform for software developers. Recent research found a large amount of insecure encryption code in production systems that has been inspired by examples  given on Stack Overflow. By copying and pasting functional code, developers introduced exploitable  software vulnerabilities into security-sensitive high-profile applications installed by millions of users every day. Proposed mitigations of this problem suffer from usability flaws and push developers to continue shopping for code examples on Stack Overflow once again. This points us to fighting the proliferation of insecure code directly at the root before it even reaches the clipboard. By viewing Stack Overflow as a market, implementation of cryptography becomes a decision-making problem: i. e. how to simplify the selection of helpful and secure examples. We focus on supporting software developers in making better decisions by applying nudges, a concept borrowed from behavioral science. This approach is motivated by one of our key findings: for 99.37% of insecure code examples on Stack Overflow, similar alternatives are available that serve the same use case and provide strong cryptography. Our system design is based on several nudges that are controlled by a deep neural network. It learns a representation for cryptographic API usage patterns and classification of their security, achieving average AUC-ROC of 0.992. With a user study we demonstrate that nudge-based security advice significantly helps tackling the most popular and error-prone cryptographic use cases in Android.
