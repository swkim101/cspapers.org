Given a target program state (or statement) s, what is the probability that an input reaches s? This is the quantitative reachability analysis problem. For instance, quantitative reachability analysis can be used to approximate the reliability of a program (where s is a bad state). Traditionally, quantitative reachability analysis is solved as a model counting problem for a formal constraint that represents the (approximate) reachability of s along paths in the program, i.e., probabilistic reachability analysis. However, in preliminary experiments, we failed to run state-of-the-art probabilistic reachability analysis on reasonably large programs. In this paper, we explore statistical methods to estimate reachability probability. An advantage of statistical reasoning is that the size and composition of the program are insubstantial as long as the program can be executed. We are particularly interested in the error compared to the state-of-the-art probabilistic reachability analysis. We realize that existing estimators do not exploit the inherent structure of the program and develop structure-aware estimators to further reduce the estimation error given the same number of samples. Our empirical evaluation on previous and new benchmark programs shows that (i) our statistical reachability analysis outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic reachability analysis tools in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, and (ii) our structure-aware estimators further outperform (blackbox) estimators that do not exploit the inherent program structure. We also identify multiple program properties that limit the applicability of the existing probabilistic analysis techniques.
