Abstract: Apart from forming the backbone of compiler optimization, static dataflow analysis has been widely applied in a vast variety of applications, such as bug detection, privacy analysis, program comprehension, etc. Despite its importance, performing interprocedural dataflow analysis on large-scale programs is well known to be challenging.In this paper, we propose a novel distributed analysis framework supporting the general interprocedural dataflow analysis.Inspired by large-scale graph processing, we devise a dedicated distributed worklist algorithm tailored for interprocedural dataflow analysis. We implement the algorithm and develop a distributed framework called BigDataflow running on a large-scale cluster.The experimental results validate the promising performance of BigDataflow â€“ it can finish analyzing the program of millions lines of code in minutes. Compared with the state-of-the-art, BigDataflow achieves much more analysis efficiency.
