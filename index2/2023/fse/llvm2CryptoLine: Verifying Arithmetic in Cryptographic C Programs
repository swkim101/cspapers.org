Correct implementations of cryptographic primitives are essential for modern security. These implementations often contain arithmetic operations involving non-linear computations that are infamously hard to verify. We present llvm2CryptoLine, an automated formal verification tool for arithmetic operations in cryptographic C programs. llvm2CryptoLine successfully verifies 51 arithmetic C programs from industrial cryptographic libraries OpenSSL, wolfSSL and NaCl. Most of the programs are verified fully automatically and efficiently. A screencast that showcases llvm2CryptoLine can be found at https://youtu.be/QXuSmja45VA.
