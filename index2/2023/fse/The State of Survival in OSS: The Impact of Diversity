Maintaining and retaining contributors is crucial for Open Source (OSS) projects. However, there is often a high turnover among contributors (in some projects as high as 80%). The survivability of contributors is influenced by various factors, including their demographics. Research on contributorsâ€™ survivability must, therefore, consider diversity factors. This study longitudinally analyzed the impact of demographic attributes on survivability in the Flutter community through the lens of gender, region, and compensation. The preliminary analysis reveals that affiliated or Western contributors have a higher survival probability than volunteer or Non-Western contributors. However, no significant difference was found in the survival probability between men and women.
