This paper presents a privacy-centric approach to log parsing, addressing the growing need for privacy compliance in log management. We propose a novel log parser that focuses on data minimization, a key principle in privacy protection. By integrating privacy considerations into the log parsing process, our approach enables proactive and timely privacy compliance and mitigation of privacy breaches.
