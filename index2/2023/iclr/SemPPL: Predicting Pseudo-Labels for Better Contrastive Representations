Learning from large amounts of unsupervised data and a small amount of supervision is an important open problem in computer vision. We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning -- where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) -- with a novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones through a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to even better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of $68.5\%$ and $76\%$ top-$1$ accuracy when using a ResNet-$50$ and training on $1\%$ and $10\%$ of labels on ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SemPPL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving $72.3\%$ and $78.3\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet with $1\%$ and $10\%$ labels, respectively, which improves absolute $+7.8\%$ and $+6.2\%$ over previous work. SemPPL also exhibits state-of-the-art performance over larger ResNet models as well as strong robustness, out-of-distribution and transfer performance.
