Recent work on deep learning for tabular data demonstrates the strong performance of deep tabular models, often bridging the gap between gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks. Accuracy aside, a major advantage of neural models is that they learn reusable features and are easily fine-tuned in new domains. This property is often exploited in computer vision and natural language applications, where transfer learning is indispensable when task-specific training data is scarce. In this work, we demonstrate that upstream data gives tabular neural networks a decisive advantage over widely used GBDT models. We propose a realistic medical diagnosis benchmark for tabular transfer learning, and we present a how-to guide for using upstream data to boost performance with a variety of tabular neural network architectures. Finally, we propose a pseudo-feature method for cases where the upstream and downstream feature sets differ, a tabular-specific problem widespread in real-world applications.
