Recently, a few self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods have outperformed the ImageNet classification pre-training for vision tasks such as object detection. However, its effects on 3D human body pose and shape estimation (3DHPSE) are open to question, whose target is fixed to a unique class, the human, and has an inherent task gap with SSL. We empirically study and analyze the effects of SSL and further compare it with other pre-training alternatives for 3DHPSE. The alternatives are 2D annotation-based pre-training and synthetic data pre-training, which share the motivation of SSL that aims to reduce the labeling cost. They have been widely utilized as a source of weak-supervision or fine-tuning, but have not been remarked as a pre-training source. SSL methods underperform the conventional ImageNet classification pre-training on multiple 3DHPSE benchmarks by 7.7% on average. In contrast, despite a much less amount of pre-training data, the 2D annotation-based pre-training improves accuracy on all benchmarks and shows faster convergence during fine-tuning. Our observations challenge the naive application of the current SSL pre-training to 3DHPSE and relight the value of other data types in the pre-training aspect.
