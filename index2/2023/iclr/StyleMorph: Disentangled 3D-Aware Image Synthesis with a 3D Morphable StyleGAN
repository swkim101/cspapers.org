We introduce StyleMorph, a 3D-aware generative model that disentangles 3D shape, camera pose, object appearance, and background appearance for high quality image synthesis. We account for shape variability by morphing a canonical 3D object template, effectively learning a 3D morphable model in an entirely unsupervised manner through backprop. We chain 3D morphable modelling with de-ferred neural rendering by performing an implicit surface rendering of “Template Object Coordinates” (TOCS), which can be understood as an unsupervised counterpart to UV maps. This provides a detailed 2D TOCS map signal that reflects the compounded geometric effects of non-rigid shape variation, camera pose, and perspective projection. We combine 2D TOCS maps with an independent appearance code to condition a StyleGAN-based deferred neural rendering (DNR) network for foreground image (object) synthesis; we use a separate code for background synthesis and do late fusion to deliver the final result. We show competitive synthesis results on 4 datasets (FFHQ faces, AFHQ Cats, Dogs, Wild), while achieving the joint disentanglement of shape, pose, object and background texture.
