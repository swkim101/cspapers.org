Moire patterns appear frequently when taking photos of digital screens, drastically degrading the image quality. Despite the advance of CNNs in image demoireing, existing networks are with heavy design, causing redundant computation burden for mobile devices. In this paper, we launch the first study on accelerating demoireing networks and propose a dynamic demoireing acceleration method (DDA) towards a real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our stimulus stems from a simple-yet-universal fact that moire patterns often unbalancedly distribute across an image. Consequently, excessive computation is wasted upon non-moire areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in proportion to the complexity of image patches. In order to achieve this aim, we measure the complexity of an image patch by designing a novel moire prior that considers both colorfulness and frequency information of moire patterns. Then, we restore image patches with higher-complexity using larger networks and the ones with lower-complexity are assigned with smaller networks to relieve the computation burden. At last, we train all networks in a parameter-shared supernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed DDA. In addition, the acceleration evaluated on the VIVO X80 Pro smartphone equipped with a chip of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 shows that our method can drastically reduce the inference time, leading to a real-time image demoireing on mobile devices.
