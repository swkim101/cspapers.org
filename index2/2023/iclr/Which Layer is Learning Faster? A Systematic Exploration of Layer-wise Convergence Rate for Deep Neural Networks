The deeply hierarchical structures enable deep neural networks (DNNs) to fit ex-tremely complex target functions. However, the complex interaction between layers also makes the learning process of a particular layer poorly understood. This work demonstrates that the shallower layers of DNNs tend to converge faster than the deeper layers. We call this phenomenon Layer Convergence Bias . We also uncover the fundamental reason behind this phenomenon: Flatter local minima of shallower layers make their gradients more stable and predictive, allowing for faster training. Another surprising result is that the shallower layers tend to learn the low-frequency components of the target function, while the deeper layers usually learn the high-frequency components. It is consistent with the recent discovery that DNNs learn lower frequency objects faster.
