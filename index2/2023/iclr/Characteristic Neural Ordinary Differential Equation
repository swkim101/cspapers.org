In the evaluation of cervical spine disorders, precise positioning of anatomo-physiological hallmarks is fundamental for calculating diverse measurement metrics. Despite the fact that deep learning has achieved impressive results in the field of keypoint localization, there are still many limitations when facing medical image. First, these methods often encounter limitations when faced with the inherent variability in cervical spine datasets, arising from imaging factors. Second, predicting keypoints for only 4% of the entire X-ray image surface area poses a significant challenge. To tackle these issues, we propose a deep neural network architecture, NF-DEKR, specifically tailored for predicting keypoints in cervical spine physiological anatomy. Leveraging neural memory ordinary differential equation with its distinctive memory learning separation and convergence to a singular global attractor characteristic, our design effectively mitigates inherent data variability. Simultaneously, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Focus module to preprocess feature maps before entering the disentangled regression branch and the heatmap branch. Employing a differentiated strategy for feature maps of varying scales, this approach yields more accurate predictions of densely localized keypoints. We construct a medical dataset, SCUSpineXray, comprising X-ray images annotated by orthopedic specialists and conduct similar experiments on the publicly available UWSpineCT dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline DEKR network, our proposed method enhances average precision by 2% to 3%, accompanied by a marginal increase in model parameters and the floating-point operations (FLOPs).
