Mixed-cell-height VLSI circuits have been popularly adopted to meet different design requirements. Due to various design for manufacturability (DFM)-related considerations, such as layout dependent effects (LDEs), drain-to-drain abutment (DDA), and pattern coloring for multiple patterning, different spacings in terms of placement sites between each pair of adjacent cells may result in different performances, which are usually modeled as discrete spacing costs. To tackle such a discrete and spacing cost-aware detailed placement problem for mixed-cell-height designs, a state-of-the-art dynamic programming (DP)-based approach can only tackle few cell rows simultaneously due to its extremely high complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel DP algorithm that can optimally and much efficiently solve the problem. In addition, several optimality-preserving reduction techniques are also proposed to enable the possibility of full-chip optimal solution derivation for large-scale designs. Experiments considering two DFM considerations show that the proposed approach greatly outperforms existing studies in terms of the total spacing cost, the total displacement, and runtime.
