This paper proposes an efficient verification and debugging method for arithmetic divider circuits. The technique involves setting select signals to some predefined constants in order to reduce the design to easily verifiable circuit components. These components are then verified using logic equivalence checking and SAT tools. An important feature of the proposed approach is that it naturally enables debugging by identifying and localizing bugs through proper selection of accessible signals. This method can verify and debug large restoring dividers within single minutes using synthesis and verification tools, such as ABC. The general debugging concept proposed here is applicable to both the restoring and non-restoring dividers. To the best of our knowledge the proposed debugging capability is not offered by any of the existing verification tools.
