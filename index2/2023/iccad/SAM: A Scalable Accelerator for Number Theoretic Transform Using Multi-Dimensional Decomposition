With an increasing focus on data security in today's computer systems, homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs are becoming widely used tools in privacy-preserving computing. Number theoretic transform (NTT) is a key primitive that dominates the performance of these algorithms, and thus becomes an attractive target for domain-specific acceleration. Prior NTT accelerators mostly support only fixed and small NTT sizes, which are insufficient for the diverse parameter requirements of different cryptographic algorithms and applications. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based, scalable NTT accelerator that uses multi-dimensional decomposition to efficiently support various NTT sizes. The hardware uses a limited and fixed amount of compute and storage resources on-chip. An arbitrary-sized NTT task is decomposed into fixed-sized small NTT kernels that match the on-chip hardware and thus execute with high efficiency. We further incorporate techniques to optimize both off-chip and on-chip data transfers under such complicated decomposed execution. Overall, our accelerator balances between on-chip compute throughput and off-chip memory bandwidth. It can flexibly scale to very large NTT tasks, and outperforms prior FPGA-based NTT accelerators by over 2Ã— at these large sizes.
