Ordered escape routing is a critical stage for printed circuit board design. State-of-the-art solutions to ordered escape routing are either heuristic and non-optimal, or trapped in exponential time complexity. In this work, for the first time, we prove that ordered escape routing is not only NP-hard, but also hard to approximate in polynomial time, indicating the limitation of optimal algorithms. We further present NeuroEscape, an efficient ordered escape routing method, which is based on reinforcement learning with a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and heuristic rollouts for design space exploration. A neural policy model is incorporated to further enhance the MCTS process. Theoretical results show that the number of samples required to train the model is upper bounded by a polynomial. Experimental results show that NeuroEscape solves 69% more testcases, with an average acceleration of 19.4x compared with state-of-the-art methods.
