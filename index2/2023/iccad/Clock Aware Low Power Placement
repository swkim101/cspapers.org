In modern VLSI design, more than 30% of power consumption is caused by clock networks due to their large capacitance demand and high switching frequency. Prior research on clock power optimization primarily focuses on improving the routing and synthesis processes, where the planning flexibility is restricted by the placed registers. In this paper, we develop a novel co-optimization framework to conduct analytic placement and clock tree synthesis simultaneously. A numerical engine is proposed to balance the power demand between clock and regular signal networks by effectively and efficiently updating the clock tree topology, generating the network synthesis solution, and aligning it with the placement objective using the ePlace infrastructure. The experimental results validate the high performance of our proposed algorithm on all eight CLKISPD05 benchmarks, achieving a 45.1% reduction in clock-net wirelength and a 12.7% reduction in total switching power compared to RePlAce. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art clock aware placement algorithm SimPL+Lopper, achieving a 25% reduction in clock-net wirelength and a 10.5% reduction in total switching power.
