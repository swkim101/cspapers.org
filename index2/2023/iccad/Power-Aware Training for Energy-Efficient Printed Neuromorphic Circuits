There is an increasing demand for next-generation flexible electronics in emerging low-cost applications such as smart packaging and smart bandages, where conventional silicon electronics cannot enter due to cost and form factor. In these domains, ultra-low-cost, high flexibility, and customizability are required. In this regard, printed electronics emerge as a complementary solution offering the aforementioned properties. To respect the constraints in those application scenarios and equip printed devices with the fundamental capability to process information, analog printed neuromorphic circuits offer multiple advantages, including strong expressiveness, streamlined circuit primitives, and a highly efficient machine learning-based design process. In this work, we focus on designing low-power printed neuromorphic circuits at the algorithmic level. By developing accurate power models for the circuit primitives, the power consumption can be considered into the design process. Subsequently, Pareto analysis is employed to examine the relationship between accuracy and power consumption. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed approach, 2 x reduction of the power consumption can be realized while maintaining 95 % of classification accuracy. This approach has significant implications for the future development of energy-efficient printed neuromorphic circuits and their potential applications in IoT and AI intersections.
