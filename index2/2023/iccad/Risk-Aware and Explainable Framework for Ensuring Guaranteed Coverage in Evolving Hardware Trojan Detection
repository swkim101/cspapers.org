As the semiconductor industry has shifted to a fabless paradigm, the risk of hardware Trojans being inserted at various stages of production has also increased. Recently, there has been a growing trend toward the use of machine learning solutions to detect hardware Trojans more effectively, with a focus on the accuracy of the model as an evaluation metric. However, in a high-risk and sensitive domain, we cannot accept even a small misclassification. Additionally, it is unrealistic to expect an ideal model, especially when Trojans evolve over time. Therefore, we need metrics to assess the trustworthiness of detected Trojans and a mechanism to simulate unseen ones. In this paper, we generate evolving hardware Trojans using our proposed novel conformalized generative adversarial networks and offer an efficient approach to detecting them based on a non-invasive algorithm-agnostic statistical inference framework that leverages the Mondrian conformal predictor. The method acts like a wrapper over any of the machine learning models and produces set predictions along with uncertainty quantification for each new detected Trojan for more robust decision-making. In the case of a NULL set, a novel method to reject the decision by providing a calibrated explainability is discussed. The proposed approach has been validated on both synthetic and real chip-level benchmarks and proven to pave the way for researchers looking to find informed machine learning solutions to hardware security problems.
