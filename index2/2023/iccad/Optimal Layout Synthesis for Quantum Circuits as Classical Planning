In Layout Synthesis, the logical qubits of a quantum circuit are mapped to the physical qubits of a given quantum hardware platform, taking into account the connectivity of physical qubits. This involves inserting SWAP gates before an operation is applied on distant qubits. Optimal Layout Synthesis is crucial for practical Quantum Computing on current error-prone hardware: Minimizing the number of SWAP gates directly mitigates the error rates when running quantum circuits. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed for minimizing the required SWAP insertions. The proposed exact approaches can only scale to a small number of qubits. In this paper, we provide two encodings for Optimal Layout Synthesis as a classical planning problem. We use optimal classical planners to synthesize the optimal layout for a standard set of benchmarks. Our results show the scalability of our approach compared to previous leading approaches. We can optimally map circuits with 9 qubits onto a 14 qubit platform, which could not be handled before by exact methods.
