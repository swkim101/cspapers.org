Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) are a promising solution to accelerate applications from several domains, thanks to their balance between the performance achieved through specialization and the adaptability to obtain different computational patterns through dynamic reconfiguration. Several state-of-the-art CGRA designs try to further exploit domain specialization by integrating additional specialized functional units to support custom numeric formats and/or vector functional units. While this approach can improve performance and efficiency for kernels coming from a single application domain, it lowers the overall utilization of the hardware resources and reduces the adaptability of the accelerator. This paper proposes VecPAC - a vectorizable and precision-aware coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) design. Vec-PAC integrates CGRA tiles with scalar functional units and specialized tiles with vector functional units that can trade off the number of vector lanes for the accuracy of the computation. We discuss the architecture design and present the related compilation framework. The experimental evaluation on a set of applications from three different domains (embedded, machine learning, and high-performance computing) shows that the hybrid design of VecPAC outperforms CGRAs with only scalar functional units by 1.48 ×, while providing higher scalability (evaluated on 2×2, 4×4, and 8×8). Moreover, VecPAC achieves better area-efficiency (1.74×) over a CGRA with only vector functional units.
