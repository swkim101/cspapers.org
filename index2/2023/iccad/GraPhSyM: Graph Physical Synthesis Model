In this work, we introduce GraPhSyM, a Graph Attention Network (GATv2) model for fast and accurate estimation of post-physical synthesis circuit delay and area metrics from pre-physical synthesis circuit netlists. Once trained, GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA stages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis flow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift and precise feedback provided by GraPhSym is instrumental for machine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure, connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing. When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on. The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for advanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning frameworks.
