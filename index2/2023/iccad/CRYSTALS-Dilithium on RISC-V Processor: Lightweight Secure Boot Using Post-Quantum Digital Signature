With the ongoing efforts for transitioning towards post-quantum security, NIST has recently selected the digital signature algorithm CRYSTALS-Dilithium for standardization. In this work, we demonstrate the first Dilithium based hardware accelerated secure boot architecture developed around Ariane, an open-source RISC- V core. By utilizing a compact design with novel verification engine, a secure boot flow is implemented with only 3.48ms runtime overhead compared to normal boot, while requiring 10.4K LUTs and 5.7K FFs on an FPGA. Compared to the state-of-the-art we achieve a reduction of 3.42× and 7.88 × for LUTs and FFs respectively. Also, the design when realized in 65nm ASIC requires only 125 kGE and 6.3 mW power at 100 MHz. Further, as secure boot is one of the critical processes and the security of the whole system depends on it, we implemented hardware fault countermeasures and evaluated their effectiveness in preventing secure boot bypass.
