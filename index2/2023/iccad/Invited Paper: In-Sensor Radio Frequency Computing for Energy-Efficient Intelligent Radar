Radio Frequency Neural Networks (RFNNs) have demonstrated advantages in realizing intelligent applications across various domains. However, as the model size of deep neural networks rapidly increases, implementing large-scale RFNN in practice requires an extensive number of RF interferometers and consumes a substantial amount of energy. To address this challenge, we propose to utilize low-rank decomposition to transform a large-scale RFNN into a compact RFNN while almost preserving its accuracy. Specifically, we develop a Tensor-Train RFNN (TT-RFNN) where each layer comprises a sequence of low-rank third-order tensors, leading to a notable reduction in parameter count, thereby optimizing RF interferometer utilization in comparison to the original large-scale RFNN. Additionally, considering the inherent physical errors when mapping TT-RFNN to RF device parameters in real-world deployment, from a general perspective, we construct the Robust TT-RFNN (RTT-RFNN) by incorporating a robustness solver on TT-RFNN to enhance its robustness. To adapt the RTT-RFNN to varying requirements of reshaping operations, we further provide a reconfigurable reshaping solution employing RF switch matrices. Empirical evaluations conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.
