With the rapid evolution of the Internet of Things, many real-world applications utilize heterogeneously connected sensors to capture time-series information. Edge-based machine learning (ML) methodologies are often employed to analyze locally collected data. However, a fundamental issue across data-driven ML approaches is distribution shift. It occurs when a model is deployed on a data distribution different from what it was trained on, and can substantially degrade model performance. Additionally, increasingly sophisticated deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-sensor time series data, requiring intensive computational resources beyond the capacity of today's edge devices. While brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has been introduced as a lightweight solution for edge-based learning, existing HDCs are also vulnerable to the distribution shift challenge. In this paper, we propose DOMINO, a novel HDC learning framework addressing the distribution shift problem in noisy multi-sensor time-series data. DOMINO leverages efficient and parallel matrix operations on high-dimensional space to dynamically identify and filter out domain-variant dimensions. Our evaluation on a wide range of multi-sensor time series classification tasks shows that DOMINO achieves on average 2.04% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNN-based domain generalization techniques, and delivers $16.34\times$ faster training and $2.89\times$ faster inference. More importantly, DOMINO exhibits notably better performance when learning from partially labeled data and highly imbalanced data, and provides $10.93\times$ higher robustness against hardware noises than SOTA DNNs.
