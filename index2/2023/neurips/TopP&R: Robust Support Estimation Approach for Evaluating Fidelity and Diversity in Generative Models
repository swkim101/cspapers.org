We introduced a brand-new member of the family that is going to be referred to as the New Power Topp-Leone Generated (NPTL-G). This new member is one of a kind. Given the major functions that created this new member, important mathematical aspects are discussed in as much detail as possible. We derived some functions for the new one, included the RÃ©nyi entropy, the qf, series development, and moment weighted probabilities. Moreover, to estimate the values of the parameters of our model that were not known, we employed the maximum likelihood technique. In addition, two actual datasets from the real world were investigated in order to bring attention to the possible applications of this novel distribution. This new model performs better than three key rivals based on the measurements that were collected.
