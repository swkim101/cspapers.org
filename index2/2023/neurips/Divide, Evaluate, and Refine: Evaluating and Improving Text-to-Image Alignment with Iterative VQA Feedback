The field of text-conditioned image generation has made unparalleled progress with the recent advent of latent diffusion models. While remarkable, as the complexity of given text input increases, the state-of-the-art diffusion models may still fail in generating images which accurately convey the semantics of the given prompt. Furthermore, it has been observed that such misalignments are often left undetected by pretrained multi-modal models such as CLIP. To address these problems, in this paper we explore a simple yet effective decompositional approach towards both evaluation and improvement of text-to-image alignment. In particular, we first introduce a Decompositional-Alignment-Score which given a complex prompt decomposes it into a set of disjoint assertions. The alignment of each assertion with generated images is then measured using a VQA model. Finally, alignment scores for different assertions are combined aposteriori to give the final text-to-image alignment score. Experimental analysis reveals that the proposed alignment metric shows significantly higher correlation with human ratings as opposed to traditional CLIP, BLIP scores. Furthermore, we also find that the assertion level alignment scores provide a useful feedback which can then be used in a simple iterative procedure to gradually increase the expression of different assertions in the final image outputs. Human user studies indicate that the proposed approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 8.7% in overall text-to-image alignment accuracy.
