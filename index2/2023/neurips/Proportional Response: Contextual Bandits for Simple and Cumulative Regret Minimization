Simple regret minimization is a critical problem in learning optimal treatment assignment policies across various domains, including healthcare and e-commerce. However, it remains understudied in the contextual bandit setting. We propose a new family of computationally efficient bandit algorithms for the stochastic contextual bandit settings, with the flexibility to be adapted for cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings. These advantages come from constructing and relying on"conformal arm sets"(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't achieve instance-dependent simple regret guarantees while simultaneously achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret guarantees.
