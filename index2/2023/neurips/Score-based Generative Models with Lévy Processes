Time reversibility of stochastic processes is a primary cornerstone of the score-based generative models through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). While a broader class of Markov processes is reversible, previous continuous-time approaches restrict the range of noise processes to Brownian motion (BM) since the closed form of the time reversal formula is only known for diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose a class of score-based probabilistic generative models, Lévy-It ¯ o Model (LIM), which utilizes d-dimensional α -stable distribution with independent components for noise injection. To this end, we derive an exact time reversal formula for the SDEs with Lévy processes that can allow discontinuous pure jump motion. Consequently, we advance the score-based generative models with a broad range of non-Gaussian Markov processes. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ show that our approach is valid.
