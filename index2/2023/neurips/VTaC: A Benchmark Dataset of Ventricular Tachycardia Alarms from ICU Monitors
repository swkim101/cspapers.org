False arrhythmia alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) are a continuing problem despite considerable effort from industrial and academic algorithm developers. Of all life-threatening arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia (VT) stands out as the most challenging arrhythmia to detect reliably. We introduce a new annotated VT alarm database, VTaC ( V entricular T achycardia annotated a larms from I C Us) consisting of over 5,000 waveform recordings with VT alarms triggered by bedside monitors in the ICUs. Each VT alarm in the dataset has been labeled by at least two independent human expert annotators. The dataset encompasses data collected from ICUs in three major US hospitals and includes data from three leading bedside monitor manufacturers, providing a diverse and representative collection of alarm waveform data. Each waveform recording comprises at least two electrocardiogram (ECG) leads and one or more pulsatile waveforms, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG or PLETH) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms. We demonstrate the utility of this new benchmark dataset for the task of false arrhythmia alarm reduction, and present performance of multiple machine learning approaches, including conventional supervised machine learning, deep learning, contrastive learning and generative approaches for the task of VT false alarm reduction.
