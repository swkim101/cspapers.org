Interacting particle systems have proven highly successful in various machine learning tasks, including approximate Bayesian inference and neural network optimization. However, the analysis of these systems often relies on the simplifying assumption of the mean-ﬁeld limit, where particle numbers approach inﬁnity and inﬁnitesimal step sizes are used. In practice, discrete time steps, ﬁnite particle numbers, and complex integration schemes are employed, creating a theoretical gap between continuous-time and discrete-time processes. In this paper, we present a novel framework that establishes a precise connection between these discrete-time schemes and their corresponding mean-ﬁeld limits in terms of convergence properties and asymptotic behavior. By adopting a dynamical system perspective, our framework seamlessly integrates various numerical schemes that are typically analyzed independently. For example, our framework provides a uniﬁed treatment of optimizing an inﬁnite-width two-layer neural network and sampling via Stein Variational Gradient descent, which were previously studied in isolation.
