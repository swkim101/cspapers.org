We study the problem of counting the number of distinct elements in a dataset subject to the constraint of differential privacy. We consider the challenging setting of person-level DP (a.k.a. user-level DP) where each person may contribute an unbounded number of items and hence the sensitivity is unbounded. Our approach is to compute a bounded-sensitivity version of this query, which reduces to solving a max-flow problem. The sensitivity bound is optimized to balance the noise we must add to privatize the answer against the error of the approximation of the bounded-sensitivity query to the true number of unique elements.
