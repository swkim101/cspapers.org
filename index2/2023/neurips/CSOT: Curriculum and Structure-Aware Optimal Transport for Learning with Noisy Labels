Learning with noisy labels (LNL) poses a significant challenge in training a well-generalized model while avoiding overfitting to corrupted labels. Recent advances have achieved impressive performance by identifying clean labels and correcting corrupted labels for training. However, the current approaches rely heavily on the model's predictions and evaluate each sample independently without considering either the global and local structure of the sample distribution. These limitations typically result in a suboptimal solution for the identification and correction processes, which eventually leads to models overfitting to incorrect labels. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal transport (OT) formulation, called Curriculum and Structure-aware Optimal Transport (CSOT). CSOT concurrently considers the inter- and intra-distribution structure of the samples to construct a robust denoising and relabeling allocator. During the training process, the allocator incrementally assigns reliable labels to a fraction of the samples with the highest confidence. These labels have both global discriminability and local coherence. Notably, CSOT is a new OT formulation with a nonconvex objective function and curriculum constraints, so it is not directly compatible with classical OT solvers. Here, we develop a lightspeed computational method that involves a scaling iteration within a generalized conditional gradient framework to solve CSOT efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over the current state-of-the-arts in LNL. Code is available at https://github.com/changwxx/CSOT-for-LNL.
