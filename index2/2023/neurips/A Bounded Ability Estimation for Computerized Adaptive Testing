Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), as a tool that can efﬁciently measure student’s ability, has been widely used in various standardized tests (e.g., GMAT and GRE). The adaptivity of CAT refers to the selection of the most informative questions for each student, reducing test length. Existing CAT methods do not explicitly target ability estimation accuracy since there is no student’s true ability as ground truth; therefore, these methods cannot be guaranteed to make the estimate converge to the true with such limited responses. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of estimation and ﬁnd a theoretical approximation of the true ability: the ability estimated by full responses to question bank. Based on this, a Bounded Ability Estimation framework for CAT (BECAT) is proposed in a data-summary manner, which selects a question subset that closely matches the gradient of the full responses. Thus, we develop an expected gradient difference approximation to design a simple greedy selection algorithm, and show the rigorous theoretical and error upper-bound guarantees of its ability estimate. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, show that it can reach the same estimation accuracy using 15% less questions on average, signiﬁcantly reducing test length.
