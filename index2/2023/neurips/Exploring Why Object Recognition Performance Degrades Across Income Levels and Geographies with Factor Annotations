Despite impressive advances in object-recognition, deep learning systems’ performance degrades significantly across geographies and lower income levels—raising pressing concerns of inequity. Addressing such performance gaps remains a challenge, as little is understood about why performance degrades across incomes or geographies. We take a step in this direction by annotating images from Dollar Street, a popular benchmark of geographically and economically diverse images, labeling each image with factors such as color, shape, and background. These annotations unlock a new granular view into how objects differ across incomes/regions. We then use these object differences to pinpoint model vulnerabilities across in-comes and regions. We study a range of modern vision models, finding that performance disparities are most associated with differences in texture, occlusion , and images with darker lighting . We illustrate how insights from our factor labels can surface mitigations to improve models’ performance disparities. As an example, we show that mitigating a model’s vulnerability to texture can improve performance on the lower income level. We release all the factor annotations along with an interactive dashboard to facilitate research into more equitable vision systems .
