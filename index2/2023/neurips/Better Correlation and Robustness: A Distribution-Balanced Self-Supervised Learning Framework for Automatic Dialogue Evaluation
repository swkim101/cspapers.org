Turn-level dialogue evaluation models (TDEMs), using self-supervised learning (SSL) framework, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in open-domain dialogue evaluation. However, these models inevitably face two potential problems. First, they have low correlations with humans on medium coherence samples as the SSL framework often brings training data with unbalanced coherence distribution. Second, the SSL framework leads TDEM to nonuniform score distribution. There is a danger that the nonuniform score distribution will weaken the robustness of TDEM through our theoretical analysis. To tackle these problems, we propose B etter C orrelation and R obustness (BCR), a distribution-balanced self-supervised learning framework for TDEM. Given a dialogue dataset, BCR offers an effective training set reconstructing method to provide coherence-balanced training signals and further facilitate balanced evaluating abilities of TDEM. To get a uniform score distribution, a novel loss function is proposed, which can adjust adaptively according to the uniformity of score distribution estimated by kernel density estimation. Comprehensive experiments on 17 benchmark datasets show that vanilla BERT-base using BCR outperforms SOTA methods significantly by 11.3% on average. BCR also demonstrates strong generalization ability as it can lead multiple SOTA methods to attain better correlation and robustness.
