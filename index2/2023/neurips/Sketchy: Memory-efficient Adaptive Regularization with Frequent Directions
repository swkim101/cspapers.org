Adaptive regularization methods that exploit more than the diagonal entries exhibit state of the art performance for many tasks, but can be prohibitive in terms of memory and running time. We find the spectra of the Kronecker-factored gradient covariance matrix in deep learning (DL) training tasks are concentrated on a small leading eigenspace that changes throughout training, motivating a low-rank sketching approach. We describe a generic method for reducing memory and compute requirements of maintaining a matrix preconditioner using the Frequent Directions (FD) sketch. While previous approaches have explored applying FD for second-order optimization, we present a novel analysis which allows efficient interpolation between resource requirements and the degradation in regret guarantees with rank $k$: in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting over dimension $d$, we match full-matrix $d^2$ memory regret using only $dk$ memory up to additive error in the bottom $d-k$ eigenvalues of the gradient covariance. Further, we show extensions of our work to Shampoo, resulting in a method competitive in quality with Shampoo and Adam, yet requiring only sub-linear memory for tracking second moments.
