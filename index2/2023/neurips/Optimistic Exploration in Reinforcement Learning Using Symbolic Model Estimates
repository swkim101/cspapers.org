There has been an increasing interest in using symbolic models along with reinforcement learning (RL) problems, where these coarser abstract models are used as a way to provide RL agents with higher level guidance. However, most of these works are inherently limited by their assumption of having an access to a symbolic approximation of the underlying problem. To address this issue, we introduce a new method for learning optimistic symbolic approximations of the underlying world model. We will see how these representations, coupled with fast diverse planners developed by the automated planning community, provide us with a new paradigm for optimistic exploration in sparse reward settings. We investigate the possibility of speeding up the learning process by generalizing learned model dynamics across similar actions with minimal human input. Finally, we evaluate the method, by testing it on multiple benchmark domains and compare it with other RL strategies.
