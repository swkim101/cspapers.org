Compositionality facilitates the comprehension of novel objects using acquired concepts and the maintenance of a knowledge pool. This is particularly crucial for continual learners to prevent catastrophic forgetting and enable compositionally forward transfer of knowledge. However, the existing state-of-the-art benchmarks inadequately evaluate the capability of compositional generalization, leaving an intriguing question unanswered. To comprehensively assess this capability, we introduce two vision benchmarks, namely Compositional GQA (CGQA) and Compositional OBJects365 (COBJ), along with a novel evaluation framework called Compositional Few-Shot Testing (CFST). These benchmarks evaluate the system-aticity, productivity , and substitutivity aspects of compositional generalization. Experimental results on five baselines and two modularity-based methods demonstrate that current continual learning techniques do exhibit somewhat favorable compositionality in their learned feature extractors. Nonetheless, further efforts are required in developing modularity-based approaches to enhance compositional generalization. We anticipate that our proposed benchmarks and evaluation protocol will foster research on continual learning and compositionality.
