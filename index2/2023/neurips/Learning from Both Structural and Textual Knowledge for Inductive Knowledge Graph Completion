Learning rule-based systems plays a pivotal role in knowledge graph completion (KGC). Existing rule-based systems restrict the input of the system to structural knowledge only, which may omit some useful knowledge for reasoning, e.g., textual knowledge. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework that imposes both structural and textual knowledge to learn rule-based systems. In the first stage, we compute a set of triples with confidence scores (called soft triples ) from a text corpus by distant supervision, where a textual entailment model with multi-instance learning is exploited to estimate whether a given triple is entailed by a set of sentences. In the second stage, these soft triples are used to learn a rule-based model for KGC. To mitigate the negative impact of noise from soft triples, we propose a new formalism for rules to be learnt, named text enhanced rules or TE-rules for short. To effectively learn TE-rules, we propose a neural model that simulates the inference of TE-rules. We theoretically show that any set of TE-rules can always be interpreted by a certain parameter assignment of the neural model. We introduce three new datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of soft triples and TE-rules results in significant performance improvements in inductive link prediction.
