We consider the problem of navigating in a Markov decision process where extrinsic rewards are either absent or ignored. In this setting, the objective is to learn policies to reach all the states that are reachable within a given number of steps (in expectation) from a starting state. We introduce a novel meta-algorithm which can use any online reinforcement learning algorithm (with appropriate regret guarantees) as a black-box. Our algorithm demonstrates a method for transforming the output of online algorithms to a batch setting. We prove an upper bound on the sample complexity of our algorithm in terms of the regret bound of the used black-box RL algorithm. Furthermore, we provide experimental results to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm and correctness of our theoretical results.
