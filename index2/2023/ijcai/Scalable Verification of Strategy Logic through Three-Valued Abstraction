The model checking problem for multi-agent systems against Strategy Logic specifications is known to be non-elementary. On this logic several fragments have been defined to tackle this issue but at the expense of expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a three-valued semantics for Strategy Logic upon which we define an abstraction method. We show that the latter semantics is an approximation of the classic two-valued one for Strategy Logic. Furthermore, we extend MCMAS, an open-source model checker for multi-agent specifications, to incorporate our abstraction method and present some promising experimental results.
