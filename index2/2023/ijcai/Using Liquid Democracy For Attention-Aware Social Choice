My PhD research deals with the use of Liquid Democracy (LD) for social choice scenarios, while considering the scarcity of attention as a driving factor. My aim is to better understand LD: theoretically as well as practically; in particular, by establishing containment in certain computational classes for corresponding combinatorial problems, suggesting methods to improve the use of LD, and understand its adaptation to specific scenarios. Concretely, I consider the use of LD as a solution for the problem of low voter attention in light of the high cognitive effort needed by voters to actively participate in voting processes.
