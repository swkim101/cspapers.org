Finding top-K frequent items has been a hot topic in data stream processing in recent years, which has a wide range of applications. However, most of existing sketch algorithms focuses on finding local top-K in a single data stream. In this paper, we work on finding global top-K in multiple disjoint data streams. We find that directly deploying prior sketch algorithms is often unfair under global scenarios, which will degrade the accuracy of global top-K. We define top-K-fairness and show that it is important for finding global top-K. To achieve top-K-fairness, we propose a new sketch framework, called the Double-Anonymous sketch. The process of finding global top-K items is similar to that of paper reviewing and democratic elections. In these scenarios, double-anonymity is often an effective strategy to achieve top-K-fairness. We also propose two techniques, hot panning, and early freezing, to further improve the accuracy. We theoretically prove that the Double-Anonymous sketch achieves top-K-fairnesswhile keeping high accuracy. We perform extensive experiments to verify top-K-fairness in the scenario of disjoint data streams. The experimental results show that the Double-Anonymous sketch's error is up to 129 times (60 times on average) smaller than the state-of-the-art.
