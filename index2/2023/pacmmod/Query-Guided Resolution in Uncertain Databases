We present a novel framework for uncertain data management. We start with a database whose tuple correctness is uncertain and an oracle that can resolve the uncertainty, i.e., decide if a tuple is correct or not. Such an oracle may correspond, e.g., to a data expert or to a crowdsourcing platform. We wish to use the oracle to clean the database with the goal of ensuring the correct answer for specific mission-critical queries. To avoid the prohibitive cost of cleaning the entire database and to minimize the expected number of calls to the oracle, we must carefully select tuples whose resolution would suffice to resolve the uncertainty in query results. In other words, we need a query-guided process for the resolution of uncertain data. We develop an end-to-end solution to this problem, based on the derivation of query answers and on correctness probabilities for the uncertain data. At a high level, we first track Boolean provenance to identify which input tuples contribute to the derivation of each output tuple, and in what ways. We then design an active learning solution for iteratively choosing tuples to resolve, based on the provenance structure and on an evolving estimation of tuple correctness probabilities. We conduct an extensive experimental study to validate our framework in different use cases.
