Missing data imputation for location-based sensor data has attracted much attention in recent years. The state-of-the-art imputation methods based on graph neural networks have a priori assumption that the spatial correlations between sensor locations are static. However, real-world data sets often exhibit dynamic spatial correlations. This paper proposes a novel approach to capturing the dynamics of spatial correlations between geographical locations as a composition of the constant, long-term trends and periodic patterns. To this end, we design a new method called Dynamic Adjacency Matrix Representation (DAMR) that extracts various dynamic patterns of spatial correlations and represents them as adjacency matrices. The adjacency matrices are then aggregated and fed into a well-designed graph representation learning layer for predicting the missing values. Through extensive experiments on six real-world data sets, we demonstrate that DAMR reduces the MAE by up to 19.4% compared with the state-of-the-art methods for the missing value imputation task
