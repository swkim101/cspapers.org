Complex event processing (CEP) detects situations of interest by evaluating queries over event streams. Once CEP is used in networked applications, the distribution of query evaluation among the event sources enables performance optimization. Instead of collecting all events at one location for query evaluation, sub-queries are placed at network nodes to reduce the data transmission overhead. Yet, existing techniques either place such sub-queries at exactly one node in the network, which neglects the benefits of truly distributed evaluation, or are agnostic to the network structure, which ignores transmission costs due to the absence of direct network links. To overcome the above limitations, we propose INEV graphs for in-network evaluation of CEP queries with rich semantics, including Kleene closure and negation. Our idea is to introduce fine-granular routing of partial results of sub-queries as an additional degree of freedom in query evaluation: We exploit events already disseminated in the network as part of one sub-query, when evaluating another one. We show how to instantiate INEv graphs by splitting a query workload into sub-queries, placing them at network nodes, and forwarding of their results to other nodes. Also, we characterize INEv graphs that guarantee correct and complete query evaluation, and discuss their construction based on a cost model that unifies transmission and processing latency. Our experimental results indicate that INEv graphs can reduce transmission costs for distributed CEP by up to eight orders of magnitude compared to baseline strategies.
