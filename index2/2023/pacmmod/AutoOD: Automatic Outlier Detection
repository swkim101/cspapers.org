Outlier detection is critical in real world. Due to the existence of many outlier detection techniques which often return different results for the same data set, the users have to address the problem of determining which among these techniques is the best suited for their task and tune its parameters. This is particularly challenging in the unsupervised setting, where no labels are available for cross-validation needed for such method and parameter optimization. In this work, we propose AutoOD which uses the existing unsupervised detection techniques to automatically produce high quality outliers without any human tuning. AutoOD's fundamentally new strategy unifies the merits of unsupervised outlier detection and supervised classification within one integrated solution. It automatically tests a diverse set of unsupervised outlier detectors on a target data set, extracts useful signals from their combined detection results to reliably capture key differences between outliers and inliers. It then uses these signals to produce a "custom outlier classifier" to classify outliers, with its accuracy comparable to supervised outlier classification models trained with ground truth labels - without having access to the much needed labels. On a diverse set of benchmark outlier detection datasets, AutoOD consistently outperforms the best unsupervised outlier detector selected from hundreds of detectors. It also outperforms other tuning-free approaches from 12 to 97 points (out of 100) in the F-1 score.
