We are excited to introduce this new issue of PACMMOD (Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data). PACMMOD is a new journal, concerned with the principles, algorithms, techniques, systems, and applications of database management systems, data management technology, and science and engineering of data. It includes articles reporting cutting-edge data management, data engineering, and data science research. Articles published at PACMMOD address data challenges at various stages of the data lifecycle, from modeling, acquisition, cleaning, integration, indexing, querying, analysis, exploration, visualization, interpretation, and explanation. They focus on dataintensive components of data pipelines, and solve problems in areas of interest to our community (e.g., data curation, optimization, performance, storage, systems), operating within accuracy, privacy, fairness, and diversity constraints. Articles reporting deployed systems and solutions to data science pipelines and/or fundamental experiences and insights from evaluating real-world data engineering problems are especially encouraged.
