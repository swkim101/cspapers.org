In this paper, for the first time, we introduce the concepts of window-CCs and window-SCCs on undirected and directed temporal graphs, respectively. We then study the queries of window-CC and window-SCC by developing several efficient index-based query solutions. The space costs of the best indices are linear to the sizes of the temporal graphs. The extensive experimental evaluation on 12 real-world datasets demonstrates the high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solutions. In the future, we will develop distributed index construction algorithms, which would be useful for very large temporal graphs containing billions of edges. In the future, we will implement our algorithms by using a distributed computing platform (e.g., Pregel), which would be very useful when the temporal graph is too large to be kept by a single machine.
