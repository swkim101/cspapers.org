The bumps and dips in data streams are valuable patterns for data mining and networking scenarios such as online advertising and botnet detection. In this paper, we define the wave, a data stream pattern with a serious deviation from the stable arrival rate for a period of time. We then propose Pontus, an efficient framework for wave detection and estimation. In Pontus, a lightweight data structure is utilized for the preliminary processing of incoming packets in the data plane to take advantage of its high processing speed; then, the powerful control plane carries out computationally intensive wave detection and estimation. In particular, we propose the Multi-Stage Progressive Tracking strategy which detects waves in stages and removes any disqualified items promptly to save memory. Hash collisions are addressed by a Stage Variance Maximization technique to reduce estimation error. Moreover, we prove the theoretical error bound and establish upper bounds of false positive and false negative. Experiment results show that the software version of Pontus can achieve around 97% F1-Score even under scarce memory when baselines fail. Furthermore, the implemented prototype of Pontus based on P4 achieves 842x higher throughput than the baseline strawman solution.
