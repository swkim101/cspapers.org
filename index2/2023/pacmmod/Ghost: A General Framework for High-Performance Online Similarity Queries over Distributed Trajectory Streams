Trajectory similarity queries, including similarity search and similarity join, offer a foundation for many geo-spatial applications. With the rapid increase of streaming trajectory data volumes, e.g., data from mobile phones, vessel monitoring, or traffic systems, many location-based services benefit from online similarity analytics over trajectory data streams, where moving objects continually emit real-time position data. However, most existing studies focus on offline settings, and thus several major challenges remain unanswered in an online setting. To this end, we describe Ghost, a distributed stream processing framework that enables generic, efficient, and scalable online trajectory similarity search and join. We propose a novel incremental online similarity computation (IOSC) mechanism to accelerate pair-wise streaming trajectory distance calculation, which supports a broad range of trajectory distance metrics. Compared with previous studies, IOSC reduces the complexity from quadratic to linear in terms of trajectory length. Building on this foundation, we propose histogram-based algorithms that exploit histogram indexes and a series of pruning bounds to enable streaming trajectory similarity search and join. Finally, we extend our methods to the distributed platform Flink for scalability, where a CostPartitioner is developed to ensure parallel processing and workload balancing. An experimental study using two real-life and one synthetic datasets shows that Ghost (i) acquires 6-20× efficiency/throughput gains and one order of magnitude memory overhead savings over state-of-the-art baselines, (ii) achieves 3--8× workload balancing gains on Flink, and (iii) exhibits low parameter sensitivity and high robustness.
