Graph neural networks have been widely used to learn node representations for many real-world static graphs. In general, they learn node representations by recursively aggregating information from neighbors. However, graphs in many applications are dynamic, evolving with continuous graph events, such as node feature and graph structure updates. These events require the node representations to be updated accordingly. Currently, due to the real-time requirement, how to efficiently and reliably update node representations under continuous graph events is still an open problem. Recent studies propose two solutions to partially address this problem, but their performance is still limited. First, local-based GNNs only update the nodes directly involved in events, suffering from the quality-deficit issue, since they neglect the other nodes affected by these events. Second, neighbor-sampling GNNs propose to sample neighbors to accelerate neighbor aggregation computations, encountering the neighbor-redundant issue. These sampled neighbors may be similar and cannot reflect the distribution of all neighbors, leading that node representations aggregated on these redundant neighbors may differ from those aggregated on all neighbors. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable graph neural network, namely EARLY, to update node representations for dynamic graphs. We first identify the top-k influential nodes that are most affected by graph events. Then, to sample neighbors diversely, we propose a diversity-aware layer-wise sampling technique. We theoretically demonstrate that this technique can decrease the sampling expectation error and learn more reliable node representations. Therefore, the top-k nodes selection and diversity-aware sampling enable EARLY to efficiently update node representations in a reliable way. Extensive experiments on the five real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed EARLY.
