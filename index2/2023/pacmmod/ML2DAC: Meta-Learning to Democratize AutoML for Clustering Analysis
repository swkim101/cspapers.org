Analysts often struggle with the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem, a.k.a. CASH problem in literature. Typically, they execute several algorithms with varying hyperparameter settings to find configurations that show valuable results. Efficiently finding these configurations is a major challenge. In clustering analyses, analysts face the additional challenge to select a cluster validity index that allows them to evaluate clustering results in a purely unsupervised fashion. Many different cluster validity indices exist and each one has its benefits depending on the dataset characteristics. While experienced analysts might address these challenges using their domain knowledge and experience, especially novice analysts struggle with them. In this paper, we propose a new meta-learning approach to address these challenges. Our approach uses knowledge from past clustering evaluations to apply strategies that experienced analysts would exploit. In particular, we use meta-learning to (a) select a suitable clustering validity index, (b) efficiently select well-performing clustering algorithm and hyperparameter configurations, and (c) reduce the search space to suitable clustering algorithms. In the evaluation, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches regarding accuracy and runtime.
