Cloud-native databases have become the de-facto choice for mission-critical applications on the cloud due to the need for high availability, resource elasticity, and cost efficiency. Meanwhile, driven by the increasing connectivity between data generation and analysis, users prefer a single database to efficiently process both OLTP and OLAP workloads, which enhances data freshness and reduces the complexity of data synchronization and the overall business cost. In this paper, we summarize five crucial design goals for a cloud-native HTAP database based on our experience and customers' feedback, i.e., transparency, competitive OLAP performance, minimal perturbation on OLTP workloads, high data freshness, and excellent resource elasticity. As our solution to realize these goals, we present PolarDB-IMCI, a cloud-native HTAP database system designed and deployed at Alibaba Cloud. Our evaluation results show that PolarDB-IMCI is able to handle HTAP efficiently on both experimental and production workloads; notably, it speeds up analytical queries up to Ã—149 on TPC-H (100GB). PolarDB-IMCI introduces low visibility delay and little performance perturbation on OLTP workloads (<5%), and resource elasticity can be achieved by scaling out in tens of seconds.
