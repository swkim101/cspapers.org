Geo-textual objects with both geographical location and textual description are gaining in prevalence. Over the past decades, substantial research has been conducted on spatial keyword queries, which integrate location into keyword-based querying of geo-textual content. However, existing proposals mostly focus on efficiency for processing spatial keyword queries, and little effort was made to address the effectiveness perspectives. In this work, using two datasets with ground truth query results, we evaluate the effectiveness of standard spatial keyword queries. Our evaluation results show that the TkQ query that ranks objects by a weighted combination of spatial proximity and text relevance is the most effective. Motivated by the finding, we propose a Deep relevance with Weight learning (DrW) model to further improve the effectiveness of the retrieval ranking. DrW is featured with two novel ideas: First, we propose a neural network architecture to learn the text relevance matching over the local interaction between the query and geo-textual objects. Second, we find that a query-dependent weight to balance text relevance and spatial proximity in ranking can improve effectiveness, and we develop a learning-based method to learn the query-dependent weight. Experimental results reveal that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 32.15%, 32.34%, and 33.00% in terms of NDCG@3, NDCG@5, and MRR.
