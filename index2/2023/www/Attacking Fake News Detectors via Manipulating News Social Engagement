Social media is one of the main sources for news consumption, especially among the younger generation. With the increasing popularity of news consumption on various social media platforms, there has been a surge of misinformation which includes false information or unfounded claims. As various text- and social context-based fake news detectors are proposed to detect misinformation on social media, recent works start to focus on the vulnerabilities of fake news detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack framework against Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors to probe their robustness. Specifically, we leverage a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to simulate the adversarial behavior of fraudsters on social media. Research has shown that in real-world settings, fraudsters coordinate with each other to share different news in order to evade the detection of fake news detectors. Therefore, we modeled our MARL framework as a Markov Game with bot, cyborg, and crowd worker agents, which have their own distinctive cost, budget, and influence. We then use deep Q-learning to search for the optimal policy that maximizes the rewards. Extensive experimental results on two real-world fake news propagation datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively sabotage the GNN-based fake news detector performance. We hope this paper can provide insights for future research on fake news detection.
