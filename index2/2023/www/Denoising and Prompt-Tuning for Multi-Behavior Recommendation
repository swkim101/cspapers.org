In practical recommendation scenarios, users often interact with items under multi-typed behaviors (e.g., click, add-to-cart, and purchase). Traditional collaborative filtering techniques typically assume that users only have a single type of behavior with items, making it insufficient to utilize complex collaborative signals to learn informative representations and infer actual user preferences. Consequently, some pioneer studies explore modeling multi-behavior heterogeneity to learn better representations and boost the performance of recommendations for a target behavior. However, a large number of auxiliary behaviors (i.e., click and add-to-cart) could introduce irrelevant information to recommenders, which could mislead the target behavior (i.e., purchase) recommendation, rendering two critical challenges: (i) denoising auxiliary behaviors and (ii) bridging the semantic gap between auxiliary and target behaviors. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel frameworkâ€“Denoising and Prompt-Tuning (DPT) with a three-stage learning paradigm to solve the aforementioned challenges. In particular, DPT is equipped with a pattern-enhanced graph encoder in the first stage to learn complex patterns as prior knowledge in a data-driven manner to guide learning informative representation and pinpointing reliable noise for subsequent stages. Accordingly, we adopt different lightweight tuning approaches with effectiveness and efficiency in the following stages to further attenuate the influence of noise and alleviate the semantic gap among multi-typed behaviors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPT over a wide range of state-of-the-art methods.
