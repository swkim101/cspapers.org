Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item which interests users via modeling their interest in items over time. Most of the existing works on sequential recommendation model users’ dynamic interest in specific items while overlooking users’ static interest revealed by some static attribute information of items, e.g., category, brand. Moreover, existing works often only consider the positive excitation of a user’s historical interactions on his/her next choice on candidate items while ignoring the commonly existing negative excitation, resulting in insufficiently modeling dynamic interest. The overlook of static interest and negative excitation will lead to incomplete interest modeling and thus impedes the recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose modeling both static interest and negative excitation for dynamic interest to further improve the recommendation performance. Accordingly, we design a novel Static-Dynamic Interest Learning (SDIL) framework featured with a novel Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation Modeling (TPNE) module for accurate sequential recommendation. TPNE is specially designed for comprehensively modeling dynamic interest based on temporal positive and negative excitation learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SDIL can effectively capture both static and dynamic interest and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
