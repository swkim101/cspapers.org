Fashion recommendation (FR) has received increasing attention in the research of new types of recommender systems. Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric.
