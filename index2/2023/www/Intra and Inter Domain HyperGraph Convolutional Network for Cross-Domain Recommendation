Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to solve the data sparsity problem by integrating the strengths of different domains. Though researchers have proposed various CDR methods to effectively transfer knowledge across domains, they fail to address the following key issues, i.e., (1) they cannot model high-order correlations among users and items in every single domain to obtain more accurate representations; (2) they cannot model the correlations among items across different domains. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Intra and Inter Domain HyperGraph Convolutional Network (II-HGCN) framework, which includes two main layers in the modeling process, i.e., the intra-domain layer and the inter-domain layer. In the intra-domain layer, we design a user hypergraph and an item hypergraph to model high-order correlations inside every single domain. Thus we can address the data sparsity problem better and learn high-quality representations of users and items. In the inter-domain layer, we propose an inter-domain hypergraph structure to explore correlations among items from different domains based on their interactions with common users. Therefore we can not only transfer the knowledge of users but also combine embeddings of items across domains. Comprehensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that II-HGCN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially when datasets are extremely sparse.
