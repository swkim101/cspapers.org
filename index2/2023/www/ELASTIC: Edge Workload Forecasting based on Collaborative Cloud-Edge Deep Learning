With the rapid development of edge computing in the post-COVID19 pandemic period, precise workload forecasting is considered the basis for making full use of the edge limited resources, and both edge service providers (ESPs) and edge service consumers (ESCs) can benefit significantly from it. Existing paradigms of workload forecasting (i.e., edge-only or cloud-only) are improper, due to failing to consider the inter-site correlations and might suffer from significant data transmission delays. With the increasing adoption of edge platforms by web services, it is critical to balance both accuracy and efficiency in workload forecasting. In this paper, we propose ELASTIC, which is the first study that leverages a cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for edge workload forecasting with multi-view graphs. Specifically, at the global stage, we design a learnable aggregation layer on each edge site to reduce the time consumption while capturing the inter-site correlation. Additionally, at the local stage, we design a disaggregation layer combining both the intra-site correlation and inter-site correlation to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on realistic edge workload datasets collected from Chinaâ€™s largest edge service provider show that ELASTIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, decreases time consumption, and reduces communication cost.
