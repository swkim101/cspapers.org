Relevance search over knowledge graphs seeks top-ranked answer entities that are most relevant to a query entity. Since the semantics of relevance varies with the user need and its formalization is difficult for non-experts, existing methods infer semantics from user-provided example answer entities. However, a user may provide very few examples, even none at the beginning of interaction, thereby limiting the effectiveness of such methods. In this paper, we vision a more practical scenario called labeling-based iterative relevance search: instead of effortfully inputting example answer entities, the user effortlessly (e.g., implicitly) labels current answer entities, and is rewarded with improved answer entities in the next iteration. To realize the scenario, our approach TRAVERS incorporates two rankers: a diversity-oriented ranker for supporting cold start and avoiding converging to sub-optimum caused by noisy labels, and a relevance-oriented ranker capable of handling unbalanced labels. Moreover, the two rankers and their combination dynamically evolve over iterations. TRAVERS outperformed a variety of baselines in experiments with simulated and real user behavior.
