Previous researches demonstrate that usersâ€™ actions in search interaction are associated with relative gains and losses to reference points, known as the reference dependence effect. However, this widely confirmed effect is not represented in most user models underpinning existing search evaluation metrics. In this study, we propose a new evaluation metric framework, namely Reference Dependent Metric (ReDeM), for assessing query-level search by incorporating the effect of reference dependence into the modelling of user search behavior. To test the overall effectiveness of the proposed framework, (1) we evaluate the performance, in terms of correlation with user satisfaction, of ReDeMs built upon different reference points against that of the widely-used metrics on three search datasets; (2) we examine the performance of ReDeMs under different task states, like task difficulty and task urgency; and (3) we analyze the statistical reliability of ReDeMs in terms of discriminative power. Experimental results indicate that: (1) ReDeMs integrated with a proper reference point achieve better correlations with user satisfaction than most of the existing metrics, like Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) and Rank-Biased Precision (RBP), even though their parameters have already been well-tuned; (2) ReDeMs reach relatively better performance compared to existing metrics when the task triggers a high-level cognitive load; (3) the discriminative power of ReDeMs is far stronger than Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR), slightly stronger than Precision and similar to DCG, RBP and INST. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explicitly incorporate the reference dependence effect into the user browsing model and offline evaluation metrics. Our work illustrates a promising approach to leveraging the insights about user biases from cognitive psychology in better evaluating user search experience and enhancing user models.
