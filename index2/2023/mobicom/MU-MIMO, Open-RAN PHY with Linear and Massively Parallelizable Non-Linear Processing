Multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) designs can substantially increase the achievable throughput and connectivity capabilities of wireless systems. However, existing MU-MIMO deployments typically employ linear processing that, despite its practical benefits, can leave capacity and connectivity gains unexploited. On the other hand, traditional non-linear processing solutions (e.g., sphere decoders) promise improved throughput and connectivity capabilities, but can be impractical in terms of processing complexity and latency, and with questionable practical benefits that have not been validated in actual system realizations. At the same time, emerging new Open Radio Access Network (Open-RAN) designs call for physical layer (PHY) processing solutions that are also practical in terms of realization, even when implemented purely on software. This work demonstrates the gains that our highly efficient, massively parallelizable, non-linear processing (MPNL) framework can provide, both in the uplink and downlink, when running in real-time and over-the-air, using our new 5G-New Radio (5G-NR) and Open-RAN compliant, software-based PHY. We showcase that our MPNL framework can provide substantial throughput and connectivity gains, compared to traditional, linear approaches, including increased throughput, the ability to halve the number of base-station antennas without any performance loss compared to linear approaches, as well as the ability to support a much larger number of users than base-station antennas, without the need for any traditional Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques, and with overloading factors that can be up to 300%.
