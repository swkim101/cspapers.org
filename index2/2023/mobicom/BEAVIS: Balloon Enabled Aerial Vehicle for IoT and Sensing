UAVs are becoming versatile and valuable platforms for various applications. However, the main limitation is their flying time. We present BEAVIS, a novel aerial robotic platform striking an unparalleled trade-off between the maneuverability of drones and the long-lasting capacity of blimps. BEAVIS scores highly in applications where drones enjoy unconstrained mobility yet suffer from limited lifetime. A nonlinear flight controller exploiting novel, unexplored, aerodynamic phenomena to regulate the ambient pressure and enable all translational and yaw degrees of freedom is proposed without direct actuation in the vertical direction. BEAVIS has built-in rotor fault detection and tolerance. We explain the design and the necessary background in detail. We verify the dynamics of BEAVIS and demonstrate its distinct advantages, such as agility, over existing platforms including the degrees of freedom akin to a drone with 11.36Ã— increased lifetime. We exemplify the potential of BEAVIS to become an invaluable platform for many applications.
