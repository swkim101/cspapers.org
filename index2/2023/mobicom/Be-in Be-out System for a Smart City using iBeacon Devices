The paper presents the solution proposal for the problem of detecting the presence of a passenger in a public transport vehicle in order to calculate the correct fare. The work includes an analysis of existing solutions based on Be-in/Be-out model supported by wireless technologies. The proposed solution focuses on simplifying the computational complexity involved in charging users for the number of stops travelled.
