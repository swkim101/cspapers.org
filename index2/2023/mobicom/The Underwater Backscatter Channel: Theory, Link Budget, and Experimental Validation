Underwater backscatter is a recent networking technology that enables net-zero-power communication and sensing in underwater environments. Existing research on underwater backscatter has focused on designing and demonstrating early systems with impressive capabilities; however, what remains critically missing is an end-to-end analysis of the underwater backscatter communication channel, which is necessary to understand the potential of this technology to scale to real-world applications and practical deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the underwater backscatter channel, including the downlink and uplink of end-to-end backscatter. We introduce a closed-form analytical model that encompasses the physical properties of piezoelectric materials, electromechanical coupling, electrical impedance, and the underwater acoustic channel. We verify the correctness of this theoretical analysis through both finite-element-model physical simulations and real-world experimental validation in a river, demonstrating that the analytical model matches our real-world experiments with a median deviation of only 0.76 dB. Using this model, we then simulate the theoretical limits of underwater backscatter as a function of different design parameters and identify pathways for pushing underwater backscatter toward its theoretical limits.
