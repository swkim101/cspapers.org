Artificial Intelligence offers cost-effective solutions to improve business processes and ensure more satisfying customer service. The advantage of solutions based on artificial intelligence is the possibility of using the API with mobile or stationary applications and cloud services. The research presented here aims to develop a deep learning model using cross-modal techniques on the example of a multi-tasking network. The main task is to use computer vision on IoT devices using sensors for customer service. Additionally, the solution will be based on distributed systems. Finally, the method of building the multi-tasking model, which will be designed to determine the person in the image and their emotional state, will be verified.
