The periodic trajectories of people provide an insightful and concise explanation over a long moving history, which helps to predict their future movements. In this paper, we present a Transformer based trajectory prediction method to predict the trajectories of people. First, we combine the spatial contexts of a trajectory with the sequential, temporal, and social contexts of a trajectory. Then, we predict the trajectories of people by applying Transformer based model where we multiply the length of query vector and the length of key vector with the scaling factor of the Transformer in order to make the training process more stable. As a result, our proposed Transformer based trajectory prediction model was effective.
