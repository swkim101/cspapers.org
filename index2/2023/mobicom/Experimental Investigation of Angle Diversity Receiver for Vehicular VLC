In this paper, we explore the use of multiple photodetectors for vehicular visible light communication (VLC) systems with a focus on the so-called Angle-Diversity Receiver (ADR). ADR builds upon the principle of using multiple photodetectors oriented at different reception angles to enable multidirectional signal reception. With ADR, it is possible to receive light rays from the vehicle headlight in challenging mobility conditions such as in the cases of U-turn, left-turn, and right-turn. In our work, we present preliminary results of an experimental verification of ADR-based vehicular VLC system implemented using software-defined radio platforms. Our results demonstrate that a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of more than 99 % is achieved even for T-junction road scenarios where the link is likely to get lost in the case of conventional single transmitter/receiver configurations.
