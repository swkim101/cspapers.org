Smart home speakers have become a commodity item in many households and provide interesting research opportunities in areas like wireless communication and human-computer interaction. Commercial devices do not provide sufficient access for many research tasks. We present a modular smart home hub designed specifically for research purposes. The electronic and mechanical components are designed with reproducibility in mind and can be easily recombined for a project's needs. Additionally, we show applications of the hub in different scenarios.
