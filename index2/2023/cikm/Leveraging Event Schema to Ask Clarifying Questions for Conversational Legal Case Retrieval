Legal case retrieval is a special IR task aiming to retrieve supporting cases for a given query case. Existing works have shown that conversational search paradigm can improve users' search experience in legal case retrieval. One of the keys to a practical conversational search system is how to ask high-quality clarifying questions to initiate conversations with users and understand their search intents. Recently, Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown superior ability in both open-domain QA and conversations with human. Thus it is natural to believe that they could be applied to legal conversational search as well. However, our preliminary study has shown that generating clarifying questions in legal conversational search with SOTA LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) often suffers from several problems such as duplication and low-utility contents. To address these problems, we propose LeClari, which leverages legal event schema as external knowledge to instruct LLMs to generate effective clarifying questions for legal conversational search. LeClari is constructed with a prompt module and a novel legal event selection module. The former defines a prompt with legal events for clarifying question generation and the latter selects potential event types by modeling the relationships of legal event types, conversational context, and candidate cases. We also propose ranking-oriented rewards and employ the reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML) method to optimize LeClari directly based on the final retrieval performance of the conversational legal search system. Empirical results over two widely adopted legal case retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.
