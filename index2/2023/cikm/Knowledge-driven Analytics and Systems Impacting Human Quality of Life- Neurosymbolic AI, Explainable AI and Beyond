The management of knowledge-driven artificial intelligence technologies is essential in order to evaluate their impact on human life and society. Social networks and tech use can have a negative impact on us physically, emotionally, socially and mentally. On the other hand, intelligent systems can have a positive effect on people's lives. Currently, we are witnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) like chatGPT and its influence towards the society. The objective of the workshop is to contribute to the advancement of intelligent technologies designed to address the human condition. This could include precise and personalized medicine, better care for elderly people, reducing private data leaks, using AI to manage resources better, using AI to predict risks, augmenting human capabilities, and more. The workshop's objective is to present research findings and perspectives that demonstrate how knowledge-enabled technologies and applications improve human well-being. This workshop indeed focuses on the impacts at different granularity levels made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) research on the micro granular level, where the daily or regular functioning of human life is affected, and also the macro granulate level, where the long-term or far-future effects of artificial intelligence on people's lives and the human society could be pretty high. In conclusion, this workshop explores how AI research can potentially address the most pressing challenges facing modern societies, and how knowledge management can potentially contribute to these solutions.
