Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in representation learning for graphs recently. However, the effectiveness of GNNs, which capitalize on the key operation of message propagation, highly depends on the quality of the topology structure. Most of the graphs in real-world scenarios follow a long-tailed distribution on their node degrees, that is, a vast majority of the nodes in the graph are tail nodes with only a few connected edges. GNNs produce inferior node representations for tail nodes due to the lack of sufficient structural information. In the pursuit of promoting the performance of GNNs for tail nodes, we explore how the deficiency of structural information deteriorates the performance of tail nodes and propose a general structural augmentation based tailno de representation learning framework, dubbed as øurs, which can jointly learn to augment the graph structure and extract more informative representations for tail nodes. Extensive experiments on six public benchmark datasets demonstrate that øurs outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for tail node representation learning.
