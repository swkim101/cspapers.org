Nested Named Entity Recognition (NNER), as a subarea of Named Entity Recognition, has presented longstanding challenges to researchers. In NNER, one entity may be part of a larger entity, which can occur at multiple levels. These nested structures prevent traditional sequence labeling methods from properly recognizing all entities. While recent research has focused on designing better recognition methods for NNER in various languages, Chinese Nested Named Entity Recognition (CNNER) is still underdeveloped, largely due to a lack of freely available CNNER benchmarks. To support CNNER research, in this paper, we introduce ChiNesE, a CNNER dataset comprising 20,000 sentences from online passages in multiple domains and containing 117,284 entities that fall into 10 categories, of which 43.8% are nested named entities. Based on ChiNesE, we propose Mulco, a novel method that can recognize named entities in nested structures through multiple scopes. Each scope uses a scope-based sequence labeling method that predicts an anchor and the length of a named entity to recognize it. Experimental results show that Mulco outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods with different recognition schemes on ChiNesE and ACE 2005 Chinese corpus.
