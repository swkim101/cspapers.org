We demonstrate a system for recursive query answering over graphs. The system is based on a complete implementation of the recursive relational algebra Âµ-RA, extended with parsers and compilers adapted for queries over knowledge and property graphs. Each component of the system comes with novelty for processing recursion. As a result, one can formulate, optimize and efficiently answer expressive queries that navigate recursively along paths in different types of graphs. We demonstrate the system on real datasets and show how it performs considering other state-of-the-art systems.
