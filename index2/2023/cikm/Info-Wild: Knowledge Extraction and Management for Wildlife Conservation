Our primary objective is to explore and enhance AI's role for wildlife conservation, in brief, Nature Through the Lens of AI. It seeks to address crucial challenges related to data heterogeneity, scale integration, data privacy, mitigating biases, and decision-making under uncertainty. This workshop is centred around leveraging AI's prowess in deciphering complex spatio-temporal data patterns for wildlife conservation, thereby contributing significantly to the broader canvas of AI for social good. The workshop intends to create an interdisciplinary platform bringing together computer scientists, data scientists, geospatial experts, ecologists, and conservation practitioners, fostering collaboration and driving real-world impact. The program will include keynote speeches, panel discussions, and interactive sessions focusing on efficient knowledge extraction and management, remote sensing technologies, predictive modeling, species distribution modeling, habitat quality assessment, and human-wildlife conflict mitigation. With an em- phasis on CIKM's primary interests, our aim is not only to enrich understanding of AI's symbiotic potential with ecology but also to utilize it to address pressing societal and environmental challenges.
