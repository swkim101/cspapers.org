CTR prediction is critical to industrial recommender systems. Recently, with the growth of business domains in enterprises, much attention has been focused on the multi-domain CTR recommendation. Numerous models have been proposed that attempt to use a unified model to serve multiple domains. Although much progress has been made, we argue that they ignore the importance of feature interactions and user behaviors when modeling cross-domain relations, which is a coarse-grained utilizing of domain information. To solve this problem, we propose Domain Facilitated Feature Modeling (DFFM) for CTR prediction. It incorporates domain-related information into the parameters of the feature interaction and user behavior modules, allowing for domain-specific learning of these two aspects. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of DFFM. We deploy the DFFM model in Huawei advertising platform and gain a 4.13% improvement of revenue on a two week online A/B test. Currently DFFM model has been used as the main traffic model, serving for hundreds of millions of people.
