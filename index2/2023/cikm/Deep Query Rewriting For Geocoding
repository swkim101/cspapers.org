Query rewriting aims to bridge the gap between user queries and indexed data. In the context of geocoding, it augments the user query to match all relevant entities in indexed data. This work presents an end-to-end trainable attention-based query rewriting model for geocoding. Most recent works attempt to solve query rewriting with sequence-to-sequence models, which often fail to satisfy the tight latency constraints of production environments. Toward developing a low latency model, we formulate it as a combination of multiple token classification tasks. We introduce numerous novel techniques, such as constructing a separate output space for alterations containing whole words to tackle many-to-one/one-to-many associations, using regular expression rules as prediction classes to handle the limitations of having a non-word piece prediction space, and curbing the output space for each wordpiece in our vocabulary to reduce inference time by 20x in average. We also present a data generation pipeline that generates train/test data without human judgment from the query logs. Through offline and online experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than their seq2seq and SMT-based counterparts in inference time, achieves better/on-par performance, and improves the relevance of overall geocoding.
