Bandit algorithms arose as a standard approach to learning better models online. As they become more popular, they are increasingly deployed in complex machine learning pipelines, where their actions can be overwritten. For example, in ranking problems, a list of recommended items can be modified by a downstream algorithm to increase diversity. This may break the classic bandit algorithms and lead to linear regret. Specifically, if the proposed action is not taken, uncertainty in its estimated mean reward may not get reduced. In this work, we study this setting and call it non-compliant bandits; as the agent tries to learn rewarding actions that comply with a downstream task. We propose two algorithms, compliant contextual UCB (CompUCB) and Thompson sampling (CompTS), which learn separate reward and compliance models. The compliance model allows the agent to avoid non-compliant actions. We derive a sublinear regret bound for CompUCB. We also conduct experiments that compare our algorithms to classic bandit baselines. The experiments show failures of the baselines and that we mitigate them by learning compliance models.
