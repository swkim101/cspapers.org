Generative Language Models have shown promising results in various domains, and some of the most successful applications are related to "concept expansion", which is the task of generating extensive text based on concise instructions provided through a "seed" prompt. In this presentation we will discuss the recent work conducted by the Data Science team at SurveyMonkey, where we have recently introduced a new feature that harnesses Generative AI models to streamline the survey design process. With this feature users can effortlessly initiate this process by specifying their desired objectives through a prompt, allowing them to automate the creation of surveys that include the critical aspects they wish to investigate. We will share our findings regarding some of the challenges encountered during the development of this feature. These include techniques for conditioning the model outputs, integrating generated text with industry-standard questions, fine-tuning Language Models using semi-synthetic Data Generation techniques, and more. Moreover, we will showcase the Evaluation Methodology that we have developed to measure the quality of the generated surveys across several dimensions. This evaluation process is crucial in ensuring that the generated surveys align well with user expectations and serve their intended purpose effectively. Our goal is to demonstrate the promising potential of Generative Language Models in the context of Survey Research, and we believe that sharing our learnings on these challenges and how we addressed them will be useful for practitioners working with Language Models on similar problems.
