Keeping up with research and finding related work is still a time-consuming task for academics. Researchers sift through thousands of studies to identify a few relevant ones. Automation techniques can help by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of this task. To this end, we developed CRUISE-Screening, a web-based application for conducting living literature reviews -- a type of literature review that is continuously updated to reflect the latest research in a particular field. CRUISE-Screening is connected to several search engines via an API, which allows for updating the search results periodically. Moreover, it can facilitate the process of screening for relevant publications by using text classification and question answering models. CRUISE-Screening can be used both by researchers conducting literature reviews and by those working on automating the citation screening process to validate their algorithms. The application is open-source, and a demo is available under this URL: https://citation-screening.ec.tuwien.ac.at.
