With the exponential growth of mobile devices and the increasing demand for personalized and context-aware services, service-oriented applications play a crucial role in alleviating information overload and improving user experience. At the same time, Edge-Cloud Intelligence (ECI) provides a distributed computing paradigm that leverages the computational capabilities of edge servers to bring services closer to end-users, enabling low-latency and high-bandwidth data processing. The convergence of service applications and ECI has emerged as a promising way to enhance the efficiency and quality of service provisioning in today's dynamic and resource-constrained mobile environment. This call for papers invites researchers and practitioners to contribute to the exploration of the synergy between service applications and ECI infrastructure.
