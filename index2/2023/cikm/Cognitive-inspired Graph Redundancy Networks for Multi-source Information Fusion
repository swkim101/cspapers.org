The recent developments in technologies bring not only increasing amount of information but also multiple information sources for Graph Representation Learning. With the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), there have been increasing attempts to learn representation of multi-source information leveraging its graph structures. However, existing graph methods basically combine multi-source information with different contribution scores and over-simplify the graph structures based on prior knowledge, which fail to unify complex and conflicting multi-source information. Multisensory Processing theory in cognitive neuroscience reveals human mechanism of learning multi-source information by identifying the redundancy and complementarity. Inspired by that, we propose Graph Redundancy Network (GRN) that: 1). learns a suitable representation space that maximizes multi-source interactions; 2). encodes the redundant and complementary information according to Graph Intersection and Difference of their graph structures; 3). further reinforces and explores the redundant and complementary information through low-pass and high-pass graph filters. The empirical study shows that GRN outperforms existing methods on various tasks.
