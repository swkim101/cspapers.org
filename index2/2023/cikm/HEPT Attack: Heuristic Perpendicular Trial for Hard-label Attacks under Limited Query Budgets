Exploring adversarial attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial for assessing and enhancing their adversarial robustness. Among various attack types, hard-label attacks that rely only on predicted labels offer a practical approach. This paper focuses on the challenging task of hard-label attacks within an extremely limited query budget, which is a significant achievement rarely accomplished by existing methods. To tackle this, we propose an attack framework that leverages geometric information from previous perturbation directions to form triangles and employs a heuristic perpendicular trial to effectively utilize the intermediate directions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach under strict query constraints and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art methods.
