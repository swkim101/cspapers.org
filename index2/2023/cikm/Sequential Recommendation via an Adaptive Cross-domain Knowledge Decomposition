Cross-domain recommendation, as an intelligent machine to alleviate data sparsity and cold start problems, has attracted extensive attention from scholars. Existing cross-domain recommendation frameworks usually leverage overlapping entities for knowledge transfer, the most popular of which are information aggregation and consistency maintenance. Despite decent improvements, the neglect of dynamic perspectives, the presence of confounding factors, and the disparities in domain properties inevitably constrain model performance. In view of this, this paper proposes a sequential recommendation framework via adaptive cross-domain knowledge decomposition, namely ARISEN, which focuses on employing adaptive causal learning to improve recommendation performance. Specifically, in order to facilitate sequence transfer, we align the user's behaviour sequences in the source domain and target domain according to the timestamps, expecting to use the abundant semantics of the former to augment the information of the latter. Regarding confounding factor removal, we introduce the causal learning technique and promote it as an adaptive representation decomposition framework on the basis of instrumental variables. For the sake of alleviating the impact of domain disparities, this paper endeavors to employ two mutually orthogonal transformation matrices for information fusion. Extensive experiments and detailed analyzes on large industrial and public data sets demonstrate that our framework can achieve substantial improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms.
