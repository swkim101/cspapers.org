Polarized Communities Search (PCS) aims to identify query-dependent communities where positive links predominantly connect nodes within each community, while negative links primarily connect nodes across different communities. Existing solutions primarily focus on modeling network topology, disregarding the crucial factor of node attributes. However, it is non-trivial to incorporate node attributes into PCS. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CO-guided RAndom walk in attributed signed networks (CORA) for PCS. Our approach involves constructing an attribute-based signed network to represent the auxiliary relations between nodes. We introduce a weight assignment mechanism to assess the reliability of edges in the signed network. Then, we design a co-guided random walk scheme that operates on two signed networks to model the connections between network topology and node attributes, thereby enhancing the search outcomes. Finally, we identify polarized communities using the Rayleigh quotient in the signed network. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CORA compared to state-of-the-art baselines for polarized communities search.
