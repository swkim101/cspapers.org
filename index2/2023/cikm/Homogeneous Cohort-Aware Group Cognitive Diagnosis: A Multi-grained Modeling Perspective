Cognitive Diagnosis has been widely investigated as a fundamental task in the field of education, aiming at effectively assessing the students' knowledge proficiency level by mining their exercise records. Recently, group-level cognitive diagnosis is also attracting attention, which measures the group-level knowledge proficiency on specific concepts by modeling the response behaviors of all students within the classes. However, existing work tends to explore group characteristics with a coarse-grained perspective while ignoring the inter-individual variability within groups, which is prone to unstable diagnosis results. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Homogeneous cohort-aware Group Cognitive Diagnosis model, namely HomoGCD, to effectively model the group's knowledge proficiency level from a multi-grained modeling perspective. Specifically, we first design a homogeneous cohort mining module to explore subgroups of students with similar ability status within a class by modeling their routine exercising performance. Then, we construct the mined cohorts into fine-grained organizations for exploring stable and uniformly distributed features of groups. Subsequently, we develop a multi-grained modeling module to comprehensively learn the cohort and group ability status, which jointly trains both interactions with the exercises. In particular, an extensible diagnosis module is introduced to support the incorporation of different diagnosis functions. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our HomoGCD in group as well as cohort~assessments.
