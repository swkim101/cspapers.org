Knowledge graphs have been conceived to collect heterogeneous data and knowledge about large domains, e.g. medical or engineering domains, and to allow versatile access to such collections by means of querying and logical reasoning. A surge of methods has responded to additional requirements in recent years. (i) Knowledge graph embeddings use similarity and analogy of structures to speculatively add to the collected data and knowledge. (ii) Queries with shapes and schema information can be typed to provide certainty about results. We survey both developments and find that the development of techniques happens in disjoint communities that mostly do not understand each other, thus limiting the proper and most versatile use of knowledge graphs.
