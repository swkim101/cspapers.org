The recommender system is one of the most fundamental information services. A significant effort has been devoted to improving prediction accuracy, inevitably leading to the potential degradation of recommendation diversity. Moreover, individuals have different needs for diversity. To address these problems, diversity-enhanced approaches are proposed to modify the recommender models. However, these methods fail to break free from the relevance-oriented paradigm and are mostly haunted by sharply-declined accuracy and high computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dual-Process Graph Neural Network (DPGNN), an efficient diversity-enhanced recommender system, resonating with the dual-process model of human cognition and the arousal theory of human interest. The first stage reduces the risk of suboptimal output during the training procedure, which helps to find a solution outside the relevance-oriented paradigm. Moreover, the second stage utilizes user-specific rating adjustments, boosting the recommendation diversity and accommodating users' distinctive needs with minimum computational costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our method in improving diversity, while maintaining accuracy with low computational costs.
