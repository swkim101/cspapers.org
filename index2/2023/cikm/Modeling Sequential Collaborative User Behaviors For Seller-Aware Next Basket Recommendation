Next Basket Recommendation (NBR) aims to recommend a set of products as a basket to users based on their historical shopping behavior. In this paper, we investigate the problem of NBR in online marketplaces (e.g., Instacart, Uber Eats) that connect users with multiple sellers. In such scenarios, effective NBR can significantly enhance the shopping experience of users by recommending diversified and completed products based on specific sellers, especially when a user purchases from a seller they have not visited before. However, conventional NBR approaches assume that all considered products are from the same sellers, which overlooks the complex relationships between users, sellers, and products. To address such limitations, we develop SecGT, a sequential collaborative graph transformer framework that recommends users with baskets from specific sellers based on seller-aware user preference representations that are generated by collaboratively modeling the joint user-seller-product interactions and sequentially exploring the user-agnostic basket transitions in an interactive way. We evaluate the performance of SecGT on users from a leading online marketplace at multiple cities with various involved sellers. The results show that SecGT outperforms existing NBR and also traditional product recommendation approaches on recommending baskets from cold sellers for different types of users across all cities.
