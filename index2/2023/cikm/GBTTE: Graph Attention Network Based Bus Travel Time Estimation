Real-time bus travel time is crucial for the smart public transportation system and is beneficial for improving user satisfaction for online map services. However, it faces great challenges due to fine-grained spatial dependencies and dynamic temporal dependencies. To address the above problem, we propose GBTTE, a novel end-to-end graph attention network framework to estimate bus travel time. Specifically, we construct a novel graph structure of bus routes and use a graph attention network to capture the fine-grained spatial features of bus routes. Then, we fully exploit the joint spatial-temporal relations of bus stops through a spatial-temporal graph attention network and also capture the dynamic correlation between the route and the bus transportation network with a cross graph attention network. Finally, we integrate the route representation, the spatial-temporal representation and contextual information to estimate bus travel time. Extensive experiments carried out on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GBTTE. In addition, GBTTE has been deployed in production at Baidu Maps, handling tens of millions of requests every day.
