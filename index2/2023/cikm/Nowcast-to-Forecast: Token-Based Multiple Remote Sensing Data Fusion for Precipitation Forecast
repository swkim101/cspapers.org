Accurate short-term precipitation forecast is of social and economic significance for preventing severe weather damage. Deep learning has been rapidly adopted in nowcasting based on weather radar, which plays a key role in preventing dangerous weather conditions such as torrential rainfall. However, the limited observation range of the radar imposes constraints on shorter forecast lead times. Securing a sufficient lead time for timely flood warnings and emergency responses is crucial. Here, we propose a novel GAN-based framework that combines radar and satellite data to extend forecast lead time. First, we tokenize the satellite image to align with radar dimensions and combine the satellite and radar data. We then apply positional encoding to add positional information. Second, we design the self-conditioned generator to estimate distributions of various rainfall intensities. Finally, we employ Gaussian Fourier features to map the input noise into a continuous representation. The proposed framework realistically and accurately produces time series images of various precipitation types. Furthermore, our multisource data-driven system outperforms numerical weather prediction at forecasts of up to 6 hours in South Korea.
