The widespread deployment of storage disaggregation in the cloud has facilitated flexible scaling and storage overprovisioning, allowing for high utilization of storage capacity and IOPS. Instead of utilizing remote storage protocols to access remote disks, a middle-tier is introduced between compute servers and storage servers in order to serve I/O requests from compute servers and provide computations such as compression and decompression. However, due to the need for a cloud to concurrently serve millions of VMs that require access to disaggregated storage, the middle-tier requires a massive number of servers to process network traffic between computing and storage nodes. For example, a major cloud company may deploy hundreds of thousands of high-end servers to provide such a service for its cloud storage, because the existing CPU-based middle-tier suffers from a severe issue of compute-intensive compression/decompression on high-throughput storage traffic. To address this issue, we introduce SmartDS, a middle-tier-centric SmartNIC that serves storage I/O requests with low latency and high throughput, while maintaining high flexibility and programmability. The key idea behind SmartDS is the application-aware message split (AAMS) mechanism, which allows for the processing of the message's header on the host CPU to achieve high flexibility, and the message's payload on the SmartDS. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartDS provides up to 4.3Ã— more throughput than a CPU-based middle-tier and enables the linear scale-up of multiple network ports and multiple SmartNICs, thus significantly reducing cloud infrastructure costs for disaggregated block storage.
