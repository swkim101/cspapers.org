In this paper, we propose OneQ, the first optimizing compilation framework for one-way quantum computation towards realistic photonic quantum architectures. Unlike previous compilation efforts for solid-state qubit technologies, our innovative framework addresses a unique set of challenges in photonic quantum computing. Specifically, this includes the dynamic generation of qubits over time, the need to perform all computation through measurements instead of relying on 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates, and the fact that photons are instantaneously destroyed after measurements. As pioneers in this field, we demonstrate the vast optimization potential of photonic one-way quantum computing, showcasing the remarkable ability of OneQ to reduce computing resource requirements by orders of magnitude.
