The web is littered with millions of links which previously worked but no longer do. When users encounter any such broken link, they resort to looking up an archived copy of the linked page. But, for a sizeable fraction of these broken links, no archived copies exist. Even if a copy exists, it often poorly approximates the original page, e.g., any functionality on the page which requires the client browser to communicate with the page's backend servers will not work, and even the latest copy will be missing updates made to the page's content after that copy was captured. To address this situation, we observe that broken links are often merely a result of website reorganizations; the linked page still exists on the same site, albeit at a different URL. Therefore, given a broken link, our system FABLE attempts to find the linked page's new URL by learning and exploiting the pattern in how the old URLs for other pages on the same site have transformed to their new URLs. We show that our approach is significantly more accurate and efficient than prior approaches which rely on stability in page content over time. FABLE increases the fraction of dead links for which the corresponding new URLs can be found by 50%, while reducing the median delay incurred in identifying the new URL for a broken link from over 40 seconds to less than 10 seconds.
