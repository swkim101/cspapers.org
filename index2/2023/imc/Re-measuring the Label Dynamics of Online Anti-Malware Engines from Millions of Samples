VirusTotal is the most widely used online scanning service in both academia and industry. However, it is known that the results returned by antivirus engines are often inconsistent and changing over time. The intrinsic dynamics of VirusTotal labeling have prompted researchers to investigate the characteristics of label dynamics for more effective use. However, they are generally limited in terms of the size and diversity of the datasets used in the measurements. This poses threats to many of their conclusions. In this paper, we perform an extraordinary large-scale study to re-measure the label dynamics of VirusTotal. Our dataset involves all the scan data in VirusTotal over a 14-month period, including over 571 million samples and 847 million reports in total. With this large dataset, we are able to revisit many issues related to the label dynamics of VirusTotal, including the prevalence of label dynamics/silence, the characteristics across file types, the impact of label dynamics on common label aggregation methods, the stabilization patterns of labels, etc. Our measurement reveals some observations that are unknown to the research community and even inconsistent with previous research. We believe that our findings could help researchers advance the understanding of the VirusTotal ecosystem.
