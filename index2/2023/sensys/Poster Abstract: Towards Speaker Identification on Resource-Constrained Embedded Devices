Voice is a convenient and popular way to interact with our digital world. Besides translating speech to text, it is also possible to identify speakers based on their voice profile. To date, speaker identification has predominantly been limited to high-performance computational platforms owing to the intricate nature of the underlying algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce model complexity by the required factor of âˆ¼ 10, such that speaker identification can be made feasible for embedded devices with limited resources. We further describe and discuss novel use cases, such as voice-based presence detection and authentication, that become feasible when making speaker identification viable on this class of devices.
