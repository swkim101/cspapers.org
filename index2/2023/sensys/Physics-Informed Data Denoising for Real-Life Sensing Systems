Sensors measuring real-life physical processes are ubiquitous in today's interconnected world. These sensors inherently bear noise that often adversely affects the performance and reliability of the systems they support. Classic filtering approaches introduce strong assumption on the time or frequency characteristics of sensory measurements, while learning-based denoising approaches typically rely on using ground truth clean data to train a denoising model, which is often challenging or prohibitive to obtain for many real-world applications. We observe that in many scenarios, the relationships between different sensor measurements (e.g., location and acceleration) are analytically described by laws of physics (e.g., second-order differential equation). By incorporating such physics constraints, we can guide the denoising process to improve performance even in the absence of ground truth data. In light of this, we design a physics-informed denoising model that leverages the inherent algebraic relationships between different measurements governed by the underlying physics. By obviating the need for ground truth clean data, our method offers a practical denoising solution for real-world applications. We conducted experiments in various domains, including inertial navigation, CO2 monitoring, and HVAC control, and achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with existing denoising methods. Our method can denoise data in real time (4ms for a sequence of 1s) for low-cost noisy sensors and produces results that closely align with those from high-precision, high-cost alternatives, leading to an efficient, cost-effective approach for more accurate sensor-based systems.
