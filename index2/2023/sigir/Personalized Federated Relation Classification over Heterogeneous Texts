Relation classification detects the semantic relation between two annotated entities from a piece of text, which is a useful tool for structurization of knowledge. Recently, federated learning has been introduced to train relation classification models in decentralized settings. Current methods strive for a strong server model by decoupling the model training at server from direct access to texts at clients while taking advantage of them. Nevertheless, they overlook the fact that clients have heterogeneous texts (i.e., texts with diversely skewed distribution of relations), which renders existing methods less practical. In this paper, we propose to investigate personalized federated relation classification, in which strong client models adapted to their own data are desired. To further meet the challenges brought by heterogeneous texts, we present a novel framework, namely pf-RC, with several optimized designs. It features a knowledge aggregation method that exploits a relation-wise weighting mechanism, and a feature augmentation method that leverages prototypes to adaptively enhance the representations of instances of long-tail relations. We experimentally validate the superiority of pf-RC against competing baselines in various settings, and the results suggest that the tailored techniques mitigate the challenges.
