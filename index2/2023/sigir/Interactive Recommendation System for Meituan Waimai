As the largest local retail & instant delivery platform in China, Meituan Waimai has deployed a personalized recommender system on server and recommend nearby stores to users through APP homepage. To capture real-time intention of users and flexibly adjust the recommendation results on the homepage, we further add an interactive recommender system. The existing interactive recommender systems in the industry mainly capture intention of users based on their feedback on a specific UI of questions. However, we find that it will undermine use fluency and increase use complexity by rashly inserting a new question UI when users browse the homepage. Therefore, we develop an Embedded Interactive Recommender System (EIRS) that directly infers users' intention according to their click behaviors on the homepage and dynamically inserts a new recommendation result into the homepage1. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EIRS, we conduct systematic online A/B Tests, where click-through & conversion rate of the inserted EIRS result is 132% higher than that of the initial result on the homepage, and the overall gross merchandise volume is effectively enhanced by 0.43%.
