The past few years have witnessed an explosive growth of user-generated POI-centric travel blogs, which can provide a comprehensive understanding of a POI for people. However, evaluating the quality of the POI-centric travel blogs and ranking the blogs is not a simple task without domain knowledge or actual travel experience on the target POI. Nevertheless, our insight is that the user search behavior related to the target POI on the online map service can partly valid the rationality of the POIs appearing in the travel blogs, which helps for travel blogs ranking. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for travel blogs ranking, coined Matching POI and Travel Blogs with Multi-view InFormation (MOTIF). Concretely, we first construct two POI graphs as multi-view information: (1) the search-level POI graph which reflects the user behaviors on the online map service; and (2) the document-level POI graph which shows the POI co-occurrence frequency in travel blogs. Then, to better model the intrinsic correlation of the two graphs, we adopt Mutual Information Maximization to align the search-level and document-level semantic spaces. Moreover, we leverage a pair-wise ranking loss for POI-document relevance scoring. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
