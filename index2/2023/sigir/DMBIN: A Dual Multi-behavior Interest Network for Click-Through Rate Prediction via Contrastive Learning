Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a critical role in various online applications, aiming to estimate the user's click probability. User interest modeling from various interactive behaviors(e.g., click, add-to-cart, order) is becoming a mainstream approach to CTR prediction. We argue that the various user behaviors contain two important intrinsic characteristics: 1) The discrepancy in various behaviors reveals different aspects of user's behavior-specific interests. For example, one may click out of need but pay more attention to the rating when purchasing. 2) The consistency of various behaviors contains user's behavior-invariant interest. For example, the user prefers interacted items rather than other items. Therefore, it is necessary to disentangle the discrepancy and consistency signals from the massive behavior information. Unfortunately, previous methods have yet to study this phenomenon well, which limits the recommendation performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Dual Multi-Behavior Interest Network (DMBIN for short) to disentangle behavior-specific and behavioral-invariant interests from various behaviors for a better recommendation. Specifically, DMBIN formalizethe discrepancy and consistency characteristics among various behaviors. Extensive experiments and empirical analysis on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DMBIN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DMBIN is also deployed in the online sponsored search advertising system in Meituan and achieves 2.11% and 2.76% improvement on CTR and CPM, respectively.s the dismantlement task as two contrastive learning tasks of multi-behavior interests extracted through the Multi-behavior Interest Module: Multi-behavior Interest Contrast(MIC) task and Multi-behavior Interest Alignment(MIA) task. These two tasks focus on extracting
