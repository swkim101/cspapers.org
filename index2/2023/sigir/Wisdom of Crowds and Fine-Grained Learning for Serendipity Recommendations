Serendipity is a notion that means an unexpected but valuable discovery. Due to its elusive and subjective nature, serendipity is difficult to study even with today's advances in machine learning and deep learning techniques. Both ground truth data collecting and model developing are the open research questions. This paper addresses both the data and the model challenges for identifying serendipity in recommender systems. For the ground truth data collecting, it proposes a new and scalable approach by using both user generated reviews and a crowd sourcing method. The result is a large-scale ground truth data on serendipity. For model developing, it designed a self-enhanced module to learn the fine-grained facets of serendipity in order to mitigate the inherent data sparsity problem in any serendipity ground truth dataset. The self-enhanced module is general enough to be applied with many base deep learning models for serendipity. A series of experiments have been conducted. As the result, a base deep learning model trained on our collected ground truth data, as well as with the help of the self-enhanced module, outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models in predicting serendipity.
