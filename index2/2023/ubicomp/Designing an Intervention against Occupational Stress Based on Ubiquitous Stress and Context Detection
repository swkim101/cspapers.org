Stress, particularly occupational, is a major burden for individuals and the society, affecting the health of one worker in four. Digital interventions are a scalable and moderately effective way to tackle it. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), which use sensors and artificial intelligence to adapt to the userâ€™s needs and context, appear to be a promising way to increase the effectiveness. In this paper we first describe a wearable and mobile data collection as well as stress detection experiments intended to serve as the basis for such an intervention. We then present our design for a JITAI based on cognitive behavioural therapy, and highlight a number of open questions applicable to this and similar JITAIs.
