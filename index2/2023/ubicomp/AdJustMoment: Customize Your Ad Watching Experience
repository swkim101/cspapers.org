Ads are ubiquitous on online video platforms, providing significant commercial value but also often interrupting viewers at inopportune moments. This can be particularly disruptive for mobile users, whose diverse contexts of use can mean time for video watching is limited. Prior research indicates that allowing users to negotiate or defer interruptions can reduce disruption. Inspired by this, we developed AdJustMoment, a mobile video player application that imports content from online platforms and offers users the option to defer ads through "Snooze" or "Ads-debt" - user-determined ads-viewing times. Our preliminary qualitative feedback indicates a preference for "Ads-debt", as users felt it provided greater control over when ads appear. Additionally, users also desire to receive positive feedback upon completing an ad, as it serves as a motivational factor.
