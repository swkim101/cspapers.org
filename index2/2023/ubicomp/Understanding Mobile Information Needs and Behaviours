Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives, with an ever-increasing number of users relying on mobile applications to meet their needs. This widespread usage necessitates a deep understanding of how people utilize their devices to develop more effective features. Leveraging context-based information from these devices offers insights into user needs and behaviours. This PhD study focuses on three primary aspects: deciphering context signals to determine user needs, modelling mobile user behaviour based on these signals, and generating synthetic smartphone user patterns. Our goal is to provide invaluable data that can drive the evolution of future mobile applications, further enhancing the user experience.
