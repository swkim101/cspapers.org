Data center operators, with the aid of advanced energy storage devices, can reduce the operating cost by maintaining a long-term stable electrical consumption curve. Therefore, accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial to enable effective data center electricity systems. In this paper, we develop a data-driven forecasting model for short-term data center electrical consumption. Through examining the results of the traditional statistical model, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the deep learning model, Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), we combine them to construct a hybrid model which outperforms each single one of the two models and shows good mobility. The overall performance of our models has been validated on data center electrical consumption data provided by Tencent Inc.
