The intricate flight patterns exhibited by birds have sparked considerable interest in many fields. However, traditional external visual observation has significant limitations, including susceptibility to line-of-sight occlusion, uneven lighting effects, and lack of continuous detection. In this paper, we design a hybrid embedded system that can perform bird flight postures recognition by integrating inertial measurement unit (IMU) with flexible strain sensor. The proposed system leverages a strain sensor based on laser-induced graphene (LIG), strategically positioned on the bird’s wing joints, in conjunction with a high-precision IMU deployed on the bird’s torso. Through a learning architecture, we achieve an impressive accuracy of 99.48% in identifying eight commonly observed bird flight postures. The integration of the proposed system offers exciting possibilities and serves as a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying creature flight.
