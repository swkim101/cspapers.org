In this short paper we provide some observations on the (im)possibility of distinguishing between real and virtual in augmented reality worlds. Distinguishing may be possible because of imperfect technology, impossibilities, and manipulating perceptual capabilities. The question must be asked, if this distinction cannot always be made, does this place responsibility on the owner or administrator of the Extended Reality (XR) environments? And who might be the owner or administrator in the case of ever-present extended reality?
