Coughs and sneezes are important symptoms of respiratory, allergic and Influenza-Like Illnesses. Monitoring the number of occurrences of these symptoms can not only track patientsâ€™ health but also help with understanding the dynamics of outbreaks. While there has been extensive research around detecting coughs, creating reliable methods to identify sneezes are still unexplored, partially owing to scarce availability of data. Most respiratory symptom detection algorithms operate at high sampling rates and thereby are privacy-invasive. By downsampling the data extensively, we can ensure that the speech cannot be reconstructed, yet retain enough signal characteristics to identify sneeze and cough sounds. Using a lightweight machine learning based approach, we propose a privacy-aware and energy-efficient pipeline that can detect coughs and sneezes. Such a system can lead to higher adoption and thus make tracking diseases in individuals and communities easier.
