Mental health and well-being are critical components of overall health: suffering from a mental illness can be both debilitating and life-threatening for individuals experiencing symptoms. Detecting symptoms of mental illness early-on and delivering interventions to prevent and/or manage symptoms can improve health and well-being outcomes. Ubiquitous systems are increasingly playing a central role in uncovering clinically relevant contextual information on mental health. Research shows that these systems can passively measure symptoms and enable opportunities to deliver intervention. However, despite this potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into mental healthcare has been slow, and a number of challenges need to be addressed towards the effective implementation of these tools. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of this workshop for the last seven years, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in both the conceptualization, translation, and implementation of novel approaches for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health.
