A venous insufficiency, to which the deep veins of the lower human extremities are particularly susceptible, can lead to serious diseases, such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with subsequent risks of severe implications, e.g. pulmonary embolism or a post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) [6]. The current standard procedure to diagnose venous insufficiency is performed exclusively in medical offices and hospitals in the form of in-patient treatments with special medical equipment. This hurdle for the patient, combined with the often diffuse symptoms of venous insufficiency [7], may lead to a late discovery of diseases such as DVTs and increases the risk of secondary diseases as well as treatment costs [3]. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for continuous monitoring of the current venous function by adapting the Light Reflection Rheography (LLR) and using low-cost wearable sensor technology and a smartphone app, aiming to deliver critical early stage information about pathological changes of the blood flow in the lower limbs.
