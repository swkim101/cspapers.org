We identify features of mood-tracking apps for managing mental health that foster engagement and sustained use by adolescents—a population that expresses a preference for digital apps over face-to-face support, yet demonstrates low levels of engagement with such apps. We developed a prototype of an adolescent-focused mood-tracking app, informed by literature about existing apps’ approaches to recording patients’ symptoms, the role of data representations in long-term mental health management, and the potential benefits of peer support tools. We then conducted a survey (n = 88) to assess adolescents’ preferences for various aspects of this prototype. We found that participants prefer tools for self-reflection and self-awareness over those for gamification or social support, and that they value function over entertainment when choosing wellness apps, especially among participants who disclosed a history of managing mental health. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses revealed that customization and self-reflection are important design themes. Our findings have implications for the design of mental health apps that cater to the specific needs and preferences of adolescent users.
