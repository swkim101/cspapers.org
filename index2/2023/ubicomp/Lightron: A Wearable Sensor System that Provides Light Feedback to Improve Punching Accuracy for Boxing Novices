This work presents ‘Lightron’, a wearable sensor system designed for boxing training assistance, improving punching accuracy for novices. This system combines accelerometers, stretch sensors, and flex sensors to detect the user’s movements, providing LED light feedback to the user. This adjustable design ensures a tight fit of the device to the body, allowing the sensor to collect accurate arm movement data without impeding training movements. A simple neural network is used to enable real-time motion detection and analysis, which can run on low-cost embedded devices. Contrary to merely using accelerometers on the wrist, Lightron collects motion data from the elbow and shoulder, enhancing the precision of punch accuracy assessment. Primary user studies conducted among boxing amateurs have shown that using Lightron in boxing training increases the performance of amateur players both in single and periodic training sessions, demonstrating its potential utility in the sports training domain.
