Knowledge Transfer is one of the essential principles in education. The teacherâ€™s knowledge is encoded through speech and writing and transmitted to the student. The student then decodes the transmitted information according to individual capabilities and absorbs it as knowledge. This paper presents an approach to accelerate knowledge transfer using sensor technology and social-cognitive states. So far, we have worked on quantifying meeting discussions, analyzing lecture studies, and estimating domain knowledge from web browsing. The contribution of this study is to estimate the degree of achievement of knowledge transfer and to accelerate it based on the estimated results.
