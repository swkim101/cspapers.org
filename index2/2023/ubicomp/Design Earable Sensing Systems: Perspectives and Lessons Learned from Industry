Earables computing is an emerging research community as the industry witnesses the soaring of True Wireless Stereo (TWS) Active Noise Canceling (ANC) earbuds in the past ten years. There is an increasing trend of newly initiated earable research spanning across mobile health, user-interfaces, speech processing, and context-awareness. Head-worn devices are anticipated to be the next generation Mobile Computing and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) platform. In this paper, we share our design experiences and lessons learned in building hearable sensing systems from the industry perspective. We also give our takes on future directions of the earable research.
