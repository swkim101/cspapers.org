In the event of sudden cardiac arrest in places where medical care is not available, such as in a house or in the city, primary life-saving treatment by a person present at the scene is extremely important. However, only about half of the patients receive primary life-saving treatment, and the implementation rate of primary life-saving treatment is low [5]. One of the reasons for the low implementation rate is the high psychological hurdle caused by the lack of knowledge and experience in primary life support. Although many studies have been conducted to promote the implementation of primary life-saving procedures, CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) practice mannequins are still generally required to practice primary life-saving procedures, which increases the practice cost. In this research, we propose an easier cardiac massage practice method using only a smartphone equipped with a barometer, which is widely used in the world, and a transparent sealed bag used to store food. In this research, we developed a system that estimates the pressing strength, and estimates the pressing interval of cardiac massage based on the information obtained from the barometer of the smartphone, and provides real-time feedback to the smartphone screen. The system also has a test mode to check the userâ€™s cardiac massage skills. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the screen design and practicality of the developed application. The interval of cardiac massage was evaluated as good for practice, but the strength of the cardiac massage was evaluated as just enough to get the gist.
