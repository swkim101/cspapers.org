In this work, we promote capacitive sensing as a versatile smart textile modality through a collection of functional wearable designs. Considering the large variety of possible garment design concepts, we outline an approach to implement smart sensing technology into garments while maintaining these diverse design possibilities. After introducing the basic functionalities of capacitive sensing and the process of designing and building a smart garment, we present an assortment of garments enabled by this technology within the MoCaâ€™Collection. Each of the projects serves a different purpose, built by people representing different backgrounds from electrical engineers, computer scientists, digital artists to smart fashion designers, starting from technical design over digital art to our latest design of a strongly design-oriented full-body capturing suit implementing the proposed technology.
