Engagement is a human experience relevant in multiple contexts, including classrooms, presentations and workplaces. Stemming from flow theory, engagement in these contexts has been studied using wearable devices, which can unobtrusively measure physiological changes, specifically Electrodermal Activity (EDA). However, researchers have not explored how EDA markers might be similar or different between various engagement scenarios, namely student, audience and workplace engagement. In this study, we investigated possible similarities through the use of three datasets containing EDA data and engagement self-report labels, collected in the wild in different settings using research-grade wrist-worn wearable devices. We analysed the correlation between hand-crafted EDA features and the engagement level and we leveraged a machine learning framework for engagement prediction. We found that similar features are correlated with the engagement level across the various settings. We also found that our machine learning model identified related markers as important across the three engagement contexts. Our results highlight that similarities are present in the EDA features between different engagement contexts, while also identifying possible dataset specific differences.
