This paper contributes a methodological framework for the design of digital therapeutics for mental health which leverages on state-of-the-art knowledge on digital twins and virtual coaching solutions to realize more effective and AI-powered digital health interventions. The paper discusses how the deployment of digital twins as computational models for predicting patient's health condition can be combined with human-centered distributed conversational modeling techniques in designing AI powered mental health interventions with key stakeholders. This approach helps to address main challenges in the design of AI-powered digital therapeutics, such as optimizing design efforts and resources, ensuring ethics soundness and transparency of decisions related to the digital treatment, as well as informing the pre-clinical validation of future digital therapeutics.
