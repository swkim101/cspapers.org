Urinary incontinence (UI) is a prevalent condition affecting millions of individuals worldwide, leading to various physical, social, and psychological challenges that diminish their quality of life. Current management approaches primarily focus on containment rather than proactive monitoring and warning systems. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a novel wearable technology called Privee, designed as an unobtrusive undergarment to monitor bladder fullness in real-time. Privee utilizes e-textile-based bioimpedance spectroscopy technology, which noninvasively assesses bladder fullness by analyzing the electrical properties of body tissues and fluids. The undergarment incorporates eight embroidered electrodes and textile transmission lines seamlessly integrated into the fabric. By continuously monitoring the bioimpedance signals from the bladder, Privee provides real-time information about the bladder’s fullness level. This data is processed using a specialized algorithm to estimate the need for urination. The noninvasive nature of Privee eliminates the discomfort and risks associated with invasive monitoring methods, offering a user-friendly and convenient solution for individuals with UI, overactive bladder, or post-operative care needs. This innovative technology has the potential to improve patients’ quality of life and optimize healthcare costs associated with UI management.
