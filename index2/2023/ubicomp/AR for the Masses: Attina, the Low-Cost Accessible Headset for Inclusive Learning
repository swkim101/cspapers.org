Current commercial Augmented Reality (AR) headsets are expensive and limited in availability, posing challenges for researchers and designers in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we introduce Attina, an open-source, low-cost optical see-through AR headset using a smartphone as its display. Overcoming limitations of previous work, the system features stereoscopic rendering for enhanced depth perception and a 3-DoF controller for virtual interactions. We discuss Attinaâ€™s design and outline opportunities for a usability study to evaluate its user experience.
