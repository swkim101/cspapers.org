Although many works bring exercise monitoring to smartphones and smartwatches, inertial sensors used in such systems require the device to be in motion to detect exercises. We demonstrate our full paper ProxiFit, a practical on-device exercise monitoring system capable of classifying and counting exercises despite the device being still. ProxiFit remotely detects adjacent exercises with magnetic field fluctuations induced by the motions of ferrous exercise equipment. Novel proximal sensing nature of ProxiFit (1) extends coverage of wearable exercise monitoring to exercises that do not involve device motion such as lower-body machine exercise, and (2) brings a new off-body exercise monitoring mode with line-of-sight screen visibility, namely signage mode, to a smartphone mounted in front of the user.
