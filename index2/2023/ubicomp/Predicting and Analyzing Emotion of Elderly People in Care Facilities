In this work, we aim to collect data on the emotion of the elderly using the care application FonLog and try to develop a predictive model and analyze the daily emotion data of the elderly in a geriatric care facility. We used weather information and the level of care needed by the elderly as input features and the random forest as a prediction model. As a result, the method performs differently in different facilities. Feature correlations of weather data differed among each elderly in each facility. In the textual analysis based on emotion change data, we found a strong repetition in the recording of textual data. This implies that we need to provide caregivers with a more detailed rationale for how to record changes in emotion.
