As smartphone notifications proliferate, it becomes increasingly challenging for users to review them all. In response, weâ€™ve developed NotiSummary, an application leveraging ChatGPT to present a concise summary of notifications, thereby reducing the time and effort required to review them. The application also integrates customization capabilities to further enhance the user-centric experience. Our study investigates the potential applicability of AI-based summarization techniques in notifications and explores user interaction patterns with these summaries. Preliminary results show that users find these summaries helpful in quickly accessing specific information, with preferences emerging for receiving summaries early in the morning and late at night. These findings underscore the potential value of notification summarization while highlighting the need to further investigate user preferences for summary appearance and the impact of summary generation on notification management behavior.
