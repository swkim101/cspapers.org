A central research goal of Ubicomp has always been the development of systems and methods that seamlessly support humans in accomplishing complex tasks in everyday life. In the wake of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), topics such as "Human-Centered AI" and "Hybrid Human AI" are showing a growing interest in this very research that puts us humans and our needs at the center of artificial intelligence. While methods for augmenting the human body and the impact of these augmentations on human physical life are being extensively researched, there has been very limited progress in evaluating the impact on human cognitive perception and its impact on the overall outcome of augmentations to the human body. In this tutorial, we will address the question of how to evaluate the cognitive impact of human augmentation. We will address the different levels of cognitive effects, how to measure which methods of augmentation have the best effect, and which cognitive measures have the greatest impact on augmentation, and we will give the audience the opportunity to test and evaluate cognitive human augmentation systems themselves.
