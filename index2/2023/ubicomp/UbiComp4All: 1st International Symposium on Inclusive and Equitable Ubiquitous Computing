We propose a symposium to foster research on inclusive and equitable ubiquitous computing in Latin America (LATAM). The meeting is inspired by the ACM SIGCHI Across Borders Initiative, and the 1st CSCW@LatAm Research Catalyst Workshop. We aim to: 1) discuss opportunities and challenges of defining and accomplishing inclusive and equitable ubiquitous computing centered on LATAM; 2) collaboratively mentor emerging related projects focused on LATAM; 3) create a space that encourages cross-country collaborations to address together common research challenges, whilst also strengthening the links among all the members, regardless of their level of expertise in the field; and, 4) provide a forum for dialogue between local communities in Latin America (e.g., educational and health workers, NGOs) and UbiComp researchers, with the aim of identifying pathways for codesign-focused collaborations between diverse groups of stakeholders on problems of public interest.
