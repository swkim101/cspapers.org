Electronic textiles (e-textiles) development and manufacturing processes have largely been based on individual (Do it yourself) DIY manufacturing procedures without rigorous production process standardization. Because of this, textile circuits have mostly been subjected to a trial & error development approach. In line with this motivation, this dissertation will investigate, identify, and synthesize e-textile fabrication parameters to develop a design guideline for woven stitched textile circuits. The first phase investigates and synthesizes expert knowledge that will allow for the formulation of design rules regarding the manufacturability of an e-textile. The second phase involves the development of design rules for e-textiles manufacturability to standardize the development process of e-textiles in a more reliable and repeatable way, especially because repeatability and reliability are the most important factors in manufacturability [1]. The third phase involves the deployment of these rules in a solar e-textile circuit application.
