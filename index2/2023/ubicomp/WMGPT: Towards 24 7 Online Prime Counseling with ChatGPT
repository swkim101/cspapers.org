Traditional in-person counseling encounters limitations in terms of accessibility, flexibility, and social stigma. Additionally, low mental health literacy and embarrassment among individuals hinder help-seeking behavior. Meanwhile, the introduction of more sophisticated sensors embedded in ubiquitous devices such as smartphones and smartwatches, and the release of a powerful large language model, i.e., chatGPT, create new opportunities to address the existing limitations of traditional counseling services. In that regard, we propose WMGPT, a system that offers round-the-clock mental health counseling services. By leveraging continuous analysis of user context and digital phenotype, WMGPT delivers personalized counseling support. Through 24/7 passive monitoring, it continuously assesses individualsâ€™ mental state, initiates conversations on their behalf, and potentially triggers counseling services. These specialized counseling services are facilitated by a fine-tuned chatGPT model. WMGPT presents a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional counseling by providing accessible, personalized, and timely mental health support, paving the way for a convenient and effective service for improving well-being.
