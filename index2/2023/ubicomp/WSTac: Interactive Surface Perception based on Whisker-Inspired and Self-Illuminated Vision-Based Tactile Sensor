Modern Visual-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) use cost-effective cameras to track elastomer deformation, but struggle with ambient light interference. Solutions typically involve using internal LEDs and blocking external light, thus adding complexity. Creating a VBTS resistant to ambient light with just a camera and an elastomer remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WStac, a self-illuminating VBTS comprising a mechanoluminescence (ML) whisker elastomer, camera, and 3D printed parts. The ML whisker elastomer, inspired by the touch sensitivity of vibrissae, offers both light isolation and high ML intensity under stress, thereby removing the necessity for additional LED modules. With the incorporation of machine learning, the sensor effectively utilizes the dynamic contact variations of 25 whiskers to successfully perform tasks like speed regression, directional identification, and texture classification.
