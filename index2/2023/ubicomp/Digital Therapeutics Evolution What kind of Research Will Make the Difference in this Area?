As in prescribable medical drug-based therapies, Digital Therapeutics (DTx) solutions introduce the use of software as 1) an active ingredient implemented as digital interventions to improve patientsâ€™ condition; and 2) as the excipient through which the intervention is conveyed to the patient. The most common DTx solutions implemented until today deal with the use of software-based solutions for dealing with mental health conditions. However, the potential of DTx is envisioned to grow to treat other health conditions with a number of technologies that still have not been duly explored. The objective of this workshop is to discuss the opportunities, barriers, and challenges of future DTx, the envisioned future use-cases, and the technologies with high potential to drive the uptake of these technologies, and this way to position this field as a solid complement of today's therapeutic approaches for dealing with different health conditions.
