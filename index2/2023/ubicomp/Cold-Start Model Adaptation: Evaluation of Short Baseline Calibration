Human physiology and reactions to external stimuli differ between individuals. Researchers have developed strategies to adapt to these differences but the adaptations generally require data from each individual beforehand. A cold-start occurs when there is no data from a new individual. To address this, current study proposes user calibration which uses short segments of easily obtainable baseline data to adapt to new individuals. Experiments were conducted on two public stress and affect detection datasets, WESAD and SWELL-KW, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method and to determine suitable duration of the baseline measurement. Results showed that user calibration always beat the non-personalized model and segments of 3-8 minutes seemed to be most promising to consider for future use.
