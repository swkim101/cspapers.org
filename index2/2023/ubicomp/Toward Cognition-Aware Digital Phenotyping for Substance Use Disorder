Digital phenotyping has been used in substance use disorder (SUD) research to predict substance consumption and monitor relevant symptoms. While various digital sensors have been utilized in SUD research, there is a lack of consideration for digital phenotypes that reflect cognitive functions. However, previous research has consistently shown the association of cognitive impairments with SUD and the positive effects of cognitive remediation in improving treatment outcomes. Given the role of cognitive functions in SUD, measuring and tracking the cognitive functions of patients can contribute to enhancing the process of intervention and treatment. Thus, this paper aims to facilitate the discussion of identifying and validating cognition-aware digital phenotyping in SUD. As a step toward this goal, this paper suggests the potential of a specific type of digital feature: keystroke dynamics. Keystroke dynamics have been found to be effective in estimating cognitive functions in various clinical domains. Future research needs to investigate if keystroke dynamics can be applied in SUD research and find other digital phenotypes that can measure the cognitive functions of patients with SUD.
