AirSpec is an extensible, environment-focused, research and development smart glasses platform that evolved from an existing open-source, psychophysiological monitoring system. We created custom supporting software toolkits that allow users to interact with the device, easily view real-time data, and perform remote data collection. In its base configuration, the system includes a variety of sensors that sample physiological and environmental signals and stream that data to a Bluetooth-connected client, either a phone running the AirSpec App or a Bluetooth-equipped computer via our website or a python script. In addition, AirSpecs have been made more extensible with multiple external electrical connections to support more applications and future sensor subsystems.
