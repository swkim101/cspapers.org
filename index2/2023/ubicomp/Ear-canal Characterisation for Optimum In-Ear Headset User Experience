Users listening to music, making phone calls or listening to the environment they are in (i.e. situational awareness) are having a sub-optimal user experience just because the in-ear headsets they are using are not optimised for each user but rather optimised for a general population (i.e. population average). The proposed method is one way of alleviating this problem by compensating for the usersâ€™ ear-canal shapes and size difference and including a correction EQqualiser (EQ) into the signal processing chain, for best and most compelling user experience.
