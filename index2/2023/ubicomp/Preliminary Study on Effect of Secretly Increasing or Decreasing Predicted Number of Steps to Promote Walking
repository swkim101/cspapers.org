With the widespread use of wearable devices, it is becoming easier to predict the future of an individual’s behavior regarding health. However, little is known about how presenting future predictions about an individual’s behavior affects awareness and behavior. The “StepUp Forecast” project is investigating walking behavior to clarify the impact of presenting predictions of the number of steps an individual will take on human behavior. In a previous study, it was found that self-efficacy and the number of steps taken increased significantly when the predicted number of steps was presented, compared with when only a record of the number of steps taken was shown. To advance this research, we investigated the effects of intentionally and secretly increasing or decreasing the predicted value rather than simply presenting it. Specifically, we observed changes in awareness and behavior when users were presented with a predicted value with 1,000 steps added or subtracted. In our 5-week experiment, 40 participants used StepUp Forecast, an application that presents the predicted number of steps on the basis of past life logs. The results indicate a non-significant but increasing trend in self-efficacy and number of steps added or subtracted compared with when only the step-count record was presented.
