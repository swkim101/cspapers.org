Empathy is the ability to perceive and understand other people's emotions and thoughts. Virtual reality (VR), as a new technology, offers a unique opportunity to induce empathy in individuals by allowing them to immerse themselves in realistic situations from another person's perspective. In this study, we have developed a virtual reality system that incorporates situational learning and immersive interaction. Through first-person perspective simulations, participants can experience the challenges and situations encountered by individuals with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The aim is to investigate the potential for altering public empathy and attitudes through this simulated experiential system. We hope our study could provide a new approach to health education strategies to enhance public empathy and attitudes toward people with schizophrenia.
