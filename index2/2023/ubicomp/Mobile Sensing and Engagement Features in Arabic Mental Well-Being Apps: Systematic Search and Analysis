Various mobile apps have been released to track and promote mental health and well-being. Despite the high interest in developing these apps, they suffer from high attrition rates. These apps have limited utility if they are delivered in a manner that does not maintain individualsâ€™ engagement. Engagement features are therefore a critical factor to consider for fostering intended benefits. While there is considerable research on analysing the engagement features of these apps available in English, our understanding of engagement features in such Arabic apps is limited. Moreover, much less is known about mobile sensing in Arabic apps. To address this gap, we systematically searched app stores, identified 110 apps available in Arabic, and analyzed their features based on existing mHealth assessment frameworks. Our analysis found that available Arabic apps poorly implemented engagement features, apart from basic features such as sharing and reminders. Surprisingly, Arabic apps missed mobile sensing capabilities and AI applications. This paper highlights the importance of employing mobile sensing and persuasive design principles in the future design of Arabic apps.
