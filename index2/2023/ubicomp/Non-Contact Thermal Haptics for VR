In the realm of virtual reality (VR), haptic feedback plays a pivotal role in enhancing user immersion. However, the implementation of non-contact thermal haptics presents numerous challenges. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for creating thermal haptic feedback in a VR environment, combining an ultrasonic phased array with a heating circuit. Our design generates multiple beams that deliver heated air to the user, thus simulating the sensation of temperature change. This approach enables an immersive, responsive VR experience that dynamically adjusts the temperature of the surrounding air based on the VR content. The innovation resides in our methodâ€™s ability to overcome traditional phased array limitations, such as grating lobes and high hardware costs, by leveraging the directionality of ultrasonic transducers within the array. This results in a more cost-effective, compact, and efficient thermal haptic feedback system. Our work thus offers a significant contribution to the field of VR, presenting a new way of enhancing user immersion through non-contact thermal haptics.
