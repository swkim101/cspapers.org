In recent years, more and more consumer earphones come equipped with inertial measurement units (IMUs). Using such sensors, past research has broadly explored earables for fitness applications, ranging from tracking higher-level workout activities to extracting precise gait-related parameters. Tying in with this research, we initially evaluated how the accelerometer inside earables may be leveraged to conduct vertical jump testing, which is a common standard measure to assess fitness. In a small study, four participants performed seven jump trials each. Using a simple analytical approach, we find that jump height can be calculated at 0.04 m mean absolute error with a median error of 0.02 m.
