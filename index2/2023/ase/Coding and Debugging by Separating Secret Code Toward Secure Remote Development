It is a higher priority for organizations to keep their source code secured. When a certain specific code includes a secret such as intellectual property, they need to pay special attention to prevent the secret code from leaking outside. On the other hand, sometimes code leaks comes from acts by inside programmers. This industrial paper proposes a MORDEn (Micro Organized Remote Development Environment) toward preventing code leaks. MORDEn enables programmers capable of coding and debugging by physically separating secret code from their client. We also introduce a showcase that demonstrates the feasibility of MORDEn from a case study project using it.
