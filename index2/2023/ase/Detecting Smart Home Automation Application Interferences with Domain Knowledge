Trigger-action programming (TAP) is a widely used development paradigm that simplifies the Internet of Things (loT) automation. However, the exceptional interactions between automation applications may result in interferences, such as conflicts and infinite loops, which cause undesirable consequences and even security and safety risks. While several techniques have been proposed to address this problem, they are often restricted in handling explicit and simple conflicts without considering contextual influences. In addition, they suffer from performance issues when applying to large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we design an effective and practical tool KnowDetector with comprehensive domain knowledge to detect application interferences. To detect application interferences, KnowDetector constructs an automation graph with 1) events, conditions, and actions from automation applications, 2) vertices representing physical environment channels, and 3) edges derived from potential semantic relations between the vertices. In order to make the graph extensively capture the interactions between automation applications, we propose a knowledge model named KnowloT that accurately characterizes loT devices with command-level loT services and the intricate relations between these services and the contextual environment. We abstract the interference detection into a graph pattern-matching problem and summarize ten application interference patterns of four types. Finally, KnowDetector can efficiently detect application interferences by searching for sub-graphs matching the patterns within the automation graph. We evaluated KnowDetector on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrated that it outperformed the other state-of-the-art tools with the highest precision, recall, and F-measure. In addition, KnowDetector is scalable to detect application interferences within a large number of applications with a minimal time overhead.
