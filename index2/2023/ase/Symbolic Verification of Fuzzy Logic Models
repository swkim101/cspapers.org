Fuzzy logic is widely applied in various applications. However, verifying the correctness of fuzzy logic models can be difficult. This extended abstract presents our ongoing work on verifying fuzzy logic models. We treat a fuzzy logic model as a program and propose a verification method based on symbolic execution for fuzzy logic models. We have developed and implemented the environment models for the common functions and the inference rules in fuzzy logic models. Our preliminary evaluation shows the potential of our verification method.
