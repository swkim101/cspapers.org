As software and cyber-physical systems interacting with humans become prevalent in domains such as healthcare, education and customer service, software engineers need to consider normative (i.e., social, legal, ethical, empathetic and cultural) requirements. However, their elicitation is challenging, as they must reflect the often conflicting or redundant views of stakeholders ranging from users and operators to lawyers, ethicists and regulators. To address this challenge, we introduce a tool-supported Formal framework for normaTive requirements elicitation (FormaTive). It allows specification of normative rules for a software system in an intuitive high-level language, and automates: (i) the mapping of the rules to an internal formal representation; (ii) their analysis to identify rule conflicts, redundancies, and concerns; and (iii) the synthesis of feedback enabling users to understand and resolve problems.
