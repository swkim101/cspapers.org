This poster presents new generic attacks on Feistel ciphers that incorporate the key addition at the input of the round function only. This feature leads to a specific vulnerability that can be exploited using multidimensional linear cryptanalysis. More specifically, our approach involves using key-independent linear trails so that the distribution of a combination of the plaintext and ciphertext can be computed, making it possible to use the likelihood-ratio test as a distinguisher. We provide theoretical estimates of the cost of our generic attacks, and verify these experimentally by applying the attacks to CAST-128 and LOKI91. The theoretical and experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed attacks lead to significant reductions in data or time complexity in several interesting cases.
