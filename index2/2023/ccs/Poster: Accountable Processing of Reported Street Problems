Municipalities increasingly depend on citizens to file digital reports about issues such as potholes or illegal trash dumps to improve their response time. However, the responsible authorities may be incentivized to ignore certain reports, e.g., when addressing them inflicts high costs. In this work, we explore the applicability of blockchain technology to hold authorities accountable regarding filed reports. Our initial assessment indicates that our approach can be extended to benefit citizens and authorities in the future.
