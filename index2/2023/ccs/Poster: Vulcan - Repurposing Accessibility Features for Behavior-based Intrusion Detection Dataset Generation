The generation of datasets is one of the most promising approaches to collecting the necessary behavior data to train machine learning models for host-based intrusion detection. While various dataset generation methods have been proposed, they are often limited and either only generate network traffic or are restricted to a narrow subset of applications. We present Vulcan, a preliminary framework that uses accessibility features to generate datasets by simulating user interactions for an extendable set of applications. It uses behavior profiles that define realistic user behavior and facilitate dataset updates upon changes in software versions, thus reducing the effort required to keep a dataset relevant. Preliminary results show that using accessibility features presents a promising approach to improving the quality of datasets in the HIDS domain.
