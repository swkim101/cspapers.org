We propose a 2-round blind signature protocol based on the random oracle heuristic and the hardness of standard lattice problems (Ring/Module-SIS/LWE and NTRU) with a signature size of 20 KB. The protocol is round-optimal and has a transcript size that can be as small as 60 KB. This blind signature is around 4 times shorter than the most compact lattice-based scheme based on standard assumptions of del Pino and Katsumata (Crypto 2022) and around 2 times shorter than the scheme of Agrawal et al. (CCS 2022) based on their newly-proposed one-more-ISIS assumption. We also propose a "keyed-verification'' blind signature scheme in which the verifier and the signer need to share a secret key. This scheme has a smaller signature size of only 48 bytes, but further work is needed to explore the efficiency of its signature generation protocol.
