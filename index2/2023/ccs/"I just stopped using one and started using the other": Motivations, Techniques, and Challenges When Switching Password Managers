This paper explores what motivates password manager (PM) users in the US to switch from one PM to another, the techniques they employ when switching, and challenges they encounter throughout. Through a screener (n = 412) followed by a main survey (n = 54), we find that browser-based PMs are the most widely used, with most of these users motivated to use the PM due to convenience. Unfortunately, password reuse remains high. Most participants that switch PMs do so for usability reasons, but are also motivated by cost, as third-party PMs' full suite of features often require a subscription fee. Some PM-switchers are also motivated by recent security breaches, such as what was reported at LastPass in the Fall of 2022, with some participants losing trust in LastPass and PMs generally as a result. Those that switch mostly employ manual techniques of moving their passwords, e.g., copying and pasting their credentials from their previous to their new PM, despite most PMs offering ways to automatically transfer credentials in bulk across PMs. Assistance during the switching process is limited, with less than half of participants that switched receiving guidance during the switching process. From these findings, we make recommendations to PMs that can improve their overall user experience and use, including eliciting and acting on regular feedback from users as well as making PM settings more easily reachable and customizable by end-users.
