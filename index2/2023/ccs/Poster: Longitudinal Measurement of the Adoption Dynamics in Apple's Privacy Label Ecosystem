This work reports on a large scale, longitudinal analysis of the adoption dynamics of privacy labels in the iOS App Store, measuring this first-of-its kind ecosystem as it reaches maturity over two and a half years after launching in December 2020. The motivation is to shed light on the factors affecting the shifts in privacy labels and provide insights into how and when an app's label changes. By collecting nearly weekly snapshots of over 1.6 million apps for over a year, we analyze the dynamics of privacy label adoption and the accuracy of reported labels. Our analysis of 74.5% of apps having labels after two years provides important context into this mature ecosystem where labels are becoming the standard. However, we find compelling evidence that labels may not fully capture behavior, as 28.9% of apps indicate no data collection and distributions differ between voluntary versus mandatory adoptions. Once set, labels rarely change but additions reflect more data collection. In addition to our measurement, we also plan to release a new (and growing) data set that can be used by future researchers.
