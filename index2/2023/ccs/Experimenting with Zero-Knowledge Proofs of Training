How can a model owner prove they trained their model according to the correct specification? More importantly, how can they do so while preserving the privacy of the underlying dataset and the final model? We study this problem and formulate the notion of zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT), which formalizes rigorous security guarantees that should be achieved by a privacy-preserving proof of training. While it is theoretically possible to design zkPoT for any model using generic zero-knowledge proof systems, this approach results in extremely unpractical proof generation times. Towards designing a practical solution, we propose the idea of combining techniques from MPC-in-the-head and zkSNARKs literature to strike an appropriate trade-off between proof size and proof computation time. We instantiate this idea and propose a concretely efficient, novel zkPoT protocol for logistic regression. Crucially, our protocol is streaming-friendly and does not require RAM proportional to the size of the training circuit, hence, can be done without special hardware. We expect the techniques developed in this paper to also generally be useful for designing efficient zkPoT protocols for other, more sophisticated, ML models. We implemented and benchmarked prover/verifier running times and proof sizes for training a logistic regression model using mini-batch gradient descent on a 4~GB dataset of 262,144 records with 1024 features. We divide our protocol into three phases: (1) data-independent offline phase (2) data-dependent phase that is independent of the model (3) online phase that depends both on the data and the model. The total proof size (across all three phases) is less than 10% of the data set size (<350 MB). In the online phase, the prover and verifier times are under 10 minutes and half a minute respectively, whereas in the data-dependent phase, they are close to one hour and a few seconds respectively.
