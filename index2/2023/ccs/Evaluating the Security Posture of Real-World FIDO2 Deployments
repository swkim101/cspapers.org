FIDO2 is a suite of protocols that combines the usability of local authentication (e.g., biometrics) with the security of public-key cryptography to deliver passwordless authentication. It eliminates shared authentication secrets (i.e., passwords, which could be leaked or phished) and provides strong security guarantees assuming the benign behavior of the client-side protocol components. However, when this assumption does not hold true, such as in the presence of malware, client authentications pose a risk that FIDO2 deployments must account for. FIDO2 provides recommendations for deployments to mitigate such situations. Yet, to date, there has been limited empirical investigation into whether deployments adopt these mitigations and what risks compromised clients present to real-world FIDO2 deployments, such as unauthorized account access or registration. In this work, we aim to fill in the gap by: 1) systematizing the threats to FIDO2 deployments when assumptions about the client-side protocol components do not hold, 2) empirically evaluating the security posture of real-world FIDO2 deployments across the Tranco Top 1K websites, considering both the server-side and client-side perspectives, and 3) synthesizing the mitigations that the ecosystem can adopt to further strengthen the practical security provided by FIDO2. Through our investigation, we identify that compromised clients pose a practical threat to FIDO2 deployments due to weak configurations, and known mitigations exhibit critical shortcomings and/or minimal adoption. Based on our findings, we propose directions for the ecosystem to develop additional defenses into their FIDO2 deployments. Ultimately, our work aims to drive improvements to FIDO2's practical security.
