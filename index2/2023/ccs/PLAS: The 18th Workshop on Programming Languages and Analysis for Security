PLAS provides a forum for exploring and evaluating the use of programming language and program analysis techniques for promoting security in the complete range of software systems, from compilers to machine-learned models and smart contracts. The workshop encourages proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in practical settings, and discussions of emerging threats and problems. We also host position papers that are radical, forward-looking, and lead to lively and insightful discussions influential to future research at the intersection of programming languages and security. This year will mark the 18th iteration of PLAS, which was first held in 2007 in San Diego. We expect an exciting program and many interesting discussions.
