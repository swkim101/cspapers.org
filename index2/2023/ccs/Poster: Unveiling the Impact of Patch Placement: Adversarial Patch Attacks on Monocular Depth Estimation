For autonomous driving systems, cameras and LiDAR sensors are necessary devices that provide precise depth information by which positions and sizes of objects can be identified. Moreover, recent advances in deep learning have extended their capabilities to include monocular camera setup for depth estimation. Compared with the conventional devices like LiDAR or stereo cameras for the depth estimation, the monocular camera enables to estimate depths with a low cost. It is known that the depth estimation models for the monocular camera are vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, most adversarial attacks against the monocular depth estimation have been conducted with targeted patches that are placed on a target object. It is known that the targeted patch outperforms the adjacent and remote patch that is placed beyond the target object, when it comes to an attack success rate. However, the adjacent and remote patch would provide high flexibility in patch placement, as it can be placed beyond the target object's scope. In this paper, we experimentally confirm that the patch placement significantly affects the attack success rates, particularly in specific regions.
