This paper studies Batch Private Information Retrieval (BatchPIR), a variant of private information retrieval (PIR) where the client wants to retrieve multiple entries from the server in one batch. BatchPIR matches the use case of many practical applications and holds the potential for substantial efficiency improvements over PIR in terms of amortized cost per query. Existing BatchPIR schemes have achieved decent computation efficiency but have not been able to improve communication efficiency at all. Using vectorized homomorphic encryption, we present the first BatchPIR protocol that is efficient in both computation and communication for a variety of database configurations. Specifically, to retrieve a batch of 256 entries from a database with one million entries of 256 bytes each, the communication cost of our scheme is 7.5x to 98.5x better than state-of-the-art solutions.
