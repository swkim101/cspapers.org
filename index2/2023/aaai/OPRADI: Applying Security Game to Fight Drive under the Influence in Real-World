Driving under the influence (DUI) is one of the main causes of traffic accidents, often leading to severe life and property losses. Setting up sobriety checkpoints on certain roads is the most commonly used practice to identify DUI-drivers in many countries worldwide. However, setting up checkpoints according to the police's experiences may not be effective for ignoring the strategic interactions between the police and DUI-drivers, particularly when inspecting resources are limited. To remedy this situation, we adapt the classic Stackelberg security game (SSG) to a new SSG-DUI game to describe the strategic interactions in catching DUI-drivers. SSG-DUI features drivers' bounded rationality and social knowledge sharing among them, thus realizing improved real-world fidelity. With SSG-DUI, we propose OPRADI, a systematic approach for advising better strategies in setting up checkpoints. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate it in both simulated environments and real-world contexts, in collaborating with a Chinese city's police bureau. The results reveal its effectiveness in improving police's real-world operations, thus having significant practical potentials.
