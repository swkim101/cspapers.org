We propose CARLA-FLMon, which can monitor the progress of running federated learning (FL) training in the open-source autonomous driving simulation software, CARLA. The purpose of CARLA-FLMon is to visually present the status and results of federated learning training, and to provide an extensible FL training environment with which FL training can be performed repeatedly with updated learning strategies through analysis. With CARLA-FLMon, we can determine what factors have positive or negative influences on learning by visualizing training data. Then, we can optimize the parameters of the FL training model to improve the accuracy of FL. With preliminary experiments of CARLA-FLMon on lane recognition, we demonstrate that CARLA-FLmon can increase the overall accuracy from 80.33% to 93.82% by identifying lowly-contributing clients and excluding them.
