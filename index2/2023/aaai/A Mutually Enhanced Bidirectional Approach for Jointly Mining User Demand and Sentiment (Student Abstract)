User demand mining aims to identify the implicit demand from the e-commerce reviews, which are always irregular, vague and diverse. Existing sentiment analysis research mainly focuses on aspect-opinion-sentiment triplet extraction, while the deeper user demands remain unexplored. In this paper, we formulate a novel research question of jointly mining aspect-opinion-sentiment-demand, and propose a Mutually Enhanced Bidirectional Extraction (MEMB) framework for capturing the dynamic interaction among different types of information. Finally, experiments on Chinese e-commerce data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.
