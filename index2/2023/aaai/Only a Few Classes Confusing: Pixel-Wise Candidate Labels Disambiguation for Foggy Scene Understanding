Not all semantics become confusing when deploying a semantic segmentation model for real-world scene understanding of adverse weather. The true semantics of most pixels have a high likelihood of appearing in the few top classes according to confidence ranking. In this paper, we replace the one-hot pseudo label with a candidate label set (CLS) that consists of only a few ambiguous classes and exploit its effects on self-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a coarse-to-fine process. In the coarse-level process, adaptive CLS selection is proposed to pick a minimal set of confusing candidate labels based on the reliability of label predictions. Then, representation learning and label rectification are iteratively performed to facilitate feature clustering in an embedding space and to disambiguate the confusing semantics. Experimentally, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three realistic foggy benchmarks.
