High-performing human teams leverage intelligent and efficient communication and coordination strategies to collaboratively maximize their joint utility. Inspired by teaming behaviors among humans, I seek to develop computational methods for synthesizing intelligent communication and coordination strategies for collaborative multi-robot systems. I leverage both classical model-based control and planning approaches as well as data-driven methods such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to provide several contributions towards enabling emergent cooperative teaming behavior across both homogeneous and heterogeneous (including agents with different capabilities) robot teams.
