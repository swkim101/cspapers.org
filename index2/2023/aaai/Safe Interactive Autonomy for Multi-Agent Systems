It is envisioned that in the near future autonomous systems such as multi-agent systems, will co-exist with humans, e.g., autonomous vehicles will share roads with human drivers. These safety-critical scenarios require formally provable safety guarantees so that the robots will never collide with humans or with each other. It is challenging to provide such guarantees in the real world due to the stochastic environments and inaccurate models of heterogeneous agents including robots and humans. My PhD research investigates decision-making algorithm design for provably-correct safety guarantees in mixed multi-agent systems.
