Dense passage retrieval aims to retrieve the relevant passages of a query from a large corpus based on dense representations (i.e., vectors) of the query and the passages. Recent studies have explored improving pre-trained language models to boost dense retrieval performance. This paper proposes CoT-MAE (ConTextual Masked Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective generative pre-training method for dense passage retrieval. CoT-MAE employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture that learns to compress the sentence semantics into a dense vector through self-supervised and context-supervised masked auto-encoding. Precisely, self-supervised masked auto-encoding learns to model the semantics of the tokens inside a text span, and context-supervised masked auto-encoding learns to model the semantical correlation between the text spans. We conduct experiments on large-scale passage retrieval benchmarks and show considerable improvements over strong baselines, demonstrating the high efficiency of CoT-MAE.
