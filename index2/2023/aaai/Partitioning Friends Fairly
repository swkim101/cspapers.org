We consider the problem of partitioning n agents in an undirected social network into k almost equal in size (differing by at most one) groups, where the utility of an agent for a group is the number of her neighbors in the group. The core and envy-freeness are two compelling axiomatic fairness guarantees in such settings. The former demands that there be no coalition of agents such that each agent in the coalition has more utility for that coalition than for her own group, while the latter demands that no agent envy another agent for the group they are in. We provide (often tight) approximations to both fairness guarantees, and many of our positive results are obtained via efficient algorithms.
