Video object detection (VID) is challenging because of the high variation of object appearance as well as the diverse deterioration in some frames. On the positive side, the detection in a certain frame of a video, compared with that in a still image, can draw support from other frames. Hence, how to aggregate features across different frames is pivotal to VID problem. Most of existing aggregation algorithms are customized for two-stage detectors. However, these detectors are usually computationally expensive due to their two-stage nature. This work proposes a simple yet effective strategy to address the above concerns, which costs marginal overheads with significant gains in accuracy. Concretely, different from traditional two-stage pipeline, we select important regions after the one-stage detection to avoid processing massive low-quality candidates. Besides, we evaluate the relationship between a target frame and reference frames to guide the aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the efficacy of our design, and reveal its superiority over other state-of-the-art VID approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency. Our YOLOX-based model can achieve promising performance (e.g., 87.5% AP50 at over 30 FPS on the ImageNet VID dataset on a single 2080Ti GPU), making it attractive for large-scale or real-time applications. The implementation is simple, we have made the demo codes and models available at https://github.com/YuHengsss/YOLOV.
