Brain-computer Interface (BCI) builds a neural signal to the motor command pathway, which is a prerequisite for the realization of neural prosthetics. However, a long-term stable BCI suffers from the neural data drift across days while retraining the BCI decoder is expensive and restricts its application scenarios. Recent solutions of neural signal recalibration treat the continuous neural signals as discrete, which is less effective in temporal feature extraction. Inspired by the observation from biologists that low-dimensional dynamics could describe high-dimensional neural signals, we model the underlying neural dynamics and propose a semantic-dynamic feature that represents the semantics and dynamics in a shared feature space facilitating the BCI recalibration. Besides, we present the joint distribution alignment instead of the common used marginal alignment strategy, dealing with the various complex changes in neural data distribution. Our recalibration approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real neural data of two monkeys in both classification and regression tasks. Our approach is also evaluated on a simulated dataset, which indicates its robustness in dealing with various common causes of neural signal instability.
