Modern object detectors are ill-equipped to incrementally learn new emerging object classes over time due to the well-known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. Due to data privacy or limited storage, few or no images of the old data can be stored for replay. In this paper, we design a novel One-Shot Replay (OSR) method for incremental object detection, which is an augmentation-based method. Rather than storing original images, only one object-level sample for each old class is stored to reduce memory usage significantly, and we find that copy-paste is a harmonious way to replay for incremental object detection. In the incremental learning procedure, diverse augmented samples with co-occurrence of old and new objects to existing training data are generated. To introduce more variants for objects of old classes, we propose two augmentation modules. The object augmentation module aims to enhance the ability of the detector to perceive potential unknown objects. The feature augmentation module explores the relations between old and new classes and augments the feature space via analogy. Extensive experimental results on VOC2007 and COCO demonstrate that OSR can outperform the state-of-the-art incremental object detection methods without using extra wild data.
