There has been a consensus on integrating Computing into the teaching and learning of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) subjects in K-12 (Kindergarten to 12th grade in the US education system). However, rigorous study on the impact of an integrated curriculum on students' learning in computing and/or the STEM subject(s) is still rare. In this paper, we report our research on how well an integrated curriculum helps middle school students learn Computing through the microgenetic analysis methods.
