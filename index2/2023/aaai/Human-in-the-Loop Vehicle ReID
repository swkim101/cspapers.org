Vehicle ReID has been an active topic in computer vision, with a substantial number of deep neural models proposed as end-to-end solutions. In this paper, we solve the problem from a new perspective and present an interesting variant called human-in-the-loop vehicle ReID to leverage interactive (and possibly wrong) human feedback signal for performance enhancement. Such human-machine cooperation mode is orthogonal to existing ReID models. To avoid incremental training overhead, we propose an Interaction ReID Network (IRIN) that can directly accept the feedback signal as an input and adjust the embedding of query image in an online fashion. IRIN is offline trained by simulating the human interaction process, with multiple optimization strategies to fully exploit the feedback signal. Experimental results show that even by interacting with flawed feedback generated by non-experts, IRIN still outperforms state-of-the-art ReID models by a considerable margin. If the feedback contains no false positive, IRIN boosts the mAP in Veri776 from 81.6% to 95.2% with only 5 rounds of interaction per query image.
