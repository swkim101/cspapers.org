Event cameras are a kind of bio-inspired imaging sensor, which asynchronously collect sparse event streams with many advantages. In this paper, we focus on building better and faster event-based object detectors. To this end, we first propose a computationally efficient event representation Hyper Histogram, which adequately preserves both the polarity and temporal information of events. Then we devise an Adaptive Event Conversion module, which converts events into Hyper Histograms according to event density via an adaptive queue. Moreover, we introduce a novel event-based augmentation method Shadow Mosaic, which significantly improves the event sample diversity and enhances the generalization ability of detection models. We equip our proposed modules on three representative object detection models: YOLOv5, Deformable-DETR, and RetinaNet. Experimental results on three event-based detection datasets (1Mpx, Gen1, and MVSEC-NIGHTL21) demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, while achieving a much faster running speed (< 14 ms and < 4 ms for 50 ms event data on the 1Mpx and Gen1 datasets).
