The mobile communication enabled by cellular networks is the one of the main foundations of our modern society. Optimizing the performance of cellular networks and providing massive connectivity with improved coverage and user experience has a considerable social and economic impact on our daily life. This performance relies heavily on the configuration of the network parameters. However, with the massive increase in both the size and complexity of cellular networks, network management, especially parameter configuration, is becoming complicated. The current practice, which relies largely on experts' prior knowledge, is not adequate and will require lots of domain experts and high maintenance costs. In this work, we propose a learning-based framework for handover parameter configuration. The key challenge, in this case, is to tackle the complicated dependencies between neighboring cells and jointly optimize the whole network. Our framework addresses this challenge in two ways. First, we introduce a novel approach to imitate how the network responds to different network states and parameter values, called auto-grouping graph convolutional network (AG-GCN). During the parameter configuration stage, instead of solving the global optimization problem, we design a local multi-objective optimization strategy where each cell considers several local performance metrics to balance its own performance and its neighbors. We evaluate our proposed algorithm via a simulator constructed using real network data. We demonstrate that the handover parameters our model can find, achieve better average network throughput compared to those recommended by experts as well as alternative baselines, which can bring better network quality and stability. It has the potential to massively reduce costs arising from human expert intervention and maintenance.
