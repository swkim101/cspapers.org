Question generation is the parallel task of question answering, where given an input context and, optionally, an answer, the goal is to generate a relevant and fluent natural language question. Although recent works on question generation have experienced success by utilizing sequence-to-sequence models, there is a need for question generation models to handle increasingly complex input contexts to produce increasingly detailed questions. Multi-hop question generation is a more challenging task that aims to generate questions by connecting multiple facts from multiple input contexts. In this work, we apply a transformer model to the task of multi-hop question generation without utilizing any sentence-level supporting fact information. We utilize concepts that have proven effective in single-hop question generation, including a copy mechanism and placeholder tokens. We evaluate our modelâ€™s performance on the HotpotQA dataset using automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR and show an improvement over the previous work.
