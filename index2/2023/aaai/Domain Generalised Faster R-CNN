Domain generalisation (i.e. out-of-distribution generalisation)
is an open problem in machine learning, where the goal is
to train a model via one or more source domains, that will
generalise well to unknown target domains. While the topic
is attracting increasing interest, it has not been studied in
detail in the context of object detection. The established approaches
all operate under the covariate shift assumption,
where the conditional distributions are assumed to be approximately
equal across source domains. This is the first
paper to address domain generalisation in the context of object
detection, with a rigorous mathematical analysis of domain
shift, without the covariate shift assumption. We focus on
improving the generalisation ability of object detection by
proposing new regularisation terms to address the domain
shift that arises due to both classification and bounding box
regression. Also, we include an additional consistency regularisation
term to align the local and global level predictions.
The proposed approach is implemented as a Domain
Generalised Faster R-CNN and evaluated using four object
detection datasets which provide domain metadata (GWHD,
Cityscapes, BDD100K, Sim10K) where it exhibits a consistent
performance improvement over the baselines. All the
