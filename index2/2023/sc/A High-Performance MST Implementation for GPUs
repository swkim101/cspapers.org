Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) is a fundamental graph algorithm with applications in many fields. This paper presents ECL-MST, a fast MST implementation designed specifically for GPUs. ECL-MST is based on a parallelization approach that unifies Kruskal's and Bor≈Øvka's algorithm and incorporates new and existing optimizations from the literature, including implicit path compression and edge-centric operation. On two test systems, it outperforms leading GPU and CPU codes from the literature on all of our 17 input graphs from various domains. On a Titan V GPU, ECL-MST is, on average, 4.6 times faster than the next fastest code, and on an RTX 3080 Ti GPU, it is 4.5 times faster. On both systems, ECL-MST running on the GPU is roughly 30 times faster than the fastest parallel CPU code.
