People are increasingly concerned about how tectonic processes affect climate and vice versa. We establish a cross-sphere modeling system for volcanic eruptions and atmosphere circulation on a new Sunway supercomputer with a spatial resolution from 10m locally to 3km globally, using an improved multimedium and mul-tiphase smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) combined with a fully coupled meteorology-chemistry global atmospheric modeling scheme. We achieve 400 billion particles and 80% parallel efficiency using 39,000,000 processor cores. The simulation captures the whole dynamic process of the Tonga eruption from shock waves, earth-quakes, tsunamis, mushroom clouds to the following 6â€“7 days of transport and diffusion of ash and water vapor, and preliminarily obtains the influence effect of full coupling of volcano, earthquake, ocean and atmosphere. This work is of great significance for deeply understanding the interaction between tectonic processes and climate change, and establishing an early warning simulation system for similar global hazard events.
