ENRICO is a coupled application developed under the U.S. Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project (ECP) targeting the modeling of advanced nuclear reactors. It couples radiation transport with heat and fluid simulation, including the high-fidelity, high-resolution Monte-Carlo code Shift and the Computational fluid dynamics code NekRS. NekRS is a highly-performant open-source code for simulation of incompressible and low-Mach fluid flow, heat transfer, and combustion with a particular focus on turbulent flows in complex domains. It is based on rapidly convergent high-order spectral element discretizations that feature minimal numerical dissipation and dispersion. State-of-the-art multilevel preconditioners, efficient high-order time-splitting methods, and runtime-adaptive communication strategies are built on a fast OCCA-based kernel library, libParanumal, to provide scalability and portability across the spectrum of current and future high-performance computing platforms. On Frontier, Nek5000/RS has recently achieved an un-precedented milestone in breaching over 1 billion spectral elements and 350 billion degrees of freedom. Shift has demonstrated the capability to transport upwards of 1 billion particles per second in full core nuclear reactor simulations featuring complete temperature-dependent, continuous-energy physics on Frontier. Shift achieved a weak-scaling efficiency of 97.8% on 8192 nodes of Frontier and calculated 6 reactions in 214,896 fuel pin regions below 1% statistical error yielding first-of-a-kind resolution for a Monte Carlo transport application.
