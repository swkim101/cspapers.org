Physical phenomenon such as protein folding requires simulation up to microseconds of physical time, which directly corresponds to the strong scaling of molecular dynamics(MD) on modern supercomputers. In this paper, we present a highly scalable implementation of the state-of-the-art MD code LAMMPS on Fugaku by exploiting the 6D mesh/torus topology of the TofuD network. Based on our detailed analysis of the MD communication pattern, we first adapt coarse-grained peer-to-peer ghost-region communication with uTofu interface, then further improve the scalability via fine-grained thread pool. Finally, Remote direct memory access (RDMA) primitives are utilized to avoid buffer overhead. Numerical results show that our optimized code can reduce 77% of the communication time, improving the performance of baseline LAMMPS by a factor of 2.9x and 2.2x for Lennard-Jones and embedded-atom method potentials when scaling to 36, 846 computing nodes. Our optimization techniques can also benefit other applications with stencil or domain decomposition methods.
