Quantum perturbation theory is pivotal in determining the critical physical properties of materials. The first-principles computations of these properties have yielded profound and quantitative insights in diverse domains of chemistry and physics. In this work, we propose a portable and scalable OpenCL implementation for quantum perturbation theory, which can be generalized across various high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Optimal portability is realized through the utilization of a cross-platform unified interface and a collection of performance-portable heterogeneous optimizations. Exceptional scalability is attained by addressing major constraints on memory and communication, employing a locality-enhancing task mapping strategy and a packed hierarchical collective communication scheme. Experiments on two advanced supercomputers demonstrate that our implementation exhibits remarkably performance on various material systems, scaling the system to 200,000 atoms with all-electron precision. This research enables all-electron quantum perturbation simulations on substantially larger molecular scales, with a potentially significant impact on progress in material sciences.
