In this paper, we aim to understand the properties and guarantees of static partitioning hypervisors (SPH) for Arm-based mixed-criticality systems (MCS). To this end, we performed a comprehensive empirical evaluation of popular open-source SPH, i.e., Jailhouse, Xen (Dom0-less), Bao, and seL4 CAmkES VMM, focusing on two key requirements of modern MCS: real-time and safety. The goal of this study is twofold. Firstly, to empower industrial practitioners with hard data to reason about the different trade-offs of SPH. Secondly, we aim to raise awareness of the research and open-source communities to the still open problems in SPH by unveiling new insights regarding lingering weaknesses. All artifacts will be open-sourced to enable independent validation of results and encourage further exploration on SPH.
