Emerging deep neural network (DNN) applications require high-performance multi-core hardware acceleration with large data bursts. Classical network-on-chips (NoCs) use serial packet-based protocols suffering from significant protocol translation overheads towards the endpoints. This paper proposes PATRONoC, an open-source fully AXI-compliant NoC fabric to better address the specific needs of multi-core DNN computing platforms. Evaluation of PATRONoC in a 2D-mesh topology shows 34 % higher area efficiency compared to a state-of-the-art classical NoC at 1 GHz. PATRONoC’s throughput outperforms a baseline NoC by 2-8× on uniform random traffic and provides a high aggregated throughput of up to 350 GiB/s on synthetic and DNN workload traffic.
