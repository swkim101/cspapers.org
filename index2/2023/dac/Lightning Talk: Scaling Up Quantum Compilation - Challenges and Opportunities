The past decade witnessed exciting advances in quantum computing (QC) platforms. For example, superconducting qubit systems of over a hundred qubits have been developed and are now commercially available [1] , [2] . Trapped ion systems in long chains or quantum charge-coupled device (CCD) [3] architectures have also been developed, reaching very low gate errors [4] , [5] . Recently, neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical tweezers emerged as a very promising experimental platform with hundreds of qubits at room temperature for programmable quantum simulations and quantum computation [6] , [7] . Figure 1 illustrates the rapid growth of the capacity of these QC platforms in recent years. With IBMâ€™s recent announcement of the plan for building a 100,000-qubit quantum processing unit (QPU) [8] , there is a strong need to scale up the capacity and performance of quantum compilation tools to match the rapid advances of quantum hardware.
