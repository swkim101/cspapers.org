The triple whammy of variability in platforms (e.g., process variability), applications (e.g., dynamic use cases in autonomous systems), and the environment (e.g., context) renders ineffective the classical computational/algorithmic/numerical computing paradigm in dealing with the inherent runtime dynamism and uncertainty faced by emerging systems. We posit that this requires a fundamental change from classical "static" computing to a new era that deploys a computational cognitive intelligence (CCI) paradigm that is able to learn and evolve at runtime. The CCI paradigm empowers systems to be adaptable and evolvable by exploiting biologically-inspired cognitive intelligence principles.
