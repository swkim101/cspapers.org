Persistent transactional memory (PTM) exploits transactions to provide an easy crash-consistent interface for persistent memory (PM). However, because of the substantial reader-side overhead brought on by the low bandwidth and long persistence latency of PM, present PTM research cannot scale effectively. This paper proposes a highly scalable PTM system, DRPTM, which allows nearly non-overhead reads without lowering the isolation level. DRPTM decouples persistence latency from concurrency control and traces the read-only copy maintained in logs as a lightweight read set. The evaluation shows that DRPTM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art PTM systems for various workloads and achieves near-linear scalability.
