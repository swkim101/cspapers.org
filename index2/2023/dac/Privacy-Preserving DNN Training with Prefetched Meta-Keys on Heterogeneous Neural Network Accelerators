The embedded software may migrate the collected data to the server for DNN computation acceleration, which may compromise privacy. We propose a DNN computation framework that combines TEE and NNA to address the privacy leakage problem. We design an NNA-friendly encryption method that enables NNA to correctly compute the encrypted linear input. Facing the overhead of TEE-NNA interaction, we design a pipeline-based prefetch mechanism that can reduce the TEE interaction overhead. Experimentally, our approach proves to be compatible with a wide range of NPUs and TPUs, and improves the performance by 8-19 times over the TEE scheme.
