This paper discusses the various technologies used for quantum computing and highlights the need for compiler and software stack solutions that are portable across different technologies (beyond superconducting qubit quantum computers) while providing a higher-level interface that allows scientists to run their programs in a technology-agnostic manner. To achieve this, quantum compilers and architecture designs must not be bound by classical-style standards and specifications. As a first step toward tackling this challenge, this paper then focuses on developing a compiler solution for neutral atom quantum computing technology, which has several potential benefits over superconducting qubit quantum computing technology.These benefits include a greater connectivity of qubits within the Rydberg interaction radius, which allows for fewer SWAP operations, and the ability to execute multi-qubit gates directly. However, neutral atom quantum computers have a different set of constraints and requirements, including interaction blockades, which can result in potential serialization of operations, reducing some of the gains due to the better connectivity of neutral atom quantum computers. The paper then concludes by stating that addressing these challenges requires further research and development in the field.
