Emerging cross-point memory can in-situ perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) for energy-efficient scientific computation. However, parasitic-capacitance-induced row charging and discharging latency is a major performance bottleneck of subarray VMM. We propose a memory-timing-compliant bulk VMM processing-using-memory design with row access and column access co-optimization from rethinking of read access commands and µ-op timing. We propose row-level-parallelism-adaptive timing termination mechanism to reduce tail latency of tRCD and tRP by exploiting row nonlinear charging and bulk-interleaved row-column-cooperative VMM access mechanism to reduce tRAS and overlap CL without increasing column ADC precision. Evaluations show that our design can achieve 5.03× performance speedup compared with an aggressive baseline.
