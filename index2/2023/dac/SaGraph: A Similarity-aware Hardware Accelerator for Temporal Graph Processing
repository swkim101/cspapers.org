Temporal graph processing is used to handle the snapshots of the temporal graph, which concerns changes in graph over time. Although several software/hardware solutions have been designed for efficient temporal graph processing, they still suffer from serious irregular data access due to the uncoordinated graph traversal. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes SaGraph, a domain-specific hardware accelerator to support the efficient processing of temporal graph. Specifically, temporal graph processing shows strong data access similarity, i.e., most graph accesses of the processing of different snapshots are the same and usually refer to a small fraction of vertices. SaGraph can dynamically coordinate the graph traversals and adaptively cache the vertex states to fully exploit the data access similarity for smaller data access overhead. We implemented and evaluated SaGraph on a Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA card. Compared with the cutting-edge software and hardware solutions, SaGraph achieves 8.5×-157.3×, 4.2×-16.1× speedups and 34.7×-423.6×, 5.3×-14.7× energy savings, respectively.
