Robots need to understand articulated objects, such as drawers. The state of articulated structures is commonly estimated using vision, but visual perception is limited when objects are occluded, have few salient features, or are not in the camera's field of view. Audio sensing does not face these challenges, since sound propagates in a fundamentally different way than light. Therefore we propose to fuse vision and audio sensing to overcome the challenges faced by vision alone. We estimate motion in several drawers and show that an audio-visual approach estimates drawer motion more reliably than only vision â€“ even in settings where the purely visual approach completely breaks down. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the regularities that govern how motion in drawers shapes their sound.
