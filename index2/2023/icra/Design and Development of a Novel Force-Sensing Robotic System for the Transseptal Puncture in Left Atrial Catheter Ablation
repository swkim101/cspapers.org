Transseptal puncture (TSP) is a prerequisite for left atrial catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, requiring access from the right side of the heart. It is a demanding procedural step associated with complications, including inadvertent puncturing and application of large forces on the tissue wall. Robotic systems have shown great potential to overcome such challenges by introducing force-sensing capabilities and increased precision and localization accuracy. Therefore, this work introduces the design and development of a novel robotic system developed to perform TSP. We integrated optoelectronic sensors into the tools' fixtures, measuring tissue contact and puncture forces along one axis. The novelty of this design is in the system's ability to manipulate a Brockenbrough (BRK) needle and dilator-sheath simultaneously and measure tissue contact and puncture forces. In performing puncture experiments on anthropomorphic tissue models, an average puncture force of 3.97 Â± 0.45 N (1SD) was established - similar to the force reported in literature on the manual procedure. This research highlights the potential for improving patient safety by enforcing force constraints, paving the way to more automated and safer TSP.
