Recent work in visual end-to-end learning for robotics has shown the promise of imitation learning across a variety of tasks. Such approaches are however expensive both because they require large amounts of real world data and rely on time-consuming real-world evaluations to identify the best model for deployment. These challenges can be mitigated by using simulation evaluations to identify high performing policies. However, this introduces the well-known “reality gap” problem, where simulator inaccuracies decorrelate performance in simulation from that of reality. In this paper, we build on top of prior work in GAN-based domain adaptation and introduce the notion of a Task Consistency Loss (TCL), a self-supervised loss that encourages sim and real alignment both at the feature and action-prediction levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by teaching a 9-DoF mobile manipulator to perform the challenging task of latched door opening purely from visual inputs such as RGB and depth images. We achieve 69% success across twenty seen and unseen meeting rooms using only ~ 16.2 hours of teleoperated demonstrations in sim and real. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle latched door opening from a purely end-to-end learning approach, where the task of navigation and manipulation are jointly modeled by a single neural network.
