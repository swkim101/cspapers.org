Designing a socially-aware navigation method for crowded environments has become a critical issue in robotics. In order to perform navigation in a crowded environment without causing discomfort to nearby pedestrians, it is necessary to design a global planner that is able to consider both human-robot interaction (HRI) and prediction of future states. In this paper, we propose a socially-aware global planner called SCAN, which is a global planner that generates appropriate local goals considering HRI and prediction of future states. Our method simulates future states considering the effects of the robot's actions on the future intentions of pedestrians using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), which estimates the quality of local goals. For fast simulation, we execute pedestrian motion prediction using Y-net and future state simulation using MCTS in parallel. Neural networks are only used in Y-net and not in MCTS, which enables fast simulation and prediction of a long horizon of future states. We evaluate the proposed method based on the proposed socially-aware navigation metric using realistic pedestrian simulation and real-world experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods significantly, indicating the importance of considering human-robot interaction for socially-aware navigation.
