In-space assembly is crucial to creating large-scale space structures and enabling long term space missions. Natural limitations in the size of transportation vehicles and ISRU production facilities necessitate an additive strategy with the size of the typical structural unit being essentially fixed and inversely proportional to the final assembly size. In prior robotic and space assembly examples, reversible mechanical integration of structural modules is typically achieved with actuated alignment and fastening mechanisms onboard every structural module. Additive assembly or manufacturing planning approaches often feature a “build front” that receives new materials or parts and progresses gradually across the target geometry. The system we describe here places much of the alignment and fastener actuation systems onboard a mobile robot that can operate at a build front while companion robots (Scaling Omni-directional Lattice Locomoting Explorer, SOLL-E) provide part or material transportation. The design and evaluation of this Mobile Meta-Material Interior Co-Integrator (MMIC-I), an inchworm-style locomoting robotic assembler, is described here with an emphasis on ease of assembly and a low number of unique parts for a simple design. It is designed to assist in alignment of cuboctahedron structural unit cells with captive fasteners, defining the build front in operation. Adjacent structural unit cells are locked together with specified axial and rotational actuation of the fasteners. Hardware prototypes show that the robot is able to successfully locomote to any indexed location within a lattice structure and bolt together each set of fasteners on any interface.
