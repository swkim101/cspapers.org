Miniaturized autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging and trending topic. With their form factor as big as the palm of one hand, they can reach spots otherwise inaccessible to bigger robots and safely operate in human surroundings. The simple electronics aboard such robots (sub-100 mW) make them particularly cheap and attractive but pose significant challenges in enabling onboard sophisticated intelligence. In this work, we leverage a novel neural architecture search (NAS) technique to automatically identify several Pareto-optimal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for a visual pose estimation task. Our work demonstrates how reallife and field-tested robotics applications can concretely leverage NAS technologies to automatically and efficiently optimize CNNs for the specific hardware constraints of small UAVs. We deploy several NAS-optimized CNNs and run them in closed-loop aboard a 27-g Crazyflie nano-UAV equipped with a parallel ultra-low power System-on-Chip. Our results improve the State-of-the-Art by reducing the in-field control error of 32% while achieving a real-time onboard inference-rate of ~10Hz@10mW and ~50Hz@90mW.
