Accurately manipulating articulated objects is a challenging yet important task for real robot applications. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Sim2Real$^2$ to enable the robot to manipulate an unseen articulated object to the desired state precisely in the real world with no human demonstrations. We leverage recent advances in physics simulation and learning-based perception to build the interactive explicit physics model of the object and use it to plan a long-horizon manipulation trajectory to accomplish the task. However, the interactive model cannot be correctly estimated from a static observation. Therefore, we learn to predict the object affordance from a single-frame point cloud, control the robot to actively interact with the object with a one-step action, and capture another point cloud. Further, the physics model is constructed from the two point clouds. Experimental results show that our framework achieves about 70% manipulations with<30% relative error for common articulated objects, and 30% manipulations for difficult objects. Our proposed framework also enables advanced manipulation strategies, such as manipulating with different tools.
