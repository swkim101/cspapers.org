How does a wheeled robot move and turn? The answer is straightforward for a conventional wheeled robot, but it is not so easy for a robot with a discrete wheel design. Regular wheeled robots always have four contact points, resulting in static stability during locomotion. However, QuadRunner's novel leg mechanism provides only a semi-circular wheel shape, and proper gait planning is needed to go straight or turn. Therefore, this paper presents a dual frequency gait planning method which controls the robot's gait cycle's duty factor and generates unique turning gait patterns for wheel locomotion. Describing requirements and limitations, we found sets of solutions that can achieve turning. Results show that the smallest turning radius QuadRunner achieved is 1.05m, and the biggest is 1.86m. In addition, detailed experiments were made to observe the performance and stability of straight and turning wheel behaviors. Finally, a gait verification is made using high-speed cameras.
