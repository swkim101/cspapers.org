Outdoor 3D object detection has played an essential role in the environment perception of autonomous driving. In complicated traffic situations, precise object recognition provides indispensable information for prediction and planning in the dynamic system, improving self-driving safety and reliability. However, with the vehicle's veering, the constant rotation of the surrounding scenario makes a challenge for the perception systems. Yet most existing methods have not focused on alleviating the detection accuracy impairment brought by the vehicle's rotation, especially in outdoor 3D detection. In this paper, we propose DuEqNet, which first introduces the concept of equivariance into 3D object detection network by leveraging a hierarchical embedded framework. The dual-equivariance of our model can extract the equivariant features at both local and global levels, respectively. For the local feature, we utilize the graph-based strategy to guarantee the equivariance of the feature in point cloud pillars. In terms of the global feature, the group equivariant convolution layers are adopted to aggregate the local feature to achieve the global equivariance. In the experiment part, we evaluate our approach with different baselines in 3D object detection tasks and obtain State-Of-The-Art performance. According to the results, our model presents higher accuracy on orientation and better prediction efficiency. Moreover, our dual-equivariance strategy exhibits the satisfied plug-and-play ability on various popular object detection frameworks to improve their performance.
