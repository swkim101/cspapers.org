Despite the growing interest in the use of drone fleets for delivery of food and parcels, the negative impact of such technology is still poorly understood. In this paper we investigate the impact of such fleets in terms of noise pollution and environmental justice. We use simulation with real population data to analyze the spatial distribution of noise, and find that: 1) noise increases rapidly with fleet size; and 2) drone fleets can produce noise hotspots that extend far beyond warehouses or charging stations, at levels that lead to annoyance and interference of human activities. This, we will show, leads to concerns of fairness of noise distribution. We then propose an algorithm that successfully balances the spatial distribution of noise across the city, and discuss the limitations of such purely technical approaches. We complement the work with a discussion of environmental justice, showing how careless UAV fleet development and regulation can lead to reinforcing well-being deficiencies of poor and marginalized communities.
