Cochlear implants (CIs) can improve hearing in patients suffering from sensorineural hearing loss via an electrode array (EA) carefully inserted in the scala tympani. Current EAs can cause trauma during insertion, threatening hearing preservation; hence we proposed a pre-curved thermally drawn EA that curls into the cochlea under the influence of body temperature. However, the additional surgical skill required to insert pre-curved EAs usually produces worse surgical outcomes. Medical robots can offer an effective solution to assist surgeons in improving surgical outcomes and reducing outliers. This work proposes a collaborative approach to insert our EA where manageable tasks are automated using a vision-based system. The insertion strategy presented allowed us to insert our EA successfully. The feasibility study showed that we can insert EAs following the defined control strategy while keeping the exerted contact forces within safe levels. The teleoperated robotic system and robotic vision approach to control a self-shaping CI has thus shown potential to provide the tools for a more delicate and atraumatic approach.
