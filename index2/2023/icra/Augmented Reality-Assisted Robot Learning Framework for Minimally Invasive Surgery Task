This paper presents an Augmented Reality (AR)assisted robot learning framework for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) tasks. The proposed framework exploits an external optical tracking system to collect human demonstration. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) are utilized to encode and generate a robust desired trajectory for transferring to the real robot for the MIS task. The HoloLens 2 Head-Mounted-Display (HMD) is integrated for intuitive visualization of the robot configuration under the constraint of a small incision on the patient's abdominal cavity during the demonstration phase. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed framework and compared it with the kinesthetic teaching-based modality in a tumor resection MIS task. The results illustrate that the proposed AR-assisted robot learning framework requires lower workload demand, achieves higher performance and efficiency, and ensures the feasibility of the learned results for reproduction on a real robot for MIS tasks.
