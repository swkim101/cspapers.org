Vision-based tactile sensors that can measure 3D geometry of the contacting objects are crucial for robots to perform dexterous manipulation tasks. However, the existing sensors are usually complicated to fabricate and delicate to extend. In this work, we novelly take advantage of the reflection property of semitransparent elastomer to design a robust, low-cost, and easy-to-fabricate tactile sensor named DTact. DTact measures high-resolution 3D geometry accurately from the darkness shown in the captured tactile images with only a single image for calibration. In contrast to previous sensors, DTact is robust under various illumination conditions. Then, we build prototypes of DTact that have non-planar contact surfaces with minimal extra efforts and costs. Finally, we perform two intelligent robotic tasks including pose estimation and object recognition using DTact, in which DTact shows large potential in applications.
