Autonomous UAV path planning for 3D reconstruction has been actively studied in various applications for high-quality 3D models. However, most existing works have adopted explore-then-exploit, prior-based or exploration-based strategies, demonstrating inefficiency with repeated flight and low autonomy. In this paper, we propose PredRecon, a prediction-boosted planning framework that can autonomously generate paths for high 3D reconstruction quality. We obtain inspiration from humans can roughly infer the complete construction structure from partial observation. Hence, we devise a surface prediction module (SPM) to predict the coarse complete surfaces of the target from the current partial reconstruction. Then, the uncovered surfaces are produced by online volumetric mapping waiting for observation by UAV. Lastly, a hierarchical planner plans motions for 3D reconstruction, which sequentially finds efficient global coverage paths, plans local paths for maximizing the performance of Multi-View Stereo (MVS), and generates smooth trajectories for image-pose pairs acquisition. We conduct benchmarks in the realistic simulator, which validates the performance of PredRecon compared with the classical and state-of-the-art methods.
