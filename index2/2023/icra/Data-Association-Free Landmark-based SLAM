We study landmark-based SLAM with unknown data association: our robot navigates in a completely unknown environment and has to simultaneously reason over its own trajectory, the positions of an unknown number of landmarks in the environment, and potential data associations between measurements and landmarks. This setup is interesting since: (i) it arises when recovering from data association failures or from SLAM with information-poor sensors, (ii) it sheds light on fundamental limits (and hardness) of landmark-based SLAM problems irrespective of the front-end data association method, and (iii) it generalizes existing approaches where data association is assumed to be known or partially known. We approach the problem by splitting it into an inner problem of estimating the trajectory, landmark positions and data associations and an outer problem of estimating the number of landmarks. Our approach creates useful and novel connections with existing techniques from discrete-continuous optimization (e.g., k-means clustering), which has the potential to trigger novel research. We demonstrate the proposed approaches in extensive simulations and on real datasets and show that the proposed techniques outperform typical data association baselines and are even competitive against an “oracle” baseline which has access to the number of landmarks and an initial guess for each landmark.
