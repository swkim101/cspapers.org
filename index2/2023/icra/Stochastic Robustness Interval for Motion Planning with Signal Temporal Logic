In this work, we present a novel robustness measure for continuous-time stochastic trajectories with respect to Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. We show the soundness of the measure and develop a monitor for reasoning about partial trajectories. Using this monitor, we introduce an STL sampling-based motion planning algorithm for robots under uncertainty. Given a minimum robustness requirement, this algorithm finds satisfying motion plans; alternatively, the algorithm also optimizes for the measure. We prove probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of the motion planner with respect to the measure, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several case studies.
