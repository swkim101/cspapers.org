Predicting pedestrian behavior is a crucial task for intelligent driving systems. Accurate predictions require a deep understanding of various contextual elements that could impact the way pedestrians behave. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that relies on different data modalities to predict future trajectories and crossing actions of pedestrians from an egocentric perspective. Specifically, our model utilizes a cross-modal Transformer architecture to capture dependencies between different data types. The output of the Transformer is augmented with representations of interactions between pedestrians and other traffic agents conditioned on the pedestrian and ego-vehicle dynamics that are generated via a semantic attentive interaction module. Lastly, the context encodings are fed into a multi-stream decoder framework using a gated-shared network. We evaluate our algorithm on public pedestrian behavior benchmarks, PIE and JAAD, and show that our model improves state-of-the-art in trajectory and action prediction by up to 22% and 13% respectively on various metrics. The advantages of the proposed components are investigated via extensive ablation studies.
