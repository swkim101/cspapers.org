Physical interaction with textiles, such as assistive dressing or household tasks, requires advanced dexterous skills. The complexity of textile behavior during stretching and pulling is influenced by the material properties of the yarn and by the textile's construction technique, which are often unknown in real-world settings. Moreover, identification of physical properties of textiles through sensing commonly available on robotic platforms remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Elastic Context (EC), a method to encode the elasticity of textiles using stress-strain curves adapted from textile engineering for robotic applications. We employ EC to learn generalized elastic behaviors of textiles and examine the effect of EC dimension on accurate force modeling of real-world non-linear elastic behaviors.
