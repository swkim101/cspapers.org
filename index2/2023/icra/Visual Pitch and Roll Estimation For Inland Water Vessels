Motion estimation is an essential element for autonomous vessels. It is used e.g. for lidar motion compensation as well as mapping and detection tasks in a maritime environment. Because the use of gyroscopes is not reliable and a high performance inertial measurement unit is quite expensive, we present an approach for visual pitch and roll estimation that utilizes a convolutional neural network for water segmentation, a stereo system for reconstruction and simple geometry to estimate pitch and roll. The algorithm is validated on a novel, publicly available dataset22https://git.ios.htwg-konstanz.de/dgriesse/constance_orientation_dataset/archive/main/constance_orientation_dataset-main.zip recorded at Lake Constance. Our experiments show that the pitch and roll estimator provides accurate results in comparison to an Xsens IMU sensor. We can further improve the pitch and roll estimation by sensor fusion with a gyroscope. The algorithm is available in its implementation as a ROS node33https://github.com/dionysos4/water_surface_detector.
