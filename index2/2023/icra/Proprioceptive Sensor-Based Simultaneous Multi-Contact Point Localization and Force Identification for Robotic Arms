In this paper, we propose an algorithm that estimates contact point and force simultaneously. We consider a collaborative robot equipped with proprioceptive sensors, in particular, joint torque sensors (JTSs) and a base force/torque (F/T) sensor. The proposed method has the following advan-tages. First, fast computation is achieved by proper preprocessing of robot meshes. Second, multi-contact can be identified with the aid of the base F/T sensor, while this is challenging when the robot is equipped with only JTSs. The proposed method is a modification of the standard particle filter to cope with mesh preprocessing and with available sensor data. In simulation validation, for a 7 degree-of-freedom robot, the algorithm runs at 2200Hz with 99.96% success rate for the single-contact case. In terms of the run-time, the proposed method was â‰¥3.5X faster compared to the existing methods. Dual and triple contacts are also reported in the manuscript.
