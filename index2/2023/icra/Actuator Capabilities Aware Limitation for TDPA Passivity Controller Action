Haptic interaction often requires stabilizing controllers for safety. The Time-Domain Passivity Approach guarantees passivity (then stability) by observing and dissipating energy generated from active elements in a network. The dissipating action is performed by a Passivity Controller, whose action is commanded to the physically limited robot actuators. Thus, the controller stabilizing action should be in turn limited in order to command displayable references to the actuators. This problem is rarely taken into account in the literature and when it is, the limitation is neither directly related to the actuator power limits, nor to the robot's current configuration. The limits of the currently adopted strategies leave room for improvement. In this paper, a new strategy to limit the Passivity Controller action is proposed taking into account both the physical limits of the actuators and the robot configuration. This new strategy is experimentally tested against the classical one based on the sampling time. In the experiment, a human interacts with a virtual wall in a Virtual Environment through a haptic interface. The wall induces an unstable behavior passivated with the two limitation strategies. The results clearly state the benefits introduced by the proposed strategy in two relevant cases.
