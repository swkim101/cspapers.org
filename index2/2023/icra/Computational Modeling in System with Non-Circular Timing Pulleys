We analyze and model a belt transmission system with non-circular timing pulleys. Using a 3D printer as a proof-of-concept device, experiments consisting of tracking the pose data of a printer nozzle and its pulleys are conducted. A computational model from our previous work is validated with the experimental data and expanded to model more complex systems with multiple non-circular timing pulleys as well as slippage and non-ideal tensions. Finally, an example with two non-circular timing pulleys is presented and simulated utilizing the proposed method.
