A Chor–Goldreich (CG) source is a sequence of random variables X = X1 ∘ … ∘ Xt, where each Xi ∼ {0,1}d and Xi has δ d min-entropy conditioned on any fixing of X1 ∘ … ∘ Xi−1. The parameter 0<δ≤ 1 is the entropy rate of the source. We typically think of d as constant and t as growing. We extend this notion in several ways, defining almost CG sources. Most notably, we allow each Xi to only have conditional Shannon entropy δ d. We achieve pseudorandomness results for almost CG sources which were not known to hold even for standard CG sources, and even for the weaker model of Santha–Vazirani sources: We construct a deterministic condenser that on input X, outputs a distribution which is close to having constant entropy gap, namely a distribution Z ∼ {0,1}m for m ≈ δ dt with min-entropy m−O(1). Therefore, we can simulate any randomized algorithm with small failure probability using almost CG sources with no multiplicative slowdown. This result extends to randomized protocols as well, and any setting in which we cannot simply cycle over all seeds, and a “one-shot” simulation is needed. Moreover, our construction works in an online manner, since it is based on random walks on expanders. Our main technical contribution is a novel analysis of random walks, which should be of independent interest. We analyze walks with adversarially correlated steps, each step being entropy-deficient, on good enough lossless expanders. We prove that such walks (or certain interleaved walks on two expanders), starting from a fixed vertex and walking according to X1∘ … ∘ Xt, accumulate most of the entropy in X.
