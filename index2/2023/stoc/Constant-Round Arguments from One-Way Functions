We study the following question: what cryptographic assumptions are needed for obtaining constant-round computationally-sound argument systems? We focus on argument systems with almost-linear verification time for subclasses of P, such as depth-bounded computations. Kilian’s celebrated work [STOC 1992] provides such 4-message arguments for P (actually, for NP) using collision-resistant hash functions. We show that one-way functions suffice for obtaining constant-round arguments of almost-linear verification time for languages in P that have log-space uniform circuits of linear depth and polynomial size. More generally, the complexity of the verifier scales with the circuit depth. Furthermore, our argument systems (like Kilian’s) are doubly-efficient; that is, the honest prover strategy can be implemented in polynomial-time. Unconditionally sound interactive proofs for this class of computations do not rely on any cryptographic assumptions, but they require a linear number of rounds [Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, STOC 2008]. Constant-round interactive proof systems of linear verification complexity are not known even for NC (indeed, even for AC1).
