Robust mission planning is an essential component for mission autonomy to perform complicated tasks in extreme environments. In this paper, we are interested in the role of semantic abstractions for guiding autonomous mission planning. In particular, we focus on how semantics can be leveraged to transition, at the mission level, in between individually robust task plans. We present a mission autonomy framework wherein a task plan adaptation policy leverages up-to-date semantics information in order to adapt to changes that occur during run-time, which endows the robot with better resiliency to unexpected events and improves the overall efficiency of mission operations. Under this new perspective, we provide a concrete and challenging application of autonomous exploration and radio source seeking in a complex multi-level building environment. Experimental results over simulations and real hardware tests demonstrate that the presented semantics-aware mission adaptation more effectively completes the mission with better qualitative results compared to a non-adaptive baseline.
