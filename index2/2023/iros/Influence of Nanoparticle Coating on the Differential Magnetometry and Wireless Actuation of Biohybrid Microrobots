Magnetic nanoparticles can be electrostatically assembled around sperm cells to form biohybrid micro robots. These biohybrid microrobots possess sufficient magnetic material to potentially allow for pulse-echo localization and wireless actuation. Alternatively, magnetic excitation of these nanoparticles can be used for localization based on Faraday's law of induction using a detection coil. Here, we investigate the influence of the electrostatic attraction between positively charged nanoparticles and negatively charged sperm cells on the activation of the nanoparticles during nonlinear differential magnetometry and wireless magnetic actuation. Activation of clusters of free nanoparticles and nanoparticles bound to the body of sperm cells is achieved by a combination of a high- frequency alternating field and a pulsating static field. The nonlinear response in both cases indicates that constraining the nanoparticles is likely to yield significant decreases in the magnetometry sensitivity. While the attachment of particles to the cells enables wireless actuation (rolling locomotion), the rate of change of the magnetization of the nanoparticles decreases one order of magnitude compared to free nanoparticles.
