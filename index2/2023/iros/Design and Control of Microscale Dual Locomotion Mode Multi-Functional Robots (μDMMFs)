This paper presents the design and control of a novel microrobot that utilizes two distinct magnetic locomotion methods, a combination of rotating and gradient field control, for precise micro-object manipulation using multiple end-effectors. Rotating magnetic fields induce a tumbling locomotion mode to increase the movement speed and decrease issues associated with stiction and locomotion over rough surfaces. The gradient field control allows for precise manipulation using the end-effectors, which include a pointed tip for splitting groups of objects and a blunt end for pushing or capturing objects. The microrobot is fabricated using a two-photon polymerization 3D printer, allowing for the precise reproduction of complex geometries and designs. The potential applications of this technology in the medical field are discussed, highlighting the potential for in vitro cellular manipulation.
