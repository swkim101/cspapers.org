In this paper, Safety Control Barrier Functions (SCBFs) were used to adjust the null-space compliant behavior of a redundant robot to improve safety in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) without modifying the robot behavior with respect to its main Cartesian task. A Lyapunov function was included in an energy storage formulation compatible with strict passivity to provide global asymptotic stability guarantees for the null-space compliance variation, and the necessary conditions for stability were formulated as inequality constraints of the optimization problem used for the null-space compliance variation. Experimental validation was performed using a Franka Emika Panda robot for a collaborative assembly application and its results showed that safety can be improved by using SCBFs simultaneously to the optimization of the robot configuration, while employing a single degree of freedom.
