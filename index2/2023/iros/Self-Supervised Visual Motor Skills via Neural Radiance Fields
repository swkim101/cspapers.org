In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture for visual imitation learning that exploits neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and key-point correspondence for self-supervised visual motor policy learning. The proposed network architecture incorporates a dynamic system output layer for policy learning. Combining the stability and goal adaption properties of dynamic systems with the robustness of keypoint-based correspondence yields a policy that is invariant to significant clutter, occlusions, lighting conditions changes, and spatial variations in goal configurations. Experiments on multiple manipulation tasks show that our method outperforms comparable visual motor policy learning methods on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios when using a small number of training samples.
