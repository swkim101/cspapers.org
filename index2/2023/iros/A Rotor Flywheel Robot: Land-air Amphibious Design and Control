Most land-air amphibious UAVs feature a four-wheel design that limits their adaptability in narrow and uneven spaces. This study proposes the rotor flywheel as a new land-air design that integrates a one-wheel structure and eight-rotor wings for more flexible motion. The dynamics model is then conducted with the Kane method, finding two power-saving self-balance state while rolling. Its controller design highlights the multi-input decoupling approach utilizing feedback, along with the dynamic model-based component to enable efficient control of its intricate operations. Results of simulations and experimental tests have validated the stability and adaptability of the mode-switching and rolling of the robot in ground motion.
