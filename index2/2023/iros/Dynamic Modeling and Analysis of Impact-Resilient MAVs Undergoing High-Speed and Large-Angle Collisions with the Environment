Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) often face a high risk of collision during autonomous flight, particularly in cluttered and unstructured environments. To mitigate the collision impact on sensitive onboard devices, resilient MAVs with mechanical protective cages and reinforced frames are commonly used. However, compliant and impact-resilient MAVs offer a promising alternative by reducing the potential damage caused by impacts. In this study, we present novel findings on the impact-resilient capabilities of MAVs equipped with passive springs in their compliant arms. We analyze the effect of compliance through dynamic modeling and demonstrate that the inclusion of passive springs enhances impact resilience. The impact resilience is extensively tested to stabilize the MAV following wall collisions under high-speed and large-angle conditions. Additionally, we provide comprehensive comparisons with rigid MAVs to better determine the tradeoffs in flight by embedding compliance onto the robot's frame.
