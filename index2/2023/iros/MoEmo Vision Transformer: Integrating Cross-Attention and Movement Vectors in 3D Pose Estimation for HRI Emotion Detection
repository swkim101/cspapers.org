Emotion detection presents challenges to intelligent human-robot interaction (URI). Foundational deep learning techniques used in emotion detection are limited by information-constrained datasets or models that lack the necessary complexity to learn interactions between input data elements, such as the the variance of human emotions across different contexts. In the current effort, we introduce 1) MoEmo (Motion to Emotion), a cross-attention vision transformer (ViT) for human emotion detection within robotics systems based on 3D human pose estimations across various contexts, and 2) a data set that offers full-body videos of human movement and corresponding emotion labels based on human gestures and environmental contexts. Compared to existing approaches, our method effectively leverages the subtle connections between movement vectors of gestures and environmental contexts through the use of cross-attention on the extracted movement vectors of full-body human gestures/poses and feature maps of environmental contexts. We implement a cross-attention fusion model to combine movement vectors and environment contexts into a joint representation to derive emotion estimation. Leveraging our Naturalistic Motion Database, we train the MoEmo system to jointly analyze motion and context, yielding emotion detection that outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
