In this paper, with the goal of addressing the high early-detection miss rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) polyps during a colonoscopy procedure, we propose the design and fabrication of a unique inflatable vision-based tactile sensing balloon (VTSB). The proposed soft VTSB can readily be integrated with the existing colonoscopes and provide a radiation-free, safe, and high-resolution textural mapping and morphology characterization of CRC polyps. The performance of the proposed VTSB has been thoroughly characterized and evaluated on four different types of additively manufactured CRC polyp phantoms with three different stiffness levels. Additionally, we integrated the VTSB with a colonoscope and successfully performed a simulated colonoscopic procedure inside a tube with a few CRC polyp phantoms attached to its internal surface.
