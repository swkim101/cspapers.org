In this study, we proposed a dynamic model that could quantify human comfort in autonomous vehicles (AVs) based on vehicular behaviors and a Kalman filter (KF) based approach to further refine comfort level estimation by leveraging physiological signals. The dynamic model could capture the dynamics in human comfort when the passenger was exposed to a continuous sequence of vehicular behaviors during an AV journey. The KF-based comfort estimation approach could fuse comfort level estimations based on physiological signals and the dynamic model. A simulator-based user study was conducted to evaluate the comfort estimation approaches in which the participants experienced a set of virtual AV journeys on a high-fidelity driving simulator with 6-degree-of-freedom motions. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches could quantify human comfort levels and the KF-based approach outperforms the others.
