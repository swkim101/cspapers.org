Designing robots is a multiphase process aimed at solving a multi-criteria optimization problem to find the best possible detailed design. Generative design (GD) aims to accelerate the design process compared to manual design, since GD allows exploring and exploiting the vast design space more efficiently. In the field of robotics, however, relevant research focuses mostly on the generation of fully-actuated open chain kinematics, which is trivial in mechanical engineering perspective. Within this paper, we address the problem of generative design of closed-chain linkage mechanisms. A GD algorithm has to be able to generate meaningful mechanisms which satisfy conditions of existence. We propose an optimization-driven algorithm for generation of planar closed-chain linkages to follow a predefined trajectory. The algorithm creates an unlimited range of physically reproducible design alternatives that can be further tested in simulation. These tests could be done in order to find solutions that satisfy extra criteria, e.g., desired dynamic behavior or low energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is called “respawn” since it builds a new linkage after the ancestor has been tested in a virtual environment in pursuit for the optimal solution. To show that the algorithm is general enough, we show a set of generated linkages that can be used for a wide class of robots.
