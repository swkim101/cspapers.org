While motion classification architectures have improved in accuracy and robustness in recent years, computationally expensive approaches and sophisticated hardware dependencies limit their real-world applicability. To overcome these challenges, we have designed a lightweight, realtime architecture for classifying motions of the arm & hand using features derived from motor unit action potentials within surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signals, rather than which provide direct interrogation of underlying muscle activation patterns. We tested the architecture on 6 motions performed dynamically across a range of muscle contraction intensities achieving median classification accuracies ranging from 91.3% to 93.3 % and an average processing time of approximately 40 ms across three different classifiers. Taken together, our findings demonstrate potential robustness of motor unit based neural interfaces for motion classification tasks.
