Using robots to collect data is an effective way to obtain information from the environment and communicate it to a static base station. Furthermore, robots have the capability to communicate with one another, potentially decreasing the time for data to reach the base station. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Program that reasons about discrete routing choices, continuous robot paths, and their effect on the latency of the data collection task. We analyze our formulation, discuss optimization challenges inherent to the data collection problem, and propose a factored formulation that finds optimal answers more efficiently. Our work is able to find paths that reduce latency by up to 101% compared to treating all robots independently in our tested scenarios.
