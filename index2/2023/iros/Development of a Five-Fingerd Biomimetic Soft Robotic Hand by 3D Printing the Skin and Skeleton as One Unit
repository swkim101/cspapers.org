Robot hands that imitate the shape of the human body have been actively studied, and various materials and mechanisms have been proposed to imitate the human body. Although the use of soft materials is advantageous in that it can imitate the characteristics of the human body's epidermis, it increases the number of parts and makes assembly difficult in order to perform complex movements. In this study, we propose a skin-skeleton integrated robot hand that has 15 degrees of freedom and consists of four parts. The developed robotic hand is mostly composed of a single flexible part produced by a 3D printer, and while it can be easily assembled, it can perform adduction, flexion, and opposition of the thumb, as well as flexion of four fingers.
