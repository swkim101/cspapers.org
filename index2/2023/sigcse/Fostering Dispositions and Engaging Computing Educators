Dispositions are cultivable behaviors desirable in the workplace. Examples of dispositions are being adaptable, meticulous, and self-directed. The eleven dispositions described in the CC2020 report should not be confused with the professional knowledge of computing topics, or with skills, including technical skills, along with cross-disciplinary skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, or communication. Dispositions, more inherent to human characteristics, identify personal qualities and behavioral patterns important for successful professional careers. The leaders of this special session collaborate on a multi-institutional project funded by the National Science Foundation. Using their experiences at four higher education institutions, they will demonstrate how to foster dispositions among computing students through two hands-on activities. The audience will get first-hand experience using reflection exercises and vignettes, and will participate in debating their design, merits, and limitations. The resulting interaction will provide the audience ample time to discuss the benefits and challenges of incorporating and fostering dispositions in computing programs. It is hoped that participants will leave with concrete ideas on how to extend the current work to their own courses, programs, and institutions.
