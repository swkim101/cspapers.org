Switch mode is a novel block-based programming feature that allows learners to author one or more lines of text-based code inside of a block-based program. The design of Switch mode seeks to support novices in authoring text-based code while keeping the scaffolds of block-based programming present. Switch mode blocks can be used like any other block but instead of specifying a specific behavior. Switch blocks have a text-based programming editor embedded with it to type in commands. In Switch mode, users can convert conventional blocks to Switch blocks or start from blank Switch blocks to immediately begin typing Python commands. Predefined Switch blocks support single line commands, multi-line programs, variables, nested structures, and function headers. This demo introduces the switch mode approach and will provide a hands-on tutorial on how to author switch mode programs. The session will also share a case study showcasing the potential of switch mode using data from in a 9th grade classroom study. This demo session will introduce attendees to a new and novel approach for helping novices transition from block-based to text-based programming and provide opportunities for hands-on exploration of the tool alongside discussions of how it might be used in classrooms.
