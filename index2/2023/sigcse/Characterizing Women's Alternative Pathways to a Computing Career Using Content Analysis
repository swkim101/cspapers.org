Technology innovation requires a set of diverse employees with computing skills. Yet, it remains a challenge for the global digital labor market to obtain an equitable representation of women. This is particularly true for women who enter the computing workforce after obtaining an initial undergraduate degree in a non-computing field. To resolve discrepancies, it is important to learn more about the factors influencing career trajectories and the possible alternative pathways that may encourage participation in the field. We define alternative pathways as any post-baccalaureate program or training that meets the needs of bachelor's degree-holding women with computing aspirations. This research paper, guided by Schlossberg's Transition Theory, conducted a content analysis on publicly available job profiles to characterize the types and features of alternative pathways commonly chosen by women in the United States (U.S.) to aid in understanding their transitions into a computing career. Findings from this study provide guidance and suggestions to women who are interested in transitioning to computing later in their career paths. It further outlines potential avenues with actionable recommendations for the computing education community to attract and retain women in the computing workforce in an effort to build an inclusive ecosystem.
