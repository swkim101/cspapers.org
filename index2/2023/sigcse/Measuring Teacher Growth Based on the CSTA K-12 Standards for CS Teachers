Professional learning programs for computer science (CS) teachers primarily rely on self-reported data from participants to understand the learning impact on teachers and improve teacher growth. We developed and piloted a set of standardized measures of teacher growth aligned with Standards 2-5 of the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) Standards for CS Teachers. We created a rubric from the 29 indicators across the four standards by merging similar concepts. We reduced these 29 indicators into 18 rubric items placed in one of three groups: Planning (9 items), Assessing (3 items), and Professional Development (6 items). We also created scales for measuring progress on each item based on the criteria for each standard. After creating an entry form based on the rubric items, we conducted a two-cycle pilot process, with teachers (n=24) completing the entry form and providing feedback in the form and in focus groups. We then applied revisions to the process, and conducted a second pilot with a different set of teachers (n=29). Teachers reported multiple ways to improve the process, including understanding their own growth path as a CS teacher. In this experience report, we describe the process of creating the rubric, the two-phase pilot used to gather feedback from the teachers, and the changes that we made to the rubric based on teacher feedback. We also provide a high-level description of the 18 items in the rubric, lessons learned, and recommendations.
