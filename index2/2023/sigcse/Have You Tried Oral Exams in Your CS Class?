An oral exam is an assessment approach involving verbal explanations of key concepts or thought process to achieve a solution to a problem, sometimes accompanied by written or typed work. As a complement or refreshing alternative to standard written assessments, oral exams are being implemented in CS courses in a variety of formats. This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session will bring together the growing community of CS educators who have previously used oral exams and those interested in alternative assessment approaches to share ideas and discuss best practices. The discussion leaders represent a wide range of institutions and have varied previous expertise in the design, implementation, and study of oral exams in CS courses. The BoF session will involve (1) introduction to oral exams and previous approaches led by the discussion leaders, (2) small group discussions based on shared interests or concerns with oral exams, and (3) discussion of best practices for oral exams in CS courses.
