This BOF is a networking opportunity for researchers, teachers, resource developers, and state leaders involved or interested in K-12 AI Education. This BOF will serve as an informal opportunity for those who participated in the AI4K12 January 2021 State of AI Education in Your State Workshop and quarterly check-in webinars to reconnect in person. We also want to provide opportunities for newcomers working on K-12 AI Education, either through outreach or their own research, to learn about and join the community. The goal for all attendees is to talk about their work, share successes, form collaborations, and discuss issues with building the framework of implementation. Most importantly, attendees will have opportunities to connect with others with similar interests and challenges, to identify best practices, share resources, and identify next steps to help advance their work. For those who are new to the community, we want to provide opportunities to learn about K-12 AI efforts that are underway in their state and connect with their state leaders. Attendees from states with no efforts underway can learn about resources to start a state team and begin planning. The AI4K12 Initiative and the state workshop were funded by National Science Foundation award# DRL-1846073.
