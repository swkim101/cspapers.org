Data Science is a growing, interdisciplinary field that intersects with multiple academic, professional, and industry domains. Universities are increasingly offering data science programs across a wide variety of departments and program areas. It remains unclear, however, whether any standardization of missions, learning outcomes, or course offerings have emerged. Our research provides a systematic review of 788 data science program offerings, focusing on how these programs frame their missions and objectives; the types of courses offered within their programs; and whether issues of the ethical and social dimensions of data are addressed.
