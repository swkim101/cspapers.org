In this paper, we recount efforts in developing cybersecurity workshops for K-12 teachers, intended to learn skills to better educate the cybersecurity workers of tomorrow. In 2021, we provided two one-day virtual workshops and in 2022 we provided one two-day in-person workshop to high school teachers to increase cybersecurity awareness in three areas: general cybersecurity issues, software security, and hardware security. Both the online and in-person workshops employed Google classroom and Jupyter Notebooks, and high school teachers were provided with Raspberry Pi Zeros to use as part of the workshops. This paper describes the design and implementation of the workshops and also provides evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the workshops, as well as commentary to provide guidance for future efforts.
