Programming error messages (PEMs) have long been a hindrance to novice programmers. This work aims to establish a catalog of PEM anti-patterns--- common, reoccurring features of PEMs that make them unhelpful or actively harmful to programmers. The goal is for educators to be aware of, and actively teach concrete ways that PEMs can be misleading to students; to encourage language implementers to be cognizant of these; and avoid them when designing error feedback. A pilot study is being conducted to validate the presence of anti-patterns in error messages.
