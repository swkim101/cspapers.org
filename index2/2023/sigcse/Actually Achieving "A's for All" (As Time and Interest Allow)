In recent years, a diverse body of research in computing education has discussed new pedagogies and curriculum changes to improve learning and students' experiences. Topics such as growth mindset, mastery learning, grading for equity, and specifications grading are important steps towards the Holy Grail: "A's for All" (as time and interest allow). In this new teaching approach, the "A" line does not move, but instead every student is given an opportunity to achieve proficiency and earn it, as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort it takes. In other words, students can all achieve the same learning outcomes at a different pace, instead of the traditional approach where students achieve different learning outcomes in a fixed amount of time. This workshop will provide educators and administrators with tools to implement the "A's for All" (as time and interest allow) approach in their courses and institutions. It will take attendees through elements of advocacy, hands-on randomized question generator design and implementation using a computer-based assessment system, best practices, and course policies to reduce friction.
