A Joint Task Force of the ACM, IEEE-Computer Society, and AAAI commenced work in 2021 to revise the Computer Science curricular guidelines that were last updated in 2013. Planned for publication in 2023, the revised guidelines (CS2023) cover curricular content and curricular practices. Curricular content includes updates to the CS2013 knowledge areas, a new sunflower model of what constitutes core computer science topics, a proposal for packaging knowledge areas into courses, and a competency model of the curriculum. Curricular practices cover computer science program design and delivery issues, including social aspects, professional practices, and programmatic considerations. In the special session, the latest CS2023 draft will be presented and feedback solicited. The session is targeted toward educators, administrators, and professionals interested in computer science curricular issues.
