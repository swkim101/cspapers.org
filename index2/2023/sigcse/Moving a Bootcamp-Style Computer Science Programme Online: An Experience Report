The Postgraduage Certificate in Information Technology at the University of Auckland is a bootcamp-style transition programme for students without prior programming experience. The programme's part-time variant, designed for working professionals, has traditionally been offered with intensive evening classes, with extensive tutor and instructor support. Spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic, our University has moved this part-time variant fully online. Benefits of the online offering include a wider, more inclusive audience and flexibility of student learning schedules. However, it has introduced several pedagogical challenges, including but not limited to how instructors can continue to provide meaningful support, feedback, and student engagement in an online environment. In this paper, we reflect on our experience, analyse qualitative and quantitative feedback such as student evaluations and grades, and provide recommendations for those wishing to undertake a similar transformation in the future.
