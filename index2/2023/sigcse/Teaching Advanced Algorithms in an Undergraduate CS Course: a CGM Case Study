The poster presents Algovision (see www.algovision.org), both an algorithm visualization tool and a visualization philosophy presenting algorithms as they were or could have been conceived in the mind of their discoverer. The scope of Algovision ranges from the simplest algorithms like bubble sort and BST to very advanced ones like CGM (Conjugate Gradients Method of solving systems of linear equations). Due to its philosophy, Algovision lessons are very efficient and understandable. As a demonstration, in a test after a 90 min presentation of CGM to 36 undergraduate students (2nd semester, no knowledge of numerical linear algebra), 25% of them answered all test questions correctly and two thirds were considered satisfactory. The main goal of the poster is to stimulate discussion on using tools like Algovision to include more advanced algorithms (advantageously those simpler than CGM) into the undergraduate algorithm curriculum without increasing AL core hours and taking levels (e.g., math courses) of different colleges and universities into account.
