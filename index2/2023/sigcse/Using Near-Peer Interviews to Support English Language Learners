International students from non-English speaking countries confront various challenges when seeking a degree at an English-speaking institution. Some of these challenges relate to the language of instruction, adapting to the norms of a new culture, and the academic program's structure. Learning is a cognitive, social, and emotional activity mediated by activities outside of the lecture hall. Therefore, exploring students' academic beliefs about belonging and how learning works is essential. This report explores how viewing interview clips of second and third-year students can increase first-year students' confidence and sense of belonging and motivate them to engage in effective study practices. The feedback indicates that viewing the interviews positively impacted their confidence, sense of belonging, and understanding of how to succeed in the course. This report details our experience incorporating the interviews into the course, reflects on the feedback students provided, and presents considerations for faculty seeking to use interviews to impact their students' beliefs.
