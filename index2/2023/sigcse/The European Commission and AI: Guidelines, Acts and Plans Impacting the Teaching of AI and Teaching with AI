Recent developments, guidelines, and acts by the European Commission have started to frame policy for AI and related areas such as ML and data, not only for the broader community, but in the context of education specifically. This poster presents a succinct overview of these developments. Specifically, we look to bring together all publications that might impact the teaching of AI (for example, teacher expectations in the coming years around AI competencies)and publications that affect the use of AI in the classroom. We mean using tools and systems that incorporate both 'Good Old Fashioned 'AI and those that can directly impact students. This poster is of value to both the European and the wider CER communities and practitioners, as it brings together several guidelines, acts, and plans that are not easily searchable or linked. The publications presented in this poster will impact the teaching of AI and teaching with Ai in Europe, and insights can be drawn and compared for other jurisdictions as the educational world adapts to and with AI.
