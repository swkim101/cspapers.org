Assessment is critical for learning, and summative assessment (e.g., exams) is one aspect of teaching that can be hard to scale to the large enrollments common in lower division CS courses. In this demo, I'll share my experiences in developing and using the Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF) that has be in operation at the University of Illinois since 2014. The CBTF provides proctored, secure computer-based exams, making it well suited to assessment in large-enrollment courses in computer science and other STEM disciplines. In recent semesters, our CBTF has averaged more than 65,000 exams per semester for over 9,000 unique students. In this demo, I'll demonstrate the instructor, student, and proctor perspectives of running/taking exams in the CBTF. I will explain the four principles that the CBTF is built on: sophisticated computerized questions, item generators, asynchronous exams, and a centralized proctor pool. In addition, I'll explain how contingencies like illnesses and disabilities/accommodations are handled efficiently. I will share resources on how to go about setting up a CBTF at your college/university and provide pointers to the research that we've conducted about and using the CBTF.
