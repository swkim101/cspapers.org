This workshop will introduce participants interested in teaching a full-term computer science ethics course to the tools and techniques of using science fiction to teach that course. The workshop will consist of three hourlong parts, each of which will draw heavily on science fiction as a teaching tool: (1) an introduction to and tips for teaching with multiple ethical frameworks including virtue ethics, deontology, communitarianism, and utilitarianism; (2) A deep dive on teaching about personhood and privacy by focusing on what's at stake, using multiple viewpoints; and (3) an overview and interactive workshop on the practical logistics of teaching a full term ethics course including example syllabi and teaching materials. This course will equip participants to make rich use of science fiction in their course and to incorporate multiple ethical perspectives into classroom discussion. Participants will have an opportunity to work on course structure and teaching modules in small groups and will receive example teaching materials.
