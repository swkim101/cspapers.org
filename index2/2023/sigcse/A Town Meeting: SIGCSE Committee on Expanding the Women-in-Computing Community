In January 2004, the second SIGCSE Committee ("Expanding the Women-in-Computing Community") was created. The SIGCSE Board approved the charter because the underrepresentation of women in computing is an international problem and an embarrassment for our profession. A BOF provides SIGCSE program advertising that will create a large audience for a discussion of both underrepresentation issues that attendees' institutions have and also solutions that successful gender issues projects provide. Our discussion leaders connect to three of the most important organizations that relate to underrepresentation: ACM-W (Ruth Lennon), CRA-WP (Tracy Camp), and NCWIT (Matt Muchna). The forum provides an important annual meeting for a large group of people, who work to increase the representation of women in computing in their separate organizations and who do not customarily have an opportunity to share ideas face-to-face.
