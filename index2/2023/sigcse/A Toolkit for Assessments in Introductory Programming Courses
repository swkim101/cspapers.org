Traditional paper-based exams and LMS-provided online exams for introductory programming courses are not aligned with learning objectives that emphasize problem-solving and coding skills. In this poster, we present a cloud-based assessment solution for introductory programming courses. First, we discuss the requirements and challenges of conducting frequent assessments. We then outline the functions in our online exam toolkit that allow instructors to administer versatile assessments. Instead of relying on a traditional lockdown browser, the plagiarism and cheating detection in our toolkit allows instructors to administer exams in any modern browser for face-to-face classes.
