As the focus on computer science (CS) in K-12 classrooms grows, many teachers are turning to "Hour of Code" (HoC) programs. Created in 2013, they invite teachers to spend one hour working on pre-developed CS activities with their students. Little work has been done with K-12 students (the primary audience) regarding the effects of HoC. This study reports findings from computer science education research with over 1000 students who engaged in HoC activities. Students reported their interest and perceptions of CS before and after completing HoC activities. Stated goals focus on exposing students to computers. This research effort seeks to determine if the intended impact of these activities is being reached.
