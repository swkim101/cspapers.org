Algorithms courses are a core part of many CS programs, but have received little focus in computing education, lacking statistical data about how they are generally taught. To remedy this, we present the results of the first large-scale comprehensive survey of undergraduate introductory algorithms courses at four-year institutions in the United States. Questions in the survey targeted instructor information, course concepts, the ways students are evaluated, challenges instructors encountered, and instructor envisioned improvements. We received 87 responses from 34 different states, across a wide variety of 4-year institutions. The results indicate that algorithms courses vary dramatically in most surveyed areas.
