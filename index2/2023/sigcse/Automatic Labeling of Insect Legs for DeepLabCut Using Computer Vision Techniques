Many research areas rely on the ability to observe insect position and pose through markerless tracking. Neural networks provide more robust tracking systems than traditional computer vision-based systems. However, they require many human-hours to label the training data. In this research, we explore the feasibility of using traditional computer vision techniques to label the training data automatically. This research suggests that, although a fully-automated labeling system may not be accurate enough to be used alone, such a system could be used as a first pass to create reasonably accurate labels, with a human performing a less work-intensive second pass to correct errors. Such a hybrid approach would enable the labeling of more data with less human effort.
