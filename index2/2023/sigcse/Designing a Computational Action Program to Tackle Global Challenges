As artificial intelligence involves and shapes personal and professional lives, there is a critical need to nurture and prepare AI-enabled problem-solvers. FutureMakers is designed as a six-week program that introduces foundational knowledge and essential skills to develop innovative solutions with AI responsibly. Our study utilized a convergent mixed-method design to evaluate the impact of the FutureMakers program on students' learning outcomes and shifting perspectives on AI. Quantitative data showed a shift in students' AI literacy with a large effect size. Qualitative data, based on student interviews, showed an awareness of an ethical engineering design process in applying technical skills to solve real-world problems. The program showed the impact of the computational action approach to tackle authentic challenges.
