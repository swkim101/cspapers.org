The work described in this poster builds on previous work funded by the NSF through a CSForAll:RPP grant (NSF 17-525, small-scale, Award #1738784). In our original work we developed and piloted a professional development (PD) sequence which allows in-service high school teachers to teach high quality computer science courses and earn the state's then newly created computer science endorsement. A recently funded scale-up, (NSF 20-539, medium-scale, Award #2219497), creates an expanded partnership consisting of access to five, university-faculty-led, online courses, which are integrated with localized Communities of Practice facilitated through the state's nine Area Education Agencies (AEAs) and their Digital Learning teacher consultants. This combination of resources has the potential to benefit teachers by providing not only academically rigorous instruction in both computer science and educational pedagogy, but also a much-needed, peer-based, localized, support network. Such a model could be adapted for use by other educational organizations.
