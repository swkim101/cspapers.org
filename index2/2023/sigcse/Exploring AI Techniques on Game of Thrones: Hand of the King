This research examines a two-player combinatorial game, Game of Thrones: Hand of the King, and applies several different techniques to develop an effective AI player for this game. We used several approaches including simple game state analysis, heuristic search, minimax tree search, and Monte Carlo tree search. A game framework that supports random board generation and multi-game tournaments was used to test different players against each other. Our results show that a hybrid player using both minimax tree search and Monte Carlo tree search is effective at winning against a variety of other AI players.
