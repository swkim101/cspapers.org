The current CS for All movement reflects a need to provide opportunities for every person to learn computer science, as a matter of equity. Many computing professionals have a desire to contribute to society; since access to computing education is limited in many ways, finding ways to use computing to give back is particularly valuable. In this Birds of a Feather, we will discuss strategies for individual students, faculty, and institutions to develop and lead efforts focused on improving inclusion, equity, and diversity in computing. Exemplary efforts that computing students, faculty, and computing professionals have used to broaden participation include mentoring, tutoring, K12 outreach, expanded research opportunities, and service learning. In this BoF, we invite participants to seek and share resources that can lower the barriers to engaging in outreach and research for broadening participation in computing. We will also discuss strategies for choosing projects that leverage local resources and opportunities, promote personal professional development, and contribute to institutional improvement.
