Have a CS education research project that needs a survey? If you're an education researcher who wants to learn more about survey instrumentation in order to expedite and improve your research, this session is for you! Come learn how to find, remix, and use existing surveys by delving into the process of taking openly shared resources and repurposing them for your projects. In this workshop, we'll cover basics of survey creation and modification, as well as touch upon some additional useful tips like piloting surveys, how to avoid bots attacking your survey and protecting your participants' privacy. We'll also look at how to choose a survey that fits your needs. You will be actively engaged in hands-on activities. Key takeaways from this workshop will include clear steps you can take to choose an instrument that addresses your research questions and study design, the role that validity and reliability play in instrument design, how to modify an instrument (if needed) to answer your research question, and how to add your instruments to the corpus of instruments at the K-12 CS Education Research Resource Center. Laptop is needed for this workshop.
