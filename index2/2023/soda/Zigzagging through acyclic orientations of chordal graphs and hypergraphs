In 1993, Savage, Squire, and West described an inductive construction for generating every acyclic orientation of a chordal graph exactly once, flipping one arc at a time. We provide two generalizations of this result. Firstly, we describe Gray codes for acyclic orientations of hypergraphs that satisfy a simple ordering condition, which generalizes the notion of perfect elimination order of graphs. This unifies the Savage-Squire-West construction with a recent algorithm for generating elimination trees of chordal graphs (SODA 2022). Secondly, we consider quotients of lattices of acyclic orientations of chordal graphs, and we provide a Gray code for them, addressing a question raised by Pilaud (FPSAC 2022). This also generalizes a recent algorithm for generating lattice congruences of the weak order on the symmetric group (SODA 2020). Our algorithms are derived from the Hartung-Hoang-MÂ¨utze-Williams combinatorial generation framework, and they yield simple algorithms for computing Hamilton paths and cycles on large classes of polytopes, including chordal nestohedra and quotientopes. In particular, we derive an efficient implementation of the Savage-Squire-West construction. Along the way, we give an overview of old and recent results about the polyhedral and order-theoretic aspects of acyclic orientations of graphs and hypergraphs.
