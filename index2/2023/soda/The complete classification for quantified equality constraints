We prove that QCSP$(\mathbb{N};x=y\rightarrow y=z)$ is PSpace-complete, settling a question open for more than ten years. This completes the complexity classification for the QCSP over equality languages as a trichotomy between Logspace, NP-complete and PSpace-complete. We additionally settle the classification for bounded alternation QCSP$(\Gamma)$, for $\Gamma$ an equality language. Such problems are either in Logspace, NP-complete, co-NP-complete or rise in complexity in the Polynomial Hierarchy.
