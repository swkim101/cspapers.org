Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS's) represent a modern tool for selecting a subset of elements, subject to resource constraints, when the elements are presented to the algorithm sequentially. OCRS's have led to some of the best-known competitive ratio guarantees for online resource allocation problems, with the added benefit of treating different online decisions -- accept/reject, probing, pricing -- in a unified manner. This paper analyzes OCRS's for resource constraints defined by matchings in graphs, a fundamental structure in combinatorial optimization. We consider two dimensions of variants: the elements being presented in adversarial or random order; and the graph being bipartite or general. We improve the state of the art for all combinations of variants, both in terms of algorithmic guarantees and impossibility results. Some of our algorithmic guarantees are best-known even compared to Contention Resolution Schemes that can choose the order of arrival or are offline. All in all, our results for OCRS directly improve the best-known competitive ratios for online accept/reject, probing, and pricing problems on graphs in a unified manner.
