We investigate one of the most basic problems in streaming algorithms: approximating the number of elements in the stream. Famously, [Mor78] gave a randomized algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation error for streams of length at most N in space $O(\log\log N)$. We investigate the pseudo-deterministic complexity of the problem and prove a tight $\Omega(\log N)$ lower bound, thus resolving a problem of [GGMW20].
