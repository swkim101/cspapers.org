We consider error-correction coding schemes for adversarial wiretap channels (AWTCs) in which the channel can a) read a fraction of the codeword bits up to a bound r and b) flip a fraction of the bits up to a bound p. The channel can freely choose the locations of the bit reads and bit flips via a process with unbounded computational power. Codes for the AWTC are of broad interest in the area of information security, as they can provide data resiliency in settings where an attacker has limited access to a storage or transmission medium. We investigate a family of non-linear codes known as pseudolinear codes, which were first proposed by Guruswami and Indyk (FOCS 2001) for constructing list-decodable codes independent of the AWTC setting. Unlike general non-linear codes, pseudolinear codes admit efficient encoders and have succinct representations. We focus on unique decoding and show that random pseudolinear codes can achieve rates up to the binary symmetric channel (BSC) capacity $1-H_{2}(p)$ for any $p, r$ in the less noisy region: $p\lt1/2$ and $r\lt1-H_{2}(p)$ where $H_{2}(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. Thus, pseudolinear codes are the first known optimal-rate binary code family for the less noisy AWTC that admit efficient encoders. The above result can be viewed as a derandomization result of random general codes in the AWTC setting, which in turn opens new avenues for applying derandomization techniques to randomized constructions of AWTC codes. Our proof applies a novel concentration inequality for sums of random variables with limited independence which may be of interest as an analysis tool more generally.
