Federated Learning (FL) is a novel distributed, privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm. Conventional FL suffers from drawbacks such as single point of failure and client drift. Blockchain is a distributed computing architecture famous for decentralization, transparency, and traceability. Incorporating blockchain as the underlying basis for FL decentralizes the FL process and brings opportunities to resolve the drawbacks. However, there still remain challenges to fulfilling FL with blockchain, regarding effectiveness, efficiency, and security. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain system for FL, called FedChain. To mitigate client drift and accelerate training, we present a clustered semi-asynchronous method for model aggregation. To optimize the local training in FL, we introduce a knowledge transfer method using other clients on the peer-to-peer network of blockchain. Moreover, we implement an access control mechanism to store and transmit models safely and efficiently. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that FedChain achieves superior results in accuracy, convergence, throughput, and latency.
