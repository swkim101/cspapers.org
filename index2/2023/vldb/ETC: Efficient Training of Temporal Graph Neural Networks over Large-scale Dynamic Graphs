Dynamic graphs play a crucial role in various real-world applications, such as link prediction and node classification on social media and e-commerce platforms. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have emerged as a leading approach for handling dynamic graphs, using temporal message passing to compute temporal node embeddings. However, training existing T-GNNs on large-scale dynamic graphs is prohibitively expensive due to the ill-suited batching scheme and significant data access overhead. In this paper, we introduce ETC, a generic framework designed specifically for efficient T-GNN training at scale. ETC incorporates a novel data batching scheme that enables large training batches improving model computation efficiency, while preserving model effectiveness by restricting information loss in each training batch. To reduce data access overhead, ETC employs a three-step data access policy that leverages the data access pattern in T-GNN training, significantly reducing redundant data access volume. Additionally, ETC utilizes an inter-batch pipeline mechanism, decoupling data access from model computation and further reducing data access costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ETC, showcasing its ability to achieve significant training speedups compared to state-of-the-art training frameworks for T-GNNs on real-world dynamic graphs with millions of interactions. ETC provides a training speedup ranging from 1.6X to 62.4X, highlighting its potential for efficient training on large-scale dynamic graphs.
