 In many global businesses of multinational enterprises, graph-structure data is usually geographically distributed in different regions to support low-latency services. Geo-distributed graph processing suffers from the Wide Area Networks (WANs) with scarce and heterogeneous bandwidth, thus essentially differs from traditional distributed graph processing. In this paper, we propose RAGraph, a
 Region-Aware framework for geo-distributed graph processing.
 At the core of RAGraph, we design a region-aware graph processing framework that allows advancing inefficient global updates locally and enables sensible coordination-free message interactions. RAGraph also contains an adaptive hierarchical message interaction engine to switch interaction modes adaptively based on network heterogeneity and fluctuation, and a discrepancy-aware message filtering strategy to filter important messages. Finally, the experiments show that RAGraph can achieve 1.69X - 40.53X speedup and 20.9% - 97% WAN cost reduction compared with state-of-the-art systems.
