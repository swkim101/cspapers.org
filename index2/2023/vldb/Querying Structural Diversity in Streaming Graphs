Structural diversity of a vertex refers to the diversity of connections within its neighborhood and has been applied in various fields such as viral marketing and user engagement. The paper studies querying the structural diversity of a vertex for any query time windows in streaming graphs. Existing studies are limited to static graphs which fail to capture vertices' structural diversities in snapshots evolving over time. We design an elegant index structure to significantly reduce the index size compared to the basic approach. We propose an optimized incremental algorithm to update the index for continuous edge arrivals. Extensive experiments on real-world streaming graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.
