 This paper studies association rule discovery in a graph
 G
 1
 by referencing an external graph
 G
 2
 with overlapping information. The objective is to enrich
 G
 1
 with relevant properties and links from
 G
 2
 . As a testbed, we consider Graph Association Rules (GARs). We propose a notion of graph joins to enrich
 G
 1
 by aligning entities across
 G
 1
 and
 G
 2
 . We also introduce a graph filtering method to support graph joins, by fetching only the data of
 G
 2
 that pertains to the entities of
 G
 1
 , to reduce noise and the size of the fused data. Based on these we develop a parallel algorithm to discover GARs across
 G
 1
 and
 G
 2
 . Moreover, we provide an incremental GAR discovery algorithm in response to updates to
 G
 1
 and
 G
 2
 . We show that both algorithms guarantee to reduce parallel runtime when given more processors. Better yet, the incremental algorithm is bounded relative to the batch one. Using real-life and synthetic data, we empirically verify that the methods improve the accuracy of association analyses by 30.4% on average, and scale well with large graphs.
