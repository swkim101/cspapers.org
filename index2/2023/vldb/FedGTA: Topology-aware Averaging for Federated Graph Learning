Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training on large-scale subgraphs across multiple local systems. Existing FGL studies fall into two categories: (i) FGL Optimization, which improves multi-client training in existing machine learning models; (ii) FGL Model, which enhances performance with complex local models and multi-client interactions. However, most FGL optimization strategies are designed specifically for the computer vision domain and ignore graph structure, presenting dissatisfied performance and slow convergence. Meanwhile, complex local model architectures in FGL Models studies lack scalability for handling large-scale subgraphs and have deployment limitations. To address these issues, we propose Federated Graph Topology-aware Aggregation (FedGTA), a personalized optimization strategy that optimizes through topology-aware local smoothing confidence and mixed neighbor features. During experiments, we deploy FedGTA in 12 multi-scale real-world datasets with the Louvain and Metis split. This allows us to evaluate the performance and robustness of FedGTA across a range of scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting high scalability and efficiency. The experiment includes ogbn-papers100M, the most representative large-scale graph database so that we can verify the applicability of our method to large-scale graph learning. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to bridge large-scale graph learning with FGL using this optimization strategy, contributing to the development of efficient and scalable FGL methods.
