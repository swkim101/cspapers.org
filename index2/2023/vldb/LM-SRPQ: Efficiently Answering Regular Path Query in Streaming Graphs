Regular path query (RPQ) is a basic operation for graph data analysis, and persistent RPQ in streaming graphs is a new-emerging research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for persistent RPQ in streaming graphs, named LM-SRPQ. It solves persistent RPQ with a combination of intermediate result materialization and real-time graph traversal. Compared to prior art, it merges redundant storage and computation, achieving higher memory and time efficiency. We carry out extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic streaming graphs to evaluate its performance. Experiment results confirm its superiority compared to prior art in both memory and time efficiency.
