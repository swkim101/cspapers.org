Decision-focused learning (DFL) combines both machine learning and combinatorial optimization so as to enhance the quality of decision-making. In general, DFL adds an optimization layer after the neural network and solves a focused combinatorial optimization problem. The optimization layer is usually based on KKT conditions or surrogate functions. However, the optimizer associated with the DFL is inflexible and requires a large amount of expert knowledge. Furthermore, it has been shown that the optimizer exhibits a lack of robustness and differentiability when confronted with complex tasks, especially in the graph domain. To solve this problem, we study a more generic situation by taking the optimization layer as a black-box operator on graphs. Then, we design a mixed zeroth-order optimization to differentiate the layer. Specifically, we combine DFL with graph neural networks and present a decision-focused graph neural network named ZO4Graph based on a mixed zeroth-order optimizer. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments compared with two-stage models on community detection. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms its peers.
