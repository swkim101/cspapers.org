Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation, pivotal for guiding users to their next interested locale, grapples with the persistent challenge of data sparsity. Whereas knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a favored tool to mitigate the issue, existing KG-based methods tend to overlook two crucial elements: the intention steering users’ location choices and the high-order topological structure within the KG. In this paper, we craft an Intention-aware Knowledge Graph (IKG) that harmonizes users’ visit histories, movement trajectories, and location categories to model user intentions. Building upon IKG, our novel Intention-aware Knowledge Graph Network (IKGN) delves deeper into the POI recommendation by weighing and propagating node embeddings through an attention mechanism, capturing the unique locational intent of each user. A sequential model like GRU is then employed to ensure a comprehensive representation of users’ short- and long-term location preferences. An empirical study on two real-world datasets validates the effectiveness of our proposed IKGN, with it markedly outshining seven benchmark rival models in both Recall and NDCG metrics.
