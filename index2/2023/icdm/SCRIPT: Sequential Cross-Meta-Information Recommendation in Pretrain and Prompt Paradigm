Existing online advertising systems employ separate models for each task and site, resulting in a large number of models that require significant computing power and human effort to train and deploy. Moreover, separate models have limitations in sharing cross-scenario information. To address these issues, we propose a unified sequential recommendation model called SCRIPT. It takes cross-scenario user behavior sequences as input and explicitly incorporates meta information that characterizes scenario features, such as domain, site, and behavior types. Inspired by the advances of the pretrain and prompt paradigm, we generate scenario-aware and personalized prompts based on the user profile and meta information of candidate items. This allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned during pre-training and adapt it to serve different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on two public dataset and a production dataset demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream recommendation tasks.
