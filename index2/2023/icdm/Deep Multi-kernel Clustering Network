In this paper, a deep multi-kernel clustering network, named DMKCN, is proposed to learn a high-quality and structurally separable kernel representation for the clustering task. Specifically, a multi-kernel learner is proposed to choose a suitable kernel function by learning a suitable combination of kernel functions automatically. A kernel-aid encoder module, consisting of a series of multi-kernel learners, is proposed to learn the structurally separable kernel representation. Besides, a dual self-supervised mechanism, consisting of a kernel self-supervised strategy and a representation self-supervised strategy, is designed to uniformly optimize the kernel representation learning and structural partition. The kernel self-supervised strategy is developed to supervise the multi-kernel learners with the consideration of an objective of clustering task, the representation self-supervised strategy is developed to guide the optimization of kernel representation learning by reconstructing the raw data. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed DMKCN.
