Anomaly detection in multi-type event sequences is a crucial and challenging problem with important applications in various domains, including cybersecurity, finance and healthcare. Temporal point process has emerged as a powerful technique for modeling event sequences and has gained considerable attention in the field of anomaly detection. However, existing temporal point process approaches are either inapplicable to multi-type event sequence data or incur the loss of valuable information in subsequences associated with specific event types. To this end, we propose a novel Multiple Hypothesis Testing based Anomaly Detection method (MultiAD) to detect anomalous multi-type event sequences. The basic idea of MultiAD is to capture the underlying distribution of normal sequences using a neural multivariate point process, based on which the original hypothesis testing problem can be converted into a multiple hypothesis testing using the multivariate time rescaling theorem. By conducting multiple hypothesis tests on the time-rescaled subsequences, MultiAD makes full use of the valuable information contained within individual subsequences. Moreover, we claim that the existing test statistic ignores the sequential information of inter-event time intervals and propose new statistics to address this shortcoming. Finally, we employ the kernel method to obtain a smooth estimator of the distribution of the proposed statistics under the null hypothesis. This ensures a more accurate and reliable computation of the p-value, providing robust statistical inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MultiAD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world data.
