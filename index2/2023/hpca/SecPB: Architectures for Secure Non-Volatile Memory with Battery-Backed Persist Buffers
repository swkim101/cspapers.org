The durability of data stored in persistent memory (PM) exposes data to potentially data leakage attacks. Recent research has identified the requirements for crash recoverable secure PM, but do not consider recent trends of the persistency domain extending on-chip to include cache hierarchies. In this paper, we explore this design space and identify performance and energy optimization opportunities.We propose secure persistent buffers (SecPB), a battery-backed persistent structure that moves the point of secure data persistency from the memory controller closer to the core. We revisit the fundamentals of how data in PM is secured and show how various subsets of security metadata can be generated lazily while still guaranteeing crash recoverability and integrity verification. We analyze the metadata dependency chain required in securing PM and expose optimization opportunities that allow for SecPB to reduce performance overheads by up to 32.8Ã—, with average performance overheads as low as 1.3% observed for reasonable battery capacities.
