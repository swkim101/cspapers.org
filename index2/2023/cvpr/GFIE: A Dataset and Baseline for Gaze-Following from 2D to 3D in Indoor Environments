Gaze-following is a kind of research that requires locating where the person in the scene is looking automatically under the topic of gaze estimation. It is an important clue for understanding human intention, such as identifying objects or regions of interest to humans. However, a survey of datasets used for gaze-following tasks reveals defects in the way they collect gaze point labels. Manual labeling may introduce subjective bias and is labor-intensive, while automatic labeling with an eye-tracking device would alter the person's appearance. In this work, we introduce GFIE, a novel dataset recorded by a gaze data collection system we developed. The system is constructed with two devices, an Azure Kinect and a laser rangefinder, which generate the laser spot to steer the subject's attention as they perform in front of the camera. And an algorithm is developed to locate laser spots in images for annotating 2D/3D gaze targets and removing ground truth introduced by the spots. The whole procedure of collecting gaze behavior allows us to obtain unbiased labels in unconstrained environments semi-automatically. We also propose a baseline method with stereo field-of-view (FoV) perception for establishing a 2D/3D gaze-following benchmark on the GFIE dataset. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/gfie.
