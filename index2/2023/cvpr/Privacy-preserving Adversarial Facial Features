Face recognition service providers protect face privacy by extracting compact and discriminative facial features (representations) from images, and storing the facial features for real-time recognition. However, such features can still be exploited to recover the appearance of the original face by building a reconstruction network. Although sev-eral privacy-preserving methods have been proposed, the enhancement offace privacy protection is at the expense of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose an adver-sarial features-based face privacy protection (AdvFace) approach to generate privacy-preserving adversarial features, which can disrupt the mapping from adversarial features to facial images to defend against reconstruction attacks. To this end, we design a shadow model which simulates the attackers' behavior to capture the mapping function from facial features to images and generate adversarial la-tent noise to disrupt the mapping. The adversarial features rather than the original features are stored in the server's database to prevent leaked features from exposing facial information. Moreover, the AdvFace requires no changes to the face recognition network and can be implemented as a privacy-enhancing plugin in deployed face recognition systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Adv Face outperforms the state-of-the-art face privacy-preserving methods in defending against reconstruction at-tacks while maintaining face recognition accuracy.
