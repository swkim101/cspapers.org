In this document, we collect all the results and discussions, which, due to the page limit, could not find space in the main manuscript. This supplementary material consists of two parts. First, in Appendix A, we describe more implementation details mainly regarding our pilot study, local feature pre-training, and experiments on downstream deformable shape data. Next, in Appendix B, we present additional experimental results and analysis of our local feature pre-training strategy and its generalization in downstream tasks, including deformable shape matching and segmentation.
