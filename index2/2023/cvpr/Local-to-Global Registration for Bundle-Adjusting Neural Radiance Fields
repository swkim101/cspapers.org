Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved photorealistic novel views synthesis; however, the requirement of accurate camera poses limits its application. Despite analysis-by-synthesis extensions for jointly learning neural3D representations and registering camera frames exist, they are susceptible to suboptimal solutions if poorly initialized. We propose L2G-NeRF, a Local-to-Global registration method for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields: first, a pixel-wise flexible alignment, followed by a framewise constrained parametric alignment. Pixel-wise local alignment is learned in an unsupervised way via a deep network which optimizes photometric reconstruction errors. framewise global alignment is performed using differentiable parameter estimation solvers on the pixel-wise correspondences to find a global transformation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of high-fidelity reconstruction and resolving large camera pose misalignment. Our module is an easy-to-use plugin that can be applied to NeRF variants and other neural field applications.
