We address the problem of clothed human reconstruction from a single image or uncalibrated multiview images. existing methods struggle with reconstructing detailed geometry of a clothed human and often require a calibrated setting for multiview reconstruction. We propose a flexible framework which, by leveraging the parametric SMPL-X model, can take an arbitrary number of input images to reconstruct a clothed human model under an uncalibrated setting. At the core of our framework is our novel self-evolved signed distance field (SeSDF) module which allows the framework to learn to deform the signed distance field (SDF) derived from the fitted SMPL-X model, such that detailed geometry reflecting the actual clothed human can be encoded for better reconstruction. Besides, we propose a simple method for self-calibration of multiview images via the fitted SMPL-X parameters. This lifts the requirement of tedious manual calibration and largely increases the flexibility of our method. Further, we introduce an effective occlusion-aware feature fusion strategy to account for the most useful features to reconstruct the human model. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on public benchmarks, demonstrating significant superiority over the state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and quantitatively.
