Gait recognition is a biometric technology that identifies people by their walking patterns. The silhouettes-based method and the skeletons-based method are the two most popular approaches. However, the silhouette data are easily affected by clothing occlusion, and the skeleton data lack body shape information. To obtain a more robust and comprehensive gait representation for recognition, we propose a transformer-based gait recognition framework called MMGaitFormer, which effectively fuses and aggregates the spatial-temporal information from the skeletons and silhouettes. Specifically, a Spatial Fusion M odule (SFM) and a Temporal Fusion Module (TFM) are proposed for effective spatial-level and temporal-level feature fusion, respectively. The SFM performs fine-grained body parts spatial fusion and guides the alignment of each part of the silhouette and each joint of the skeleton through the attention mechanism. The TFM performs temporal modeling through Cycle Position Embedding (CPE) andfuses temporal information of two modalities. Experiments demonstrate that our MMGaitFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular gait datasets. For the most challenging “CL” (i.e., walking in different clothes) condition in CASIA-B, our method achieves a rank-l accuracy of 94. 8%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art single-modal methods by a large margin.
