Encouraged by the effectiveness of encoding temporal dynamics within the frequency domain, recent human motion prediction systems prefer to first convert the motion representation from the original pose space into the frequency space. In this paper, we introduce two closer looks at effective frequency representation learning for robust motion prediction and summarize them as: decompose more and aggregate better. Motivated by these two insights, we develop two powerful units that factorize the frequency representation learning task with a novel decomposition-aggregation two-stage strategy: (1) frequency decomposition unit unweaves multi-view frequency representations from an input body motion by embedding its frequency features into multiple spaces; (2) feature aggregation unit deploys a series of intra-space and inter-space feature aggregation layers to collect comprehensive frequency representations from these spaces for robust human motion prediction. As evaluated on large-scale datasets, we develop a strong baseline model for the human motion prediction task that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins: 8%∼12% on Human3.6M, 3%∼7% on CMU MoCap, and 7%∼10% on 3DPW.
