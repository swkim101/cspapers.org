Colocating multiple jobs on the same server has been a commonly used approach for improving resource utilization in cloud environments. However, performance interference due to the contention over shared resources makes resource partitioning an important research problem. Partitioning multiple resources coordinately is particularly challenging when multiple latency-critical (LC) jobs are colocated with best-effort (BE) jobs, since the QoS needs to be protected for all the LC jobs. So far, this problem is not well-addressed in the literatures. We propose an online learning based solution, named OL-Part, for partitioning resources among multiple colocated LC jobs and BE jobs. OLPart is designed based on our observation that runtime performance counters can approximately indicate resource sensitivities of jobs. Based on this finding, OLPart leverages contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) to design the partitioning solution, which employs the performance counters to enable an intelligent exploration of the search space. Applying CMAB to the resource partitioning problem faces several critical challenges. OLPart proposes several techniques to overcome these challenges. OLPart does not require prior knowledge of jobs and incurs very small overhead. Evaluations demonstrate that OLPart is optimally efficient and robust, which outperforms state-of-the-art solutions with significant margins.
