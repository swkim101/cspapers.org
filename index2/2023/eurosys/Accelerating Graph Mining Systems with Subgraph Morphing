Graph mining applications analyze the structural properties of large graphs. These applications are computationally expensive because finding structural patterns requires checking subgraph isomorphism, which is NP-complete. This paper exploits the sub-structural similarities across different patterns by employing Subgraph Morphing to accurately infer the results for a given set of patterns from the results of a completely different set of patterns that are less expensive to compute. To enable Subgraph Morphing in practice, we develop efficient query transformation techniques as well as automatic result conversion strategies for different application scenarios. We have implemented Subgraph Morphing in four state-of-the-art graph mining and subgraph matching systems: Peregrine, AutoMine/- GraphZero, GraphPi, and BigJoin; a thorough evaluation demonstrates that Subgraph Morphing improves the performance of these four systems by 34×, 10×, 18×, and 13×, respectively.
