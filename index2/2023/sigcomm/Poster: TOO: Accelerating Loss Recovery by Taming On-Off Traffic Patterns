As the ubiquitous phenomenon occurs in applications such as live streaming and video conferencing, the on-off traffic pattern is regarded as a disadvantage for congestion control. However, we argue that it can be transformed as an advantage for accelerating loss recovery. In this paper, we report the design of TOO, a loss recovery acceleration mechanism that tames on-off patterns for loss duplicate reinjection without incurring non-trivial traffic overhead.
