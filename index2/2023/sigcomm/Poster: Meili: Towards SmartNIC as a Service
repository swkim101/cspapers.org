The gap between the stagnation of CPU power and the increase in network bandwidth has promoted a shift towards placing more computation on network hardware [16, 17]. Therefore, SmartNICs have become prevalent in data centers to serve various cloud applications, from network functions [15, 17, 22] to high-level applications like distributed applications and storage [14, 16, 18--21, 23].
