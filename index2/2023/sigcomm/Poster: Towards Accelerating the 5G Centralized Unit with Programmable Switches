5G networks are envisioned to support various emerging use cases, such as telemedicine, remote construction, autonomous driving, industrial automation, drone control, and immersive entertainment. These applications demand low latency, high reliability, and in some cases require ultra-high-bandwidths. Specifically, these applications require 5G networks to provide 1ms end-to-end latency with 99.99% reliability [12] for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Various studies [11, 19, 26] have shown that the radio access network (RAN) remains the bottleneck in realizing low-latency communications.
