Critical thinking is an essential human skill. Despite the importance of critical thinking, research reveals that our reasoning ability suffers from personal biases and cognitive resource limitations, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes. This paper presents the novel idea of AI-framed Questioning that turns information relevant to the AI classification into questions to actively engage usersâ€™ thinking and scaffold their reasoning process. We conducted a study with 204 participants comparing the effects of AI-framed Questioning on a critical thinking task; discernment of logical validity of socially divisive statements. Our results show that compared to no feedback and even causal AI explanations of an always correct system, AI-framed Questioning significantly increase human discernment of logically flawed statements. Our experiment exemplifies a future style of Human-AI co-reasoning system, where the AI becomes a critical thinking stimulator rather than an information teller.
