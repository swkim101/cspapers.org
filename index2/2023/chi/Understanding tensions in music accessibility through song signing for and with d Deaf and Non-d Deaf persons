Song signing is a method practiced by people who are d/Deaf and non-d/Deaf individuals to visually represent music and make music accessible through sign language and body movements. Although there is growing interest in song signing, there is a lack of understanding on what d/Deaf people value about song signing and how to make song signing productions that they would consider acceptable. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 d/Deaf participants to gain a deeper understanding of what they value in music and song signing. We then interviewed 14 song signers to understand their experiences and processes in creating song signing performances. From this study, we identify three complex, interrelated layers of the song signing creation process and discuss how they can be supported and completed to potentially bridge the cultural divide between the d/Deaf and non-d/Deaf audiences and guide more culturally responsive creation of music.
