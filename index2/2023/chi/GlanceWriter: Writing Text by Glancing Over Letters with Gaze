Writing text with eye gaze only is an appealing hands-free text entry method. However, existing gaze-based text entry methods introduce eye fatigue and are slow in typing speed because they often require users to dwell on letters of a word, or mark the starting and ending positions of a gaze path with extra operations for entering a word. In this paper, we propose GlanceWriter, a text entry method that allows users to enter text by glancing over keys one by one without any need to dwell on any keys or specify the starting and ending positions of a gaze path when typing a word. To achieve so, GlanceWriter probabilistically determines the letters to be typed based on the dynamics of gaze movements and gaze locations. Our user studies demonstrate that GlanceWriter significantly improves the text entry performance over EyeSwipe, a dwell-free input method using “reverse crossing” to identify the starting and ending keys. GlanceWriter also outperforms the dwell-free gaze input method of Tobii’s Communicator 5, a commercial eye gaze-based communication system. Overall, GlanceWriter achieves dwell-free and crossing-free text entry by probabilistically decoding gaze paths, offering a promising gaze-based text entry method.
