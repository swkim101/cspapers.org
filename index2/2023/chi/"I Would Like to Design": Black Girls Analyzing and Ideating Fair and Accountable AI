Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is especially important for those who may not be well-represented in technology design. We worked with ten Black girls in fifth and sixth grade from a predominantly Black school to understand their perceptions around fair and accountable AI and how they can have an empowered role in the creation of AI. Thematic analysis of discussions and activity artifacts from a summer camp and after-school session revealed a number of findings around how Black girls: perceive AI, primarily consider fairness as niceness and equality (but may need support considering other notions, such as equity), consider accountability, and envision a just future. We also discuss how the learners can be positioned as decision-making designers in creating AI technology, as well as how AI literacy learning experiences can be empowering.
