Smart shape-changing materials can be adapted to different usages, which have been leveraged for dynamic affordances and on-demand haptic feedback in HCI. However, the applicability of these materials is often bottlenecked by their complex fabrication and the challenge of programming localized and individually addressable responses. In this work, we propose a toolkit for designing and fabricating programmable morphing objects using off-the-shelf epoxies. Our method involves varying the crosslinker to epoxy resin ratio to control morphing temperatures from 40 ℃ to 90 ℃, either across different regions of a shape memory device or across devices. Functional components (e.g., conductive fabric, magnetic particles) are also incorporated with the epoxy for sensing and active reconfiguration. A toolbox of fabrication methods and a primitive design library are introduced to support design ideation and programmable morphing. Finally, we demonstrate application examples, including morphing toys, a shape-changing input device, and an active window shutter.
