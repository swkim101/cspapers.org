Mixed-reality telepresence allows local and remote users feel as if they are present together in the same space. In this paper we report on a mixed-reality volumetric telepresence system that is adaptable, multi-user and cross-modal, i.e. combining augmented and virtual reality technologies with face-to-face interactions. The system extends state-of-art by creating full-body and environmental volumetric renderings in real-time over local enterprise networks. We report findings of an evaluation in a training scenario which was adapted for remote delivery and led by an industry professional. Analysis of interviews and observed behaviours identify varying attitudes towards virtually mediated full-body experiences and highlight the impact of volumetric mixed-reality telepresence to facilitate personal experiences of co-presence and to ground communication with interlocutors.
