Spatiotemporal modulation (STM) is used to render tactile patterns with ultrasound arrays. Previous research only explored the effects of single-point STM parameters, such as drawing speed (Vd). Here we explore the effects of multi-point STM on both perceptual (intensity) and emotional (valence/arousal) responses. This introduces a new control parameter for STM - the number of focal points (Nfp) â€“ on top of conventional STM parameter (Vd). Our results from a study with 30 participants showed a negative effect of Nfp on perceived intensity and arousal, but no significant effects on valence. We also found the effects of Vd still aligned with prior results for single-point, even when different Nfp were used, suggesting that effects observed from single-point also apply to multi-point STM. We finally derive recommendations, such as using single-point STM to produce stimuli with higher intensity and/or arousal, or using multi-point STM for milder and more relaxing (less arousing) experiences.
