Remote direct memory access (RDMA) supports zero-copy networking by transferring data from clients directly to host memory, eliminating the need to copy data between clients' memory and the data buffers in the hosting server. However, the hosting server must design efficient memory management schemes to handle incoming clients' data. In this paper, we propose a high-performance host memory management scheme called HM2 for RDMA-enabled distributed systems. We present a new buffer structure for incoming data from clients. In addition, we propose efficient data processing methods to reduce network transfers between clients and servers. We conducted a preliminary experiment to evaluate HM2, and the results showed HM2 achieved higher throughput than existing schemes, including L5 and FaRM.
