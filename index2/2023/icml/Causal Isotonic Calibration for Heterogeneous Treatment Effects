We propose causal isotonic calibration, a novel nonparametric method for calibrating predictors of heterogeneous treatment effects. In addition, we introduce a novel data-efficient variant of calibration that avoids the need for hold-out calibration sets, which we refer to as cross-calibration. Causal isotonic cross-calibration takes cross-fitted predictors and outputs a single calibrated predictor obtained using all available data. We establish under weak conditions that causal isotonic calibration and cross-calibration both achieve fast doubly-robust calibration rates so long as either the propensity score or outcome regression is estimated well in an appropriate sense. The proposed causal isotonic calibrator can be wrapped around any black-box learning algorithm to provide strong distribution-free calibration guarantees while preserving predictive performance.
