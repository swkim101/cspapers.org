We first propose a decentralized proximal stochastic gradient tracking method (DProxSGT) for nonconvex stochastic composite problems, with data heterogeneously distributed on multiple workers in a decentralized connected network. To save communication cost, we then extend DProxSGT to a compressed method by compressing the communicated information. Both methods need only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ samples per worker for each proximal update, which is important to achieve good generalization performance on training deep neural networks. With a smoothness condition on the expected loss function (but not on each sample function), the proposed methods can achieve an optimal sample complexity result to produce a near-stationary point. Numerical experiments on training neural networks demonstrate the significantly better generalization performance of our methods over large-batch training methods and momentum variance-reduction methods and also, the ability of handling heterogeneous data by the gradient tracking scheme.
