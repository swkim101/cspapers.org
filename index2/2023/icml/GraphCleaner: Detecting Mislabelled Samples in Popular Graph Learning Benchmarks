Label errors have been found to be prevalent in popular text, vision, and audio datasets, which heavily influence the safe development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Despite increasing efforts towards improving the quality of generic data types, such as images and texts, the problem of mislabel detection in graph data remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we explore mislabelling issues in popular real-world graph datasets and propose GraphCleaner, a post-hoc method to detect and correct these mislabelled nodes in graph datasets. GraphCleaner combines the novel ideas of 1) Synthetic Mislabel Dataset Generation, which seeks to generate realistic mislabels; and 2) Neighborhood-Aware Mislabel Detection, where neighborhood dependency is exploited in both labels and base classifier predictions. Empirical evaluations on 6 datasets and 6 experimental settings demonstrate that GraphCleaner outperforms the closest baseline, with an average improvement of 0.14 in F1 score, and 0.16 in MCC. On real-data case studies, GraphCleaner detects real and previously unknown mislabels in popular graph benchmarks: PubMed, Cora, CiteSeer and OGB-arxiv; we find that at least 6.91% of PubMed data is mislabelled or ambiguous, and simply removing these mislabelled data can boost evaluation performance from 86.71% to 89.11%.
