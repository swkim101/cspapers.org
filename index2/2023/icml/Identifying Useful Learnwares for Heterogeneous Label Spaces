The learnware paradigm aims to build a learn-ware market containing numerous learnwares, each of which is a well-performing machine learning model with a corresponding specification to describe its functionality so that future users can identify useful models for reuse according to their own requirements. With the learnware paradigm, model developers can spontaneously submit models to the market without leaking data privacy, and users can leverage models in the market to accomplish different machine learning tasks without having to build models from scratch. Recent studies have attempted to realize the model specification through Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME). In this paper, we make an attempt to improve the effectiveness of RKME specification for heterogeneous label spaces, where the learn-ware market does not contain a model that has the same label space as the user’s task, by considering a class-specific model specification explicitly, along with a class-wise learnware identification method. Both theoretical and empirical analyses show that our proposal can quickly and accurately find useful learnwares that satisfy users’ requirements. Moreover, we find that for a specific task, reusing a small model identified via the specification performs better than directly reusing a pre-trained generic big model.
