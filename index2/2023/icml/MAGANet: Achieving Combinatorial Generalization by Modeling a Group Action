Combinatorial generalization refers to the ability to collect and assemble various attributes from diverse data to generate novel unexperienced data. This ability is considered a necessary passing point for achieving human-level intelligence. To achieve this ability, previous unsupervised approaches mainly focused on learning the disen-tangled representation, such as the variational au-toencoder. However, recent studies discovered that the disentangled representation is insufficient for combinatorial generalization and is not even correlated. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for data generation that can robustly generalize under these distribution shift situations. Instead of representing each data, our model discovers the fundamental transformation between a pair of data by simulating a group action. To test the combinatorial generalizability, we evaluated our model in two settings: Recombination-to-Element and Recombination-to-Range. The experiments demonstrated that our method has quantitatively and qualitatively superior generalizability and generates better images than traditional models.
