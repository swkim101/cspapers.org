In this paper, we propose a novel framework Active Learning based Structural Inference (ALaSI), to infer the existence of directed connections from observed agentsâ€™ states over a time period in a dynamical system. With the help of deep active learning, ALaSI is competent in learning the representation of connections with a relatively small pool of prior knowledge. Moreover, based on information theory, the proposed inter-and out-of-scope message learning pipelines are remarkably beneficial to structural inference for large dynamical systems. We evaluate ALaSI on various large datasets including simulated systems and real-world networks, to demonstrate that ALaSI is able to outperform previous methods in precisely inferring the existence of connections in large systems under either supervised learning or unsupervised learning.
