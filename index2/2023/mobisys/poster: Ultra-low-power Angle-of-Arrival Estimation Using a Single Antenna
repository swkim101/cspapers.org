In this poster, we present a new approach to low-power self-localization for IoT nodes called Sirius. With the rise of low-power sensor networks in precision farming, climate monitoring, and surveying, it has become increasingly critical to accurately and robustly localize low-power sensor nodes. However, traditional systems that rely on antenna arrays and time synchronization are too complex for low-power IoT nodes. To overcome this limitation, Sirius utilizes gain-pattern reconfigurable antennas with passive envelope detector-based radios to estimate angle-of-arrival. This is achieved by embedding direction-specific codes in the received signals, which carry angle-of-arrival information. Our prototype has demonstrated a median error of 7 degrees in AoA estimation and 2.5 meters in localization, comparable to state-of-the-art antenna array-based systems. This new approach opens up exciting possibilities for low-power IoT nodes in various fields.
