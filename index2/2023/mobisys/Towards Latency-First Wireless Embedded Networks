Current physical-layer networking technology primarily optimises for reliability rather than latency, thus unnecessarily impairing latency-sensitive applications such as real-time control in embedded, wireless, and dense networks. This extended abstract introduces a set of novel low-level networking primitives that optimise such networks for latency, pushing latency-inducing failures up the stack. The development of and experiments on a 25-node prototype network show that the resulting symbol-synchronous architecture unlocks application scenarios formerly reserved for wired networks, offering sub-millisecond network latency across multiple hops for real-time control, in-the-loop classification based on distributed data from 10s of nodes in milliseconds, and a 25--75% traffic reduction when data is subject to large measurement noise.
