Low-power sensor networks are transforming large-scale sensing in precision farming, livestock tracking, climate-monitoring and surveying. Accurate and robust localization in such low-power sensor nodes has never been as crucial as it is today. This paper presents, Sirius, a self-localization system using a single receiver for low-power IoT nodes. Traditionally, systems have relied on antenna arrays and tight synchronization to estimate angle-of-arrival (AoA) and time-of-flight with known access points. While these techniques work well for regular mobile systems, low-power IoT nodes lack the resources to support these complex systems. Sirius explores the use of gain-pattern reconfigurable antennas with passive envelope detector-based radios to perform AoA estimation without requiring any kind of synchronization. It shows a technique to embed direction specific codes to the received signals which are transparent to regular communication channel but carry AoA information with them. Sirius embeds these direction-specific codes by using reconfigurable antennas and fluctuating the gain pattern of the antenna. Our prototype demonstrates a median error of 7 degrees in AoA estimation and 2.5 meters in localization, which is similar to state-of-the-art antenna array-based systems. Sirius opens up new possibilities for low-power IoT nodes.
