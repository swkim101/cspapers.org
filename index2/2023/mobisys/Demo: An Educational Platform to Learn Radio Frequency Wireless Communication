Obtaining hands-on experience with wireless communication can be challenging due to the limited configurability of most commercial off-the-shelf transceivers. We present a low-cost and open-source educational platform designed to help students experiment and investigate wireless concepts through real-world testing. Our platform provides students with the ability to control the physical-layer configuration, design and implement their backscatter system, and conduct link quality experiments to investigate the resulting system performance. This platform offers students a unique opportunity to gain practical experience and deepen their understanding of wireless communication, while also providing a valuable tool for researchers and educators in the field.
