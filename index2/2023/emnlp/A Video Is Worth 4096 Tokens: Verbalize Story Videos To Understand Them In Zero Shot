Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. While previous research in multi-media understanding has focused mainly on videos with specific actions like cooking, there is a dearth of large annotated training datasets, hindering the development of supervised learning models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question-answering, and topic classification. To bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing story videos to generate their descriptions in natural language and then performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on five video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised base-lines for video understanding. Further, alleviating a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science, persuasion strategy identification.
