We investigate the task of out-of-domain (OOD) text classification with the aim of extending a classification model, trained on multiple source domains, to an unseen target domain. Recent studies have shown that learning invariant representations can enhance the performance of OOD generalization. However, the inherent disparity in data distribution across different domains poses challenges for achieving effective invariance learning. This study addresses this issue by employing memory aug-mentations. Specifically, we augment the original feature space using key-value memory and employ a meta-learning-based approach to enhance the quality of the invariant representations. Experimental results on sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks show the effectiveness of memory-based method for invariance learning, leading to state-of-the-art performance on six datasets.
