Using a vocabulary that is shared across languages is common practice in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT). In addition to its simple design, shared tokens play an important role in positive knowledge transfer, assuming that shared tokens refer to similar meanings across languages. However, when word overlap is small, especially due to different writing systems, transfer is inhibited. In this paper, we define word-level information transfer pathways via word equivalence classes and rely on graph networks to fuse word embeddings across languages. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach: 1) embeddings of words with similar meanings are better aligned across languages, 2) our method achieves consistent BLEU improvements of up to 2.3 points for high- and low-resource MNMT, and 3) less than 1.0\% additional trainable parameters are required with a limited increase in computational costs, while inference time remains identical to the baseline. We release the codebase to the community.
