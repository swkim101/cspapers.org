Despite the excellent performance of vision-language pre-trained models (VLPs) on conventional VQA task, they still suffer from two problems: First, VLPs tend to rely on language biases in datasets and fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Second, they are inefficient in terms of memory footprint and computation. Although promising progress has been made in both problems, most existing works tackle them independently. To facilitate the application of VLP to VQA tasks, it is imperative to jointly study VLP compression and OOD robustness, which, however, has not yet been explored. This paper investigates whether a VLP can be compressed and debiased simultaneously by searching sparse and robust subnetworks. To this end, we systematically study the design of a training and compression pipeline to search the subnetworks, as well as the assignment of sparsity to different modality-specific modules. Our experiments involve 3 VLPs, 2 compression methods, 4 training methods, 2 datasets and a range of sparsity levels and random seeds. Our results show that there indeed exist sparse and robust subnetworks, which are competitive with the debiased full VLP and clearly outperform the debiasing SoTAs with fewer parameters on OOD datasets VQA-CP v2 and VQA-VS.
