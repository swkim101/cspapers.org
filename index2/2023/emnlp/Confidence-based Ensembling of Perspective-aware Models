Research in the field of NLP has recently focused on the variability that people show in selecting labels when performing an annotation task. Exploiting disagreements in annotations has been shown to offer advantages for accurate modelling and fair evaluation. In this paper, we propose a strongly perspectivist model for supervised classification of natural language utterances. Our approach combines the predictions of several perspective-aware models using key information of their individual confidence to capture the subjectivity encoded in the annotation of linguistic phenomena. We validate our method through experiments on two case studies, irony and hate speech detection, in in-domain and cross-domain settings. The results show that confidence-based ensembling of perspective-aware models seems beneficial for classification performance in all scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with automatically extracted perspectives from annotations when the annotatorsâ€™ metadata are not available.
