In many centralized labor markets candidates interview with potential employers before matches are formed through a clearinghouse. One prominent example is the market for medical residencies and fellowships, which in recent years has had a large increase in the number of interviews. There have been numerous efforts to reduce the cost of interviewing in these markets using a variety of signalling mechanisms, however, the theoretical properties of these mechanisms have not been systematically studied in models with rich preferences. In this paper we give theoretical guarantees for a variety of mechanisms, finding that these mechanisms must properly balance competition in both sides of the market.
