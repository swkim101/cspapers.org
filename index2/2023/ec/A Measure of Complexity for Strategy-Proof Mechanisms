We propose a measure of strategic complexity for strategy-proof mechanisms. In particular, we characterize a class of implementations for which we provide a complete ranking in terms of their strategic complexity, in a well-defined sense. The class---which we call essential frames---includes virtually all strategy-proof mechanisms used in practice.
