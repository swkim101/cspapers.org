In strategyproof mechanisms, it is always an optimal strategy for agents to truthfully report their private information to the mechanism. This theoretical property is clearly appealing, as it gives a mechanism designer the ability to predict play and make meaningful statements about other criteria such as welfare. However, a growing body of empirical evidence has documented significant deviations from truthful reporting in such mechanisms. This issue is particularly important in matching markets, the focus in this paper.
