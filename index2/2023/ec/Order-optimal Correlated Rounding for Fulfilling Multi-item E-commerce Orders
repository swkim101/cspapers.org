We study a parsimonious correlated rounding problem motivated by e-commerce fulfillment. In this problem, we are given a multi-item order of size q; for each item i = 1, ..., q, we are given the probability uki with which it must be shipped from each Fulfillment Center (FC) k = 1, ..., K, with [EQUATION]. The goal is to randomly select a FC to ship each item following these marginal probabilities uki (motivated by trying to satisfy long-run inventory flow), in a way that not many distinct FC's end up being used (motivated by reducing the number of boxes that need to be shipped). In particular, the objective is to use each FC with probability at most α · yk, where yk:= maxi=1 ..., q uki is a lower bound on the probability with which FC k must be used, and α ≥ 1 is the guarantee to be made as small as possible.
