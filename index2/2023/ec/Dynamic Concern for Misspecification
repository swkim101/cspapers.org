We consider an agent that repeatedly chooses among actions whose payoffs have an unknown distribution. This choice is taken using an average of robust control assessments, where each assessment takes a different structured model as the benchmark. We introduce endogeneity in the misspecification concern: the better the structured models explain the past, the less concerned the agent is.
