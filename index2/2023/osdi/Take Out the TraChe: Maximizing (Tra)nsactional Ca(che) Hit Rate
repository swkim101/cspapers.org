Most caching policies focus on increasing object hit rate to improve overall system performance. However, these algorithms are insufficient for transactions. In this work, we define a new metric, transactional hit rate, to capture when caching reduces latency for transactions. We present DeToX, a caching system that leverages transactional dependencies to make eviction and prefetching decisions. DeToX is able to significantly outperform single-object alternatives on real-world workloads and popular OLTP benchmarks, providing up to a 130% increase in transaction hit rate and 3.4x improvement in cache efficiency.
