Virtual machines (VMs) have been increasingly deployed in real-time systems to enhance heterogeneous resource sharing. Despite being isolated for security and prevention of failure propagation, VMs need to communicate with each other to complete certain tasks jointly. A real-time inter-VM communication framework has been proposed based on VirtIO, which is in essence a mechanism of message passing with high latency and low scalability on data amount. In contrary, IVSHMEM implements inter-VM communication with shared memory, which is generally fast and large in throughput. Unfortunately, IVSHMEM does not resolve resource contention between flows and hence cannot be applied in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose a real-time inter-VM communication framework RTISM built upon shared memory and IVSHMEM. RTISM provides priority-based scheduling and supports mixed-criticality flows. Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) analysis is reported to bound the end-to-end communication delay and a Limited Priority Assignment (LPA) algorithm is developed to enhance schedulability. Experimental evaluation shows that (i) RTISM has about 4 times higher throughput than the VirtIO-based inter-VM communication framework; (ii) LPA improves schedulability by over 25% compared to the state-of-the-art; (iii) WCRT produces a tight bound.
