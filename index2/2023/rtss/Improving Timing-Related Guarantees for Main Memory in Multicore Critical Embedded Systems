Main memory is one of the most complex resources to analyze in multicore-based embedded real-time systems, with contention in the memory controller and the timing constraints of the main memory device as the main contributors to that complexity. One of the main challenges in multicore real-time systems is producing the required evidence on the management of contention delay for the certification. This stems from the fact that current MPSoCs barely provide any event monitors on how tasks interact and delay each other in memory. Besides, even if hardware and software mechanisms are in place to mitigate contention in the memory system, it is hard - if at all possible - to provide evidence about their correctness. In this work, we cover this gap by proposing a lightweight hardware mechanism that tightly tracks inter-core contention in memory. The proposed hardware mechanism, which we evaluate in detail, improves the quality of timing-related evidence that must be provided on how contention in main memory of multicore real-time systems is handled in adherence to applicable safety standards.
