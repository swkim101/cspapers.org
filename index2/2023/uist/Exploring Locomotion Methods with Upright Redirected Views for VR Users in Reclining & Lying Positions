Using VR in reclining & lying positions is getting common for users, but upward views caused by posture have to be redirected to be parallel to the ground as when users are standing. This affects users’ locomotion performances in VR due to potential physical restrictions, and the visual-vestibular-proprioceptive conflict. This paper is among the first to investigate the suited locomotion methods and how reclining & lying positions and redirection affect them in such conditions. A user-elicitation study was carried out to construct a set of locomotion methods based on users’ preferences when they were in different reclining & lying positions. A second study developed user-preferred ’tapping’ and ’chair rotating’ gestures, by evaluating their performances at various body reclining angles, we measured the general impacts of posture and redirection. The results showed that these methods worked effectively, but exposed some shortcomings, and users performed worst at 45° reclining angles. Finally, four upgraded methods were designed and verified to improve the locomotion performances.
