In this study, we explore a new way to complementarily utilize the immersive visual output of VR and the physical haptic input of a smartphone. In particular, we focus on interacting with distant virtual objects using a smartphone in a through-plane manner and present a novel selection technique that overcomes the binocular parallax that occurs in such an arrangement. In our proposed technique, when a user in the stereoscopic viewing mode needs to perform a distant selection, the user brings the fingertip near the screen of the mobile device, triggering a smoothly animated transition to the monoscopic touching mode. Using a novel proof-of-concept implementation that utilizes a transparent acrylic panel, we conducted a user study and found that the proposed technique is significantly quicker, more precise, more direct, and more intuitive compared to the ray casting baseline. Subsequently, we created VR applications that explore the rich and interesting use cases of the proposed technique.
