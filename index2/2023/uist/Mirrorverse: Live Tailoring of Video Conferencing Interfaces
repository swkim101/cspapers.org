How can we let users adapt video-based meetings as easily as they rearrange furniture in a physical meeting room? We describe a design space for video conferencing systems that includes a five-step “ladder of tailorability,” from minor adjustments to live reprogramming of the interface. We then present Mirrorverse and show how it applies the principles of computational media to support live tailoring of video conferencing interfaces to accommodate highly diverse meeting situations. We present multiple use scenarios, including a virtual workshop, an online yoga class, and a stand-up team meeting to evaluate the approach and demonstrate its potential for new, remote meetings with fluid transitions across activities.
