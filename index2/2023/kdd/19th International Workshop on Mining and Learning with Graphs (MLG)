The 19th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs (MLG) is held in Long Beach, CA, USA and is co-located with the Tenth International Workshop on Deep Learning on Graphs (DLG) as part of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. This workshop is a forum for exchanging ideas and methods for mining and learning with graphs, developing new common understandings of the problems at hand, sharing of data sets where applicable, and leveraging existing knowledge from different disciplines. In doing so, we aim to better understand the overarching principles and the limitations of our current methods, and to inspire research on new algorithms and techniques for mining and learning with graphs. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, graph mining, graph machine learning, statistical relational learning, social network analysis, and network science. The target audience spans researchers and practitioners across academia, government, and industry.
