Applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to real-world problems is challenging for machine learning (ML) practitioners due to two major obstacles. The first hurdle is the high barrier to learn programming GNNs from scratch. The second challenge lies in overcoming engineering difficulties when scaling GNN models for large graphs at an industry-level. To address these challenges, GraphStorm, an open-source framework, offers a solution by providing an easy-to-use user interface and an end-to-end GNN training/inference pipeline that seamlessly handles extremely large graphs in a distributed manner This tutorial aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of GraphStorm, including its design principles, target users, and use cases, through presentations. The hands-on sections will enable attendees to walk through four practical GraphStorm use cases that can assist them in leveraging GNNs to address real-world business problems.
