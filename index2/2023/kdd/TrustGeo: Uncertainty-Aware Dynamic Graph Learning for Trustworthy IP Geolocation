The rising popularity of online social network services has attracted a lot of research focusing on mining various user patterns. Among them, accurate IP geolocation is essential for a plethora of location-aware applications. However, despite extensive research efforts and significant advances, the "accurate and reliable'' desideratum is yet to be achieved at a higher quality level. This work presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based model, called TrustGeo, for trustworthy street-level IP geolocation. A distinct and important aspect of TrustGeo is the incorporation of sources of uncertainty in the learning process. The results of our extensive experimental evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework in significantly improving the accuracy and trustworthiness of street-level IP geolocation.
