Traffic signal control plays a pivotal role in the management of urban traffic flow. With the rapid advancement of reinforcement learning, the development of signal control methods has seen a significant boost. However, a major challenge in implementing these methods is ensuring that signal lights do not change abruptly, as this can lead to traffic accidents. To mitigate this risk, a time-delay is introduced in the implementation of control actions, but usually has a negative impact on the overall efficacy of the control policy. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel Traffic Signal Control Framework (PRLight), which leverages an On-policy Traffic Control Model (OTCM) and an Online Traffic Prediction Model (OTPM) to achieve efficient and real-time control of traffic signals. The framework collects multi-source traffic information from a local-view graph in real-time and employs a novel fast attention mechanism to extract relevant traffic features. To be specific, OTCM utilizes the predicted traffic state as input, eliminating the need for communication with other agents and maximizing computational efficiency while ensuring that the most relevant information is used for signal control. The proposed framework was evaluated on both simulated and real-world road networks and compared to various state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing traffic congestion and accidents.
