Pick-up and delivery (PD) services such as online food ordering are playing an increasingly important role in serving people's daily demands. Accurate PD route prediction (PDRP) is important for service providers to efficiently schedule riders to improve service quality. It is crucial to model the decision-making process behind the route choice of riders for PDRP. Recent years have witnessed the success of utilizing imitation learning (IL) to model user decision-making process. Therefore, we propose to deploy an IL framework to solve the PDRP problem. However, there still exist three main challenges: (1) the rider's route decision is affected by multi-source and heterogeneous features and the complex relationships among these features make it hard to explore how they influence the rider's route decision-making; (2) the large route decision-making space make it easy to explore and predict unreasonable routes; (3) the rider's personalized preference is important in modeling the route decision-making process but cannot be fully explored. To tackle the above challenges, we propose ILRoute, a Graph-based imitation learning method for PDRP. ILRoute utilizes a multi-graph neural network (multi-GNN) to extract the multi-source and heterogeneous features and model their complex relationships. To address the large route decision-making space, ILRoute introduces a mobility regularity-aware constraint as prior route choice knowledge to reduce the exploration route decision-making space. To model the personalized preferences of the rider, ILRoute utilizes a personalized constraint mechanism to enhance the personalization of the rider's route decision-making process. Offline experiments conducted on three real-world datasets and online comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.
