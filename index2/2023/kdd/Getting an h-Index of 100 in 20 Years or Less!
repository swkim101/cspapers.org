The title of this tutorial is clickbait! However, a high h-index (relative to the stage of your career), will make you advisor, chair, dean and chancellor happy, and it can help you get a job or get promoted. Moreover, I will show that h-indices are highly susceptible to the Matthew Effect, a high h-index may help you get funding and attract strong collaborators/students, which in turn will likely further increase your h-index! Thus, "kickstarting" your h-index early in your career can pay huge dividends. It goes without saying that optimizing h-index is not the same as optimizing your scientific impact. Note that John Clauser, the 2022 Nobel prize winner in physics has an h-index of just 29. However, a high h-index does mean that you have been prolific at publishing papers, and it also means that the community does read and cite these papers. In this tutorial, I show that beyond pure quality of your research, there are many "tricks" you can do to increase both your paper's chance of acceptance, and increase its number of citations, thus optimizing your h-index. Please note that there are ways to increase your h-index that are clearly disingenuous and bad for the community (citation cartels, ghost authorships etc.). However, I believe that all the ideas presented in this tutorial are legal, moral, and are generally helpful for the entire community.
