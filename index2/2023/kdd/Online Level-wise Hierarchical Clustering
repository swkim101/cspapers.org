Online hierarchical clustering algorithms, compared to their scalable batch setting counterparts, typically provide more limited accuracy and efficiency performance. Yet, when data is incrementally arriving, a crucial setting in many clustering applications (e.g., entity resolution and concept discovery), these batch setting algorithms do not apply. This paper presents a family of new algorithms for online hierarchical clustering that combine high quality trees and fast per-point insertion time--made possible through a limited number of parallel non-greedy tree re-arrangements. We analyze our methods under assumptions about the data and the separability of clusters. Empirically, we find that our proposed algorithms yield state-of-the-art results in hierarchical clustering dendrogram purity and in building compressed prototypes for a k-nearest representative classifier.
