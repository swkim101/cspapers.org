Asset discovery is fundamental to any organization's cybersecurity efforts. Indeed, one must accurately know which assets belong to an IT infrastructure before the infrastructure can be secured. While practitioners typically rely on a relatively small set of well-known techniques, the academic literature on the subject is voluminous. In particular, the Internet measurement research community has devised a number of asset discovery techniques to support many measurement studies over the past five years. In this paper, we systematize asset discovery techniques by constructing a framework that comprehensively captures how network identifiers and services are found. We extract asset discovery techniques from recent academic literature in security and networking and place them into the systematized framework. We then demonstrate how to apply the framework to several case studies of asset discovery workflows, which could aid research reproducibility. These case studies further suggest opportunities for researchers and practitioners to uncover and identify more assets than might be possible with traditional techniques.
