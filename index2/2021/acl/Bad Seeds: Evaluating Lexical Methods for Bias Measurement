In this work we verify the results of Bad Seeds: Evaluating Lexical Methods for Bias Measurement (Antoniak and 3 Mimno, 2021). We replicate the experiments conducted and verify the main claims made in the original paper: (1) Bias 4 measurements depend on seeds and models. (2) Shuffled seed pairs can result in a significant different bias subspace 5 compared to ordered seed pairs. (3) Set similarity is negatively correlated with the explained variance of the first PCA 6 component in the seed pairings subspace. 7
