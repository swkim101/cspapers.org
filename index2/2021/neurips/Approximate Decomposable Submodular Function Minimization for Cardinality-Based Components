Terminology and notation For our results it will be convenient to interpret the ground set V as a set of nodes in a hypergraph H = (V,E), where each e âˆˆ E is an individual hyperedge and fe is the function which determines how to penalize different ways of splitting the hyperedge e. The function f is then a notion of a generalized hypergraph cut function [4, 6, 9]. This terminology is particularly convenient when talking about graph reduction strategies, since modeling a function fe will involve treating each element in e as a node. We apply this terminology here, though note that all of the results we show will apply more generally to approximately modeling a decomposable submodular function using the cut properties of a graph.
