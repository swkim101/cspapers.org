We study the problem of minimizing a convex function given by a zeroth order oracle that is possibly corrupted by outlier noise . Speciﬁcally, we assume the function values at some points of the domain are corrupted arbitrarily by an adversary, with the only restriction being that the total volume of corrupted points is bounded. The goal then is to ﬁnd a point close to the function’s minimizer using access to the corrupted oracle. We ﬁrst prove a lower bound result showing that, somewhat surprisingly, one cannot hope to approximate the minimizer nearly as well as one might expect, even if one is allowed an unbounded number of queries to the oracle. Complementing this negative result, we then develop an efﬁcient algorithm that outputs a point close to the minimizer of the convex function, where the speciﬁc distance matches exactly , up to constant factors, the distance bound shown in our lower bound result.
