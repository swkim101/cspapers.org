We study personalization of supervised learning with user-level differential privacy. Consider a setting with many users, each of whom has a training data set drawn from their own distribution P i . Assuming some shared structure among the problems P i , can users collectively learn the shared structure—and solve their tasks better than they could individually—while preserving the privacy of their data? We formulate this question using joint, user-level differential privacy—that is, we control what is leaked about each user’s entire data set. We provide algorithms that exploit popular non-private approaches in this domain like the Almost-No-Inner-Loop (ANIL) method, and give strong user-level privacy guarantees for our general approach. When the problems P i are linear regression problems with each user’s regression vector lying in a common, unknown low-dimensional subspace, we show that our efﬁcient algorithms satisfy nearly optimal estimation error guarantees. We also establish a general, information-theoretic upper bound via an exponential mechanism-based algorithm.
