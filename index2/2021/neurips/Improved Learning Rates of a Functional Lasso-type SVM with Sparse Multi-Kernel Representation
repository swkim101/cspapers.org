The organization of the proofs is as follows. Frist, we show that the `1-type penalty has as special feature, allowing one to avoid estimating explicitly the estimation error. Second, a new element in the proof is proved in empirical process theory, in which we use the strong convexity of the expected functional objective under the Bernstein condition to enter directly into local conditions. Third, we use the intrinsic correlation between different RKHSs to derive a key inequality, which is related to the left side one of our basic inequality. Based on the above three steps, we can establish a basic polynomial-type inequality, which immediately yields our general learning rates for SVM.
