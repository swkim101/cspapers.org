Predicting the most likely route from a source location to a destination is a core functionality in mapping services. Although the problem has been studied in the literature, two key limitations remain to be addressed. First, our study reveals that a signiﬁcant portion of the routes recommended by existing methods fail to reach the destination. Second, existing techniques are transductive in nature; hence, they fail to recommend routes if unseen roads are encountered at inference time. In this paper, we address these limitations through an inductive algorithm called N EURO MLR. N EURO MLR learns a generative model from historical trajectories by conditioning on three explanatory factors: the current location, the destination, and real-time trafﬁc conditions. The conditional distributions are learned through a novel combination of Lipschitz embeddings with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) using historical trajectory data. Through in-depth experiments on real-world datasets, we establish that N EURO MLR imparts signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy over the state of the art. More importantly, N EURO MLR generalizes dramatically better to unseen data and the recommended routes reach the destination with much higher likelihood than existing techniques.
