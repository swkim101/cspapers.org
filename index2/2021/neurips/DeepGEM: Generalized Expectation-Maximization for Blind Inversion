Typically, inversion algorithms assume that a forward model, which relates a source to its resulting measurements, is known and ﬁxed. Using collected indirect measurements and the forward model, the goal becomes to recover the source. When the forward model is unknown, or imperfect, artifacts due to model mismatch occur in the recovery of the source. In this paper, we study the problem of blind inversion: solving an inverse problem with unknown or imperfect knowledge of the forward model parameters. We propose DeepGEM, a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that can be used to solve for the unknown parameters of the forward model in an unsupervised manner. DeepGEM makes use of a normalizing ﬂow generative network to efﬁciently capture complex posterior distributions, which leads to more accurate evaluation of the source’s posterior distribution used in EM. We showcase the effectiveness of our DeepGEM approach by achieving strong performance on the challenging problem of blind seismic tomography, where we signiﬁcantly outperform the standard method used in seismology. We also demonstrate the generality of DeepGEM by applying it to a simple case of blind deconvolution. achieves strong performance in the task of joint seismic tomography and earthquake source localization, substantially outperforming standard approaches currently being used in seismology on synthetic data. The proposed framework is ﬂexible and can be applied to different applications that require estimation or ﬁne tuning of forward model parameters. We demonstrate this ﬂexibility by also applying the approach to a simple, but challenging, blind deconvolution problem. Future work includes applying this method to real seismic data, extending to other applications, and incorporating data-driven priors. Our results highlight the beneﬁt of blending physically sound model-based techniques with learning machinery for blind inverse problems.
