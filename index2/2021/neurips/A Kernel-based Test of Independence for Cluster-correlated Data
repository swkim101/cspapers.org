In this section, we present some preliminary results that will be useful in proving Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.3 and Proposition 3.4. We draw upon existing theory on properties of random kernel matrices and extend these properties to cluster-correlated data. Specifically, we show the convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an empirical kernel matrix based on clustered data. Let (X ,F , P ) be a probability space and H be a Hilbert space over (X ,F , P ) with a symmetric kernel function k : X × X → R. Let H be a compact operator onH, defined by
