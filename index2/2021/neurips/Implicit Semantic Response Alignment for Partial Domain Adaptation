Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the target label space is a subset of the source label space. Most state-of-art PDA methods tackle the inconsistent label space by assigning weights to classes or individual samples, in an attempt to discard the source data that belongs to the irrelevant classes. However, we believe samples from those extra categories would still contain valuable information to promote positive transfer. In this paper, we propose the Implicit Semantic Response Alignment to explore the intrinsic relationships among different categories by applying a weighted schema on the feature level. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we design a class2vec module to extract the implicit semantic topics from the visual features. With an attention layer, we calculate the semantic response according to each implicit semantic topic. Then semantic responses of source and target data are aligned to retain the relevant information contained in multiple categories by weighting the features, instead of samples. Experiments on several cross-domain benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art PDA methods. Moreover, we elaborate in-depth analyses to further explore implicit semantic alignment.
