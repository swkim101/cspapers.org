Theorem A.1. (Bias-balanced Regression) Assume the multinomial logistic regression with the model h(x)[y] = e ηy ∑ y′ e η y′ where ηy is the logit for class y, and the training data distribution Ptrain(X,Y,B). Let Pu be the data distribution shifted from Ptrain to have the uniform correlation between Y and B. If the model h estimates the conditional probability over Pu, i.e., h(x)[y] = pu(y|x), then the estimate of the conditional probability over Ptrain is:
