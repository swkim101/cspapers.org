We introduce a simple yet effective framework for improving the robustness of learning algorithms against image corruptions for autonomous driving. These cor-ruptions can occur due to both internal (e.g., sensor noises and hardware abnormalities) and external factors (e.g., lighting, weather, visibility, and other environmental effects). Using sensitivity analysis with FID-based parameterization, we propose a novel algorithm exploiting basis perturbations to improve the overall performance of autonomous steering and other image processing tasks, such as classiﬁcation and detection, for self-driving cars. Our model not only improves the performance on the original dataset, but also achieves signiﬁcant performance improvement on datasets with multiple and unseen perturbations, up to 87% and 77%, respectively. A comparison between our approach and other SOTA techniques conﬁrms the effectiveness of our technique in improving the robustness of neural network training for learning-based steering and other image processing tasks.
