Most researches for knowledge graph completion learn representations of entities and relations to predict missing links in incomplete knowledge graphs. However, these methods fail to take full advantage of both the contextual information of entity and relation. Here, we extract contexts of entities and relations from the triplets which they compose. We propose a model named AggrE, which conducts efficient aggregations respectively on entity context and relation context in multi-hops, and learns context-enhanced entity and relation embeddings for knowledge graph completion. The experiment results show that AggrE is competitive to existing models.
