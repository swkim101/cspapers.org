We present a network software suite that can model contagions or opinion manipulation in social networks, that combines features from the standard packages and extends them to allow complex, interacting, dynamic topologies, and dynamic heterogeneous agent types, with individual interaction policies. The framework allows for the easy implementation of new agent types, and provides flexible visualization tools to elucidate network behavior over time.
