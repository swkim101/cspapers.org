We introduce the Online Preference Reporting and Aggregation (OPRA) system, an open-source online system that aims at providing support for group decision-making. We illustrate OPRA's distinctive features: UI for reporting rankings with ties, comprehensive analytics of preferences, and group decision-making in combinatorial domains. We also discuss our work in an automatic mentor matching system. We hope that the open-source nature of OPRA will foster development of computerized group decision support systems.
