We propose the maximin support method, a novel extension of the D’Hondt apportionment method to approval-based multiwinner elections. The maximin support method is a sequential procedure that aims to maximize the voter support of the least supported elected candidate. It can be computed efficiently and satisfies (adjusted versions of) the main properties of the original D’Hondt method: house monotonicity, population monotonicity, and proportional representation. We also establish a close relationship between the maximin support method and alternative D’Hondt extensions due to Phragmén.
