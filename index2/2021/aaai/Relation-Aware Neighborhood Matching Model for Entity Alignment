Entity alignment which aims at linking entities with the same meaning from different knowledge graphs (KGs) is a vital step for knowledge fusion. Existing research focused on learning embeddings of entities by utilizing structural information of KGs for entity alignment. These methods can aggregate information from neighboring nodes but may also bring noise from neighbors. Most recently, several researchers attempted to compare neighboring nodes in pairs to enhance the entity alignment. However, they ignored the relations between entities which are also important for neighborhood matching. In addition, existing methods paid less attention to the positive interactions between the entity alignment and the relation alignment. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel Relation-aware Neighborhood Matching model named RNM for entity alignment. Specifically, we propose to utilize the neighborhood matching to enhance the entity alignment. Besides comparing neighbor nodes when matching neighborhood, we also try to explore useful information from the connected relations. Moreover, an iterative framework is designed to leverage the positive interactions between the entity alignment and the relation alignment in a semi-supervised manner. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model RNM performs better than state-of-the-art methods.
