The Active Sensing Testbed (AST) is a novel framework for research in machine perception and world-view rea-soning. The AST supports exploratory development of perception systems that can build internal models of the world by combining multi-view and multi-modal analyt-ics, utilize these models to form hypotheses about a sce-ne, and potentially take action to fill in gaps in knowledge or make predictions about future world states. As a modular software framework, the AST is in-tended to lower the barrier to entry for researchers and developers in applying state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to real-world problems.
