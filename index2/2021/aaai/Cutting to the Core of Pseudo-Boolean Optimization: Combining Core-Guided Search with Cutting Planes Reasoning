Core-guided techniques have revolutionized Boolean satisfiability
approaches to optimization problems (MaxSAT), but the process at
the heart of these methods, strengthening bounds on solutions by
repeatedly adding cardinality constraints, remains a bottleneck.
Cardinality constraints require significant work to be re-encoded to
SAT, and SAT solvers are notoriously weak at cardinality reasoning.

In this work, we lift core-guided search to pseudo-Boolean (PB)
solvers, which deal with more general PB optimization problems
and operate natively with cardinality constraints. The cutting planes
method used in such solvers allows us to derive stronger cardinality
constraints, which yield better updates to solution bounds, and the
increased efficiency of objective function reformulation also makes it
feasible to switch repeatedly between lower-bounding and upper-
bounding search. A thorough evaluation on applied and crafted
benchmarks shows that our core-guided PB solver significantly
improves on the state of the art in pseudo-Boolean optimization.
