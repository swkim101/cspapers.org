We introduce Wasserstein Adversarial Proximal Policy Optimization (WAPPO), a novel algorithm for visual transfer in Reinforcement Learning that explicitly learns to align the distributions of extracted features between a source and target task. WAPPO approximates and minimizes the Wasserstein-1 distance between the distributions of features from source and target domains via a novel Wasserstein Confusion objective. WAPPO outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in visual transfer and successfully transfers policies across Visual Cartpole and both the easy and hard settings of of 16 OpenAI Procgen environments.
