Many deep learning based 3D face reconstruction methods have been proposed recently, however, few of them have applications in games. Current game character customization systems either require players to manually adjust considerable face attributes to obtain the desired face, or have limited freedom of facial shape and texture. In this paper, we propose an automatic character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games. Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations. To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence of lighting and occlusions. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods used in games. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/FuxiCV/MeInGame.
