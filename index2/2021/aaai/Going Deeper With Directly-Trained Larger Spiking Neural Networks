Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising in a bio-plausible coding for spatio-temporal information and event-driven signal processing, which is very suited for energy-efficient implementation in neuromorphic hardware. However, the unique working mode of SNNs makes them more difficult to train than traditional networks. Currently, there are two main routes to explore the training of deep SNNs with high performance. The first is to convert a pre-trained ANN model to its SNN version, which usually requires a long coding window for convergence and cannot exploit the spatio-temporal features during training for solving temporal tasks. The other is to directly train SNNs in the spatio-temporal domain. But due to the binary spike activity of the firing function and the problem of gradient vanishing or explosion, current methods are restricted to shallow architectures and thereby difficult in harnessing large-scale datasets (e.g. ImageNet). To this end, we propose a threshold-dependent batch normalization (tdBN) method based on the emerging spatio-temporal backpropagation, termed “STBP-tdBN”, enabling direct training of a very deep SNN and the efficient implementation of its inference on neuromorphic hardware. With the proposed method and elaborated shortcut connection, we significantly extend directly-trained SNNs from a shallow structure (
