Millions of mobile apps have been available through various app markets. Although most app markets have enforced a number of automated or even manual mechanisms to vet each app before it is released to the market, thousands of low-quality apps still exist in different markets, some of which violate the explicitly specified market policies. In order to identify these violations accurately and timely, we resort to user comments, which can form an immediate feedback for app market maintainers, to identify undesired behaviors that violate market policies, including security-related user concerns. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study to detect and characterize the correlations between user comments and market policies. First, we propose CHAMP, an approach that adopts text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic rules through a semi-automated process, and classifies comments into 26 pre-defined types of undesired behaviors that violate market policies. Our evaluation on real-world user comments shows that it achieves both high precision and recall (>0.9) in classifying comments for undesired behaviors. Then, we curate a large-scale comment dataset (over 3 million user comments) from apps in Google Play and 8 popular alternative Android app markets, and apply CHAMP to understand the characteristics of undesired behavior comments in the wild. The results confirm our speculation that user comments can be used to pinpoint suspicious apps that violate policies declared by app markets. The study also reveals that policy violations are widespread in many app markets despite their extensive vetting efforts. CHAMP can be a whistle blower that assigns policy-violation scores and identifies most informative comments for apps.
