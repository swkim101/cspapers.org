When a bug manifests in a user-facing application, it is likely to be exposed through the graphical user interface (GUI). Given the importance of visual information to the process of identifying and understanding such bugs, users are increasingly making use of screenshots and screen-recordings as a means to report issues to developers. Due to their graphical nature, screen-recordings present challenges for automated analysis that preclude the use of current duplicate bug report detection techniques. This paper describes in detail our reproduction package artifact for TANGO, a duplicate detection technique that operates purely on video-based bug reports by leveraging both visual and textual information to overcome these challenges and aid developers in this task. Specifically, this reproduction package contains the data and code that enables our TANGOâ€™s empirical evaluation replication and future research in the area of duplicate video-based bug report detection.
