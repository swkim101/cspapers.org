Many autonomous driving applications nowadays come along with a prebuilt vector map for routing and planning purposes. In order to localize on this map, traditional LiDAR localization methods usually require a separate localization layer to function. On one hand, the separate layer occupies large storage and is not convenient to update. On the other hand, the potential of the vector map itself has not been fully exploited by existing methods. In this paper, we present a LiDAR localization system that leverages the vector map directly as the localization layer. A semantic extraction module is developed to match the heterogeneous data between LiDAR measurements and the 3D vector elements. A local map maintenance module is introduced to keep the system function robustly when there are not enough vector matches. The system adopts an optimization-based framework and infers 6-DOF poses. Experiments show that the proposed system is able to achieve centimeter accuracy robustly in both highway and urban environments, without a separate localization layer.
