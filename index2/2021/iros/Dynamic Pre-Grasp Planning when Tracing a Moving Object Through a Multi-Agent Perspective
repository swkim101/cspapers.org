While a human is tracking a moving object to prepare for later grasping, we naturally change our hand pose to generate optimal pre-grasp to avoid post-grasp adjustment. Robot hand controllers need dynamic pre-grasp planning capability, so they are not limited in dynamic tracking and catching tasks. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of using a two-stage optimization method to enable dynamic pre-grasp planning of individual fingers while tracking a moving object to ensure a later successful grasp. The first stage adopts multi-agent pursuit to partition the search space on the object surface. The method allows each finger to consider its immediate surroundings in a local view instead of globally determining the best location for all fingers. The search space for each finger is dramatically reduced since sensible alternatives are the ones left after pruning. Each finger goal location acts independently yet coordinates with others to achieve the goal of covering the object. In the second stage, four different goal point movement strategies are presented to impact the finger goal location in their respective search space to demonstrate the ability to facilitate different needs of the task and requirements of the designer. Dynamic finger goal adaption is obtained by iteratively updating these two stages. The approach is consistent in different scenarios for the object.
