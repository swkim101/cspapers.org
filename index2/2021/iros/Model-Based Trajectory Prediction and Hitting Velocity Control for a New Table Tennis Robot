Currently, most table tennis robots concentrate on the canonical position control problem while ignoring the actual velocity control requirements. In this paper, we consider these requirements and propose a new table tennis robot framework. First, a tailor-made mechanical structure is designed such that the robot can reach large workspaces. Thereafter, in the table tennis trajectory prediction process, a clustering algorithm is introduced to screen the heterogeneous predicted hitting points and filter the invalid ones, thereby significantly improving the prediction accuracy. By using quintic polynomial trajectory planning, smooth and stable high-speed control of the robot hitting motion can be obtained. Finally, a position-based strategy and a velocity-based strategy are devised for returning the table tennis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the ball's trajectory prediction algorithm is more than 92%. The success rate of returning the ball exceeds 95% at the ball velocity of 3-7 m/s, and the velocity-based strategy performs better compared with the position-based approach at the ball velocity of 7-9 m/s.
