Loop closure detection (LCD), which aims to deal with the drift emerging when robots travel around the route, plays a key role in a simultaneous localization and mapping system. Unlike most current methods which focus on seeking an appropriate representation of images, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline dominated by the estimation of spatial geometric relationship. When a query image occurs, we select semantically similar images based on the SuperPoint network and the aggregated selective match kernel in the first stage, and then conduct robust geometric confirmation to verify true loop-closing pairs in the second stage. Based on the potential property of motion field in the LCD scene, a robust feature matching algorithm, termed as motion field consensus with locality preservation (MFC-LP), is proposed. In particular, we exploit the smoothness prior to guide the learning of the motion field for an image pair in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Meanwhile, to enhance the local relevance of motion vectors, we design a locality preservation mechanism thus making the learned motion field more accurate. Extensive experiments on several publicly available datasets reveal that MFC-LP has a good performance in the general feature matching task and the proposed pipeline outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in the LCD task.
