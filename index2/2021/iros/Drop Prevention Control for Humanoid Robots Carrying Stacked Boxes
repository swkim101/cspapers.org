We developed a method to enable a humanoid robot to carry stacked boxes. In order to transport objects efficiently, it is necessary to carry multiple objects at the same time, but in previous studies, humanoid robots have only been able to carry a single object. When a humanoid robot carries stacked boxes, the robot drops boxes when the positional relationship between un-grasped boxes changes. The causes for dropping the boxes can be divided into sudden changes attributed to robot making turns or losing balance, and the accumulation of small changes that occur because of the impact of landing while walking. We propose a method that prevents sudden changes in the stacked boxes by smoothing the hand trajectory and modifying the misalignment by tilting or shaking the entire stack. We verify the effectiveness of proposed method for enabling a humanoid robot to carry stacked boxes through experiments using a simulator and an actual robot.
