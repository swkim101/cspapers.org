A novel 6-DOF parallel manipulator with two spherical-universal-revolute limbs is proposed in this work. Compared with general 6-DOF parallel manipulators of six kinematic limbs, this new manipulator actuated by spherical motion generators has only two limbs, which brings kinematic advantages such as small footprint and large workspace. The inverse position problem of the manipulator is solved by an analytical approach, upon which velocity equations are formulated. Kinematic performance including workspace and also manipulability are calculated to show the advantages of the new design.
