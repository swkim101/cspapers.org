Learned visuomotor policies have shown considerable success as an alternative to traditional, hand-crafted frameworks for robotic manipulation. Surprisingly, an extension of these methods to the multiview domain is relatively unexplored. A successful multiview policy could be deployed on a mobile manipulation platform, allowing the robot to complete a task regardless of its view of the scene. In this work, we demonstrate that a multiview policy can be found through imitation learning by collecting data from a variety of viewpoints. We illustrate the general applicability of the method by learning to complete several challenging multi-stage and contact-rich tasks, from numerous viewpoints, both in a simulated environment and on a real mobile manipulation platform. Furthermore, we analyze our policies to determine the benefits of learning from multiview data compared to learning with data collected from a fixed perspective. We show that learning from multiview data results in little, if any, penalty to performance for a fixed-view task compared to learning with an equivalent amount of fixed-view data. Finally, we examine the visual features learned by the multiview and fixed-view policies. Our results indicate that multiview policies implicitly learn to identify spatially correlated features.
