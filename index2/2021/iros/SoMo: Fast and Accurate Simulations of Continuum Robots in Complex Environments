Engineers and scientists often rely on their intuition and experience when designing soft robotic systems. The development of performant controllers and motion plans for these systems commonly requires time-consuming iterations on hardware. We present the SoMo (Soft Motion) toolkit, a software framework that makes it easy to instantiate and control typical continuum manipulators in an accurate physics simulator. SoMo introduces a standardized and human-readable description format for continuum manipulators. It leverages this description format and the Bullet physics engine to enable fast and accurate simulations of soft and soft-rigid hybrid robots in environments with complex contact interactions. This allows users to vary design and control parameters across simulations with minimal effort. We compare the capabilities of SoMo to other physics simulators and highlight the benefits and accuracy of SoMo by demonstrating the agreement between simulation and real-world experiments on several examples; these include an in-hand manipulation task with continuum fingers, an automated exploration of how to design soft fingers for precision grasping, and a brief snake locomotion study. Overall, SoMo provides an accessible way for designers of soft robotic hardware and control systems to gain access to a simulation-accelerated workflow.
