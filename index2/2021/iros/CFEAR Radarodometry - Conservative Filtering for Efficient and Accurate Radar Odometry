This paper presents an accurate, highly efficient and learning free method for large-scale radar odometry estimation. By using a simple filtering technique that keeps the strongest returns, we produce a clean radar data representation and reconstruct surface normals for efficient and accurate scan matching. Registration is carried out by minimizing a point-to-line metric and robustness to outliers is achieved using a Huber loss. Drift is additionally reduced by jointly registering the latest scan to a history of keyframes. We found that our odometry pipeline generalize well to different sensor models and datasets without changing a single parameter. We evaluate our method in three widely different environments and demonstrate an improvement over spatially cross validated state-of-the-art with an overall translation error of 1.76% in a public urban radar odometry benchmark, running merely on a single laptop CPU thread at 55 Hz.
