Single image haze removal is crucial in computer vision. In open literatures, two kinds of dehazing strategies (prior-based and learning-based methods) have been developed. However, they have a trade-off between detail preservation and the image quality. Prior-based methods reconstruct the detail well but have lower image quality while learning-based methods achieve better recovered quality but lose the detail. In this paper, to mitigate this dilemma, a hierarchical architecture using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed. It divides the dehazing problem into two parts: detail and background reconstruction. Based on investigating how haze affects the image in the wavelet domain, two networks for detail and background reconstruction are proposed. To avoid color distortion and the detail loss, the anti-vanish wavelet loss and the bound penalty are proposed. The multi-level wavelet component discriminator is proposed for further improvement. Experiments show that the proposed network can achieve superior performance in all metrics.
