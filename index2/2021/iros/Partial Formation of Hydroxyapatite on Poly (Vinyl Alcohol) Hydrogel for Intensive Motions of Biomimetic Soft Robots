The fabrication method to utilize poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogels with additional stiff parts in a single structure for hydrogel-based soft robots to realize an intensive motion with elastic energy is proposed in this paper. An inorganic material which is often seen in the hard tissues of our body; hydroxyapatite, was partially formed on a hydrogel with a simple procedure of alternatingly soaking a hydrogel with a covering device into two salt liquids. With this bioinspired structure, the whole hydrogel was able to change its physical properties while maintaining its whole structure as one. We succeeded in flicking motion of this structure only by bias displacement. This structure will help soft robots to move more intensively in a simple fabrication.
