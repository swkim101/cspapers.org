Localization is a crucial prerequisite for automated valet parking, in which a vehicle is required to navigate itself in a GPS-denied parking lot. Traditional visual localization methods usually build a feature map and use it for future localizations. However, the feature map is not robust to changes in illumination, appearance, and viewing perspective. To deal with this issue, we need a more stable map. In this paper, we propose to use the parking lotâ€™s HD vector map directly for localization. The vector representation is ultimately stable but brings challenges in data association as well. To this end, we present a novel data association method to match the surround-view images with the vector map. In addition, we also propose a closed-form relocalization strategy by exploiting distinctive road mark combinations in the vector map. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to achieve centimeter-level localization accuracy in a multi-floor parking lot.
