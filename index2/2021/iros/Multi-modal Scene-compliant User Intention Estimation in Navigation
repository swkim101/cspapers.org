A multi-modal framework to generate user intention distributions when operating a mobile vehicle is proposed in this work. The model learns from past observed trajectories and leverages traversability information derived from the visual surroundings to produce a set of future trajectories, suitable to be directly embedded into a perception-action shared control strategy on a mobile agent, or as a safety layer to supervise the prudent operation of the vehicle. We base our solution on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network with Long-Short Term Memory cells to capture trajectory distributions conditioned on past trajectories, further fused with traversability probabilities derived from visual segmentation with a Convolutional Neural Network. The proposed data-driven framework results in a significant reduction in error of the predicted trajectories (versus the ground truth) from comparable strategies in the literature (e.g. Social-GAN) that fail to account for information other than the agentâ€™s past history. Experiments were conducted on a dataset collected with a custom wheelchair model built onto the open-source urban driving simulator CARLA, proving also that the proposed framework can be used with a small, unannotated dataset.
