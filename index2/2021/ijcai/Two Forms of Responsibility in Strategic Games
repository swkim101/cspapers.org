The paper studies two forms of responsibility, seeing to it and being blamable, in the setting of strategic games with imperfect information. The paper shows that being blamable is definable through seeing to it, but not the other way around. In addition, it proposes a bimodal logical system that describes the interplay between the seeing to it modality and the individual knowledge modality.
