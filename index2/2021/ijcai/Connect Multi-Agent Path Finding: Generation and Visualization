We present a generic tool to visualize missions of the Connected Multi-Agent Path Finding (CMAPF) problem. This problem is a variant of MAPF which requires a group of agents to navigate from an initial conﬁguration to a goal conﬁguration while maintaining connection. The user can create an instance of CMAPF and can play the generated plan. Any algorithm for CMAPF can be plugged into the tool.
