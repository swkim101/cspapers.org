In this demonstration, we develop an interactive tool, HIVE, to demonstrate the ability and versatility of an explainable risk ranking model with a special focus on financial use cases. HIVE is a web-based tool that provides users with automated highlighted financial statements, and HIVE is designed for making comparing statements rather more efficient. Moreover, with the proposed tool, users can find related reports at ease, and we believe that HIVE can benefit both academics and practitioners in finance as they can work around deep learning models with their newly gained insights.
