The use of machine learning rapidly increases in high-risk scenarios where decisions are required, for example in healthcare or industrial monitoring equipment. In crucial situations, a model that can offer meaningful explanations of its decision-making is essential. In industrial facilities, the equipment's well-timed maintenance is vital to ensure continuous operation to prevent money loss. Using machine learning, predictive and prescriptive maintenance attempt to anticipate and prevent eventual system failures. This paper introduces a visualisation tool incorporating interpretations to display information derived from predictive maintenance models, trained on time-series data.
