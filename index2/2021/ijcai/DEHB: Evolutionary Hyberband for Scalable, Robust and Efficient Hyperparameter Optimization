Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple, well-performing evolutionary algorithm to solve a variety of optimization problems [K. Price and Lampinen, 2006] [Das et al., 2016]. This algorithm was originally introduced in 1995 by Storn and Price [Storn and Price, 1997], and later attracted the attention of many researchers to propose new improved state-of-the-art algorithms [Chakraborty, 2008]. DE is based on four steps: initialization, mutation, crossover and selection. Algorithm 1 presents the DE pseudo-code. Initialization. DE is a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm which consists of a population of N individuals. Each individual is considered a solution and expressed as a vector of D-dimensional decision variables as follows:
