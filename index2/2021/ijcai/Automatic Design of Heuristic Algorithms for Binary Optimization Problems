In this work we present AutoBQP, a heuristic solver for binary optimization problems. It applies automatic algorithm design techniques to search for the best heuristics for a given optimization problem. Experiments show that the solver can find algorithms which perform better than or comparable to state-of-the-art methods, and can even find new best solutions for some instances of standard benchmark sets.
