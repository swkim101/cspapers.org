Goal Recognition is the task of inferring an agent's goal, from a set of hypotheses, given a model of the environment dynamic, and a sequence of observations of such agent's behavior. While research on this problem gathered momentum as an offshoot of plan recognition, recent research has established it as a major subject of research on its own, leading to numerous new approaches that both expand the expressivity of domains in which to perform goal recognition and substantial advances to the state-of-the-art on established domain types. In this survey, we focus on the advances to goal recognition achieved in the last decade, categorizing the resulting techniques and identifying a number of opportunities for further breakthrough research.
