We present a generalization of belief base revision

to the multi-agent case. In our approach agents

have belief bases containing both propositional beliefs

and higher-order beliefs about their own beliefs

and other agentsâ€™ beliefs. Moreover, their belief

bases are split in two parts: the mutable part,

whose elements may change under belief revision,

and the core part, whose elements do not change.

We study a belief revision operator inspired by

the notion of screened revision. We provide complexity

results of model checking for our approach

as well as an optimal model checking algorithm.

Moreover, we study complexity of epistemic planning

formulated in the context of our framework.
