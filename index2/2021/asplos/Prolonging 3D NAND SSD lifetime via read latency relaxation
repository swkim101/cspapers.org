The adoption of 3D NAND has significantly increased the SSD density; however, 3D NAND density-increasing techniques, such as extensive stacking of cell layers, can amplify read disturbances and shorten SSD lifetime. From our lifetime-impact characterization on 8 state-of-the-art SSDs, we observe that the 3D TLC/QLC SSDs can be worn-out by low read-only workloads within their warranty period since a huge amount of read disturbance-induced rewrites are performed in the background. To understand alternative read disturbance mitigation opportunities, we also conducted read-latency characterizations on 2 other SSDs without the background rewrite mechanism. The collected results indicate that, without the background rewriting, the read latencies of the majority of data become higher, as the number of reads on the data increases. Motivated by these two characterizations, in this paper, we propose to relax the short read latency constraint on the high-density 3D SSDs. Specifically, our proposal relies on the hint information passed from applications to SSDs that specifies the expected read performance. By doing so, the lifetime consumption caused by the read-induced writes can be reduced, thereby prolonging the SSD lifetime. The detailed experimental evaluations show that our proposal can reduce up to 56% of the rewrite-induced spent-lifetime with only 2% lower performance, under a file-server application.
