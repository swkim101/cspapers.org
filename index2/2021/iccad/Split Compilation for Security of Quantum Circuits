An efficient quantum circuit (program) compiler aims to minimize the gate-count - through efficient instruction translation, routing, gate, and cancellation - to improve run-time and noise. Therefore, a high-efficiency compiler is paramount to enable the game-changing promises of quantum computers. To date, the quantum computing hardware providers are offering a software stack supporting their hardware. However, several third-party software toolchains, including compilers, are emerging. They support hardware from different vendors and potentially offer better efficiency. As the quantum computing ecosystem becomes more popular and practical, it is only prudent to assume that more companies will start offering software-as-a-service for quantum computers, including high-performance compilers. With the emergence of third-party compilers, the security and privacy issues of quantum intellectual properties (IPs) will follow. A quantum circuit can include sensitive information such as critical financial analysis and proprietary algorithms. Therefore, submitting quantum circuits to untrusted compilers creates opportunities for adversaries to steal IPs. In this paper, we present a split compilation methodology to secure IPs from untrusted compilers while taking advantage of their optimizations. In this methodology, a quantum circuit is split into multiple parts that are sent to a single compiler at different times or to multiple compilers. In this way, the adversary has access to partial information. With analysis of over 152 circuits on three IBM hardware architectures, we demonstrate the split compilation methodology can completely secure IPs (when multiple compilers are used) or can introduce factorial time reconstruction complexity while incurring a modest overhead (~ 3% to ~ 6% on average).
