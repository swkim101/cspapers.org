Carbon nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are emerging as an alternative to silicon devices for next-generation computing systems. However, imperfect carbon nanotube deposition during CNFET fabrication can lead to the formation of difficult-to-etch CNT aggregates in the active layer. These CNT aggregates can form parasitic CNFETs (para-FETs) that are modulated by adjoining gate contacts or back-end-of-line metal layers, thereby forming conditional shorts and stuck-at faults. We show that even weak (parametric) para-FETs can lead to a degraded static noise margin in CNFET-based design. We propose ParaMitE, a layout optimization method that horizontally flips selected standard cells in situ to minimize the number of para-FETs that can arise due to unetched CNTs. As we modify only the cell orientation (and not the cell placement), the impact on the power, timing, and wire length of the CNFET-based design is negligible. Simulation results for several benchmarks show that the proposed method can mitigate up to 60% of the possible para-FET locations (90% of the most critical locations) with only a 3% increase in the total wire length. ParaMitE can enable yield ramp-up at the foundry by providing guidance on which para-FETs can be avoided by design, and conversely, which CNT aggregates must be removed through processing steps.
