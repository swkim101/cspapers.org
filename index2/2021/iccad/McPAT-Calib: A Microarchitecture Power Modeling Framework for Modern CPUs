Energy efficiency has become the core issue of modern CPUs, and it is difficult for existing power models to balance speed, generality, and accuracy. This paper introduces McPAT-Calib, a microarchitecture power modeling framework, which combines McPAT with machine learning (ML) calibration methods. McPAT-Calib can quickly and accurately estimate the power of different benchmarks running on different CPU configurations, and provide an effective evaluation tool for the design of modern CPUs. First, McPAT-7nm is introduced to support the analytical power modeling for the 7nm technology node. Then, a wide range of modeling features are identified, and automatic feature selection and advanced regression methods are used to calibrate the McPAT-7nm modeling results, which greatly improves the generality and accuracy. Moreover, a sampling algorithm based on active learning (AL) is leveraged to effectively reduce the labeling cost. We use up to 15 configurations of 7nm RISC-V Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) along with 80 benchmarks to extensively evaluate the proposed framework. Compared with state-of-the-art microarchitecture power models, McPAT-Calib can reduce the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of shuffle-split cross-validation by 5.95%. More importantly, the MAPE is reduced by 6.14% and 3.64% for the evaluations of unknown CPU configurations and benchmarks, respectively. The AL sampling algorithm can reduce the demand of labeled samples by 50 %, while the accuracy loss is only 0.44 %.
