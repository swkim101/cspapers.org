This paper describes the latest release of the DATC Robust Design Flow (RDF), RDF-2021, which has several key additions to expand its horizons. The Chisel/FIRRTL compiler is now part of DATC RDF, enabling support of recent hardware generator designs written in Chisel. Logic locking through RTL obfuscation, an updated ABC synthesis flow, and DFT support are other notable updates to the RDF. A Bookshelf-LEF/DEF converter powered by OpenDB is also added into DATC RDF's inventory as an enabler of robust benchmark conversion. We also describe efforts toward open metrics standards and datasets for machine learning (ML) applications and smart tuning of the design flow, as well as expansion of public analysis calibration data. Our paper closes with future research directions related to DATC's efforts.
