Logic rewriting is an important optimization function that can improve Quality of Results (QoR) in modern VLSI circuits. This optimization function usually has a greedy approach and involves steps such as graph traversal, cut computation and ranking, and functional matching. For logic rewriting to be effective in improving the QoR, there should be many local rewriting iterations which can be very slow for industrial level benchmark circuits. One effective solution to speed up the logic rewriting operation is to upload its time consuming steps to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to benefit from massively parallel computations that is available there. In this regard, the present contest problem studies the possibility of using GPUs in accelerating a classical logic rewriting function. State-of-the-art large-scale open-source benchmark circuits as well as industrial-level designs will be used to test the GPU accelerated logic rewriting function.
