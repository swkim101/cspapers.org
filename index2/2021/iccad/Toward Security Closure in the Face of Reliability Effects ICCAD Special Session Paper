The reliable operation of ICs is subject to physical effects like electromigration, thermal and stress migration, negative bias temperature instability, hot-carrier injection, etc. While these effects have been studied thoroughly for IC design, threats of their subtle exploitation are not captured well yet. In this paper, we open up a path for security closure of physical layouts in the face of reliability effects. Toward that end, we first review migration effects in interconnects and aging effects in transistors, along with established and emerging means for handling these effects during IC design. Next, we study security threats arising from these effects; in particular, we cover migration effects-based, disruptive Trojans and aging-exacerbated side-channel leakage. Finally, we outline corresponding strategies for security closure of physical layouts, along with an outline for CAD frameworks.
