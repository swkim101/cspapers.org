The problem of inferring the value of internal nets in a circuit from its power side-channels has been the topic of extensive research over the past two decades, with several frameworks developed mostly focusing on cryptographic hardware. In this paper, we focus on the problem of breaking logic locking, a technique in which an original circuit is made ambiguous by inserting unknown “key” bits into it, via power side-channels. We present a pair of attack algorithms we term PowerSAT attacks, which take in arbitrary keyed circuits and resolve key information by interacting adaptively with a side-channel “oracle”. They are based on the query-by-disagreement scheme used in functional SAT attacks against locking but utilize Psuedo-Boolean constraints to allow for reasoning about hamming-weight power models. We present a software implementation of the attacks along with techniques for speeding them up. We present simulation and FPGA-based experiments as well. Notably, we demonstrate the extraction of a 32-bit key from a comparator circuit with a $2^{31}$ functional query complexity, in $\sim 64$ chosen power side-channel queries using the PowerSAT attack, where traditional CPA fails given 1000 random traces. We release a binary of our implementation along with the FPGA $+\mathbf{scope}\ \mathbf{HDL}/\mathbf{setup}$ used for the experiments.
