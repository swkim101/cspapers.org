Today's high performance computing (HPC) systems are limited by the expensive data movement between processing and memory units. An emerging solution strategy is to perform in-memory computing (IMC) using non-volatile memory. However, state-of-the-art in-memory computing paradigms fail to simultaneously deliver high precision and high energy-efficiency. Analog in-memory computing is extremely energy-efficient but inherently vulnerable to errors. In contrast, digital in-memory computing based on Boolean logic is robust to errors but less energy-efficient. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called hybrid analog-digital in-memory computing. The paper also proposes the associated in-memory computing platform and design automation tool chain needed to perform computation using the paradigm. The paradigm is capable of performing matrix-vector multiplication with both high energy-efficiency and precision. The key idea of the paradigm is to first decompose the most significant bits (MSBs) of the desired computation into Boolean functions and the least significant bits (LSBs) into matrix-vector multiplication operations. Next, the operations are mapped to digital and analog in-memory computing hardware, respectively. The proposed paradigm is evaluated using applications from the domains of structural engineering, mathematics, and statistics. Compared with analog in-memory computing, the proposed paradigm is capable of meeting the constraints on the computational accuracy. Compared with digital in-memory computing, systems, power, speed, and area are respectively improved with 2.44X, 2.45X and 2.32X.
