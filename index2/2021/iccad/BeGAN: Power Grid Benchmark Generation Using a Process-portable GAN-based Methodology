Evaluating CAD solutions to physical implementation problems has been extremely challenging due to the unavailability of modern benchmarks in the public domain. This work aims to address this challenge by proposing a process-portable machine learning (ML)-based methodology for synthesizing synthetic power delivery network (PDN) benchmarks that obfuscate intellectual property information. In particular, the proposed approach leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) and transfer learning techniques to create realistic PDN benchmarks from a small set of available real circuit data. BeGAN generates thousands of PDN benchmarks with significant histogram correlation (p-value â‰¤ 0.05) demonstrating its realism and an average L1 Norm of more than 7.1 %, highlighting its IP obfuscation capabilities. The original and thousands of ML-generated synthetic PDN benchmarks for four different open-source technologies are released in the public domain to advance research in this field.
