The emergence of continuous-flow microfluidics has led to a revolution in biochemistry and biomedicine. On such a microscale lab-on-a-chip system, complex biochemical assays, e.g., DNA analysis and drug discovery, can be executed efficiently without any human intervention. Owing to the high complexity of chip architecture and assay protocol, considerable effort has been directed towards the design automation of such chips over the past decade. Existing methods, however, perform the corresponding design tasks including binding, scheduling, placement, and routing separately, leading to serious gaps between different steps and may even cause design failure. To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a one-pass architecture synthesis flow called BigIntegr, for continuous-flow microfluidic lab-on-a-chip, integrating all the design steps into an “organic whole”, which has never been considered in prior work. With the proposed BigIntegr, the aforementioned design tasks can be synchronized seamlessly and performed in a combined manner, thereby eliminating the gaps between design steps. As a result, biochip architectures with both high efficiency and low cost can be generated without any design adjustments and modifications. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed automation flow.
