EDA tools provide a large spectrum of parameters to help designers achieve the maximized PPA of designs. The corresponding enormous solution space, however, hinders designers from navigating towards optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage automatic flow tuning tool, named FlowTuner, for efficient and effective parameter tuning of VLSI design flow. It utilizes both exploitation using transferred parameter knowledge from archival design data and exploration via a multi-stage cooperative co-evolutionary framework. Furthermore, novel flow jump-start and early-stop techniques are developed to reduce the overall runtime for tuning. Experiments on a set of IWLS 2005 benchmark circuits through a commercial tool flow demonstrate that FlowTuner produces considerably better design outcomes in 50 % shorter turnaround time compared to the state-of-the-art flow tuning techniques.
