The rapidly increasing volume and complexity of data is demanding the relentless scaling of computing power. With transistor feature size approaching physical limits, the benefits that CMOS technology can provide is diminishing. For future energy efficient computing systems, researchers aim to exploit various emerging nanotechnologies to replace conventional CMOS technology. In particular, ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) appear to be a promising candidate to continue improving energy efficiency for data-intensive applications. Advances in FeFET scalability and FeFET compatibility with CMOS have sparked growing interest in device, circuit, and system communities. While FeFET is still evolving, many researchers and developers are already cautiously optimistic about its future. This paper provides a review on FeFET's recent technology advances, challenges, and opportunities, with a particular emphasis upon device modeling and circuit design of FeFET content addressable memory, as well as their applications in machine learning.
