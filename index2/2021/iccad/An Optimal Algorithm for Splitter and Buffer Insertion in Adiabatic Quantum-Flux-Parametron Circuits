The Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP), which benefits from low power consumption and rapid switching, is one of the rising superconducting logics. Due to the rapid switching, the delay of the inputs of an AQFP gate is strictly specified so that additional buffers are needed to synchronize the delay. Meanwhile, to maintain the symmetry layout of gates and reduce the undesired parasitic magnetic coupling, the AQFP cell library adopts the minimalist design method in which splitters are employed for the gates with multiple fan-outs. Thus, an AQFP circuit may demand numerous splitters and buffers, resulting in a considerable amount of power consumption and delay. This provides a motivation for proposing an effective splitter and buffer insertion algorithm for the AQFP circuits. In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming-based algorithm that provides an optimal splitter and buffer insertion for each wire of the input circuit. Experimental results show that our method is fast, and has a 10% reduction of additional Josephson Junctions (JJs) in the complicated circuits compared with the state-of-the-art method.
