—We address the problem of calculating complex Jacobian matrices that can arise from optimization problems. An example is the inverse optimal control in human motion analysis which has a cost function that depends on the second order time-derivative of torque ¨ τ . Thus, its gradient decomposed to, among other, the Jacobian δ ¨ τ/δq . We propose a new concept called N -order Comprehensive Motion Transformation Matrix ( N -CMTM) to provide an exact analytical solution of several Jacobians. The computational complexity of the basic Jacobian and its N -order time-derivatives computed from the N -CMTM is experimentally shown to be linear to the number of joints N j . The N -CMTM is based on well-known spatial algebra which makes it available for any type of robots. Moreover, it can be used along classical algorithms. The computational complexity of the construction of the N -CMTM itself is experimentally shown to be N 2 .
