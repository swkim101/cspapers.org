Evidence-based elections aim to produce trustworthy and compelling evidence of the correctness of election outcomes, enabling the detection of problems with high probability. They require a well-curated voter-veriﬁed paper trail, compliance audits, and a rigorous tabulation audit of the election outcome, known as a risk-limiting audit (RLA). This paper focuses on ballot polling RLAs which can require that a very large sample of ballots be drawn. The main ballot polling RLA in use today, BRAVO, is designed for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot draw. But in practice, ballot polling audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop. Direct application of B RAVO to large rounds results in considerable inefﬁciency. We present M INERVA , a risk-limiting audit that addresses this problem. When compared to the B RAVO stopping rule being applied at the end of the round, for a ﬁrst-round with 90% stopping probability, M INERVA halves the number of ballots required across all state margins in the 2020 US Presidential election. When compared to the B RAVO stopping rule being applied after examination of individual ballots, M INERVA reduces the number of ballots by about a quarter. M INERVA requires that round sizes are predetermined; this does not appear to be a drawback for large ﬁrst rounds which have been typical choices for election ofﬁcials. Ballot-polling audits are the leading option in most states. M INERVA
