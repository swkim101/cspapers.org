High quality imaging usually requires bulky and expensive lenses to compensate geometric and chromatic aberrations. This poses high constraints on the optical hash or low cost applications. Although one can utilize algorithmic reconstruction to remove the artifacts of low-end lenses, the degeneration from optical aberrations is spatially varying and the computation has to trade off efficiency for performance. For example, we need to conduct patch-wise optimization or train a large set of local deep neural networks to achieve high reconstruction performance across the whole image. In this paper, we propose a PSF aware deep network, which takes the aberrant image and PSF map as input and produces the latent high quality version via incorporating deep priors, thus leading to a universal and flexible optical aberration correction method. Specifically, we pre-train a base model from a set of diverse lenses and then adapt it to a given lens by quickly refining the parameters, which largely alleviates the time and memory consumption of model learning. The approach is of high efficiency in both training and testing stages. Extensive results verify the promising applications of our proposed approach for compact low-end cameras.
