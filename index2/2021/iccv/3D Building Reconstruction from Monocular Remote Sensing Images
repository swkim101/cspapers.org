3D building reconstruction from monocular remote sensing imagery is an important research problem and an economic solution to large-scale city modeling, compared with reconstruction from LiDAR data and multi-view imagery. However, several challenges such as the partial invisibility of building footprints and facades, the serious shadow effect, and the extreme variance of building height in large-scale areas, have restricted the existing monocular image based building reconstruction studies to certain application scenes, i.e., modeling simple low-rise buildings from near-nadir images. In this study, we propose a novel 3D building reconstruction method for monocular remote sensing images, which tackles the above difficulties, thus providing an appealing solution for more complicated scenarios. We design a multi-task building reconstruction network, named MTBR-Net, to learn the geometric property of oblique images, the key components of a 3D building model and their relations via four semantic-related and three offset-related tasks. The network outputs are further integrated by a prior knowledge based 3D model optimization method to produce the the final 3D building models. Results on a public 3D reconstruction dataset and a novel released dataset demonstrate that our method improves the height estimation performance by over 40% and the segmentation F1-score by 2% - 4% compared with current state-of-the-art.
