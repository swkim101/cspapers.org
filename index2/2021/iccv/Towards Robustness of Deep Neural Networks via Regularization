The proof of Theorem 1 is adapted from the proof of Theorem 1 in [11]. Consider certain sets of joint probability distributions of three random variables (X,U,Z) ∈ X × U × Z . X can be taken as the input images, U as the output of the framework, and Z as the latent codes. PC,Z(U,Z) represents a joint distribution of a variable pair (U,Z), where Z is first sampled from PZ and then U from PC(U |Z). PC defined in (2) is the marginal distribution of U when (U,Z) ∼ PC,Z . The joint distributions Γ(X,U) or couplings between values of X and U can be written as Γ(X,U) = Γ(U |X)PX(X) due to the marginal constraint. Γ(U |X) can be decomposed into an encoding distribution Q(Z|X) and the generating distribution PC(U |Z), and Theorem 1 mainly shows how to factor it through Z. In the first part, we will show that if PC(U |Z) are Dirac measures, we have
