Multi-scale and multi-patch deep models have been shown effective in removing blurs of dynamic scenes. However, these methods still suffer from one major obstacle: manually designing a lightweight and high-efficiency network is challenging and time-consuming. To tackle this obstacle, we propose a novel deblurring method, dubbed PyNAS (pyramid neural architecture search network), towards automatically designing hyper-parameters including the scales, patches, and standard cell operators. The proposed PyNAS adopts gradient-based search strategies and innovatively searches the hierarchy patch and scale scheme not limited to cell searching. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical search strategy tailored to the multi-scale and multi-patch deblurring task. The strategy follows the principle that the first distinguishes between the top-level (pyramid-scales and pyramid-patches) and bottom-level variables (cell operators) and then searches multi-scale variables using the top-to-bottom principle. During the search stage, PyNAS employs an early stopping strategy to avoid the collapse and computational issues. Furthermore, we use a path-level binarization mechanism for multi-scale cell searching to save the memory consumption. Our primary contribution is a real-time deblurring algorithm (around 58 fps) for 720p images while achieves state-of-the-art deblurring performance on the GoPro and Video Deblurring datasets.
