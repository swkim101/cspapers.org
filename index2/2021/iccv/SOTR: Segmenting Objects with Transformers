Most recent transformer-based models show impressive performance on vision tasks, even better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for high-quality instance segmentation. The proposed method, Segmenting Objects with TRansformers (SOTR), simplifies the segmentation pipeline, building on an alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed twin transformer is time- and resource-efficient since only a row and a column attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS COCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches. We hope our simple but strong framework could serve as a preferment baseline for instance-level recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/easton-cau/SOTR.
