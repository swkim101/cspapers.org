While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks, they are fragile to carefully de-signed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover, to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
