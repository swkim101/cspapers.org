With the development of deep convolutional neural networks, image matting has ushered in a new phase. Regarding the nature of image matting, most researches have focused on solutions for transition regions. However, we argue that many existing approaches are excessively focused on transition-dominant local fields and ignored the inherent coordination between global information and transition optimisation. In this paper, we propose the Tripartite Information Mining and Integration Network (TIMI-Net) to harmonize the coordination between global and local attributes formally. Specifically, we resort to a novel 3-branch encoder to accomplish comprehensive mining of the input information, which can supplement the neglected coordination between global and local fields. In order to achieve effective and complete interaction between such multi-branches information, we develop the Tripartite Information Integration (T I2) Module to transform and integrate the interconnections between the different branches. In addition, we built a large-scale human matting dataset (Human-2K) to advance human image matting, which consists of 2100 high-precision human images (2000 images for training and 100 images for test). Finally, we con-duct extensive experiments to prove the performance of our proposed TIMI-Net, which demonstrates that our method performs favourably against the SOTA approaches on the alphamatting.com (Rank First), Composition-1K (MSE- 0.006, Grad-11.5), Distinctions-646 and our Human-2K. Also, we have developed an online evaluation website to perform natural image matting.
