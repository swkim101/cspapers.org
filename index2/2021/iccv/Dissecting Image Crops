The elementary operation of cropping underpins nearly every computer vision system, ranging from data augmentation and translation invariance to computational photography and representation learning. This paper investigates the subtle traces introduced by this operation. For example, despite refinements to camera optics, lenses will leave behind certain clues, notably chromatic aberration and vignetting. Photographers also leave behind other clues relating to image aesthetics and scene composition. We study how to detect these traces, and investigate the impact that cropping has on the image distribution. While our aim is to dissect the fundamental impact of spatial crops, there are also a number of practical implications to our work, such as revealing faulty photojournalism and equipping neural network researchers with a better understanding of shortcut learning.
