Video data is with complex temporal dynamics due to various factors such as camera motion, speed variation, and different activities. To effectively capture this diverse motion pattern, this paper presents a new temporal adaptive module (TAM) to generate video-specific temporal kernels based on its own feature map. TAM proposes a unique two-level adaptive modeling scheme by decoupling the dynamic kernel into a location sensitive importance map and a location invariant aggregation weight. The importance map is learned in a local temporal window to capture short-term information, while the aggregation weight is generated from a global view with a focus on long-term structure. TAM is a modular block and could be integrated into 2D CNNs to yield a powerful video architecture (TANet) with a very small extra computational cost. The extensive experiments on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something datasets demonstrate that our TAM outperforms other temporal modeling methods consistently, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance under the similar complexity.
