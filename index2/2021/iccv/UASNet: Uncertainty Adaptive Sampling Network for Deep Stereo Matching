Recent studies have shown that cascade cost volume can play a vital role in deep stereo matching to achieve high resolution depth map with efficient hardware usage. However, how to construct good cascade volume as well as effective sampling for them are still under in-depth study. Previous cascade-based methods usually perform uniform sampling in a predicted disparity range based on variance, which easily misses the ground truth disparity and decreases disparity map accuracy. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty adaptive sampling network (UASNet) featuring two modules: an uncertainty distribution-guided range prediction (URP) model and an uncertainty-based disparity sampler (UDS) module. The URP explores the more discriminative uncertainty distribution to handle the complex matching ambiguities and to improve disparity range prediction. The UDS adaptively adjusts sampling interval to localize disparity with improved accuracy. With the proposed modules, our UASNet learns to construct cascade cost volume and predict full-resolution disparity map directly. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves the highest ground truth covering ratio compared with other cascade cost volume based stereo matching methods. Our method also achieves top performance on both SceneFlow dataset and KITTI benchmark.
