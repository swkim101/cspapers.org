Finding shape correspondences can be formulated as an ${\mathcal{N}}{\mathcal{P}} - hard$ quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that becomes infeasible for shapes with high sampling density. A promising research direction is to tackle such quadratic optimization problems over binary variables with quantum annealing, which allows for some problems a more efficient search in the solution space. Unfortunately, enforcing the linear equality constraints in QAPs via a penalty significantly limits the success probability of such methods on currently available quantum hardware. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Q-Match, i.e., a new iterative quantum method for QAPs inspired by the Î±-expansion algorithm, which allows solving problems of an order of magnitude larger than current quantum methods. It implicitly enforces the QAP constraints by updating the current estimates in a cyclic fashion. Further, Q-Match can be applied iteratively, on a subset of well-chosen correspondences, al-lowing us to scale to real-world problems. Using the latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave Advantage, we evaluate the proposed method on a subset of QAPLIB as well as on isometric shape matching problems from the FAUST dataset.
