The wide-angle lens gains increasing attention since it can capture a wide field-of-view (FoV) scene. However, the obtained image is contaminated with radial distortion, making the scene not realistic. Previous distortion rectification methods rectify the image in a rectangle or invagination, failing to display the complete content and regular shape simultaneously. In this paper, we rethink the representation of rectification results and present a Rectification OutPainting (ROP) method, aiming to extrapolate the coherent semantics to the blank area and create a wider FoV beyond the original wide-angle lens. To address the specific challenges such as the variable painting region and curve boundary, a rectification module is designed to rectify the image with geometry supervision, and the extrapolated results are generated using a dual conditional expansion strategy. In terms of the spatially discounted correlation, a curve-aware correlation measurement is proposed to focus on the generated region to enforce the local consistency. To our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the challenging rectification via outpainting, and our curve-aware strategy can reach a rectification construction with complete content and regular shape. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the superiority of our ROP over other state-of-the-art solutions.
