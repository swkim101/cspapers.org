Pose-guided virtual try-on task aims to modify the fashion item based on pose transfer task. These two tasks that belong to person image synthesis have strong correlations and similarities. However, existing methods treat them as two individual tasks and do not explore correlations between them. Moreover, these two tasks are challenging due to large misalignment and occlusions, thus most of these methods are prone to generate unclear human body structure and blurry fine-grained textures. In this paper, we devise a structure-transformed texture-enhanced network to generate high-quality person images and construct the relationships between two tasks. It consists of two modules: structure-transformed renderer and texture-enhanced stylizer. The structure-transformed renderer is introduced to transform the source person structure to the target one, while the texture-enhanced stylizer is served to enhance detailed textures and controllably inject the fashion style founded on the structural transformation. With the two modules, our model can generate photorealistic person images in diverse poses and even with various fashion styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two tasks.
