Conventional deep image inpainting methods are based on auto-encoder architecture, in which the spatial details of images will be lost in the down-sampling process, leading to the degradation of generated results. Also, the structure information in deep layers and texture information in shallow layers of the auto-encoder architecture can not be well integrated. Differing from the conventional image inpainting architecture, we design a parallel multi-resolution inpainting network with multi-resolution partial convolution, in which low-resolution branches focus on the global structure while high-resolution branches focus on the local texture details. All these high- and low-resolution streams are in parallel and fused repeatedly with multi-resolution masked representation fusion so that the reconstructed images are semantically robust and textually plausible. Experimental results show that our method can effectively fuse structure and texture information, producing more realistic results than state-of-the-art methods.
