Robust face reconstruction from monocular image in general lighting conditions is challenging. Methods combining deep neural network encoders with differentiable rendering have opened up the path for very fast monocular reconstruction of geometry, lighting and reflectance. They can also be trained in self-supervised manner for increased robustness and better generalization. However, their differentiable rasterization-based image formation models, as well as underlying scene parameterization, limit them to Lambertian face reflectance and to poor shape details. More recently, ray tracing was introduced for monocular face reconstruction within a classic optimization-based framework and enables state-of-the art results. However, optimization-based approaches are inherently slow and lack robustness. In this paper, we build our work on the afore-mentioned approaches and propose a new method that greatly improves reconstruction quality and robustness in general scenes. We achieve this by combining a CNN encoder with a differentiable ray tracer, which enables us to base the reconstruction on much more advanced personalized diffuse and specular albedos, a more sophisticated illumination model and a plausible representation of self-shadows. This enables to take a big leap forward in reconstruction quality of shape, appearance and lighting even in scenes with difficult illumination. With consistent face attributes reconstruction, our method leads to practical applications such as relighting and self-shadows removal. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results show improved accuracy and validity of the approach.
