This paper proposes a novel location-aware deep-learning-based single image reflection removal method. Our network has a reflection detection module to regress a probabilistic reflection confidence map, taking multi-scale Laplacian features as inputs. This probabilistic map tells if a region is reflection-dominated or transmission-dominated, and it is used as a cue for the network to control the feature flow when predicting the reflection and transmission layers. We design our network as a recurrent network to progressively refine reflection removal results at each iteration. The novelty is that we leverage Laplacian kernel parameters to emphasize the boundaries of strong reflections. It is beneficial to strong reflection detection and substantially improves the quality of reflection removal results. Extensive experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.
