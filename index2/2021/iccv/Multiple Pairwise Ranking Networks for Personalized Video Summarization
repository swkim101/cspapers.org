In this paper, we investigate video summarization in the supervised setting. Since video summarization is subjective to the preference of the end-user, the design of a unique model is limited. In this work, we propose a model that provides personalized video summaries by conditioning the summarization process with predefined categorical user labels referred to as preferences. The underlying method is based on multiple pairwise rankers (called Multi-ranker), where the rankers are trained jointly to provide local summaries as well as a global summarization of a given video. In order to demonstrate the relevance and applications of our method in contrast with a classical global summarizer, we conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, notably through a user study and comparisons with the state-of-art methods in the global video summarization task.
