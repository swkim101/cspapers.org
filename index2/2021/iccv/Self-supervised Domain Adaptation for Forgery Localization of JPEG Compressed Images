With wide applications of image editing tools, forged images (splicing, copy-move, removal and etc.) have been becoming great public concerns. Although existing image forgery localization methods could achieve fairly good results on several public datasets, most of them perform poorly when the forged images are JPEG compressed as they are usually done in social networks. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a self-supervised domain adaptation network, which is composed of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approximation network (ComNet), is proposed for JPEG-resistant image forgery localization. To improve the performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is customized to approximate the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with general JPEG compression characteristics. The backbone network is then trained with domain adaptation strategy to localize the tampering boundary and region, and alleviate the domain shift between uncompressed and JPEG-agent images. Extensive experimental results on several public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms or rivals to other state-of-the-art methods in image forgery localization, especially for JPEG compression with unknown QFs.
