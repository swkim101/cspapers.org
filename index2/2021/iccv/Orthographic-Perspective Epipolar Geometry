In this paper we consider the epipolar geometry between orthographic and perspective cameras. We generalize many of the classical results for the perspective essential matrix to this setting and derive novel minimal solvers, not only for the calibrated case, but also for partially calibrated and non-central camera setups. While orthographic cameras might seem exotic, they occur naturally in many applications. They can e.g. model 2D maps (such as floor plans), aerial/satellite photography and even approximate narrow field-of-view cameras (e.g. from telephoto lenses). In our experiments we highlight various applications of the developed theory and solvers, including Radar-Camera calibration and aligning Structure-from-Motion models to aerial or satellite images.
