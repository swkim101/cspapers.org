High quality facial image editing is a challenging problem in the movie post-production industry, requiring a high degree of control and identity preservation. Previous works that attempt to tackle this problem may suffer from the entanglement of facial attributes and the loss of the personâ€™s identity. Furthermore, many algorithms are limited to a certain task. To tackle these limitations, we propose to edit facial attributes via the latent space of a StyleGAN generator, by training a dedicated latent transformation network and incorporating explicit disentanglement and identity preservation terms in the loss function. We further introduce a pipeline to generalize our face editing to videos. Our model achieves a disentangled, controllable, and identity-preserving facial attribute editing, even in the challenging case of real (i.e., non-synthetic) images and videos. We conduct extensive experiments on image and video datasets and show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and quantitative evaluation.
