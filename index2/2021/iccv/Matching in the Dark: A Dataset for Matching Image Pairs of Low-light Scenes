This paper considers matching images of low-light scenes, aiming to widen the frontier of SfM and visual SLAM applications. Recent image sensors can record the brightness of scenes with more than eight-bit precision, available in their RAW-format image. We are interested in making full use of such high-precision information to match extremely low-light scene images that conventional methods cannot handle. For extreme low-light scenes, even if some of their brightness information exists in the RAW format imagesâ€™ low bits, the standard raw image processing on cameras fails to utilize them properly. As was recently shown by Chen et al. [14], CNNs can learn to produce images with a natural appearance from such RAW-format images. To consider if and how well we can utilize such information stored in RAW-format images for image matching, we have created a new dataset named MID (matching in the dark). Using it, we experimentally evaluated combinations of eight image-enhancing methods and eleven image matching methods consisting of classical/neural local descriptors and classical/neural initial point-matching methods. The results show the advantage of using the RAW-format images and the strengths and weaknesses of the above component methods. They also imply there is room for further research.
