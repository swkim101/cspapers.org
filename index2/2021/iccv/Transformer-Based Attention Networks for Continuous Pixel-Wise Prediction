While convolutional neural networks have shown a tremendous impact on various computer vision tasks, they generally demonstrate limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependencies due to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. Initially designed for natural language processing tasks, Transformers have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose TransDepth, an architecture that benefits from both convolutional neural networks and transformers. To avoid the network losing its ability to capture locallevel details due to the adoption of transformers, we propose a novel decoder that employs attention mechanisms based on gates. Notably, this is the first paper that applies transformers to pixel-wise prediction problems involving continuous labels (i.e., monocular depth prediction and surface normal estimation). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TransDepth achieves state-of-theart performance on three challenging datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ygjwd12345/TransDepth.
