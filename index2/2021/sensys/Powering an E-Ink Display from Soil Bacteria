This demo showcases the power delivery potential of soil-based microbial fuel cells. We build a prototype energy harvesting setup for a soil microbial fuel cell, measure the amount of power that we can harvest, and use that energy to drive an e-ink display. Microbial fuel cells are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, especially soil moisture. In near-optimal, super moist conditions our cell provides approximately 100 &mgr;W of power at around 500 mV, which is ample power over time to power our system several times a day. In sum, we find that the confluence of ever lower-power electronics and new understanding of microbial fuel cell design means that "soil-powered sensors" are now feasible. There remains, however, significant future work to make these systems reliable and maximally performant. This demo is a working copy of the system presented at LP-IoT'21 [6].
