Edge computing improves latency and scalability in IoT by shifting applications from cloud to edge servers. However, it requires a control plane in the cloud, which hinders reliability and scalability, is impractical for remote deployments, incurs considerable costs, and offers limited privacy controls. We propose reusing existing IoT gateways for compute, providing resource elasticity using heterogeneous edge hardware, and following a user-driven privacy model. We envision edge computing that is cost-effective, scalable, and privacy-aware, without the dependence on cloud. Our results show that gateways can be used to execute a significant subset of edge applications offering better scalability and responsiveness.
