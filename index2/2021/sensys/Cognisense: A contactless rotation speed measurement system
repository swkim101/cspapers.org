Several engineering applications require reliable rotation speed measurement for their correct functioning. The rotation speed measurements can be used to enhance the machines' vibration signal analysis and can also elicit faults undetectable by vibration monitoring alone. The current state of the art sensors for rotation speed measurement are optical, magnetic and mechanical tachometers. These sensors require line-of-sight and direct access to the machine which limits their use-cases. In this demo, we showcase Cognisense, an RF-based hardware-software sensing system that uses Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) waves to accurately measure a machine's rotation speed. Cognisense uses a novel compact patch antenna in a monostatic radar configuration capable of transmitting and receiving OAM waves in the 5GHz license-exempt band. The demo will show Cognisense working on machines with varied numbers of blades, sizes and materials. We will also present how Cognisense operates reliably in non-line-of-sight scenarios where traditional tachometers fail. We demonstrate how Cognisense works well in high-scattering scenarios and is not impacted by the material of rotor blades. Unlike optical tachometers that require one to face the machine head-on, Our demo will also show Cognisense performing reliably in the presence of a tilt angle between the system and the machine which is not possible with optical tachometers.
