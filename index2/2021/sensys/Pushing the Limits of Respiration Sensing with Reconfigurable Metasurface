Human respiration monitoring acts as a crucial role to indicate people's daily health. Compared with traditional respiration monitoring methods, device-free wireless respiration sensing technology is emerging as a promising modality due to the less privacy intrusive and without on-body sensors. However, due to the intrinsic nature of relying on weak reflection signals for sensing, the sensing range is limited. Meanwhile, reliable sensing performance only can be achieved when the environment with little or even no interference. In this work, we propose a WiFi-based respiration system to simultaneously enlarge the sensing range and mitigate the interference. The basic idea is to employ a reconfigurable metasurface to dynamically manipulate electromagnetic waves in the environment to achieve beamforming and beam steering. Our system thus enhances the sensing range and reduces the energy of reflected signals from interferers to ensure reliable performance. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.
