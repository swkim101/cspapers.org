The paper presents a novel vision on the application of blockchain technology to empower the dynamic service provisioning in future 6G mobile networks. We propose a platform for decentralized service level agreement (SLA) negotiation between users and mobile network operators (MNOs) based on smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. In addition, the new quality of experience (QoE) model is proposed for end-users to customize their trade-off between SLA and service price. Finally, we develop the method of dynamic service selection among multiple MNOs that provides border-less connectivity for end-users with the guaranteed QoE regardless of the serving MNO.
