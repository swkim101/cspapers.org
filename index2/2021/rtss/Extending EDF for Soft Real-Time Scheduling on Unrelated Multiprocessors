Though recent work has established the soft real-time (SRT)-optimality of Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) variants on multiprocessor models with limited heterogeneity (e.g., uniform speeds or affinity masks), such models are insufficient to describe modern multiprocessors, which have grown increasingly heterogeneous. This fact highlights the need to extend theoretical results to more asymmetric models, such as the unrelated multiprocessor model. This paper presents an EDF variant tailored for this model and proves that it is at least nearly SRT-optimal. Simulation results for random task systems are also presented that suggest that the proposed EDF variant may actually be SRT-optimal.
