Large cloud service providers have built an increasing number of geo-distributed data centers (DCs) connected by WAN to host their diverse services. While we have seen a large body of work on traffic engineering of WAN, the WAN traffic characteristics of production DC networks remain not well understood. In this paper, we report on the network traffic observed in Baidu's DC network (DCN) that consists of tens of geo-distributed DCs. Baidu hosts both traditional services like Web and Computing, as well as emerging services, such as Analytics, AI, and Map. We analyze WAN traffic characteristics in Baidu's DCN from the perspectives of traffic demands, traffic communication among DCs, and traffic characteristics of diverse services. Specifically, we focus on the disparity that might exist among different types of services. We also discuss the implications of our findings for WAN traffic engineering, fabric design, and service deployment.
