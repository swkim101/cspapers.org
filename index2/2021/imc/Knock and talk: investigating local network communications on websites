Modern webpages are amalgamations of resources requested from various public Internet services. In principle though, webpages can also request resources from localhost and devices in the LAN, providing a degree of internal network access to external entities. Prior work has demonstrated how this access can be used for supporting web attacks, particularly for profiling and fingerprinting users. In this paper, we empirically investigate if and how popular websites are interacting with their visitors' localhost and LAN resources, and compare the behavior observed to that from known malicious websites. We crawl and monitor the network requests made by the landing pages of domains in the Tranco top 100K domains as well as ~145K websites that are known to be related to malware, phishing, or abuse. For both popular and malicious sites, we detect over 100 sites in each category making requests to internal network destinations, including several highly-ranked sites (within the top 10K). Investigating these sites in-depth, we identify that over 40% of the ones from the top 100K list do so to conduct host profiling, purportedly for fraud and bot detection. We also uncover cases of legitimate native application communication and likely developer errors. For malicious sites, we do not detect cases of internal network attacks. Rather, we believe that the malicious sites generating local network traffic are compromised or cloned phishing websites and that the traffic results from the corresponding benign sites. We observe significantly more local activity when on the Windows OS, compared to Linux or Mac OS X, as well as extensive use of WebSockets, which are not bound by the Same-Origin Policy. Ultimately, our exploration provides empirical grounding on the localhost and LAN network activities of websites, revealing both intentional and unintentional behavior.
