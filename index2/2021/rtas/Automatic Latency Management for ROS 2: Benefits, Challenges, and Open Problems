Robotic systems are typically subject to real-time constraints. Still, the ROS ecosystem—the most popular repository of open-source robotics software—exhibits little evidence of the use of real-time theory to bound or control worst-case response times. Hurdles to adoption are the amount of expertise required to correctly use real-time scheduling mechanisms and the inherent unpredictability of typical robotics workloads, which defy static provisioning. To overcome these hurdles, ROS-Llama, an automatic latency manager for ROS2, is proposed. Crucially, use of ROS-Llama requires only little effort and knowledge of realtime concepts. Relevant properties of ROS2 and essential requirements of the robotics domain are identified, and the conceptual and practical challenges in developing such a mostly automatic tool are discussed. Experiments on a mobile robot demonstrate the viability of the approach and show that ROS-Llama reduces the maximum observed latency under load compared to the default Linux scheduler. Finally, open problems in the underlying real-time analysis and major platform limitations in Linux and ROS2 that prevent further improvements are identified.
