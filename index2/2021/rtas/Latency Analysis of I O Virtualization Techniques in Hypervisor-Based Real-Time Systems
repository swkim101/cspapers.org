Nowadays, hypervisors are the standard solution to integrate different domains into a shared hardware platform, while providing safety, security, and predictability. To this end, a hypervisor virtualizes the physical platform and orchestrates the access to each component. When the system needs to comply with certification requirements for safety-critical systems, virtualization latencies need to be analytically bounded for providing off-line guarantees. This paper presents a detailed modeling of three I/O virtualization techniques, providing analytical bounds for each of them under different metrics. Experimental results compare the bounds for a case study and quantify the contribution due to different sources of delay.
