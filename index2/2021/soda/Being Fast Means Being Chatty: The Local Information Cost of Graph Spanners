We introduce a new measure for quantifying the amount of information that the nodes in a network need to learn to jointly solve a graph problem. We show that the local information cost ($\textsf{LIC}$) presents a natural lower bound on the communication complexity of distributed algorithms. For the synchronous CONGEST-KT1 model, where each node has initial knowledge of its neighbors' IDs, we prove that $\Omega(\textsf{LIC}_\gamma(P)/ \log\tau \log n)$ bits are required for solving a graph problem $P$ with a $\tau$-round algorithm that errs with probability at most $\gamma$. Our result is the first lower bound that yields a general trade-off between communication and time for graph problems in the CONGEST-KT1 model. 
We demonstrate how to apply the local information cost by deriving a lower bound on the communication complexity of computing a $(2t-1)$-spanner that consists of at most $O(n^{1+1/t + \epsilon})$ edges, where $\epsilon = \Theta(1/t^2)$. Our main result is that any $O(\textsf{poly}(n))$-time algorithm must send at least $\tilde\Omega((1/t^2) n^{1+1/2t})$ bits in the CONGEST model under the KT1 assumption. Previously, only a trivial lower bound of $\tilde \Omega(n)$ bits was known for this problem. 
A consequence of our lower bound is that achieving both time- and communication-optimality is impossible when designing a distributed spanner algorithm. In light of the work of King, Kutten, and Thorup (PODC 2015), this shows that computing a minimum spanning tree can be done significantly faster than finding a spanner when considering algorithms with $\tilde O(n)$ communication complexity. Our result also implies time complexity lower bounds for constructing a spanner in the node-congested clique of Augustine et al. (2019) and in the push-pull gossip model with limited bandwidth.
