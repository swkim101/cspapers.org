Knowledge graph (KG) is the backbone to enable cognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI), which relies on cognitive computing and semantic reasoning. Knowledge graph is the connected data with the semantically enriched context. It is the necessary step for the next move of AI. Our daily activities have closely intermingled with various applications powered by knowledge graphs. It has even entered our healthcare system to facilitate clinical decision making and improve hospital efficiency. This workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners to promote research and applications related to knowledge graph.
