CTR prediction, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click an item, plays a crucial role in online advertising and recommender system. Feature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are the two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored for many years and have made great progress for CTR prediction. However, (1) feature interaction based methods which rely heavily on the co-occurrence of different features, may suffer from the feature sparsity problem (i.e., many features appear few times); (2) user interest mining based methods which need rich user behaviors to obtain user's diverse interests, are easy to encounter the behavior sparsity problem (i.e., many users have very short behavior sequences). To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named Dual Graph enhanced Embedding, which is compatible with various CTR prediction models to alleviate these two problems. We further propose a Dual Graph enhanced Embedding Neural Network(DG-ENN) for CTR prediction. Dual Graph enhanced Embedding exploits the strengths of graph representation with two carefully designed learning strategies (divide-and-conquer, curriculum-learning-inspired organized learning) to refine the embedding. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world industrial datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DG-ENN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CTR prediction models. Moreover, when applying to state-of-the-art CTR prediction models, Dual graph enhanced embedding always obtains better performance. Further case studies prove that our proposed dual graph enhanced embedding could alleviate the feature sparsity and behavior sparsity problems. Our framework will be open-source based on MindSpore in the near future.
