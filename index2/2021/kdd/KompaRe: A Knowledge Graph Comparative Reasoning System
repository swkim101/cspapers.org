Reasoning is a fundamental capability for harnessing valuable insight, knowledge and patterns from knowledge graphs. Existing work has primarily been focusing on point-wise reasoning, including search, link prediction, entity prediction, subgraph matching and so on. This paper introduces comparative reasoning over knowledge graphs, which aims to infer the commonality and inconsistency with respect to multiple pieces of clues. We envision that the comparative reasoning will complement and expand the existing point-wise reasoning over knowledge graphs. In detail, we develop KompaRe, the first of its kind prototype system that provides comparative reasoning capability over large knowledge graphs. We present both the system architecture and its core algorithms, including knowledge segment extraction, pairwise reasoning and collective reasoning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed KompaRe.
