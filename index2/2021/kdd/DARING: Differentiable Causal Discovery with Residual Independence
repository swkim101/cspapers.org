Discovering causal structure among a set of variables is a crucial task in various scientific and industrial scenarios. Given finite i.i.d. samples from a joint distribution, causal discovery is a challenging combinatorial problem in nature. The recent development in functional causal models, especially the NOTEARS provides a differentiable optimization framework for causal discovery. They formulate the structure learning problem as a task of maximum likelihood estimation over observational data (i.e., variable reconstruction) with specified structural constraints such as acyclicity and sparsity. Despite its success in terms of scalability, we find that optimizing the objectives of these differentiable methods is not always consistent with the correctness of learned causal graph especially when the variables carry heterogeneous noises (i.e., different noise types and noise variances) in real data from wild environments. In this paper, we provide the justification that their proneness to erroneous structures is mainly caused by the over-reconstruction problem, i.e., the noises of variables are absorbed into the variable reconstruction process, leading to the dependency among variable reconstruction residuals, and thus raise structure identifiability problems according to FCM theories. To remedy this, we propose a novel differentiable method DARING by imposing explicit residual independence constraint in an adversarial way. Extensive experimental results on both simulation and real data show that our proposed method is insensitive to the heterogeneity of external noise, and thus can significantly improve the causal discovery performances.
