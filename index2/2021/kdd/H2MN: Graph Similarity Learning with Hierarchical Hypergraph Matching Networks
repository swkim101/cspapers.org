Graph similarity learning, which measures the similarities between a pair of graph-structured objects, lies at the core of various machine learning tasks such as graph classification, similarity search, etc. In this paper, we devise a novel graph neural network based framework to address this challenging problem, motivated by its great success in graph representation learning. As the vast majority of existing graph neural network models mainly concentrate on learning effective node or graph level representations of a single graph, little effort has been made to jointly reason over a pair of graph-structured inputs for graph similarity learning. To this end, we propose Hierarchical Hypergraph Matching Networks (H2sup>MN) to calculate the similarities between graph pairs with arbitrary structure. Specifically, our proposed H2MN learns graph representation from the perspective of hypergraph, and takes each hyperedge as a subgraph to perform subgraph matching, which could capture the rich substructure similarities across the graph. To enable hierarchical graph representation and fast similarity computation, we further propose a hyperedge pooling operator to transform each graph into a coarse graph of reduced size. Then, a multi-perspective cross-graph matching layer is employed on the coarsened graph pairs to extract the inter-graph similarity. Comprehensive experiments on five public datasets empirically demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform state-of-the-art baselines with different gains for graph-graph classification and regression tasks.
