Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art collaborative filtering (CF) solution. A fundamental challenge of CF is to distill negative signals from the implicit feedback, but negative sampling in GNN-based CF has been largely unexplored. In this work, we propose to study negative sampling by leveraging both the user-item graph structure and GNNs' aggregation process. We present the MixGCF method---a general negative sampling plugin that can be directly used to train GNN-based recommender systems. In MixGCF, rather than sampling raw negatives from data, we design the hop mixing technique to synthesize hard negatives. Specifically, the idea of hop mixing is to generate the synthetic negative by aggregating embeddings from different layers of raw negatives' neighborhoods. The layer and neighborhood selection process are optimized by a theoretically-backed hard selection strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by using MixGCF, state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation models can be consistently and significantly improved, e.g., 26% for NGCF and 22% for LightGCN in terms of NDCG@20.
