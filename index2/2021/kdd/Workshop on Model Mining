How to mine the knowledge in the pretrained models is of significance in achieving more promising performance, since practitioners have access to many pretrained models easily. This Workshop on Model Mining aims to investigate more diverse and advanced manners in mining knowledge within models, which tends to leverage the pretrained models more wisely, elegantly and systematically. There are many topics related to this workshop, such as distilling a lightweight model from a well-trained heavy model via teacher-student paradigm, and boosting the performance of the model by carefully designing the predecessor tasks, e.g., pre-training, self-supervised and contrastive learning. Model mining as a special way of data mining is relevant to SIGKDD, and its audience including researchers and engineers will benefit a lot for designing more advanced algorithms for their tasks.
