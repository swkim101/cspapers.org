Temperature sensing plays a significant role in upholding quality assurance and meeting regulatory compliance in a wide variety of applications, such as fire safety and cold chain monitoring. However, existing temperature measurement devices are bulky, cost-prohibitive, or battery-powered, making item-level sensing and intelligence costly. In this paper, we present a novel tag-based thermometer called Thermotag, which uses a common passive RFID tag to sense the temperature with competitive advantages of being low-cost, battery-free, and robust to environmental conditions. The basic idea of Thermotag is that the resistance of a semiconductor diode in a tag's chip is temperature-sensitive. By measuring the discharging period through the reverse-polarized diode, we can estimate the temperature indirectly. We propose a standards-compliant measurement scheme of the discharging period by using a tag's volatile memory and build a mapping model between the discharging period and temperature for accurate and reliable temperature sensing. We implement Thermotag using a commercial off-the-shelf RFID system, with no need for any firmware or hardware modifications. Extensive experiments show that the temperature measurement has a large span ranging from 0 °C to 85 °C and a mean error of 2.7 °C.
