In the paper, we demonstrate an application of the wireless earbud - an acoustic ruler. Approaches are proposed to improve the robustness of the design in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment. We also share our solution to several engineering challenges, which aims at facilitating the transformation of earbuds to into acoustic sensing research platforms without any hardware modification.
