This paper proposes a drive-through recharging strategy for a quadrotor. First, a ground charging station is constructed with a portable charging wire, then with two conductive hooks connected to the battery, the quadrotor is flying through the station. Finally, after connecting the hooks to the charging wire, the quadrotor can be recharged without landing or stopping, similar to a drive-through. During the charging, the quadrotor is still able to accomplish local monitoring assignments. The main challenge of this work is to ensure that the hooks successfully connect to the charging wire. Though visual-based techniques appear promising to handle this problem, the detection of a thin charging wire is challenging especially during the flight. Besides, the conductive hooks underneath the quadrotor are out of the camera view, which brings more challenges to the problem. Therefore, in this paper, the aiming problem is directed into the position constraint control problem of the quadrotor. Specifically, a virtual aiming box is considered near the charging wire center, then a control design is proposed to constrain the position of the quadrotor to ensure the hooks position always within the virtual aiming box. Moreover, to enhance the system robustness against the outdoor environment, a wind disturbance estimator is proposed in the control design. Both theoretical analysis and experimental validation are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
