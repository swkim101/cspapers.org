Recently, tactile sensing has attracted great interest for robotic manipulation. Predicting if a grasp will be stable or not, i.e. if the grasped object will drop out of the gripper while being lifted, can aid robust robotic grasping. Previous methods paid equal attention to all regions of the tactile data matrix or all time-steps in the tactile sequence, which may include irrelevant or redundant information. In this paper, we propose to equip Convolutional Neural Networks with spatial-channel and temporal attention mechanisms (SCT attention CNN) to predict future grasp stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to use attention mechanisms for predicting grasp stability only relying on tactile information. We implement our experiments with 52 daily objects. Moreover, we compare different spatio-temporal models and attention mechanisms as an empirical study. We found a significant accuracy improvement of up to 5% when using SCT attention. We believe that attention mechanisms can also improve the performance of other tactile learning tasks in the future, such as slip detection and hardness perception.
