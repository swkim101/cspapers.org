This paper formulates a methodology to plan and control flat-terrain motions of an underactuated bipedal robot riding a snakeboard, which is a steerable variant of the skateboard. We use tools from non-holonomic motion planning to study snakeboard gaits and develop feedback control strategies that enable bipedal robots to produce the desired gaits while maintaining balance, regulating the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the snakeboard, achieving sharp turns, and avoiding obstacles.
