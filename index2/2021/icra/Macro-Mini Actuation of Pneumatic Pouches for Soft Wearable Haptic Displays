Pneumatic wearable haptic devices can provide distributed pressure feedback to human operators during robot teleoperation and in virtual and augmented reality. However, these devices have an inherent trade-off between the spatial coverage of their pressure output and their resolution and dynamic response. To achieve specified spatial resolution and dynamic response, we propose a macro-mini actuation approach that stacks a number of smaller inflatable pouches atop a larger inflatable pouch. We develop models for the static and dynamic responses of single and stacked pouches and compare these with experimental results, providing guidelines for the design of wearable stacked pneumatic displays. Finally, we demonstrate this pneumatic macro-mini approach by replicating the time series pressure profiles of data collected from a huggable robot embedded with distributed force sensors.
