Accurate position feedback in a wide range is critical for medical microrobotics and robot-assisted examinations, such as colonoscopy, bronchoscopy and capsule endoscopy examination. Among the many modalities of positioning feedback, magnetic tracking is a preferable method due to the unique advantages of free line of sight, free energy storage and untethered connection. However, the field strength of the magnetic source decreases with the third power of the distance, limiting the effectiveness of position feedback at long distances. In order to maintain a consistently high tracking accuracy in a broad area, this paper presents a new dynamic tracking solution by applying a movable sensor array. In this new solution, the tracking accuracy of the magnet is first determined and optimized within a short range. When the target microrobot carrying the magnet exceeds this optimized range, the sensor array is relocated by an external robotic arm to keep the target in the effective tracking range. Moreover, we also propose a multi-point locating algorithm to minimize the varying background noise. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases the range of magnetic tracking and achieves a satisfactory level of tracking accuracy, which demonstrates significant potentials to improve the position feedback of microrobots in medical applications.
