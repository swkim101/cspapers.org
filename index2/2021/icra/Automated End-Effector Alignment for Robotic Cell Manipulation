Cell manipulation is a key technology in many biomedical and clinical applications, in which end-effector alignment is a critical procedure. Presently, end-effector alignment is performed manually and suffers from large misalignment error and inconsistency. Manual alignment often undesirably moves the end-effector (e.g., a glass micropipette) out of the limited field of view under microscopy and risks breaking the fragile end-effector. This paper presents automated end-effector alignment for robotic cell manipulation. A rotational degree of freedom was added to a micromanipulator with translational degrees of freedom. The kinematic model of end-effector’s rotation was established, and the unknown model parameters were calibrated and updated via quadratic optimization. A controller was designed based on the kinematics modeling and parameter optimization to compensate for rotation-induced translation and achieve end-effector alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic alignment technique achieved an accuracy of 0.6±0.3° and a time cost of 18.5 ± 10.2 s, both significantly less than manual alignment. The developed controller cost significantly less time for micropipette alignment than the PID controller. A glass micropipette was used as the end-effector for human sperm immobilization, a critical procedure in clinical cell surgery. The success rate of sperm immobilization was 97% by robotic micropipette alignment, higher than the success rate of 90% by manual alignment due to the higher accuracy of robotic alignment.
