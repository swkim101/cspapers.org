This paper aims at showing the dynamic performance and reliability of the low-cost, open-access quadruped robot Solo-12, which is developed within the framework of Open Dynamic Robot Initiative. It presents the implementation of a state-of-the-art control pipeline, close to the one that was previously implemented on Mini Cheetah, which implements a model predictive controller based on the centroidal dynamics to compute desired contact forces in order to track a reference velocity. Different contributions are proposed to speed up the computation process, notably at the level of the state estimation and the whole body controller. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot closely follow the reference velocity while being highly reactive and able to recover from perturbations.
