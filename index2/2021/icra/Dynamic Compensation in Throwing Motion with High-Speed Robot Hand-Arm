In recent years, research and development have been carried out on manipulators equipped with multi-fingered robot hands as end-effectors to perform delicate and dexterous tasks. In high-speed movement of such multi-fingered hand-arms, the weight of the multi-fingered hands slows down the response of the arms. To solve this problem, we propose a control method in which a high-response hand is used to compensate for the delay in a low-response arm in the task of throwing a ball. In particular, the accuracy of the pitching motion is improved by predicting tracking errors based on the arm dynamics and using nonlinear model predictive control to compensate for arm tracking errors by using the hand motion. Experimental results of ball throwing are shown.
