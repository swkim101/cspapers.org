Malaria is a worldwide scourge, and the broad deployment of an effective vaccine would improve the lives of millions of people. A vaccine based on Plasmodium falciparum (PfSPZ) sporozoites extracted from the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes shows significant promise. However, the large-scale industrial production of PfSPZ-based vaccines will benefit from automation of the key step of extracting sporozoites from mosquito salivary glands that is currently performed by manual microdissection. In this work, we demonstrate a robotic system prototype for extracting salivary glands from mosquitoes to streamline vaccine production and reduce the need for operators. In the proposed system, mosquitoes are decapitated in an automated robotic pick-place-decapitate process, then a squeezer apparatus extracts mosquito salivary glands from the body. Mosquito detection and body part localization are performed by computer vision methods. The software allows system operation in simulation and on the robotic hardware, which facilitates subsystem development and integration. Experiments show encouraging results with success rates of 93% in robotic mosquito manipulation and 87.1% in salivary gland extraction. The system has the potential to improve the efficiency of PfSPZ vaccine production with significant gains in throughput and reduction in training times for a highly deskilled initial manual step. Further, this system is expected to pave the way for a more mature future system.
