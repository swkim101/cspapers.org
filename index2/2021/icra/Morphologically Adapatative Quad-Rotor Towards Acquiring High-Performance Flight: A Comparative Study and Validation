This paper presents our comparative study on how the flight performances of an in-flight morphing quad-rotor are affected by the morph induced inertia variation. A custom-built in-flight morphing quad-rotor was employed in numerical and experimental tests for the study and analysis. In these tests, the quad-rotor is controlled to follow a predefined path and/or to hover in an environment with the constant wind disturbance. Our numerical results indicate that the morphing-size-down quad-rotor exhibits more agile in flight attributed to the compact volume/size, while the big-size one shows more flight stability in a disturbed and windy environment. Compared to regular scaled aerial vehicles whose volume/size changes follow a weight change proportionally, the numerical results reveal that our morphing quad-rotor that changes its volume with identical mass can acquire more merits towards high flight performances. Experimental validations further prove that through adaptatively transform its size in a complex and constrained environment, the in-flight morphing quad-rotor is not only capable of well performing path following tasks when encountering obstacles on the path or nearby the path, but also enhances the flight performance of withstanding external torques by extending its size so as to increase its moment-of-inertia. In summary, our in-flight morphing quad-rotor can acquire higher flight performances by adaptatively morphing when flying in complex environments.
