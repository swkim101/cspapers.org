To date, untethered microrobots have been receiving tremendous attention for playing implacable roles of maneuverable tools in fields such as microfabrication and biomanipulation. Typical actuation of such untethered tiny robots is the magnetic field-based approaches, including gradient and rotational methods. Compared to the gradient type method, the rotational approach requires much less magnetic field strength to generate efficient actuation for magnetic microrobots. To actuate microrobots desirably, a precise periodic magnetic field should be provided. To generate precise periodic magnetic field with enhanced strength, this paper develops a prototype of 3D magnetic servoing system based on integrated solenoids, performance of which are enhanced by employing iron cores and extended number of coils. Each solenoid is equipped with a Hall sensor to provide real-time feedback signal for performing precise magnetic field control. To precisely regulate this setup, a decoupled asynchronous repetitive control (DARC) scheme is established to generate a desirable 3D periodic magnetic field with noise-level tracking error under the situation of missing execution opportunity randomly. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed magnetic servoing system, which is promising for dynamic properties characterization of magnetic microrobots.
