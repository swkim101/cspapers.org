Generating locally optimal UAV-trajectories is challenging due to the non-convex constraints of collision avoidance and actuation limits. We present the first local, optimization-based UAV-trajectory generator that simultane-ously guarantees validity and asymptotic optimality for known environments. Validity: Given a feasible initial guess, our algo-rithm guarantees the satisfaction of all constraints throughout the process of optimization. Asymptotic Optimality: We use an asymptotic exact piecewise approximation of the trajectory with an automatically adjustable resolution of its discretization. The trajectory converges under refinement to the first-order stationary point of the exact non-convex programming problem. Our method has additional practical advantages including joint optimality in terms of trajectory and time-allocation, and robustness to challenging environments as demonstrated in our experiments.
