This paper introduces the normalized unused sensing capacity to measure the amount of information that a sensor is currently gathering relative to its theoretical maximum. This quantity can be computed using entirely local information and works for arbitrary sensor models, unlike previous literature on the subject. This is then used to develop a distributed coverage control strategy for a team of heterogeneous sensors that automatically balances the load based on the current unused capacity of each team member. This algorithm is validated in a multi-target tracking scenario, yielding superior results to standard approaches that do not account for heterogeneity or current usage rates.
