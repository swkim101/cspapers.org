In this work, we report on how a sense of touch can be used to control an underactuated anthropomorphic robot hand, based on an integration that respects the handâ€™s mechanical functionality. Our focus is on integrating the sensorimotor control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, an anthropomorphic soft robot hand designed around the principle of adaptive synergies, with the BRL tactile fingertip (TacTip), a soft biomimetic optical tactile sensor. We consider: (i) closed-loop tactile control to establish a light contact on an unknown held object, based on the structural similarity of the tactile image; and (ii) controlling the estimated pose of a held object, using a convolutional neural network approach developed for other TacTip sensors. Accurate control was found for a range of hard and soft objects (to sub-millimetre accuracy and a few degrees). Overall, this gives a foundation to endow soft robotic hands with human-like touch, with implications for autonomous grasping, manipulation, human-robot interaction and prosthetics.
