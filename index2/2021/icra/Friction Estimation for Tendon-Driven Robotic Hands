In tendon-driven robotic hands, tendons are usually routed along several pulleys. The resulting friction is often substantial, and must therefore be modelled and estimated, for instance for accurate control and contact detection. Common approaches for friction estimation consider special dedicated setups, where the parameters of a static or dynamic friction model at a single contact point are determined. In this paper, we rather combine such individual friction models into an overall friction model for the entire finger. Furthermore, we propose a method for estimating the parameters of this overall model in situ, i.e. from trajectories executed on the assembled hand, avoiding the need for dedicated setups. An important component of the proposed model is a varying bias for treating friction at low velocities, allowing a simpler static friction model to be used. We demonstrate that our approach enables contacts to be detected more accurately on the DLR David hand, without additional sensors.
