This paper describes Resh, a new, statically typed, interpreted programming language and associated runtime for orchestrating multirobot systems. The main features of Resh are: (1) It offloads much of the tedious work of programming such systems away from the programmer and into the language runtime; (2) It is based on a small set of temporal and locational operators; and (3) It is not restricted to specific robot types or tasks. The Resh runtime consists of three engines that collaborate to run a Resh program using the available robots in their current environment. This paper describes both Resh and its runtime and gives examples of its use.
