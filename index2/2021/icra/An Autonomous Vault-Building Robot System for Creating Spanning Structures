Research in autonomous robots for construction has largely focused on ground-based robots whose reach constrains the size of what they can build, or on climbing or aerial robots that build solid or unroofed structures. Autonomous construction of larger, multistory buildings, or bridges spanning unsupported distances, would require robots that build sturdy structures supporting their own weight. In this paper, we present VaultBot, a system of autonomous robots that build a load-bearing spanning vault using identical modular blocks. The custom blocks employ mechanical and other features to facilitate robotic manipulation and locomotion, and can be removed from and replaced in an assembled structure as a way of repairing damage. We characterize the system's performance and failure modes, and demonstrate reliable autonomous assembly for a structure composed of 46 blocks. Blocks can be made collapsible and deployable as a way of reducing mass and volume that must be transported to a construction site. Such a system could be used to help enable construction of protective shelters in challenging environments, such as disaster relief scenarios, arctic settings, or extraterrestrial habitats.
