Mechanical intelligence is the use of mechanical and other physical properties to create robotic systems adaptable to new external situations using simple control schemes. Designs of robot hands have successfully been developed and optimised following this principle to produce self-adaptive and versatile power grasps via implementations based on underactuated fingers, elastic components, and open-loop motor control. However, these characteristics, and mechanical-intelligent strategies in general, have been seldom leveraged for precision grasping. This paper proposes a mechanical-intelligent technique to facilitate not only spiral caging power grasp, but also self-adaptive precision grasp with error tolerance. This approach is exemplified by the rigorous analysis, development, and testing of a novel three-fingered, two-actuator, underactuated robot hand, called the helical hand, which is capable of self-adaptive precision grasping, and of generating spiral helical power grasps of unknown objects by simply setting two actuators at a constant speed.
