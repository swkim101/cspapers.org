Recent studies have shown that enabling drones to change their morphology in flight can significantly increase their versatility in different tasks. In this paper, we investigate the aerodynamic effects caused by the partial overlap between the propellers and the main body of a morphing quadrotor during flight. We experimentally characterize such effects and design a morphology-aware control scheme to compensate them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by deploying the compensation scheme on a quadrotor that can fold its arms around the main body, comparing it against the same controller without the compensation scheme. Experimental results show that our compensation scheme can address the loss of thrust due to the overlap between the main body and the propellers, guaranteeing higher tracking accuracy, without requiring complex and computationally expensive aerodynamical models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work counteracting the aerodynamic effects of a morphing quadrotor during flight and showing the effects of partial overlap between a propeller and the central body of the drone.
