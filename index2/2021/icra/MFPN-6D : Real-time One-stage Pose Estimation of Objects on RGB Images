6D pose estimation of objects is an important part of robot grasping. The latest research trend on 6D pose estimation is to train a deep neural network to directly predict the 2D projection position of the 3D key points from the image, establish the corresponding relationship, and finally use Pespective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm performs pose estimation. The current challenge of pose estimation is that when the object texture-less, occluded and scene clutter, the detection accuracy will be reduced, and most of the existing algorithm models are large and cannot take the real-time requirements. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-directional Feature Pyramid Network, MFPN, which can efficiently integrate and utilize features. We combined the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with MFPN to design a new network for 6D pose estimation, MFPN-6D. At the same time, we propose a new confidence calculation method for object pose estimation, which can fully consider spatial information and plane information. At last, we tested our method on the LINEMOD and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to textureless materials and occlusion, while running more efficiently compared to other methods.
