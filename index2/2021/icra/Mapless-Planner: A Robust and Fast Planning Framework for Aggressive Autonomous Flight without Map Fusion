Maintaining a map online is resource-consuming while a robust navigation system usually needs environment abstraction via a well-fused map. In this paper, we propose a mapless local planner which directly conducts such abstraction on the unfused sensor data. A limited-memory data structure with a reliable proximity query algorithm is proposed for maintaining raw historical information. A sampling-based scheme is designed to extract the free-space skeleton. A smart waypoint selection strategy enables to generate high-quality trajectories within the resultant flight corridors. Our planner differs from other mapless ones in that it can abstract and exploit the environment information more efficiently. The online replan consistency and success rate are both significantly improved against conventional mapless methods.
