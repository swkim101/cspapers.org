Tactile sensing has seen a rapid adoption with the advent of vision-based tactile sensors. Vision-based tactile sensors provide high resolution, compact and inexpensive data to perform precise in-hand manipulation and human-robot interaction. However, the simulation of tactile sensors is still a challenge. In this paper, we built the first fully general optical tactile simulation system for a GelSight sensor using physics based rendering techniques. We propose physically accurate light models and show in-depth analysis of individual components of our simulation pipeline. Our system outperforms previous simulation techniques qualitatively and quantitative on image similarity metrics. Our code and experimental data is open-sourced at $\color{Fuchsia} {\text{project page}}$ project page.
