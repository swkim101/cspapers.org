In the presence of complicated kinematic and dynamic, we present a generalizable robust control technique for the 6-Degree of Freedom (6DoF) Stewart integrated platform with revolving, time-delayed torque control actuators to achieve faster, and reliable efficiency for parallel control manipulators. The suggested optimal solution involves the construction of a time-delay Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) controller integrated with an on-line Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the cost function gain tuner. The controller is formulated to robustly mitigate the nonlinear systemâ€™s real-time tracking error with large time-delay, which is implemented via ADAMS software. The method is validated through simulation experiments to demonstrate that the developed methodology is practical, optimum, and zero-error convergence.
