Low-light image enhancement is a complex and vital task including, recovering color and texture details from low-light images. For automated driving, low-light scenarios will have severe implications for vision-based applications. To address this problem, we propose a real-time unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) with multiple discriminators. It includes a multi-scale discriminator, a texture discriminator, and a color discriminator to evaluate images from different perspectives. Furthermore, considering the uneven illumination distribution of images and the different information contained in the channels, we adopte a feature fusion attention module to combine channel attention with pixel attention to extract image features. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluation and provides visible improvements in SLAM localization effects.
