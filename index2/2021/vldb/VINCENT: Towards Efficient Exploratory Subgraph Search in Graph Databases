Exploratory search is a search paradigm that plays a vital role in databases, data mining, and information retrieval to assist users to get familiar with the underlying databases. It supports iterative query formulation to explore the data space. Despite its growing importance, exploratory search on graph-structured data has not received adequate attention in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel system called Vincent that facilitates an efficient exploratory subgraph search in a graph database containing a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs. By automatically generating the content for panels in GUI and diversified patterns from databases and providing a visual result explorer, Vincent supports data-driven visual query formulation, incremental subgraph processing, and efficient query result summarization.
