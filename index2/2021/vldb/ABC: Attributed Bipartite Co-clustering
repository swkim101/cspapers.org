Finding a set of co-clusters in a bipartite network is a fundamental and important problem. In this paper, we present the Attributed Bipartite Co-clustering (ABC) problem which unifies two main concepts: (i) bipartite modularity optimization, and (ii) attribute cohesiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to find co-clusters while considering the attribute cohesiveness. We prove that ABC is NP-hard and is not in APX, unless P=NP. We propose three algorithms: (1) a top-down algorithm; (2) a bottom-up algorithm; (3) a group matching algorithm. Extensive experimental results on real-world attributed bipartite networks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.
