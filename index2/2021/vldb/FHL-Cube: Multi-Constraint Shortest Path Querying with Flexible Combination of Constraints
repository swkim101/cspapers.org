 Multi-Constraint Shortest Path (
 MCSP
 ) generalizes the classic shortest path from single to multiple criteria such that more personalized needs can be satisfied. However,
 MCSP
 query is essentially a high-dimensional skyline problem and thus time-consuming to answer. Although the current
 Forest Hop Labeling (FHL)
 index can answer
 MCSP
 efficiently, it takes a long time to construct and lacks the flexibility to handle arbitrary criteria combinations. In this paper, we propose a skyline-cube-based
 FHL
 index that can handle the flexible
 MCSP
 efficiently. Firstly, we analyze the relation between low and high-dimensional skyline paths theoretically and use a cube to organize them hierarchically. After that, we propose methods to derive the high-dimensional path from the lower ones, which can adapt to the flexible scenario naturally and reduce the expensive high dimensional path concatenation. Then we introduce efficient methods for both single and multi-hop cube concatenations and propose pruning methods to further alleviate the computation. Finally, we improve the
 FHL
 structure with lower height for faster construction and query. Experiments on real-life road networks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art.
