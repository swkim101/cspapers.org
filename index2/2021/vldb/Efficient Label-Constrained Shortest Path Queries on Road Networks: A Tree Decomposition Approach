 Computing the shortest path between two vertices is a fundamental problem in road networks. Most of the existing works assume that the edges in the road networks have no labels, but in many real applications, the edges have labels and label constraints may be placed on the edges appearing on a valid shortest path. Hence, we study the label-constrained shortest path queries in this paper. In order to process such queries efficiently, we adopt an index-based approach and propose a novel index structure, LSD-Index, based on
 tree decomposition.
 With LSD-Index, we design an efficient query processing algorithm with good performance guarantees. Moreover, we also propose an algorithm to construct LSD-Index and further improve the efficiency of index construction by exploiting the parallel computing techniques. We conduct extensive performance studies using large real road networks including the whole USA road network. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm not only achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup in query processing time but also consumes much less index space. Meanwhile, the indexing time is also competitive, especially that for the parallel index construction algorithm.
