Today's Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) systems, tackle the ever-growing data in combination with a mixture of transactional and analytical workloads. While optimizing for aspects such as data freshness and performance isolation, they build on the traditional data-to-code principle and may trigger massive cold data transfers that impair the overall performance and scalability. Firstly, in this paper we show that Near-Data Processing (NDP) naturally fits in the HTAP design space. Secondly, we propose an NDP database architecture, allowing transactionally consistent in-situ executions of analytical operations in HTAP settings. We evaluate the proposed architecture in state-of-the-art key/value-stores and multi-versioned DBMS. In contrast to traditional setups, our approach yields robust, resource- and cost-efficient performance.
