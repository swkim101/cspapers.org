In recent years, we have seen the success of network representation learning (NRL) methods in diverse domains ranging from computational chemistry to drug discovery and from social network analysis to bioinformatics algorithms. However, each such NRL method is typically prototyped in a programming environment familiar to the developer. Moreover, such methods rarely scale out to large-scale networks or graphs. Such restrictions are problematic to domain scientists or end-users who want to scale a particular NRL method-of-interest on large graphs from their specific domain.
 In this work, we present a novel system, WebMILE to democratize this process. WebMILE can scale an unsupervised network embedding method written in the user's preferred programming language on large graphs. It provides an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the end-user. The user provides the necessary input (embedding method file, graph, required packages information) through a simple GUI, and WebMILE executes the input network embedding method on the given input graph. WebMILE leverages a pioneering multi-level method, MILE (alternatively DistMILE if the user has access to a cluster), that can scale a network embedding method on large graphs. The language agnosticity is achieved through a simple Docker interface. In this demonstration, we will showcase how a domain scientist or end-user can utilize WebMILE to rapidly prototype and learn node embeddings of a large graph in a flexible and efficient manner - ensuring the twin goals of high productivity and high performance.
