Sentiment analysis has received constant research attention due to its usefulness and importance in different applications. However, despite the research advances in this field, most current tools suffer in prediction quality due to the inconsistencies in their results, i.e., intra- and inter-tool inconsistencies. This demonstration proposes a system for the evaluation of sentiment analysis quality namely SA-Q. The system allows the evaluation of inconsistency in sentiment analysis tools, the resolution of the inconsistency using state-of-the-art methods and the recommendation of relevant sentiment analysis tool for any type of data set provided by the attendees. It allows the attendees to compare the tools. Moreover, we demonstrate that SA-Q evaluates the consistency of tools on two levels (intra-tool and inter-tool). Through various scenarios, we showcase the challenges of inconsistency resolution, demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system and the recommendations that can be given to the attendees for their datasets. We demonstrate that SA-Q system has practical utility in many areas of industrial applications for better decision making. This demonstration shows promising research areas for data management, NLP, and machine learning communities by adopting and drawing inspiration from truth inference methods to create more robust tools and improve the tool's scalability.
