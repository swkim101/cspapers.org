 In this paper, we propose the first deterministic algorithms to solve the frequency estimation and frequent item problems in the
 bounded-deletion
 model. We establish the space lower bound for solving the deterministic frequent items problem in the bounded-deletion model, and propose Lazy SpaceSaving
 ±
 and SpaceSaving
 ±
 algorithms with optimal space bound. We develop an efficient implementation of the SpaceSaving
 ±
 algorithm that minimizes the latency of update operations using novel data structures. The experimental evaluations testify that SpaceSaving
 ±
 has accurate frequency estimations and achieves very high recall and precision across different data distributions while using minimal space. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that, if allowed the same space, SpaceSaving± is more accurate than the state-of-the-art protocols with up to
 logU
 - 1/
 logU
 of the items deleted, where
 U
 is the size of the input universe. Moreover, motivated by prior work, we propose Dyadic SpaceSaving
 ±
 , the first deterministic quantile approximation sketch in the bounded-deletion model.
