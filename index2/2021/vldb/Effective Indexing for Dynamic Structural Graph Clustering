 Graph clustering is a fundamental data mining task that clusters vertices into different groups. The structural graph clustering algorithm (
 SCAN
 ) is a widely used graph clustering algorithm that derives not only clustering results, but also special roles of vertices like hubs and outliers. In this paper, we consider structural graph clustering on dynamic graphs under Jaccard similarity. The state-of-the-art index-based solution focuses on static graphs and incurs prohibitive update costs to maintain indices. Lately, an efficient approximate dynamic structural graph clustering algorithm Dyn-StrClu under Jaccard similarity is proposed. However, their solution needs to fix input parameters while parameter settings of SCAN usually need to be fine-tuned to achieve good clustering results.
 
 
 Motivated by these limitations, we present a study on devising effective index structures for SCAN algorithm on dynamic graphs. Similar to the state-of-the-art dynamic scheme, our main idea to reduce the time complexity is still by bringing approximation to clustering results. However, our solution does not need to fix the input parameters. To achieve this, our solution includes two key components. The first is to maintain a bottom-
 k
 sketch for each vertex so that the similarities of affected vertices can be easily updated. The second key is a bucketing strategy that allows us to update clustering results and roles of vertices efficiently. Our theoretical analysis shows that our proposed algorithm achieves
