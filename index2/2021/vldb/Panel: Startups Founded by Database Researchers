This in-person panel, which I will be moderating, will focus on startups founded by worldwide database researchers. The panelists are a set of people with different backgrounds in terms of their geographic locations, research careers, startup experiences, maturity of their past and present startups, etc. This panel is modeled after such a panel that I organized and moderated at the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data in June 2020. This VLDB 2022 panel will be the second time such a panel will be hosted in a research-oriented database conference.
