JSON Schema is a schema language for JSON documents, based on a complex combination of structural operators, Boolean operators (negation included), and recursive variables. The static analysis of JSON Schema documents comprises practically relevant problems, including schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence. These problems can be reduced to witness generation: given a schema, generate an element of the schema --- if it exists --- and report failure otherwise. Schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence have been shown to be decidable. However, no witness generation algorithm has yet been formally described. We contribute a first, direct algorithm for JSON Schema witness generation, and study its effectiveness and efficiency in experiments over several schema collections, including thousands of real-world schemas.
