In 2011, we proposed PathSim to systematically define and compute similarity between nodes in a heterogeneous information network (HIN), where nodes and links are from different types. In the PathSim paper, we for the first time introduced HIN with general network schema and proposed the concept of meta-paths to systematically define new relation types between nodes. In this paper, we summarize the impact of PathSim paper in both academia and industry. We start from the algorithms that are based on meta-path-based feature engineering, then move on to the recent development in heterogeneous network representation learning, including both shallow network embedding and heterogeneous graph neural networks. In the end, we make the connection between knowledge graphs and HINs and discuss the implication of meta-paths in the symbolic reasoning scenario. Finally, we point out several future directions.
