 Database systems use static analysis to determine upfront which data is needed for answering a query and use indexes and other physical design techniques to speed-up access to that data. However, for important classes of queries, e.g., HAVING and top-k queries, it is impossible to determine up-front what data is
 relevant.
 To overcome this limitation, we develop provenance-based data skipping (PBDS), a novel approach that generates provenance sketches to concisely encode what data is relevant for a query. Once a provenance sketch has been captured it is used to speed up subsequent queries. PBDS can exploit physical design artifacts such as indexes and zone maps.
