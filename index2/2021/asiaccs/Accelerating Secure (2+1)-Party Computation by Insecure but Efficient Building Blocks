Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a cryptographic tool that enables a set of parties to compute a function jointly while keeping each input secret. Since MPC based on secret sharing (SS) achieves high throughput and works fast, many applications have been developed. However, SS-based MPC requires many communication rounds in general, and this becomes a performance bottleneck in real-world applications under high-latency networks. In this paper, we propose SS-based secure three-party computation with almost no preprocessing based on our new (small-)constant-round fundamental gates, by revisiting a framework in a few previous works where a number of parties are assisted by another party who may partially learn secret information. Instead of ordinary logical gates, our fundamental gate is an efficient Equality, for which the result leaks to the third party, and we develop novel two-round constructions of secure building-block protocols (LessThan Comparison, RightShift, Table LookUp, etc.) from the insecure Equality. To show the practicality of our protocols, we implement a secure exact edit distance protocol for two genome strings. Our experiments show that in some network setting our protocol is about 2 times faster (14 times faster taking preprocessing into consideration) than the state-of-the-art SS-based protocol (Ohata and Nuida, FC 2020).
