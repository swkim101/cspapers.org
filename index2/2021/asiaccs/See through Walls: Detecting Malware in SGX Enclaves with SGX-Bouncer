Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) offers strong confidentiality and integrity protection to software programs running in untrusted operating systems. Unfortunately, SGX may be abused by attackers to shield suspicious payloads and conceal misbehaviors in SGX enclaves, which cannot be easily detected by existing defense solutions. There is no comprehensive study conducted to characterize malicious enclaves. In this paper, we present the first systematic study that scrutinizes all possible interaction interfaces between enclaves and the outside (i.e., cache-memory hierarchy, host virtual memory, and enclave-mode transitions), and identifies seven attack vectors. Moreover, we propose SGX-Bouncer, a detection framework that can detect these attacks by leveraging multifarious side-channel observations and SGX-specific features. We conduct empirical evaluations with existing malicious SGX applications, which suggests SGX-Bouncer can effectively detect various abnormal behaviors from malicious enclaves.
