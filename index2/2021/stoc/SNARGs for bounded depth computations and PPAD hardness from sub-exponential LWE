We construct a succinct non-interactive publicly-verifiable delegation scheme for any log-space uniform circuit under the sub-exponential Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. For a circuit C:{0,1}N→{0,1} of size S and depth D, the prover runs in time poly(S), the communication complexity is D · polylog(S), and the verifier runs in time (D+N) ·polylog(S). To obtain this result, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive: a lossy correlation-intractable hash function family. We use this primitive to soundly instantiate the Fiat-Shamir transform for a large class of interactive proofs, including the interactive sum-check protocol and the GKR protocol, assuming the sub-exponential hardness of LWE. Additionally, by relying on the result of Choudhuri et al. (STOC 2019), we establish (sub-exponential) average-case hardness of PPAD, assuming the sub-exponential hardness of LWE.
