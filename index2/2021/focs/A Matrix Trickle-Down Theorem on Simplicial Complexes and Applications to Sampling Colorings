We show that the natural Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generates a random proper edge-coloring of a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ whenever the number of colors is at least $q\geq(\frac{10}{3}+\epsilon)\Delta$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is arbitrary and the maximum degree satisfies $\Delta\geq C$ for a constant $C=C(\epsilon)$ depending only on $\epsilon$, For edge-colorings, this improves upon prior work [Vig99; Che+19] which show rapid mixing when $q\geq(\frac{11}{3}-\epsilon_{0})\Delta$, where $\epsilon_{0}\approx 10^{-5}$ is a small fixed constant. At the heart of our proof, we establish a matrix trickle-down theorem, generalizing Oppenheim's influential result, as a new technique to prove that a high dimensional simplicial complex is a local spectral expander.
