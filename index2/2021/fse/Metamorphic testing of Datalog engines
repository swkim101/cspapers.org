Datalog is a popular query language with applications in several domains. Like any complex piece of software, Datalog engines may contain bugs. The most critical ones manifest as incorrect results when evaluating queriesâ€”we refer to these as query bugs. Given the wide applicability of the language, query bugs may have detrimental consequences, for instance, by compromising the soundness of a program analysis that is implemented and formalized in Datalog. In this paper, we present the first metamorphic-testing approach for detecting query bugs in Datalog engines. We ran our tool on three mature engines and found 13 previously unknown query bugs, some of which are deep and revealed critical semantic issues.
