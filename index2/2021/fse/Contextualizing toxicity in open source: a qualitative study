In this paper, we study toxic online interactions in issue discussions of open-source communities. Our goal is to qualitatively understand how toxicity impacts an open-source community like GitHub. We are driven by users complaining about toxicity, which leads to burnout and disengagement from the site. We collect a substantial sample of toxic interactions and qualitatively analyze their characteristics to ground future discussions and intervention design.
