Current static source code analyzers can be slow, hard to use correctly, and expensive. If not properly configured, they can also generate large amounts of output, even for well-written code. To fix this, we developed a new tool called Cobra. The Cobra tool can be used interactively even on very large code bases, which means that it is very fast. It is also designed to be easy to use and free. The tool comes with a library of predefined queries to catch standard coding issues, including cyber-security related risks from the CVE database. The query libraries can be used as provided, but the best part is that you can also easily modify and extend those queries, or add your own. The Cobra tool is language neutral: you can use it to check C or C++ code, or Java, Ada, Python, or even English prose. I'll show how the tool works, what makes it fast, and how you can write powerful queries in a couple of different ways.
