The mobile app marketplace has fierce competition for mobile app developers, who need to develop and update their apps as soon as possible to gain first mover advantage. Third-party libraries (TPLs) offer developers an easier way to enhance their apps with new features. However, how to find suitable candidates among the high number and fast-changing TPLs is a challenging problem. TPL recommendation is a promising solution, but unfortunately existing approaches suffer from low accuracy in recommendation results. To tackle this challenge, we propose GRec, a graph neural network (GNN) based approach, for recommending potentially useful TPLs for app development. GRec models mobile apps, TPLs, and their interactions into an app-library graph. It then distills app-library interaction information from the app-library graph to make more accurate TPL recommendations. To evaluate GRecâ€™s performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments based on a large-scale real-world Android app dataset containing 31,432 Android apps, 752 distinct TPLs, and 537,011 app-library usage records. Our experimental results illustrate that GRec can significantly increase the prediction accuracy and diversify the prediction results compared with state-of-the-art methods. A user study performed with app developers also confirms GRec's usefulness for real-world mobile app development.
