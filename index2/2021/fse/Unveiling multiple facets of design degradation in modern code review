Software design is a key concern in code review through which developers actively discuss and improve each code change. Nevertheless, code review is predominantly a cooperative task influenced by both technical and social aspects. Consequently, these aspects can play a key role in how software design degrades as well as contributing to accelerating or reversing the degradation during the process of each single code changeâ€™s review. However, there is little understanding about such social and technical aspects relates to either the reduction or the increase of design degradation as the project evolves. Consequently, the scarce knowledge on this topic helps little in properly guiding developers along design-driven code reviews. Our goal in this Doctoral research is three-fold: (1) to characterize the impact of code review and their practices on design degradation over time; (2) to understand the contribution of technical and social aspects to design degradation; and (3) to propose a conceptual framework to support design-decision making during code review. Our preliminary results show that the majority of code reviews had little to no design degradation impact, and that technical and social aspects contribute to distinguishing and predicting design impactful changes.
