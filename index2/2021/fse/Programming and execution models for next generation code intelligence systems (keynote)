McCarthy defined Artificial Intelligence (AI) as “the science and engineering of making intelligent computer programs”. I define Code Intelligence (CI) by specializing his definition to intelligent computer programs that analyze other computer programs (PAPs for short) and use it to structure the keynote in two parts. The first part argues for more research on engineering foundations of PAPs. The second part outlooks new directions of combining rule-based intelligence of current PAPs with learning capabilities. Together, novel engineering foundations and enhanced intelligence characterize what I think will be the next generation of PAPs.
