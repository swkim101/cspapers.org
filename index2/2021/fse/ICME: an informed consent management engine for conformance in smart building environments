Smart buildings can reveal highly sensitive insights about their inhabitants and expose them to new privacy threats and vulnerabilities. Yet, convenience overrides privacy concerns and most people remain ignorant about this issue. We propose a novel Informed Consent Management Engine (ICME) that aims to: (a) increase users’ awareness about privacy issues and data collection practices in their smart building environments, (b) provide fine-grained visibility into privacy conformance and infringement by these devices, (c) recommend and visualise corrective user actions through ”digital nudging”, and (d) support the monitoring and management of personal data disclosure in a shared space. We present a reference architecture for ICME that can be used by software engineers to implement diverse end-user consent management solutions for smart buildings. We also provide a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate how the ICME approach works in a shared smart workplace. Demo: https://youtu.be/5y6CdyWAdgY
