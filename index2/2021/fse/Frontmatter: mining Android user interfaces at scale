We introduce Frontmatter: the largest open-access dataset containing user interface models of about 160,000 Android apps. Frontmatter opens the door for comprehensive mining of mobile user interfaces, jumpstarting empirical research at a large scale, addressing questions such as "How many travel apps require registration?", "Which apps do not follow accessibility guidelines?", "Does the user interface correspond to the description?", and many more. The Frontmatter UI analysis tool and the Frontmatter dataset are available under an open-source license.
