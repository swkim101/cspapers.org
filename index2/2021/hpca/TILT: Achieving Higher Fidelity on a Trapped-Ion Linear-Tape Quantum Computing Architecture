Trapped-ion qubits are a leading technology for practical quantum computing. In this work, we present an architectural analysis of a linear-tape architecture for trapped ions. In order to realize our study, we develop and evaluate mapping and scheduling algorithms for this architecture. In particular, we introduce TILT, a linear “Turing-machinelike” architecture with a multilaser control “head,” where a linear chain of ions moves back and forth under the laser head. We find that TILT can substantially reduce communication as compared with comparable-sized Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures. We also develop two important scheduling heuristics for TILT. The first heuristic reduces the number of swap operations by matching data traveling in opposite directions into an “opposing swap.”, and also avoids the maximum swap distance across the width of the head, as maximum swap distances make scheduling multiple swaps in one head position difficult. The second heuristic minimizes ion chain motion by scheduling the tape to the position with the maximal executable operations for every movement. We provide application performance results from our simulation, which suggest that TILT can outperform QCCD in a range of NISQ applications in terms of success rate (up to 4.35x and 1.95x on average). We also discuss using TILT as a building block to extend existing scalable trapped-ion quantum computing proposals.
