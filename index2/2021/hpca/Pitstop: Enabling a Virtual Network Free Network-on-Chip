Maintaining correctness is of paramount importance in the design of a computer system. Within a multiprocessor interconnection network, correctness is guaranteed by having deadlock-free communication at both the protocol and network levels. Modern network-on-chip (NoC) designs use multiple virtual networks to maintain protocol-level deadlock freedom, at the expense of high power and area overheads. Other techniques involve complex detection and recovery mechanisms, or use misrouting which incurs additional packet latency. Considering that the probability of deadlocks occurring is low, the additional resources needed to avoid/resolve deadlocks should also be low. To this end, we propose Pitstop, a low-cost technique that guarantees correctness by resolving both protocol and network-level deadlocks without the use of virtual networks, complex hardware, or misrouting. Pitstop transfers blocked packets to the network interface (NI) creating a bubble (empty buffer slot) which breaks deadlock. The blocked packet can make forward progress through NI to NI traversals using low complexity bypassing mechanisms. This scheme performs better due to higher utilization of virtual channels and works on arbitrary irregular topologies without any virtual networks. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Pitstop can improve performance up to 11% and reduce power and area up to 41% and 40%.
