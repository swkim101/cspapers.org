As parallel applications become more complex, auto-tuning becomes more desirable, challenging, and time-consuming. We propose, Bliss, a novel solution for auto-tuning parallel applications without requiring apriori information about applications, domain-specific knowledge, or instrumentation. Bliss demonstrates how to leverage a pool of Bayesian Optimization models to find the near-optimal parameter setting 1.64Ã— faster than the state-of-the-art approaches.
