The recently invented retina-inspired spike camera has shown great potential for capturing dynamic scenes. Different from the conventional digital cameras that compact the photoelectric information within the exposure interval into a single snapshot, the spike camera produces a continuous spike stream to record the dynamic light intensity variation process. For spike cameras, image reconstruction remains an important and challenging issue. To this end, this paper develops a spike-to-image neural network (Spk2ImgNet) to reconstruct the dynamic scene from the continuous spike stream. In particular, to handle the challenges brought by both noise and high-speed motion, we propose a hierarchical architecture to exploit the temporal correlation of the spike stream progressively. Firstly, a spatially adaptive light inference subnet is proposed to exploit the local temporal correlation, producing basic light intensity estimates of different moments. Then, a pyramid deformable alignment is utilized to align the intermediate features such that the feature fusion module can exploit the long-term temporal correlation, while avoiding undesired motion blur. In addition, to train the network, we simulate the working mechanism of spike camera to generate a large-scale spike dataset composed of spike streams and corresponding ground truth images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art spike camera reconstruction methods.
