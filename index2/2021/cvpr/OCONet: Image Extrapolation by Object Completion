Image extrapolation extends an input image beyond the originally-captured field of view. Existing methods struggle to extrapolate images with salient objects in the foreground or are limited to very specific objects such as humans, but tend to work well on indoor/outdoor scenes. We introduce OCONet (Object COmpletion Networks) to extrapolate foreground objects, with an object completion network conditioned on its class. OCONet uses an encoder-decoder architecture trained with adversarial loss to predict the objectâ€™s texture as well as its extent, represented as a predicted signed-distance field. An independent step extends the background, and the object is composited on top using the predicted mask. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that we improve on state-of-the-art image extrapolation results for challenging examples.
