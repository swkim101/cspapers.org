3D point cloud classification has many safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robotic grasping. However, several studies showed that it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points.In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud; then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made. Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness guarantees. We also empirically evaluate PointGuard on ModelNet40 and ScanNet benchmark datasets.
