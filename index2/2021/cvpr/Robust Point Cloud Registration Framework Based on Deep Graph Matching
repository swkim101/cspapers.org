3D point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recently, learning-based point cloud registration methods have made great progress. However, these methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matching-based framework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point clouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by singular value decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy, partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
