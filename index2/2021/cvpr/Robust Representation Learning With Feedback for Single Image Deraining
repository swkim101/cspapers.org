A deraining network can be interpreted as a conditional generator that aims at removing rain streaks from image. Most existing image deraining methods ignore model errors caused by uncertainty that reduces embedding quality. Unlike existing image deraining methods that embed low-quality features into the model directly, we replace low-quality features by latent high-quality features. The spirit of closed-loop feedback in the automatic control field is borrowed to obtain latent high-quality features. A new method for error detection and feature compensation is proposed to address model errors. Extensive experiments on bench-mark datasets as well as specific real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.
