In this paper, we propose Cluster-wise Hierarchical Generative Model for deep amortized clustering (CHiGac). It provides an efficient neural clustering architecture by grouping data points in a cluster-wise view rather than point-wise view. CHiGac simultaneously learns what makes a cluster, how to group data points into clusters, and how to adaptively control the number of clusters. The dedicated cluster generative process is able to sufficiently exploit pair-wise or higher-order interactions between data points in both inter- and intra-cluster, which is useful to sufficiently mine the hidden structure among data. To efficiently minimize the generalized lower bound of CHiGac, we design an Ergodic Amortized Inference (EAI) strategy by considering the average behavior over sequence on an inner variational parameter trajectory, which is theoretically proven to reduce the amortization gap. A series of experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results demonstrated that CHiGac can efficiently and accurately cluster datasets in terms of both internal and external evaluation metrics (DBI and ACC).
