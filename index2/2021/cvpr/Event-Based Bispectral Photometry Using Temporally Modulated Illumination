As explained in the manuscript, event cameras record events triggered by changes in brightness. Ideally, if conditions of a change in brightness, such as brightnesses at the beginning and ending of the change, are determined, the number and timing of triggered events are theoretically calculated. However, the unstable factors of event cameras, such as dead time and limited bandwidth, lead to loss and delay in events. This is often modeled as a statistical threshold, which is useful to reasonably synthesize event dataset from a series of conventional video frames [S1]. We also assume a statistical threshold following a normal distribution, i.e., h ∼ N (μh, σ h), and analyze the threshold of each pixel based on the recorded events.
