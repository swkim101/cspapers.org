HPC systems typically rely on the fixed-lifetime (FLT) data retention strategy, which only considers temporal locality of data accesses to parallel file systems. However, our extensive analysis based on the leadership-class HPC system traces suggests that the FLT approach often fails to capture the dynamics in users' behavior and leads to undesired data purge. In this study, we propose an activeness-based data retention (ActiveDR) solution, which advocates considering the data retention approach from a holistic activeness-based perspective. By evaluating the frequency and impact of users' activities, ActiveDR prioritizes the file purge process for inactive users and rewards active users with extended file lifetime on parallel storage. Our extensive evaluations based on the traces of the prior Titan supercomputer show that, when reaching the same purge target, ActiveDR achieves up to 37% file miss reduction as compared to the current FLT retention methodology.
