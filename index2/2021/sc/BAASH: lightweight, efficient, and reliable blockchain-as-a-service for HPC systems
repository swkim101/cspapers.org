Distributed resiliency becomes paramount to alleviate the growing costs of data movement and I/Os while preserving the data accuracy in HPC systems. This paper proposes to adopt blockchain-like decentralized protocols to achieve such distributed resiliency. The key challenge for such an adoption lies in the mismatch between blockchain's targeting systems (e.g., shared-nothing, loosely-coupled, TCP/IP stack) and HPC's unique design on storage subsystems, resource allocation, and programming models. We present BAASH, Blockchain-As-A-Service for HPC, deployable in a plug-n-play fashion. BAASH bridges the HPC-blockchain gap with two key components: (i) Lightweight consensus protocols for the HPC's shared-storage architecture, (ii) A new fault-tolerant mechanism compensating for the MPI to guarantee the distributed resiliency. We have implemented a prototype system and evaluated it with more than two million transactions on a 500-core HPC cluster. Results show that the prototype of the proposed techniques significantly outperforms vanilla blockchain systems and exhibits strong reliability with MPI.
