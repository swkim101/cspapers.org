In this paper, we propose a novel hint-accelerated Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework based on Apache Thrift over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) protocols, called HatRPC. HatRPC proposes a hierarchical hint scheme towards optimizing heterogeneous RPC services and functions. The proposed hint design is composed of service-granularity and function-granularity hints for achieving varied optimization goals and reducing design space for further optimizing the underneath RDMA communication engine. We co-design a key-value store called HatKV with HatRPC and LMDB. The effectiveness and efficiency of HatRPC are validated and evaluated with our proposed Apache Thrift Benchmarks (ATB), YCSB, and TPC-H workloads. Performance evaluations show that the proposed HatRPC approach can deliver up to 55% performance improvement for ATB benchmarks and up to 1.51Ã— speedup for TPC-H queries compared with vanilla Thrift over IPoIB. In addition, the co-designed HatKV can achieve up to 85.5% improvement for YCSB workloads.
