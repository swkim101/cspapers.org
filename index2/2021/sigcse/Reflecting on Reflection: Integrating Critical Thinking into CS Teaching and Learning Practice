Reflection is integral to learning and professional practice. We discuss how deliberate reflection can be integrated into coursework and how instructors can embed it. We will use an online problem solving activity individually and in small groups to provide a context for reflection, and practice guided reflection as problem solvers (emulating students) and as instructors. Discussion leaders will guide reflective discussions and connect to their experiences teaching problem solving courses. Collaborative problem solving and reflection activities can support the participation and success of all students across academic content areas, specifically underrepresented students. This session expects to engage educators interested in reflection to increase students' critical thinking skills. Leaders are CS faculty who taught CAHSI INCLUDES problem solving courses, designed in collaboration with Google, with reflection as an important part of solving problems. We will utilize a problem-solving activity to ground discussions in a shared experience, with time for solitary work, group work, and reflection on the problem and the processes used to solve it. Discussion leaders will guide reflective discussion and connect to their experiences teaching problem solving course content as part of the Google/CAHSI partnership. Groups will regather at the end to report and reflect about the experience of the BoF.
