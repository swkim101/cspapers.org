Augmented Reality (AR) learning has successfully been proven to support new learning pedagogies. The pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or "Learning by Doing" using AR combined with virtual touchless hand interaction and machine learning agents has not been explored in great detail. Fundamentally this exploration of touchless technologies and learning intelligence has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world which created a need for more interactive and personalized learning solutions. This research presented the implementation of touchless hand interaction and machine learning agents in an AR learning application for teaching the PC assembly in the resource constraint environment.
