Microworlds are sandboxed learning environments, often used for a particular educational purpose. We introduce the Big Pixel Microworld, to allow young students to explore and visualize functions that operate on the discrete 'pixels' of the XY coordinate axes. They can change the size of a 'pixel' by 3x (a single 1x1 big 'pixel', or 3x3, 9x9, 27x27 grids etc. all the way down to 729x729, in which one displayed 'pixel' is one screen pixel). There are two modes: zooming and resolution. For some problems, zooming is better, in which the pixels remain fixed to the background function, and what is displayed appears as if the user is zooming in on a camera. We also feature resolution mode, in which we clamp the edges of the screen to the background function, and increasing the number of pixels on the screen appears as if the user is sampling the space higher. There are four distinct activities in this microworld: Paint, Function Exploration, Cellular Automata, and Color Exploration. We have used this microworld at our outreach events and in our Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) Middle School course, and have had very positive responses, but are looking for other ideas. What other spaces should we explore with this tool? What other microworlds should we build? What have others built? The goal of this lightning talk is to engage the SIGCSE community with this preliminary work and share best practices and ideas for possible future work.
