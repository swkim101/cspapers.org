This workshop provides instructors with a hands-on introduction to CS Materials (https://cs-materials.herokuapp.com/), a software infrastructure for designing and aligning a course to national curriculum guidelines, as well as to other courses in the curriculum. The workshop will detail the underlying principles behind CS Materials, namely, that classifying class materials against national curriculum guidelines enables better design and alignment of CS Courses, and permit accurate searches for materials that meet specific learning outcomes and/or topics. The CS Materials workshop will provide a hands-on experience to instructors to use the system to classify their own course content against the ACM IEEE CS 2013 guidelines and contribute to a shared public resource for CS educators. Workshop attendees will learn to input learning materials, perform topic coverage analysis, check alignment within their own course, as well as other courses in their curriculum, and search for new materials for use in their classes. Attendees should come with a laptop and have readied some class materials from a class they teach and want to share and/or analyze. The project provides stipends for instructor to enter, classify, and share one of their courses on CS Materials.
