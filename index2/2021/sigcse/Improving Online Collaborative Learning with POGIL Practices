Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) provides structures for successful collaborative student learning that are readily adapted for synchronous online classes. This work presents examples of how experienced POGIL instructors transitioned to online classes, and describes best practices from POGIL that are easy for CS instructors to adapt to facilitate effective collaborative learning in online classes. Successful online collaborative learning requires more structure than in-person collaborative learning, and POGIL roles and activities can provide that structure.
