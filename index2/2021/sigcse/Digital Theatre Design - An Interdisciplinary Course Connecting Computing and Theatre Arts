The success of performing arts productions has typically relied to varying degrees on technology and its associated innovations. Imaginative set construction and creative lighting design provide the necessary environment to transport viewing audiences effectively in both time and place. This new course entitled 'Digital Theatre Design' is an interdisciplinary effort to awaken students in Theatre Arts and Computer Science to the exceptional learning experience of collaborating across traditional boundaries that exist between the Arts and Engineering. While pursuing their degrees, undergraduate students majoring in STEM fields typically have limited exposure to the extensive variety of career paths available to them. Students taking this course benefit greatly from the opportunity to consider potential careers that effectively integrate both humanities and technology and to raise awareness about the breadth of the possible applications of computing in modern society. Offered in Spring 2020, this course encourages students to investigate the interplay of artistry and technology as they work together to ultimately design and present scenes from selected plays, which represents the capstone project for the course. Students are given an introduction to the 'tools' of the trade in a studio setting as they advance through a series of exercises, as well as independent and team projects focusing on both artistic design and software engineering. This poster presentation will display in detail the classroom strategies, course activities, and future plans for this innovative course offering.
