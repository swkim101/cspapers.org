Introductory computer science courses, such as Computer Systems, could be used to provide the first exposure to computer security to students. However, prior work has shown that, in the US's top R1 universities, computer systems courses are not taught with security in mind. It was also shown that students and instructors use unsafe functions in their code, leading to security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focused on the textbooks used for computer systems courses. We analyzed the discussion of security topics and the use of unsafe functions in the thirteen textbooks used in the top 30 R1 universities in the US for teaching computer systems. We show that many textbooks do not discuss security at all, while some limit their discussion to "undefined behavior'', ignoring that opportunity to discuss potential security issues associated with the undefined behavior. Furthermore, textbooks that talk about security continue using unsafe functions throughout (though not necessarily in vulnerable ways but also without any warning or explanation). We also show that many textbooks do not warn about unsafe functions they use or teach how to use them safely.
