Three districts representing unique contexts and challenges from across the United States have been iteratively designing and implementing inclusive computing pathways for K-12 students. In this paper, we identify barriers to inclusivity within each districts? K-12 computing pathway. Through a research practice partnership (RPP), we seek to develop a shared understanding of inclusiveness and apply that understanding to the development of targeted supports in the design and implementation of K-12 computing pathways. We analyze existing structures and systems for gaps in order to create new opportunities and resources for students, teachers, schools and districts.
