Computing students with disabilities face a variety of difficulties in computing education and careers including inaccessible technology, difficulty arranging accommodations, attitudinal barriers, and a lack of mentors. This panel of computing students and recent graduates with disabilities will describe their experiences both in and out of the classroom. The goal is to provide the audience with an opportunity to hear first-hand how their educational needs were met as non-traditional computing students. In addition to the panelists' short presentations, the moderator will facilitate a dialog between the members of the audience and the panelists.
