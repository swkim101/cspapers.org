A key challenge in designing a database course is how to introduce students to the great variety of data models, query languages, databases, and data processing systems available now. To address this challenge, we propose SQL2X, a novel SQL-centric learning model that teaches students SQL, NoSQL, and MapReduce via translation. For example, translating SQL queries into MapReduce programs to gain insights on how aggregation and join are performed in parallel in MapReduce, and translating SQL queries into REST requests to Firebase to help understand the differences between the query capability of SQL and NoSQL databases. We have applied the model to a graduate database course in our applied data science program. The evaluation and feedback from the students with diverse background indicate the effectiveness of the model in developing students' modeling, querying, and analytical skills over diverse data systems.
