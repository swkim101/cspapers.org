This poster presents preliminary findings from a study of four elementary-level teachers participating in a collaborative PD accompanying a CS instructional unit of seven lessons. The unit introduces students to CS concepts through an expansive framing approach utilizing board games. Through analysis of discourse, the PD and expansive framing approach appeared to support productive teacher talk that enhanced teachers' learning and enactment of the unit.
