Broadening participation in computing is a key priority for both the tech industry and academia. However, high rates of attrition from Ph.D. programs represent a tremendous loss of talent, potential, and resources that stifles efforts to diversify computing. The purpose of this study was to understand the extent to which students consider departure and to uncover prominent threats to student persistence. Findings reveal that students primarily consider departure due to a lack of support and inclusion in their department.
