This study describes the development of a word list for CS1 and the creation of a Computer Terminology Test. The CS1 word list contains 123 most frequent words compiled from CS1 textbooks and lecture notes. This list is beneficial for students, teachers, and curriculum designers to use it in studying, teaching, and setting learning goals especially for non-native English speakers. The Computer Terminology Test was built based on words perceived to be most important from the CS1 word list. This test is designed to help in identifying students who may need extra support in English computer terminology to improve their performance in introductory programming classes.
