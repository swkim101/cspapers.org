Challenge Based Learning (CBL) is a student-centered learning ap- proach that aims to prepare them to learn by asking relevant ques- tions and proposing solutions to real-world challenges. However, in the context of CBL in general, learning management is a diffi- culty faced by undergraduate students, and it is rarely addressed. In order to support learning management, this work proposes an agile learning management method based on Scrum to support students in a CBL learning cycle. In conjunction with the proposed method, a case study was carried out involving students from several under- graduate courses. The use of the method showed significant results in learning, in the administration of learning objectives (LOs)[1], and in the acceptance of its use by the participants.
