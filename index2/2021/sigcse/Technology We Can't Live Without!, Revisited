This panel is an outgrowth of a Technology that Educators of Computing Hail (TECH) Birds of a Feather session held at SIGCSE for seven years, which has grown into popular panels for four years, and served as a springboard for a regular column in ACM Inroads. It will provide a chance for seasoned high school and university educators to show the technologies that they can't live without, what problems they solve, and how to use them.
