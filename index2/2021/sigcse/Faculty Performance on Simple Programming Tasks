We generally accept that some students will struggle on simple tasks at the end of an introductory programming course. We investigate the disturbing possibility that many CS faculty in India also struggle on such tasks. Based on initial data from a pan-India unproctored online programming test, we find that the 193 self-identified faculty participants performed poorly on this test. Our preliminary findings are consistent with recent national policies that acknowledge the lack of requisite expertise and depth among many faculty in India.
