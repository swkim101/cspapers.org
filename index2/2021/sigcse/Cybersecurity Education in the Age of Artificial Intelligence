The 2019 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan highlighted the mutual needs and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. AI techniques are expected to enhance cybersecurity by assisting human system managers with automated monitoring, analysis, and responses to cybersecurity attacks. Conversely, it is essential to guard AI technologies from unintended uses and hostile exploitation by leveraging cybersecurity practices. Research results at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity can help us to be better equipped with tools and techniques to tackle the growing cybersecurity challenges, while also presenting an opportunity to devise fundamentally new ways to motivate and educate students about cybersecurity in the age of AI. Likewise, a June 2019 technical workshop on 'Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Opportunities and Challenges' noted how the interplay between AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity will continue to introduce new opportunities and challenges in the security of AI as well as AI for cybersecurity. Basic research at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and education has the potential to expand existing AI opportunities and resources in cybersecurity education and workforce development. Education efforts are needed to foster workforce knowledge and skills about applying AI expertise to cybersecurity as well as building robust and trustworthy AI. This BOF session will bring together researchers who are interested in these collaborative explorations.
