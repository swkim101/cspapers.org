Computer science (CS) has been a growing and increasingly lucrative field for some time. The demand of job applicants in this field, especially in industry, are high. Yet, the supply of CS candidates to fill these positions are low. One notable reason for this phenomenon is based on the high dropout rate of majors as they matriculate through a CS curriculum. Another reason is their failure to showcase the appropriate skill-sets and related expectations needed as candidates for tech-based job opportunities. When emphasizing the latter reason, it is important to examine the current educational practices that may influence such discrepancies as students matriculate through a CS curriculum. This extended abstract discusses one way to address this discrepancy by exploring the impact of exposing early CS majors to coding interview practices in the form of whiteboard problem solving. A virtual assessment was conducted on 30 CS students enrolled in one of two different intro level computer courses at an institution in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The results of this assessment revealed that students mostly struggled with their ability to conceptualize a given problem in order to apply the appropriate concepts to solve it effectively.
