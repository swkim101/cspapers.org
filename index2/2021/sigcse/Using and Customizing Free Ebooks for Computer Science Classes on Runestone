Runestone Interactive is an open-source ebook platform designed to create and publish free interactive computer science textbooks. (See http://runestoneinteractive.org). Runestone ebooks support programming within the browser, code visualization/stepping, and a variety of practice activities, including multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, clickable-code, and mixed-up code (Parsons problems). Over 20 free textbooks have been created for CS1, CS2, web development, data science, and AP CS (both courses). The presenters have several years of experience creating and using Runestone ebooks. Several studies have demonstrated good usability and positive learning and attitude impacts on students using these ebooks. Over 25,000 people a day use Runestone ebooks. This workshop will introduce computer science teachers (both secondary and post-secondary) to Runestone ebooks. The hands-on session will start by leading participants through use of the ebooks as if they were students. Participants will be introduced to the interactive features of the ebooks. Participants will next create a custom course from an existing ebook and will use the instructor's dashboard to review student activity, modify the course, grade students, and set up a spaced practice tool. Participants will create their own assignments using existing problems. Participants will also be shown how to create new material for assignments, such as multiple-choice questions for a quiz.
