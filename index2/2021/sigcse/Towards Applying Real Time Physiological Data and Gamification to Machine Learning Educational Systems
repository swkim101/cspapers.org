In the data age, everyday devices and applications implement machine learning (ML) to enhance user experiences. However, everyday users usually do not completely understand the technology. Moving forward with ML education will require support for new forms of digital literacies involving machine learning. Physiological computing and gamification techniques can present engaging opportunities for dynamic personally-relevant data collection and manipulation. Our research proposes a system design that applies both real-time physiological data and gamification elements to provide novice users the opportunity to learn about ML concepts.
