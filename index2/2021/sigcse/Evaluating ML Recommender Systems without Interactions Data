Recommendation systems can greatly enhance the user experience in a variety of applications. When developing a recommender system, it is optimal to have a large dataset of user-item interaction data with which to train, test, and evaluate the model. However, many applications that could benefit from a recommender do not have access to a large dataset of user behavior relevant to that application. The research described here concerns the development of a recommender for a web application for which there does not exist a large, appropriate dataset because it is still in the late prototype phase. The first stage of this research focuses on synthesizing artificial data to use in training and testing. The complex structure of user behavior could not be captured with rule-based randomly generated data, but a strategy was discovered for transforming existing, unrelated, datasets to fit the application's needs. This strategy can be broadly applied when developing recommenders for any application, and potentially to solve sparse data problems in other machine learning (ML) domains. With the presence of an adequate dataset, the new recommender can be effectively trained, evaluated, and compared. The second phase of research is ongoing, but preliminary results are promising.
