This paper reports on the first year of teacher PD from an ongoing project designing to integrate computational thinking in middle school mathematics classrooms. The analysis investigates how teachers' prior dispositions toward programming influenced their behaviors in the PD. Two case studies illustrate that teachers' engagement and learning were affected not just by our designs, but also by the knowledge and beliefs teachers brought with them.
