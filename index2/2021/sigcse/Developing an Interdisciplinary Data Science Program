This paper describes a newly developed Data Science major that is jointly offered between two departments (Computer Science and Statistics) and across two colleges (College of Engineering and College of Natural and Architectural Sciences). The paper explores the inspiration and motivation for creating the undergraduate Data Science program, the program curriculum, and the governing body of the program. We aim to recruit undergraduates, specifically women, into the new major which are underrepresented in Computer Science at our University. We expect that this Major in Data Science will serve as a general framework for establishing similar interdisciplinary programs.
