The development of communication and other soft-skills among computer science students is not an easy task. Most curricula focus on technical skills. Team project methodologies are often used as a way to improve students? communication skills. However, the student teams are usually only comprised of computer science students. This paper is an experience report of the didactical methodology used in a project called GGULIVRR@Lodz, which has run annually since 2014. The project is short, intensive and team-based, with an important requirement that each student team is multinational and multidisciplinary. In the project, university lecturers act as mentors who help the student teams organize their work and tracks if a team?s planned didactical results are being achieved. The GGULIVRR@Lodz project stimulates an increase of soft-skills among IT and other students who participate in the project. The detailed description of our process will allow others to recreate the project or build similar events in colleges or even company environments.
