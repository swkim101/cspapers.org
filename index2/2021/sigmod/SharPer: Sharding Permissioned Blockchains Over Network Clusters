Scalability is one of the main roadblocks to business adoption of blockchain systems. Despite recent intensive research on using sharding techniques to enhance the scalability of blockchain systems, existing solutions do not efficiently address cross-shard transactions. In this paper, we introduce SharPer, a scalable permissioned blockchain system. In SharPer, nodes are clustered and each data shard is replicated on the nodes of a cluster. SharPer supports networks consisting of either crash-only or Byzantine nodes. In SharPer, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph and each cluster maintains only a view of the ledger. SharPer incorporates decentralized flattened protocols to establish cross-shard consensus. The decentralized nature of the cross-shard consensus in SharPer enables parallel processing of transactions with nonoverlapping clusters. Furthermore, SharPer provides deterministic safety guarantees. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of SharPer in terms of performance and scalability especially in workloads with a low percentage of cross-shard transactions.
