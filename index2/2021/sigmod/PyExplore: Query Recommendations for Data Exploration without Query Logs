Helping users explore data becomes increasingly more important as databases get larger and more complex. In this demo, we present PyExplore, a data exploration tool aimed at helping end users formulate queries over new datasets. PyExplore takes as input an initial query from the user along with some parameters and provides interesting queries by leveraging data correlations and diversity.
