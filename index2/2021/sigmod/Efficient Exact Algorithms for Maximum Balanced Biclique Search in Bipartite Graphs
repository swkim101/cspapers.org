Given a bipartite graph, the maximum balanced biclique (MBB) problem, discovering a mutually connected while disjoint sets of equal size with the maximum cardinality, plays a significant role for mining the bipartite graph and has numerous applications. Despite the NP-hardness of the MBB problem, in this paper, we show that an exact MBB can be discovered extremely fast in bipartite graphs for real applications. We propose two exact algorithms dedicated for small dense and large sparse bipartite graphs respectively. For dense bipartite graphs, an O*(1.3803n) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm in fact can find an MBB very fast for small dense bipartite graphs that are common for applications such as VLSI design. This is because, using our proposed novel techniques, the search can fast converge to sufficiently dense bipartite graphs which we prove to be polynomial-time solvable. For large sparse bipartite graphs typical for applications such as biological data analysis, an O*(1.3803 δ) algorithm is proposed, where δ is only a few hundred for large sparse bipartite graphs with millions of vertices. The indispensible optimization that leads to this time complexity is: we transform a large sparse bipartite graph into a limited number of dense subgraphs such that each of the dense subgraphs has up to δ vertices and then apply our proposed algorithm for dense bipartite graphs on each of the subgraphs. To further speed up this algorithm, tighter upper bounds, faster heuristics and more effective reductions are proposed, allowing an MBB to be discovered within a few seconds for bipartite graphs with millions of vertices. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real large bipartite graphs to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and techniques.
