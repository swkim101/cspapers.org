Machine learning models may perform differently on different data subgroups, which we represent as itemsets (i.e., conjunctions of simple predicates). The identification of these critical data subgroups plays an important role in many applications, for example model validation and testing, or evaluation of model fairness. Typically, domain expert help is required to identify relevant (or sensitive) subgroups. We propose the notion of divergence over itemsets as a measure of different classification behavior on data subgroups, and the use of frequent pattern mining techniques for their identification. A quantification of the contribution of different attribute values to divergence, based on the mathematical foundations provided by Shapley values, allows us to identify both critical and peculiar behaviors of attributes. Extended experiments show the effectiveness of the approach in identifying critical subgroup behaviors.
