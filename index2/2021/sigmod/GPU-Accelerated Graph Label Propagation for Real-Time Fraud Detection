Fraud detection is a pressing challenge for most financial and commercial platforms. In this paper, we study the processing pipeline of fraud detection in a large e-commerce platform of TaoBao. Graph label propagation (LP) is a core component in this pipeline to detect suspicious clusters from the user-interaction graph.Furthermore, the run-time of the LP component occupies 75% overhead of TaoBao's automated detection pipeline. To enable real-time fraud detection, we propose a GPU-based framework, called GLP, to support large-scale LP workloads in enterprises.We have identified two key challenges when integrating GPU acceleration into TaoBao's data processing pipeline: (1)programmability for evolving fraud detection logics; (2)demand for real-time performance. Motivated by these challenges, we offer a set of expressive APIs that data engineers can customize and deploy efficient LP algorithms on GPUs with ease. We propose novel GPU-centric optimizations by leveraging the community as well as power-law properties of large graphs. Extensive experiments have confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed optimizations. With a single GPU, GLP supports a real billion-scale graph workload from the fraud detection pipeline of TaoBao and achieves 8.2x speedup to the current in-house distributed solution running on high-end multicore machines.
