Streaming graph analysis is gaining importance in various fields due to the natural dynamicity in many real graph applications. However, approximately counting triangles in real-world streaming graphs with edge duplication and expiration remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose SWTC algorithm to address approximate sliding-window triangle counting problem in streaming graphs with edge duplication. In SWTC, we propose a fixed-length slicing strategy that addresses both unbiased sampling and cardinality estimation issues with a bounded memory usage. We theoretically prove the superiority of our method in sample graph size and estimation accuracy under given memory upper bound. Extensive experiments also confirm that our approach has higher accuracy compared with the baseline method under the same memory usage.
