Product Quantization is a method for approximate nearest neighbor search. I review and analyze two recent SIMD-based query acceleration techniques and propose an algorithmic solution agnostic to the underlying hardware. This new method is competitive in terms of runtime to the SIMD-based methods and alleviates their drawbacks: reduced accuracy and limited encoding bit budget configurations.
