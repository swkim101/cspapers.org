Benchmarks have always been one of the greatest assets in evaluating a Data Management System (DBMS) performance and providing a standard way to compare different DBMSs from various angles. As DBMSs evolve over time, new benchmarks are created, and the older ones need to advance and adapt in order to continue to be a valid and capable comparison tool. Many of the standard benchmarks use synthetic data and as such may not be able to capture the complexity of real data and its relationships correctly. The Wisconsin Benchmark was one of the first and main benchmarking tools made four decades ago by Dewitt et al at the University of Wisconsin. One of the most powerful features of this benchmark is that its relations are designed so their structure and distribution of attributes is easy to understand and control. While the Wisconsin Benchmark was a very powerful and widely-used benchmark years ago, it is given less attention in current studies. We believe that the Wisconsin Benchmark and its carefully designed relations can be utilized and provide capabilities that are unique and useful.. In this paper, we present a flexible, easy-to-use and scalable JSON Data Generator implemented in java based on the Wisconsin Benchmark Data Generator description, with more advanced features to provide relations and attributes closer to real-world data. Attribute skewness and variable length records using different size distributions are some of these newly added features. It is a ready-to-use, parameterized, and scalable data generator tool that since its development has been used in several AsterixDB's [4] performance benchmarking and publications [13,14,17,18], and we believe that can be useful to many others.
