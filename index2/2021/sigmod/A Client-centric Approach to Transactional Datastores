Traditional brick-and-mortar services are increasingly moving online and companies rely on ever larger data analytics to optimise their business logic. Similarly, most medical practices favour electronic health records over paper documents: 84% of American hospitals store medical records electronically [19], an 8-fold increase since 2008. In this data-driven world, data is money. It must be collected efficiently, even as it spans multiple heterogeneous, geo-distributed sources. Data must be stored reliably, even in the presence of failures. As the sensitivity of the data being stored increases, so does the need to store it securely in the presence of human attacks. Data must also be accessed consistently, even under high load.
