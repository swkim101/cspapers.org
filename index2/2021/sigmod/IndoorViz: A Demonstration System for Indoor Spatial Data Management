Due to the growing popularity of indoor location-based services, indoor data management has received significant research attention in the past few years. However, we observe that the existing indexing and query processing techniques for the indoor space do not fully exploit the properties of the indoor space. Consequently, they provide below par performance which makes them unsuitable for large indoor venues with high query workloads. In this demonstration, we present IndoorViz, a new indoor spatial data management system that integrates three novel index structures proposed in [4] and [6] with well designed query processing algorithms and 3D visualization functions. The IndoorViz is able to support indoor spatial object indexing, efficient query processing and interactive 3D display.
