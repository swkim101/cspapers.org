We present a novel method for working with the physicist's method of amortized resource analysis, which we call the quantum physicist's method. These principles allow for more precise analyses of resources that are not monotonically consumed, like stack. This method takes its name from its two major features, worldviews and resource tunneling, which behave analogously to quantum superposition and quantum tunneling. We use the quantum physicist's method to extend the Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA) type system, enabling the derivation of resource bounds based on tree depth. In doing so, we also introduce remainder contexts, which aid bookkeeping in linear type systems. We then evaluate this new type system's performance by bounding stack use of functions in the Set module of OCaml's standard library. Compared to state-of-the-art implementations of AARA, our new system derives tighter bounds with only moderate overhead.
