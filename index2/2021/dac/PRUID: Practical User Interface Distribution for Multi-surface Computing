It becomes more and more common for people to have multiple mobile devices. This opens the opportunity of multi-surface computing in which users interact with an app using multiple devices simultaneously. Recently, a system called FLUID was developed, which can distribute User Interface (UI) elements of an app to multiple devices to support multi-surface computing. FLUID enables general, flexible and transparent multi-device interaction, which cannot be achieved by previous approaches such as screen mirroring, app migration, and customized app development on multiple devices. However, the practicality of FLUID is still severely limited because it requires that (1) the app source codes must be available and (2) the same app is pre-installed on all devices. This paper presents PRUID, a UI distribution system that is free from the above-mentioned limitations of FLUID. PRUID captures and extracts relevant information about UI elements to be distributed completely at run time, without requiring the app source code. An app-independent UI agent is designed to dock and render the UI components distributed to the guest device, so pre-installation of the app on guest devices is not required. We developed representative use cases to demonstrate the usage and evaluate the performance of PRUID. The evaluation results show that the extra overhead incurred due to the UI information extraction at run time is marginal and PRUID provides a smooth user experience.
