Parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have emerged as a quantum analogue of deep neural networks and can be trained for discriminative or generative tasks and can be trained with gradient-based optimization on near-term quantum devices [1], [2], [3]. In the current era of quantum computing, known as the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era [4], these devices contain a moderate number of qubits (< 100), and algorithmic performance is strongly impacted by hardware noise. Additionally, the training of PQCs are hybrid algorithms, in which the computational workflow is split between quantum and classical computing platforms.
