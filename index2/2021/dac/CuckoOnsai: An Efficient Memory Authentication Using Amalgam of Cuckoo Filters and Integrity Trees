The off-chip main memory data can be extracted or tampered by an adversary having physical access to a device. In modern secure designs, such tampering or data attacks can be prevented by storing the integrity tree built on top of encryption counters. However, such approaches have significant performance and on-chip storage overheads. This paper proposes CuckoOnsai, which uses the combination of a novel on-chip per core Cuckoo filter and an off-chip small integrity tree. Compared to the recent competing scheme, CuckoOnsai improves performance by 13.1% and reduces the space overheads and $\mathrm{ED}^{2}$ by 50% and 26.1%, respectively.
