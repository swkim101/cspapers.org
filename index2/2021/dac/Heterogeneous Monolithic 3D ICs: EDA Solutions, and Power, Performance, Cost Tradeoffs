In this paper, we present a novel heterogeneous design of Monolithic 3D ICs along with crucial design flow enhancements and better partitioning methods. The heterogeneous M3D ICs are designed with a combination of low-cost, low-power, and low-performance cells on one die and a higher-cost, power, and performance technology variant on the tier, for heterogeneity. These heterogeneous designs out-perform most 2D, 3D variants in Power-Delay Product and Cost metrics. Using 4 different netlists, we see up-to 23% improvement in Performance per Cost, and 16% improvement of Power Delay Product with heterogeneous M3D compared to the best 2D designs.
