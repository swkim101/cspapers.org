High quality standard cell layout automation in advanced technology nodes is still challenging in the industry today because of complex design rules. In this paper we introduce an automatic standard cell layout generator called NVCell that can generate layouts with equal or smaller area for over 90% of single row cells in an industry standard cell library on an advanced technology node. NVCell leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fix design rule violations during routing and to generate efficient placements.
