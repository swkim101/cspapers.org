Regular expressions (regexes) play a key role in a wide range of systems including network intrusion detection. FPGA accelerators can provide power savings over CPUs by exploiting MISD parallelism inherent in regex processing. However, FPGA solutions are brittle, requiring hours to reprogram when rulesets change, while real-world security threats evolve rapidly.We present RXPSC (Regular eXPression Structural Compiler), a compiler designed to compile new regexes to existing regex accelerators. We use input-stream translation to enable fixed FPGA accelerators to accelerate new patterns with minimal overhead and little update delay. Compared to a solution where new regexes run on a CPU, RXPSC reduces CPU load by more than a factor of ten for 84% of unseen regexes in ANMLZoo benchmarks.
