Three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) has demonstrated outstanding classification performance in video recognition compared to two-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN), since 3D-CNN not only learns the spatial features of each frame, but also learns the temporal features across all frames. However, 3D-CNN suffers from intensive computation and data movement. To solve these issues, an energy-efficient low-latency 3D-CNN accelerator is proposed. Temporal locality and small differential value dropout are used to increase the sparsity of activation. Furthermore, to fully utilize the sparsity of weight and activation, a full zero-skipping convolutional microarchitecture is proposed. A hierarchical load-balancing scheme is also introduced to improve resource utilization. With the proposed techniques, a 3D-CNN accelerator is designed in a 55-nm low-power CMOS technology, bringing in up to 9.89Ã— speedup compared to the baseline implementation. Benchmarked with C3D, the proposed accelerator achieves an energy efficiency of 4.66 TOPS/W at 100 MHz and 1.08 V supply voltage.
