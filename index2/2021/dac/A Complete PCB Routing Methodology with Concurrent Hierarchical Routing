Trends in high pin density and an increasing number of routing layers complicate printed circuit board (PCB) routing, which is categorized as escape and area routing. Traditional escape routing research has focused on escape routing but has not considered the quality of area routing among chip components at the same time. In this work, we propose a complete PCB routing methodology, including simultaneous escape routing (SER), post-SER refinement, and gridless area routing. The SER completes the layer assignment of all nets and produces an escape order ensuring suitable escape and area routing on each layer. Length-matching constraints and differential pair routing are satisfied in each stage of the routing flow. The experiment results indicate that the proposed PCB routing method can complete routings for seven commercial PCB designs, whereas the commercial PCB tool cannot complete any of them.
