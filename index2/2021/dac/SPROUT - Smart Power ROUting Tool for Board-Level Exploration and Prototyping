The board-level power network design process is governed by system-level parameters such as the number of layers and the ball grid array (BGA) pattern. These parameters influence the characteristics of the resulting system, such as power, speed, and cost. Evaluating the impact of these parameters is, however, challenging. To estimate the reduction in impedance if, for example, additional BGA balls are dedicated to the power delivery system, adjustments to the board layout and an additional impedance extraction process are required. These processes are poorly automated, requiring significant time and labor. Automating power network exploration and prototyping can greatly enhance the power delivery design process by increasing the number of possible design options. With power network exploration and prototyping, the effects of the system parameters on the electrical characteristics can be better understood, providing valuable insight into the early design stages. SPROUT - an automated algorithm for prototyping printed circuit board (PCB) power networks - is presented here. This tool includes the first fully automated algorithm for board-level power network layout synthesis. Two board-level industrial power networks are synthesized using SPROUT where a ball grid array is connected with a power management IC and decoupling capacitors across four voltage domains. The impedance of the resulting layouts is in good agreement with manual PCB layouts while requiring 95% less design time.
