While traditional chips in bulk silicon technology are widely used for reliable and highly efficient systems, there are applications that call for devices in other technologies. On the one hand, novel device technologies need to be re-evaluated with respect to potential threats and attacks, and how these can be faced with existing and novel security solutions and methods. On the other hand, emerging device technologies bring opportunities for building the secure systems of the future. In this paper, we will give an overview of applications and security primitives developed in three important emerging device technologies, namely memristors, fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) and flexible electronics.
