Dummy filling is widely applied to significantly improve the planarity of topographic patterns for the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process in VLSI manufacturing. This paper proposes a novel model-based dummy filling synthesis framework NeurFill, integrated with multiple starting points-sequential quadratic programming (MSP-SQP) optimization solver. Inside this framework, a full-chip CMP simulator is first migrated to the neural network, achieving $8134 \times$ speedup on gradient calculation by backward propagation. Multi-modal starting points search is further applied in the framework to obtain satisfying filling quality optimums. The experimental results show that the proposed NeurFill outperforms existing rule- and model-based methods.
