This paper presents a charge-sharing based customized 8T SRAM in-memory computing (IMC) architecture. In the proposed IMC approach, the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation of multi-bit activations and weights is supported using the charge sharing between bit-line (BL) parasitic capacitances. The area-efficient customized 8T SRAM macro can achieve robust and voltage-scalable MAC operations due to the charge-domain computation. We also propose a split capacitor structure-based 5/6-bit reconfigurable successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR-ADC) to reduce the hardware cost of an analog readout circuit while supporting higher precision MAC operations. The proposed reconfigurable SAR-ADC has been exploited to implement layer-by-layer mixed bit-precisions in convolution layer for increasing energy efficiency with negligible accuracy loss. The 256Ã—64 8T SRAM IMC macro has been implemented using 28nm CMOS process technology. The proposed SRAM macro achieves 11. 20-TOPS/W with a maximum clock frequency of 125MHz at 1. 0V. It also supports supply voltage scaling from 0.5V to 1.1V with the energy efficiency ranging from 8.3-TOPS/W to 35.4-TOPS/W within 1 % accuracy loss.
