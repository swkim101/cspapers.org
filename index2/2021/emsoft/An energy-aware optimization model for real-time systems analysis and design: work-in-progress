Energy efficiency considerations are required for resource reservations in real-time systems. However, current systems lack considerations of energy efficiency when calculating the optimum processor speed to ensure that the supply of resources is no less than the workload demand during any time intervals. Therefore, we propose an energy-aware optimization model using supply and demand bound functions to reduce over-provisioning resources while still guaranteeing task deadlines. Our initial experiment shows the advantages of using the proposed technique in terms of energy efficiency.
