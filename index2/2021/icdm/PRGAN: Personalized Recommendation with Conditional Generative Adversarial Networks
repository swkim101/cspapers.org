Most of the existing methods define recommendation as regression or classification for user-item interactions and apply discriminative models. However, recommender systems suffer from interaction data sparsity and data noise problems in reality. Recent Generative Adversarial Network-based recommender systems have the potential to solve the aforementioned problems. The negative sampling methods use the generator to collect effective signals from a large amount of unlabeled data to alleviate the data sparsity problem, while they suffer from sparse rewards in the policy gradient training process. The vector reconstruction methods generate user-related vectors for data augmentation to enhance robustness, but they lead to redundant calculation and only take the user as a condition and ignore information conveyed by items. To alleviate the limitations of these methods, we propose a novel framework termed Personalized Recommendation with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (PRGAN) to consider both the user and the item subset as conditions and formulate conditional rating vector generation as a user-item matching problem. The sparsity of conditional rating vectors can be controlled in our method, which simplifies the discriminatorâ€™s learning task. Experiments are conducted on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
