On par with the human classification accuracy, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have fueled the deployment of many video processing systems on cloud-backed mobile platforms (e.g., cell phones and robotics). Nevertheless, these video processing systems often face a tension between intensive energy consumption from CNNs and limited resources on mobile platforms. To address this tension, we propose to accelerate video processing with a widely-available, but not yet well-explored runtime input-level information, namely class skew. Through such runtime-profiled information, it strives to automatically optimize CNNs toward the time-varying video stream. Specifically, we build Palleon, a runtime system that dynamically adapts and selects a CNN model with the least energy consumption based on the automatically detected class skews, while still achieving the desired accuracy. Extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art CNNs and real-world videos demonstrate that Palleon enables efficient video processing with up to 6.7x energy saving and 7.9x latency reduction.
