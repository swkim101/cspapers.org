Emerging applications like distributed coordinated beamforming (DCB), intelligent reflector arrays, and networked robotic devices will transform wireless applications. However, for systems-centric work on these topics, the research community must first overcome the hurdle of implementing fine-grained, over-the-air timing synchronization, which is critical for any coordinated operation. To address this gap, this paper presents an open-source design and implementation of 'RFClock' that provides timing, frequency and phase synchronization for software defined radios (SDRs). It shows how RFClock can be used for a practical, 5-node DCB application without modifying existing physical/link layer protocols. By utilizing a leader-follower architecture, RFClock-leader allows follower clocks to synchronize with mean offset under 0.107Hz, and then corrects the time/phase alignment to be within a 5ns deviation. RFClock is designed to operate in generalized environments: as standalone unit, it generates a 10MHz/1PPS signal reference suitable for most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDRs today; it does not require custom protocol-specific headers or messaging; and it is robust to interference through a frequency-agile operation. Using RFClock for DCB, we verify significant increase in channel gain and low BER in a range of [0 -- 10--3] for different modulation schemes. We also demonstrate performance that is similar to a popular wired solution and significant improvement over a GPS-based solution, while delivering this functionality at a fractional price/power point.
