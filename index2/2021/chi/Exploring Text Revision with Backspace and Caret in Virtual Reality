Current VR systems provide various text input methods that enable users to enter text efficiently with virtual keyboards. However, little attention has been paid to facilitate text revision during the VR text input process. We first summarized existing text revision solutions in current VR text input research and found that backspace is the only tool available for text revision with virtual keyboards with few mentioning designs for caret control. To systematically explore VR text revision designs, we presented a design space for VR text revision based on backspace and caret. With the proposed design space, we further analyzed the feasibility of the combined usage of backspace and caret by proposing and evaluating four VR text revision techniques. Outcomes of this research can provide a fundamental understanding of VR text revision solutions (with backspace and caret) and a comparable basis for evaluating future VR text revision techniques.
