Aerial hoops are circular, hanging devices for both acrobatic exercise and artistic performance that let us explore the role of interactive sonification in physical activity. We present SonicHoop, an augmented aerial hoop that generates auditory feedback via capacitive touch sensing, thus becoming a digital musical instrument that performers can play with their bodies. We compare three sonification strategies through a structured observation study with two professional aerial hoop performers. Results show that SonicHoop fundamentally changes their perception and choreographic processes: instead of translating music into movement, they search for bodily expressions that compose music. Different sound designs affect their movement differently, and auditory feedback, regardless of type of sound, improves movement quality. We discuss opportunities for using SonicHoop as an aerial hoop training tool, as a digital musical instrument, and as a creative object; as well as using interactive sonification in other acrobatic practices to explore full-body vertical interaction.
