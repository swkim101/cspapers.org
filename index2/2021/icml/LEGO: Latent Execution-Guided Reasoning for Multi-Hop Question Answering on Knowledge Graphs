Answering complex natural language questions on knowledge graphs (KGQA) is a challenging task. It requires reasoning with the input natu-ral language questions as well as a massive, incomplete heterogeneous KG. Prior methods obtain an abstract structured query graph/tree from the input question and traverse the KG for answers following the query tree. However, they inherently cannot deal with missing links in the KG. Here we present LEGO, a L atent E xecution-G uided reas O ning framework to handle this challenge in KGQA. LEGO works in an iterative way, which alternates between (1) a Query Synthesizer, which synthesizes a reasoning action and grows the query tree step-by-step, and (2) a Latent Space Executor that executes the reasoning action in the latent embedding space to combat against the missing information in KG. To learn the synthe-sizer without step-wise supervision, we design a generic latent execution guided bottom-up search procedure to ﬁnd good execution traces efﬁciently in the vast query space. Experimental results on several KGQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared with previous state of the art.
