In this section we present results on the concentration of the variance for subgaussian random variables. Traditional results on the concentration of the variances (Maurer & Pontil, 2009; Carpentier et al., 2011) are obtained in the bounded setting. We propose results in a more general framework. Let us begin with some definitions. Definition S1 (Sub-gaussian random variable). A random variable X is said to be κ2-sub-gaussian if ∀λ ≥ 0, exp(λ(X − EX)) ≤ exp(λ2κ2/2) .
