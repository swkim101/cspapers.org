GUI testing is an important but expensive activity. Recently, research on test reuse approaches for Android applications produced interesting results. Test reuse approaches automatically migrate human-designed GUI tests from a source app to a target app that shares similar functionalities. They achieve this by exploiting semantic similarity among textual information of GUI widgets. Semantic matching of GUI events plays a crucial role in these approaches. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on semantic matching of GUI events. Our study involves 253 configurations of the semantic matching, 337 unique queries, and 8,099 distinct GUI events. We report several key findings that indicate how to improve semantic matching of test reuse approaches, propose SemFinder a novel semantic matching algorithm that outperforms existing solutions, and identify several interesting research directions.
