Deep Learning (DL) system has been widely used in many critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, their security is threatened by backdoor attack, which is achieved by adding artificial patterns on specific training data. Existing attack methods normally poison the data using a patch, and they can be easily detected by existing detection methods. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Backdoor, which utilizes the Targeted Universal Adversarial Perturbation (TUAP) to hide the anomalies in DL models and confuse existing powerful detection methods. With extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that Adversarial Backdoor can be injected stably with an attack success rate around 98%. Moreover, Adversarial Backdoor can bypass state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods. More specifically, only around 37% of the poisoned models can be caught, and less than 29% of the poisoned data cannot bypass the detection. In contrast, for the patch backdoor, all the poisoned models and more than 80% of the poisoned data will be detected. This work intends to alarm the researchers and developers of this potential threat and to inspire the designing of effective detection methods.
