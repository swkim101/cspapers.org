Despite an exciting area with many promises for innovations in wearable interactive systems, research on interaction techniques for smart rings lacks structured knowledge and readily-available resources for designers to systematically attain such innovations. In this work, we conduct a systematic literature review of ring-based gesture input, from which we extract key results and a large set of gesture commands for ring, ring-like, and ring-ready devices. We use these findings to deliver GestuRING, our web-based tool to support design of ring-based gesture input. GestuRING features a searchable gesture-to-function dictionary of 579 records with downloadable numerical data files and an associated YouTube video library. These resources are meant to assist the community in attaining further innovations in ring-based gesture input for interactive systems.
