3D position tracking on smartphones has the potential to unlock a variety of novel applications, but has not been made widely available due to limitations in smartphone sensors. In this paper, we propose ReflecTrack, a novel 3D acoustic position tracking method for commodity dual-microphone smartphones. A ubiquitous speaker (e.g., smartwatch or earbud) generates inaudible Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) acoustic signals that are picked up by both smartphone microphones. To enable 3D tracking with two microphones, we introduce a reflective surface that can be easily found in everyday objects near the smartphone. Thus, the microphones can receive sound from the speaker and echoes from the surface for FMCW-based acoustic ranging. To simultaneously estimate the distances from the direct and reflective paths, we propose the echo-aware FMCW technique with a new signal pattern and target detection process. Our user study shows that ReflecTrack achieves a median error of 28.4 mm in the 60cm × 60cm × 60cm space and 22.1 mm in the 30cm × 30cm × 30cm space for 3D positioning. We demonstrate the easy accessibility of ReflecTrack using everyday surfaces and objects with several typical applications of 3D position tracking, including 3D input for smartphones, fine-grained gesture recognition, and motion tracking in smartphone-based VR systems.
