Stance detection (also known as stance classification and stance prediction) is a problem related to social media analysis, natural language processing, and information retrieval, which aims to determine the position of a person from a piece of text they produce, towards a target (a concept, idea, event, etc.) either explicitly specified in the text, or implied only. The output of the stance detection procedure is usually from this set: Favor, Against, None. In this tutorial, we will define the core concepts and research problems related to stance detection, present historical and contemporary approaches to stance detection, provide pointers to related resources (datasets and tools), and we will cover outstanding issues and application areas of stance detection. As solutions to stance detection can contribute to significant tasks including trend analysis, opinion surveys, user reviews, personalization, and predictions for referendums and elections, it will continue to stand as an important research problem, mostly on textual content currently, and particularly on social media. Finally, we believe that image and video content will commonly be the subject of stance detection research soon.
