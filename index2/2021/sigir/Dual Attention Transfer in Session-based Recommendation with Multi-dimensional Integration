Session-based recommendation (SBR) is widely used in e-commerce to predict the anonymous user's next click action according to a short sequence. Many previous studies have shown the potential advantages of applying Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to SBR tasks. However, the existing SBR models using GNN to solve user preference problems are only based on one single dataset to obtain one recommendation model during training. While the single dataset has the problems including the excessive sparse data source and the long-distance relationship of items. Therefore, introducing the dual transfer, which can enrich the data source, to SBR is absolutely necessary. To this end, a new method is proposed in this paper, which is called dual attention transfer based on multi-dimensional integration (DAT-MDI): (i) DAT uses a potential mapping method based on a slot attention mechanism to extract the user's representation information in different sessions between multiple domains. (ii) MDI combines the graph neural network for the graphs (session graph and global graph) and the gate recurrent unit (GRU) for the sequence to learn the item representation in each session. Then the multi-level session representation are combined by a soft-attention mechanism. We do a variety of experiments on four benchmark datasets which have shown that the superiority of the DAT-MDI model over the state-of-the-art methods.
