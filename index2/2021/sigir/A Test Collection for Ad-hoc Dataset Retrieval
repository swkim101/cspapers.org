This paper introduces a new test collection for ad-hoc dataset retrieval, which have been developed through a shared task called Data Search in the fifteenth NTCIR. This test collection consists of dataset collections derived from the US and Japanese governments' open data sites (i.e., Data.gov and e-Stat), as well as English and Japanese topics for these collections. Organizing the shared task in NTCIR, we conducted relevance judgments for datasets retrieved by 74 search systems, and included them in the test collection. In addition to the detailed description of the test collection, we conducted in-depth analysis on the test collection, and revealed (1) what techniques were used and effective, (2) what topics were difficult, and (3) large topic variability in the dataset retrieval task.
