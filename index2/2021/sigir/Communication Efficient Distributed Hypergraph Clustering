Hypergraphs can capture higher-order relations between subsets of objects instead of only pairwise relations as in graphs. Hypergraph clustering is an important task in information retrieval and machine learning. We study the problem of distributed hypergraph clustering in the message passing communication model using small communication cost. We propose an algorithm framework for distributed hypergraph clustering based on spectral hypergraph sparsification. For an n-vertex hypergraph G with hyperedges of maximum size r distributed at s sites arbitrarily and a parameter ε∈ (0,1), our algorithm can produce a vertex set with conductance O(√1+ε/1-ε √φG), where φG is the conductance of G, using communication cost ~O(nr2s/εO(1)) (~O hides a polylogarithmic factor). The theoretical results are complemented with extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different real-world datasets.
