In online marketplaces, an increasing number of producers depend on search and recommendation systems to connect them with consumers to make a living. In this talk, we discuss how these systems will need to evolve from the traditional formulations by incorporating the producer value into their objectives. Jointly optimizing the ranking functions behind these systems on both consumer and producer values is a new direction and raises many technical challenges. To overcome these, we lay out an end-to-end solution and present the results of applying this solution on Facebook Marketplace.
