Counterfactual Learning to Rank (CLTR) becomes an attractive research topic due to its capability of training ranker with click logs. However, CLTR inherently suffers from a large amount of bias caused by confounders, variables that affect both the observation (examination) behavior and click behavior. Recent efforts to correct bias mostly focus on position bias, which assumes that each observation in a ranking list is isolated and only depends on the position. Though effective, users often engage with documents in an interactive manner. Ignoring the interactions between observations/clicks would incur a large interactional observation bias no matter how much data is collected. In this work, we leverage the embedding method to develop an Interactional Observation-Based Model (IOBM) to estimate the observation probability. We argue that while there exist complex observed and unobserved confounders for observation/click interactions, it is sufficient to use the embedding as a proxy confounder to uncover the relevant information for the prediction of the observation propensity. Moreover, the embedding could offer an alternative to the fully specified generative model for observation and decouples the complex interaction structure of observations/clicks. In our IOBM, we first learn the individual observation embedding to capture position and click information. Then, we learn the interactional observation embedding to uncover their local interaction structure. To filter out irrelevant information and reduce contextual bias, we utilize query context information and propose the intra-observation attention and the inter-observation attention, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two LTR benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the proposed IOBM consistently achieves better performance over the baseline models in various click situations and verifying its effectiveness of eliminating interactional observation bias.
