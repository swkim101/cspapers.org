Live streaming is becoming an increasingly popular trend of sales in E-commerce. The core of live-streaming sales is to encourage customers to purchase in an online broadcasting room. To enable customers to better understand a product without jumping out, we propose AliMe MKG, a multi-modal knowledge graph that aims at providing a cognitive profile for products, through which customers are able to seek information about and understand a product. Based on the MKG, we build an online live assistant that highlights product search, product exhibition and question answering, allowing customers to skim over item list, view item details, and ask item-related questions. Our system has been launched online in the Taobao app, and currently serves hundreds of thousands of customers per day.
