Supervised link prediction aims at finding missing links in a network by learning directly from the data suitable criteria for classifying link types into existent or non-existent. Recently, along this line, subgraph-based methods learning a function that maps subgraph patterns to link existence have witnessed great successes. However, these approaches still have drawbacks. First, the construction of the subgraph relies on an arbitrary nodes selection, often ineffective. Second, the inability of such approaches to evaluate adaptively nodes importance reduces flexibility in nodes features aggregation, an important step in subgraph classification. To address these issues, a novel graph-classification based link-prediction model is proposed: Attention and Re-weighting based subgraph Classification for Link prediction (ARCLink). ARCLink first extracts a subgraph around the two nodes whose link should be predicted, by network reweighting, i.e. attributing a weight in the range 0-1 to all links of the original network, and then learns a function to map the subgraph to a continuous vector for classification, thus revealing the nature (non-existence/existence) of the unknown link. For leaning the mapping function, ARCLink generates a vector representation of the extracted subgraph by hierarchically aggregating nodes features according to nodes importance. In contrast to previous studies that either fully ignore or use fixed schemes to compute nodes importance, ARCLink instead learns nodes importance adaptively by employing attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments, ARCLink was validated on a series of real-world networks against state-of-the-art link prediction methods, consistently demonstrating its superior performances
