Hierarchical community detection, which aims at discovering the hierarchical structure of a graph, attracts increasing attention due to its wide range of applications. However, due to the difficulty of parametrizing the community tree, existing methods mainly rely on heuristic algorithms, which are limited by their low accuracy and inability to handle new observations. As far as we know, how to leverage deep learning techniques to better discover hierarchical communities remains almost blank in the existing literature. In this paper, we present the first deep learning framework called ReinCom for hierarchical community detection. To address the challenge of parametrizing the community tree, we propose a novel growing-up process where, at each step, we first partition nodes into the community tree and then adjust the community tree according to the partition results. To learn an optimal growing-up process, we propose an embedding agent and a community agent to implement the two sub-steps respectively. Furthermore, we also propose an online learning strategy for new observations on the graph. Empirical results show that our proposed model has better modeling effectiveness than the state-of-the-art methods. For example, in terms of modularity, the performance of ReinCom is 33% higher than previous community detection works. Besides, with the aid of the learned node embeddings, we also devise a graph visualization algorithm which can consistently reflect the latent hierarchical structure of a graph.
