There is a growing need to find meaningful teams in expert networks such as DBLP and GitHub. However, existing team formation methods, such as those based on shortest paths between experts, may generate weakly-connected teams. We demonstrate RW-Team, a robust team formation framework based on a random walk with restart (RWR). We introduce a greedy algorithm to reduce the search space, and we use a Monte Carlo approximation of RWR to improve performance. To handle large graphs, we implement RW-Team in Apache Spark. The proposed demonstration will allow participants to form teams of researchers having various skill sets and explore connections among team members using several graph visualization techniques.
