The rise of Internet and social media changed not only how we consume information, but it also democratized the process of content creation and dissemination, thus making it easily available to anybody. Despite the hugely positive impact, this situation has the downside that the public was left unprotected against biased, deceptive, and disinformative content, which could now travel online at breaking-news speed and allegedly influence major events such as political elections, or disturb the efforts of governments and health officials to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The research community responded to the issue, proposing a number of inter-connected research directions such as fact-checking, disinformation, misinformation, fake news, propaganda, and media bias detection. Below, we cover the mainstream research, and we also pay attention to less popular, but emerging research directions, such as propaganda detection, check-worthiness estimation, detecting previously fact-checked claims, and multimodality, which are of interest to human fact-checkers and journalists. We further cover relevant topics such as stance detection, source reliability estimation, detection of persuasion techniques in text and memes, and detecting malicious users in social media. Moreover, we discuss large-scale pre-trained language models, and the challenges and opportunities they offer for generating and for defending against neural fake news. Finally, we explore some recent efforts aiming at flattening the curve of the COVID-19 infodemic.
