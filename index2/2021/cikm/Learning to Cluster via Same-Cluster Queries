We study the problem of learning to cluster data points using an oracle which can answer same-cluster queries. Different from previous approaches, we do not assume that the total number of clusters is known at the beginning and do not require that the true clusters are consistent with a predefined objective function such as the K-means. These relaxations are critical from the practical perspective and, meanwhile, make the problem more challenging. We propose two algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees and verify their effectiveness via an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.
