Numeral information plays an important role in narratives of several domains such as medicine, engineering, and finance. Previous works focus on the foundation exploration toward numeracy and show that fine-grained numeracy is a challenging task. In machine reading comprehension, our statistics show that only a few numeral-related questions appear in previous datasets. It indicates that few benchmark datasets are designed for numeracy learning. In this paper, we present a Numeral-related Question Answering Dataset, NQuAD, for fine-grained numeracy, and propose several baselines for future works. We compare NQuAD with three machine reading comprehension datasets and show that NQuAD is more challenging than the numeral-related questions in other datasets.
