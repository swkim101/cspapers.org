Fake news videos are being actively produced and uploaded on YouTube to attract public attention. In this paper,we propose a topic-agnostic fake news video detection model based on adversarial learning and topic modeling. The proposed model estimates the topic distribution of a video using its title/description and comments by topic modeling and tries to identify the differences in stance by the topic distribution difference between title/description and comments. Then, it constructs an adversarial neural network to extract topic-agnostic features effectively. The proposed model can effectively detect topic changes for stance analysis and easily shift among various topics. In this study, it achieves an F1-score 2.68% point greater than previous models in fake news video detection.
