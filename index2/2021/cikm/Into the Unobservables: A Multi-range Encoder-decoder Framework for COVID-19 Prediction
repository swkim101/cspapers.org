The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed people's daily lives. A robust forecasting model for COVID-19 infections is essential for governments and institutions to plan timely and perform accurate interventions. Mainstream solutions for COVID-19 prediction fit reported data only by considering observed cases. However, the neglected facts that positive samples are incomplete and many facts of the novel disease are unknown may be prone to cause severe error accumulation, especially in long-term predictions. To fully understand the spreading patterns of the virus, we propose an encoder-decoder framework: (i) in the encoder we embed historical case data into multiple expose-infection ranges and learn message passing between time slices and across ranges with coarse-grained human mobility data incorporated; (ii) in the decoder, we decode the embedded features based on reported cases as well as deaths to jointly consider the effect of both observed and hidden data. We model the spreading of disease in over 60 counties of California and New York, which are two of the most metropolitan areas in the US. The proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on JHU COVID-19 dataset on both weekly prediction and daily prediction tasks. We design detailed ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each key module and find the model not only works with the assistance of mobility data but also with purely cases and deaths, which implies its broad application scenarios.
