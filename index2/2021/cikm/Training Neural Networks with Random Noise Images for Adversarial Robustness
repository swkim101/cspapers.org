Despite their high accuracy, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Currently, adversarial training is the mainstream defense approach against adversarial examples. However, given the unknown nature of adversarial attacks in real life, this approach has fundamental limitations in practical use, as it is impossible to obtain sufficient adversarial examples for the training. In this paper, we propose RanTrain, a simple training approach which employs a background class with random noise images to augment the original DNN model and training data, without requiring any adversarial examples. Experiments have shown that RanTrain works effectively with different datasets and various DNN structures, and it significantly increases the robustness of DNNs to adversarial examples.
