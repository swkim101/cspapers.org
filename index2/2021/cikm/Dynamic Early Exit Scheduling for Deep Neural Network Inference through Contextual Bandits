Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have dramatically improved the accuracy of DNN inference, but also introduce larger latency. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize early exit, a novel method that allows inference to exit at earlier exit points at the cost of an acceptable amount of accuracy. Scheduling the optimal exit point on a per-instance basis is challenging because the realized performance (i.e., confidence and latency) of each exit point is random and the statistics vary in different scenarios. Moreover, the performance has dependencies among the exit points, further complicating the problem. Therefore, the optimal exit scheduling decision cannot be known in advance but should be learned in an online fashion. To this end, we propose Dynamic Early Exit (DEE), a real-time online learning algorithm based on contextual bandit analysis. DEE observes the performance at each exit point as context and decides whether to exit or keep processing. Unlike standard contextual bandit analyses, the rewards of the decisions in our problem are temporally dependent. Furthermore, the performances of the earlier exit points are inevitably explored more compared to the later ones, which poses an unbalance exploration-exploitation trade-off. DEE addresses the aforementioned challenges, where its regret per inference asymptotically approaches zero. We compare DEE with four benchmark schemes in the real-world experiment. The experiment result shows that DEE can improve the overall performance by up to 98.1% compared to the best benchmark scheme.
