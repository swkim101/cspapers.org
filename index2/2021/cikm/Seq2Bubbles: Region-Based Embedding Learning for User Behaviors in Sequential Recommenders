User behavior sequences contain rich information about user interests and are exploited to predict user's future clicking in sequential recommendation. Existing approaches, especially recently proposed deep learning models, often embed a sequence of clicked items into a single vector, i.e., a point in vector space, which suffer from limited expressiveness for complex distributions of user interests with multi-modality and heterogeneous concentration. In this paper, we propose a new representation model, named as Seq2Bubbles, for sequential user behaviors via embedding an input sequence into a set of bubbles each of which is represented by a center vector and a radius vector in embedding space. The bubble embedding can effectively identify and accommodate multi-modal user interests and diverse concentration levels. Furthermore, we design an efficient scheme to compute distance between a target item and the bubble embedding of a user sequence to achieve next-item recommendation. We also develop a self-supervised contrastive loss based on our bubble embeddings as an effective regularization approach. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our bubble embedding can consistently outperform state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.
