In this paper, we describe our progress on designing a passive fidgeting material for remote work scenarios. We focus on vibrotactile feedback and present the insights of a remote workshop with 6 participants exploring materials with haptic feedback. Our overall goal, is to design a smart tabletop surface for prolonged computer work, reducing stress and improving body awareness.
