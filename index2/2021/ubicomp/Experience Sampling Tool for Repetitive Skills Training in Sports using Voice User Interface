Repetitive skills training (RST) is a commonly used method for improving skills. Although wearable devices and existing context-aware technologies allow us to easily detect objective data during RST, subjective data have not been collected effectively, even though both objective and subjective data are important for RST. In this paper, we propose and implement a prototype system, called MiQ, to collect subjective data with minimum workload during RST for sports. MiQ allows us to record subjective data hands-free via a voice user interface (VUI). We also discuss the future scope of the proposed prototype system.
