Human body produces different physiological stress reaction when you hit a toe to a doorstep than when you panic at a job interview. The impact for bodyâ€™s homeostasis varies depending on the reaction type and some reactions are harmful to our health. Currently, stress estimation is focused on binary identification between stress and non-stress stages. More detailed separation of stress reaction types is needed for detecting harmful stress. In this study, the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm was used to classify a baseline condition and physiological and psychosocial stress, based on psychophysiological signals monitored using a wrist sensor device. Classification was robust in separating the two stress states from baseline and from each other. The results provide support for novel approaches utilizing fine-grained estimation of stress type from wearable sensor data.
