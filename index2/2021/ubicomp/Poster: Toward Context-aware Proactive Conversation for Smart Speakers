Despite the increasing popularity of novel conversational services for smart speakers, the current ones have supported limited proactive interactions. In this work, we focus to understand opportune moments for proactive conversational interactions in domestic contexts. To achieve our goal, we built a speech-based experience sampling device and performed a 1-week field study with 40 students living in university dormitories. From 3,572 in-situ experiences, we identified eleven categories to find contextual features related to opportune moments. We showed that the key determinants for interruptibility are relevant to personal contextual factors, user mobility, and social presence. Through considering the aforementioned factors, we envision that a smart speaker can intelligently manage the timing of conversations.
