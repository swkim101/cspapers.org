Interruptions, such as disruptive smartphone notifications or habitual smartphone use, can cause people to make mistakes and reduce their efficiencies in daily contexts. People can manage smartphone distraction by reconfiguring smartphone settings or using limiting tools to avoid such issues. However, it is difficult to manage smartphone distraction proactively according to the userâ€™s context. To explore the feasibility of context-aware distraction management, we collected and analyzed user contexts and needs relevant to smartphone distraction. Our results show the heterogeneity of distracting contexts and suggest the opportunity for a rule-based system to provide context-aware distraction management.
