It is well known that the underwater acoustic channel (UAC) has the physical characteristic of sparse structure due to the significant multipath effect. To improve the performance of UAC estimation, with the physical knowledge on channel sparsity in mind we propose a novel method called Deep Learning based UAC Estimation (DL-UACE) in this paper. The DL-UACE method combines the conventional iterative sparse recovery algorithm of approximate message passing (AMP) with deep neural network (DNN) to construct a sparsity-aware DNN for the deep learning of the inherent sparse structure of the UAC. Furthermore, the denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN) is integrated into the sparsity-aware DNN as a denoiser to mitigate the impact of ubiquitous ambient noise that obeys Gaussian distribution on UAC estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed DL-UACE method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and spectrum efficiency, especially in severe conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or insufficient pilots.
