We present Sonic Straws, a beverage-based gustosonic system that allows users to experience playful personalized sounds via drinking through straws. The system consists of two straws, a customized lid, and a holder containing a microcontroller. It performs a sensing process via the two straws connected to the microcontroller to sense capacitance, which then generates sounds played back through a speaker. Our aim is to support a playful way of drinking in everyday life because we believe that interactive technology offers unique opportunities to enrich drinking experiences. Ultimately, with our work, we aim to inspire and guide designers working with playful gustosonic interactions to experience eating/drinking as play.
