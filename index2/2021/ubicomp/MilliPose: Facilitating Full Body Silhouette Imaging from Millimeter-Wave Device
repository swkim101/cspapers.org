This paper proposes MilliPose, a system that facilitates full human body silhouette imaging and 3D pose estimation from millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices. Unlike existing vision-based motion capture systems, MilliPose is not privacy-invasive and is capable of working under obstructions, poor visibility, and low light conditions. MilliPose leverages machine-learning models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Recurrent Neural Network to solve the challenges of poor resolution, specularity, and variable reflectivity with existing mmWave imaging systems. Our preliminary results show the efficacy of MilliPose in accurately predicting body joint locations under natural human movement.
