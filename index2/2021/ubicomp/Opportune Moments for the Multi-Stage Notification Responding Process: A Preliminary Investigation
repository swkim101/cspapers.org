Notifications are advantageous to users, but they could cause interruptions when appearing at inopportune moments. Research has suggested that multiple stages are possibly involved in the notification responding process, including the phone generating an alert, the user roughly glancing it, engaging with it, and acting on it. Nevertheless, how users’ perceived opportune moment for each stage correlates with each other remains unclear. Using experience sampling method, we show that users’ perceived opportune moment for each stages differed. This result needs further in-depth investigation into the precisely defined opportune moment for each stages and its underlying key factors.
