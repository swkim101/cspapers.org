News notifications have become an important way for users to access news. But news notifications sent at an inopportune moment may not be processed sufficiently, which is one of the contributing reasons for misinformation dissemination. We built a news app called NewsMoment, and observed five users’ receptivity to its news notifications. We found that these users 60% of the time only spent less than 30 seconds on notified news, regardless of their high interests in them. Furthermore, they mostly regarded themselves as having read the complete content. This suggests investigation of opportune moments for news notification delivery may be needed to improve users’ processing of news.
