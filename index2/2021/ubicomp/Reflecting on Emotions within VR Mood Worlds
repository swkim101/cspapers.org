Virtual reality applications can be an effective tool for emotion regulation and therefore support emotional well-being and mental health. However, many VR applications focus on inducing (positive) emotions and there is little research on how users can express their emotions autonomously at home. Thus, there is a need to inquire how emotions can be expressed independently in virtual environments. To that end, this position paper presents VR Mood Worlds, a VR application for ER intervention, that allows users to visualise their emotions and thus supports emotion regulation and emotional well-being.
