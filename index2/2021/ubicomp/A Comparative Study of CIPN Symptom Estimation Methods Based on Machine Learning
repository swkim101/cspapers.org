Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of anticancer medicines that causes muscular weakness and falls in cancer patients. Therefore, we compared the methods for identifying and estimating the factors that cause symptoms in CIPN based on factor analysis and four different machine learning algorithms. The results of factor analysis showed that the latent factors causing CIPN can be classified into three categories: “Morning body condition”, “Pain in the legs” and “Dizziness”. We chose models for machine learning based on the premise of multi-task learning and built numerous machine learning models to estimate various CIPN symptoms. According to the results of the comparison studies, TabNet has the best generalization performance.
