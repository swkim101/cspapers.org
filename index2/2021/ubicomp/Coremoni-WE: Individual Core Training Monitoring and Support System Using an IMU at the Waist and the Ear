Due to the influence of the new coronavirus, many people are interrupting fitness clubs and exercise/sports performed by multiple people. Under these circumstances, ”core training,” which can be easily performed indoors by individuals, attracts attention as an exercise to improve health. However, it is not easy to recognize whether the posture during the training is correct or not, which may significantly reduce the effect of the exercise. To tackle these issues, we have been developing ”Coremoni-WE,” a core training monitoring and support system that combines wearables and earables to judge posture.
