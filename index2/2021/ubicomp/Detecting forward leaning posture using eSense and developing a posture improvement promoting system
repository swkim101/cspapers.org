In this study, we propose a method using eSense for detecting forward leaning posture during computer work, and verify its effectiveness. We will also develop a system that prompts the user to improve posture when a forward leaning posture is detected, and verify its effectiveness. In the future, we aim to develop a system that targets not only forward leaning posture but also posture improvement in other parts of the body by utilizing the contents verified in this research.
