Virtual Reality has demonstrated its potential in drug psychotherapy. However, there is little research on the design space of VR experience combined with biofeedback in clinical settings for drug addiction that is aligned with treatment goals. We designed a prototype system, called CravingProbe, combining VR and biofeedback technologies to assist drug psychotherapy, and recruited three psychotherapists for a pilot user study to share their feedback from therapeutic perspectives. Results show that participants agreed that the system illustrates most of the typical real-life craving episodes and useful to discuss potential cravings experienced by patients. And, participants expressed willingness to and felt capable of using this system during drug psychotherapy.
