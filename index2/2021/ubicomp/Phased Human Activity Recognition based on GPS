This paper describes an activity recognition method for Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge by team TDU_BSA_BCI. The classification accuracy has been improved by switching the estimation model, depending on whether the location is available. Data, including location were classified by Deep Neural Network including LSTM layer. Data that exclude location were classified by the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. The 2 outputs have been combined. They were optimized by applying a median filter. In the submission phase, the best F-measure obtained for the SHL validation-set was 65%.
