Some of the biggest challenges in applying Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to the industry floor are in the form factor, and safety requirements of the head worn display. This includes alleviating issues such as peripheral view occlusion, and adaptation to personal protective equipment. In this work we present the design of Project Ariel, an Open Source 3D printable display specifically designed for use in industrial environments. It is our hope that with this technology, the average tradesman can utilize the powerful visualizations AR has to offer, significantly improving their daily work flow.
