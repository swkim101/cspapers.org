Considerable literature has explored the topic of haptics, including thermal presentation, in virtual reality (VR). However, the existing thermal presentation methods have limitations such as low responsiveness and need for contacts. As such, this study proposes a high-speed, non-contact thermal presentation method using infrared rays and a shutter mechanism consisting of fins. The results of the preliminary study suggested that the method could present temperature with different intensities according to the angle of the fin. Finally, several applications taking advantage of its features of high-speed and non-contact thermal presentation are proposed.
