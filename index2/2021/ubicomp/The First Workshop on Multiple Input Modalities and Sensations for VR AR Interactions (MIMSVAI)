With the advance of VR/AR technology, more and more VR/AR applications are emerging and have been popular among new users. Users interact with both physical or virtual worlds through multiple input modalities and sensations to create an immersive VR/AR experience. However, a lack of robust and intuitive interaction interfaces and realistic sensations hinders usersâ€™ experience for achieving a fascinating acceptance in various application areas of VR/AR interactions. This workshop discusses the challenges and applications of designing a higher coherence between different input modalities and sensations to offer more engaging VR/AR experiences, which can create opportunities for the researchers from both UbiComp and VR/AR fields to jointly discuss and brainstorm new directories of designing new input modalities and sensations for VR/AR interactions.
