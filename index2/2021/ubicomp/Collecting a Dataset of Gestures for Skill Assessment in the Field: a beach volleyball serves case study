Activity and gesture recognition from wearable sensors data can be used for skill assessment in order to gauge the capability of a user at performing a task. As many other problem of automatic classification, gesture recognition relies on annotated data for the training of the classification system and to gather a set of gestures for the assessment. The collection of a multi-sensors dataset for this goal can be challenging, especially when it is performed in the field rather than in a more controlled environment such as a laboratory. In this paper, we present the collection of a beach volleyball gestures dataset in the field. The resulting dataset is made publicly available to the community and it includes 585 annotated gestures, collected by 10 users, with 4 wearable inertial sensors per user. In addition, we also provide a list of lessons learnt, suggestions and guidelines to improve future data collections in the field.
