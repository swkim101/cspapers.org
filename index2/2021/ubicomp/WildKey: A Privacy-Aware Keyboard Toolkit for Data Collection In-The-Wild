Touch data, and in particular text-entry data, has been predominantly collected in laboratory settings, under controlled conditions. While touch and text-entry data has consistently shown its potential for monitoring and detecting a variety of conditions and impairments, its deployment in-the-wild remains a challenge. In this paper, we present WildKey, an Android keyboard toolkit that allows for the usable deployment of in-the-wild user studies. WildKey is able to analyse text-entry behaviours through implicit and explicit text-entry data collection while ensuring user privacy. We detail each of the WildKeyâ€™s components and features, metrics collected, and discuss the steps taken to ensure user privacy thus promoting compliance.
