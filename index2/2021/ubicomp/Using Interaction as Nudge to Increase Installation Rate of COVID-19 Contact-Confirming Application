For the COVID-19 Contact Confirming Application (COCOA) to be fully effective, it is important that many people install COCOA on their smartphones. However, because the current COCOA implements only a minimum number of functions, it is difficult to motivate people to install it. Therefore, we focus on an extrinsic approach that motivates the installation of COCOA by adding fun functions through interaction with a ubiquitous system on the environment side. In this paper, we introduce an interactive system that nudges users to install COCOA by reframing the act of installing COCOA as getting a ticket to participate in fun experiences.
