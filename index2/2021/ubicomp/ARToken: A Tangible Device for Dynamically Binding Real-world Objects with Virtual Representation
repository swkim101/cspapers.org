Users are eager to interact with and control virtual proxies in the reconstructed virtual world using physical objects with haptic feedback since the development of AR/VR. Therefore, we propose ARToken, a device that virtualizes physical objects through AR tracking, and then links the relative positions of the Token device and virtual representations through its system, generating interactive virtual environments based on physical environments. In addition to tracking position through AR images, when the object exceeds the recognition range of AR Image, the IMU sensor can be used to detect rotation and displacement. ARToken sends this information through WiFi, allowing for real-time feedback of the state of the real object to the corresponding virtual representation. Also, this system allows for simultaneous tracking of multiple devices. To verify our design, we have produced two applications that exhibit how ARToken aids in generating virtual environments based on physical environments and links virtual and physical objects as one.
