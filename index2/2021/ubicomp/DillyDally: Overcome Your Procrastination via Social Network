In modern society with various sorts of entertainment, procrastination becomes a knotty issue in our daily live and such symptom fatally affects our working efficiency. To investigate and solve this issue, we first interview several college students familiar with anti-procrastination applications to learn about the defects of existing approaches. Then, we design a framework that integrates “social network” and “task notification” to suppress procrastination via peers’ excitation. In our framework, we first build a social media environment that allows users to create their own moments. Second, users are able to create their incoming tasks and set up the corresponding partners. Different from existing applications that use games to encourage users, we allow their friends and partners to notify the task owner in various ways such as direct messaging, vibration, and taking photos. In this way, our app “DillyDally” achieves better user stickiness and applicability since peers’ encouragement usually has a larger impact on motivating users.
