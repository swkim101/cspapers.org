Recognizing emotions through pervasive technologies has been the objective of several research studies. Still, the inherent complexities of emotion recognition result in applications that support the process rather than fully address it. Existing methods for data collection combine multiple sensors and devices. The analysis and classification of usersâ€™ and environmental data face challenges to reach high accuracy, responsiveness, and reliability. Because emotion recognition is user-dependent, it still remains as an open challenge to be resolved. This paper provides a unified view about emotion recognition, presenting a multidimensional design space that includes multiple approaches. We discuss the practicalities involved with the implementation of each approach and the deployment of emotion recognition systems. We conclude with a discussion about their advantages, limitations, and open questions.
