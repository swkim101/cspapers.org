Emotional well-being issues have become prevalent nowadays. Nearly 74% of adults in the US said they have experienced at least one symptom of stress in the past month in 2018. To improve one's emotional well-being, relevant techniques of music therapy are used to help people ease pain and improve depressive symptoms. However, we know little about the role of technology in further exhibiting the therapeutic value of music. Having this in mind, we design AudioMomento as a self- healing tool, aiming to engage people in a series of music collecting activities plus journaling via a tangible recording audio book. These activities are informed by existing psychological evidences on music therapy. We hope this tool can be used to promote people's emotional well-being in everyday life.
