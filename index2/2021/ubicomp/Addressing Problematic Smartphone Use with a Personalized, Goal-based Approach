Researchers have long-studied the negative effects of excessive smartphone use and proposed ways to reduce screen time. However, studies suggest restriction-only techniques may cause additional mental health burden. We present our findings from semi-structured discussions with 38 college students on their perception of healthy and problematic smartphone behaviors. Generally, usersâ€™ responses suggested that when smartphone use was perceived as healthy, it helped the user achieve an individualized purpose of primary value. Yet, problematic use did not serve a purpose of primary value. This paper summarizes the key findings from this qualitative study. It also provides an update on our current work, making the case for creating tools focused on helping users achieve their personalized goals in relation to smartphone use or non-use. Our data and theory argue against merely restricting screen time, which is often unsustainable and triggers negative emotions.
