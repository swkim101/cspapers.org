Serious mental illnesses (SMIs), like bipolar disorder (BD) can have a significant negative impact on individualsâ€™ lives, but ability to anticipate manic and depressive mood episodes before they occur can lead better treatment outcomes. BD and its symptoms can also show through online behaviors, suggesting an opportunity to use an online data-driven approach to managing BD. However, designing technologies to support individuals with SMIs have unique concerns, such as privacy and agency. In this proposed work, I mean to understand the feasibility and acceptance of a BD intervention system that uses online behavioral data to infer mood episode onset. Throughout this I mean to explore patient and clinician needs for managing BD through a data-driven intervention, as well as attitudes toward sharing personal data within social support networks to help support treatment, to develop a prototype for future evaluation. In conclusion, I present preliminary findings on patient acceptance, common problematic behaviors, and the role of patient-clinician relationships.
