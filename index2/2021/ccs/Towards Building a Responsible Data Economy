Data is a key driver of modern economy and AI/machine learning, however, a lot of this data is sensitive and handling the sensitive data has caused unprecedented challenges for both individuals and businesses. These challenges will only get more severe as we move forward in the digital era. In this talk, I will talk about technologies needed for responsible data use including secure computing, differential privacy, federated learning, as well as blockchain technologies for data rights, and how to combine privacy computing technologies and blockchain to building a platform for a responsible data economy, to enable more responsible use of data that maximizes social welfare & economic efficiency while protecting users' data rights and enable fair distribution of value created from data. I will also talk about new paradigms that this approach enables including decentralized data science and data DAO. I will also discuss new frameworks on data valuation.
