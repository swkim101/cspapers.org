Despite the many advantages of cloud computing, keeping information in such an environment increases the risk of cyber attacks, as well as the possibility of unauthorized access by cloud provider employees. Another critical concern is privacy protection, since depending on data access control, confidential information may be exposed even through authorized access. To solve these issues we have previously proposed Vallum, a platform that leverages Intel SGX protection to ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of data at rest and during processing. It also provides tools for privacy protection, following policies set by the data owner. In this demo we present Vallum-Med, an application of Vallum for the protection of medical patient personal data, including imaging results of their cardiac examinations. We will demonstrate that this system fully supports cloud protection of such sensitive data as well as the definition of privacy policies and ensuring that all results of queries are compliant to these policies. All processing, data storage and network traffic are protected using SCONE, a docker container-based technology for seamlessly incorporating SGX protection for applications, which provides a fully encrypted memory environment.
