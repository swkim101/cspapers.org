The great amount and complex structure of graph data bring a big challenge to graph data management. However, traditional management approaches cannot tackle the challenge. Fortunately, reinforcement learning provides a new approach to solve this problem due to its automation and adaptivity in decision making. Motivated by this, we develop April, an automatic graph data management system, which performs storage structure selection, index selection, and query optimization based on reinforcement learning. The system selects storage structure, indices effectively and automatically, and optimizes the SPARQL queries efficiently. April also offers a friendly interface for users, which allows users to interact with the system in a customized mode. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of April with two graph data benchmarks.
