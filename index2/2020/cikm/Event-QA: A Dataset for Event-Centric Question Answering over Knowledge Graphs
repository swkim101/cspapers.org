Semantic Question Answering (QA) is a crucial technology to facilitate intuitive user access to semantic information stored in knowledge graphs. Whereas most of the existing QA systems and datasets focus on entity-centric questions, very little is known about these systems' performance in the context of events. As new event-centric knowledge graphs emerge, datasets for such questions gain importance. In this paper, we present the Event-QA dataset for answering event-centric questions over knowledge graphs. Event-QA contains 1000 semantic queries and the corresponding English, German and Portuguese verbalizations for EventKG - an event-centric knowledge graph with more than 970 thousand events.
