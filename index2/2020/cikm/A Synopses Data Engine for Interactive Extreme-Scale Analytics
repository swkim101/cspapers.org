We detail the novel architecture of a Synopses Data Engine (SDE) which combines the virtues of parallel processing and stream summarization towards interactive analytics at scale. Our SDE, built on top of Apache Flink, has a unique design that supports a very wide variety of synopses, allows for dynamically adding new functionality to it at runtime, and introduces a synopsis-as-a-service paradigm to enable various types of scalability.
