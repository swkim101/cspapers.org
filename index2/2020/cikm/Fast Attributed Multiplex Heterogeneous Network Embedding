In recent years, heterogeneous network representation learning has attracted considerable attentions with the consideration of multiple node types. However, most of them ignore the rich set of network attributes (attributed network) and different types of relations (multiplex network), which can hardly recognize the multi-modal contextual signals across different interactions. While a handful of network embedding techniques are developed for attributed multiplex heterogeneous networks, they are significantly limited to the scalability issue on large-scale network data, due to their heavy cost both in computation and memory. In this work, we propose a Fast Attributed Multiplex heterogeneous network Embedding framework (FAME) for large-scale network data, by mapping the units from different modalities (i.e., network topological structures, various node features and relations) into the same latent space in a very efficient way. Our FAME is an integrative architecture with the scalable spectral transformation and sparse random projection, to automatically preserve both attribute semantics and multi-type interactions in the learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets with various network analytical tasks, demonstrate that FAME achieves both effectiveness and significant efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.
