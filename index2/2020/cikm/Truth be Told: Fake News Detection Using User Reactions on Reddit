In this paper, we provide a large dataset for fake news detection using social media comments. The dataset consists of 12,597 claims (of which 63% are labelled as fake) from four different sources (Snopes, Poltifact, Emergent and Twitter). The novel part of the dataset is that it also includes over 662K social media discussion comments related to these claims from Reddit. We make this dataset public for the research community. In addition, for the task of fake news detection using social media comments, we provide a simple but strong baseline solution deep neural network model which beats several solutions in the literature.
