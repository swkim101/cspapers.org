We propose Graph Generating Dependencies (GGDs), a new class of dependencies for property graphs. Extending the expressivity of state of the art constraint languages, GGDs can express both tuple- and equality-generating dependencies on property graphs, both of which find broad application in graph data management. We provide the formal definition of GGDs, analyze the validation problem for GGDs, and demonstrate the practical utility of GGDs.
