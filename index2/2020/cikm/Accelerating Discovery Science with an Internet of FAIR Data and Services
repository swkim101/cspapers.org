Biomedicine has always been a fertile and challenging domain for computational discovery science. Indeed, the existence of millions of scientific articles, thousands of databases, and hundreds of ontologies offer exciting opportunities to mine our collective knowledge, were we not stymied by incompatible formats, incomplete and overlapping vocabularies, confusing licensing policies, and heterogeneous data access points. In this talk, I will discuss our work to create computational standards, platforms, and methods to wrangle knowledge into simple, but effective representations based on semantic web technologies that are maximally FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable - and to further use these representations for biomedical knowledge discovery. However, only with crucial additional developments will this emerging Internet of FAIR data and services enable automated scientific discovery on a global scale.
