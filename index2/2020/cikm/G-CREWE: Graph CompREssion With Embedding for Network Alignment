Network alignment is useful for multiple applications that require increasingly large graphs to be processed. Existing research approaches this as an optimization problem or computes the similarity based on node representations. However, the process of aligning every pair of nodes between relatively large networks is time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose a framework, called G-CREWE (Graph CompREssion With Embedding) to solve the network alignment problem. G-CREWE uses node embeddings to align the networks on two levels of resolution, a fine resolution given by the original network and a coarse resolution given by a compressed version, to achieve an efficient and effective network alignment. The framework first extracts node features and learns the node embedding via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Then, node embedding helps to guide the process of graph compression and finally improve the alignment performance. As part of G-CREWE, we also propose a new compression mechanism called MERGE (Minimum DEgRee NeiGhbors ComprEssion) to reduce the size of the input networks while preserving the consistency in their topological structure. Experiments on all real networks show that our method is more than twice as fast as the most competitive existing methods while maintaining high accuracy.
