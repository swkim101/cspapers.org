The Third Workshop on "Advances in Interpretable Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence" (AIMLAI) presents contributions in the fields of (i) interpretable ML and AI, i.e., algorithms that are natively interpretable, and (ii) interpretability modules, i.e., explanation layers on top of black-box models, also called post-hoc interpretability. AIMLAI encourages interdisciplinary collaborations with particular emphasis in knowledge management, infovis, human computer interaction and psychology. It also welcomes applied research for use cases where interpretability matters.
