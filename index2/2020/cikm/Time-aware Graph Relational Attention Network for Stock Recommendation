Recommending stock with the highest return ratio is always a challenging problem in the field of financial technology. In this paper, we propose a time-aware graph relational attention network (TRAN) for stock recommendation based on return ratio ranking. In TRAN, time-aware relational attention mechanism is the key unit to capture time-varying correlation strength between stocks by the interaction of historical sequences and stock description documents. With the dynamic strength, the nodes of the stock relation graph aggregate the features of neighbor stock nodes by graph convolution operation. For a given group of stocks, our model can output the ranking results of stocks according to their return ratios. The experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRAN for stock recommendation.
