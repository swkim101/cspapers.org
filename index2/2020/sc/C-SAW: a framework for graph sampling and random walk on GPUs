Many applications require to learn, mine, analyze and visualize large-scale graphs. These graphs are often too large to be addressed efficiently using conventional graph processing technologies. Fortunately, recent research efforts find out graph sampling and random walk, which significantly reduce the size of original graphs, can benefit the tasks of learning, mining, analyzing and visualizing large graphs by capturing the desirable graph properties. This paper introduces C-SAW, the first framework that accelerates Sampling and Random Walk framework on GPUs. Particularly, C-SAW makes three contributions: First, our framework provides a generic API which allows users to implement a wide range of sampling and random walk algorithms with ease. Second, offloading this framework on GPU, we introduce warp-centric parallel selection, and two novel optimizations for collision migration. Third, towards supporting graphs that exceed the GPU memory capacity, we introduce efficient data transfer optimizations for out-of-memory and multi-GPU sampling, such as workload-aware scheduling and batched multi-instance sampling. Taken together, our framework constantly outperforms the state of the art projects in addition to the capability of supporting a wide range of sampling and random walk algorithms.
