We present an effort to port the nonhydrostatic atmosphere dynamical core of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to efficiently run on a variety of architectures, including conventional CPU, many-core CPU, and GPU. We specifically target cloud-resolving resolutions of 3 km and 1 km. To express on-node parallelism we use the C++ library Kokkos, which allows us to achieve a performance portable code in a largely architecture-independent way. Our C++ implementation is at least as fast as the original Fortran implementation on IBM Power9 and Intel Knights Landing processors, proving that the code refactor did not compromise the efficiency on CPU architectures. On the other hand, when using the GPUs, our implementation is able to achieve 0.97 Simulated Years Per Day, running on the full Summit supercomputer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most achieved to date by any global atmosphere dynamical core running at such resolutions.
