We present that, the rank-frequency relation in textual data follows f \propto r^{-\alpha}(r+\gamma)^{-\beta}, where f is the token frequency and r is the rank by frequency, with (\alpha, \beta, \gamma) as parameters. The formulation is derived based on the empirical observation that d^2 (x+y)/dx^2 is a typical impulse function, where (x,y)=(\log r, \log f). The formulation is the power law when \beta=0 and the Zipfâ€“Mandelbrot law when \alpha=0. We illustrate that \alpha is related to the analytic features of syntax and \beta+\gamma to those of morphology in natural languages from an investigation of multilingual corpora.
