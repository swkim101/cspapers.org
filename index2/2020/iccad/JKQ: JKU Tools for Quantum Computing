With quantum computers on the brink of practical applicability, there is a lively community that develops toolkits for the design of corresponding quantum circuits. Many of the problems to be tackled here are similar to design problems from the classical realm for which sophisticated design automation tools have been developed in the previous decades. In this paper, we present JKQ-a set of tools for quantum computing developed at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz which utilizes this design automation expertise. By this, we offer complementary approaches for many design problems in quantum computing such as simulation, compilation, or verification. In the following, we provide an introduction of the tools for potential users who would like to work with them as well as potential developers aiming to extend them.
