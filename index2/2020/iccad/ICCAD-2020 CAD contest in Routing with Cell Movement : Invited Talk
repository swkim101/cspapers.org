In physical implementation, the common approach is to divide it into the placement stage and the routing stage. By doing this divide-and-conquer approach, it may cause conservative margin reservation and mis-correlation. To address this problem, ICCAD-2020 contest encourages the research in the techniques of resolving this mentioned problem in the divide-and-conquer place & route approach. We provided (i) a set of benchmarks and (ii) an evaluation metric that facilitate contestants to develop and test their new algorithms.
