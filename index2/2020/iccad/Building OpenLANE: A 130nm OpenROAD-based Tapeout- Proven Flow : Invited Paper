Building a completely open-source System-on-Chip (SoC) means using open-source tools, an open-source foundry Process Design Kit (PDK), and open-source IP libraries including standard cell libraries and analog blocks. Such an effort involves many challenges and cooperation among numerous entities. In this talk we present StriVe, a small open-source SoC designed using a flow based on open-source EDA tools and targeting a foundry process with an open-source PDK and IP libraries, from concept to silicon validation. By designing StriVe, we aim to prove that any skepticism around the use of open-source EDA tools and flows to generate custom ASIC designs is misplaced.
