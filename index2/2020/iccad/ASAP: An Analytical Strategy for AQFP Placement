Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) is a superconducting logic with very low energy dissipation. Each AQFP cell is driven by AC-power to serve as both power supply and clock signal. The clock signals trigger the data flow from one clock phase to the next clock phase, and the delay for each output in the same phase has to be equal. At the same time, the signal current attenuates as the wire becomes longer. When a wire exceeds a maximum length, the weak current causes incorrect data. Thus, rows of buffers have to be inserted as repeaters to satisfy both delay synchronization and wirelength constraint. These inserted buffers significantly increase the power consumption and also the total delay of AQFP circuits. In this paper, we propose an analytical strategy for AQFP placement (ASAP) to provide effective placement results that greatly reduce the number of additional inserted buffers. ASAP includes two main characteristics: 1) a new wire-length function for analytical global placement and 2) detailed placement including fixed-order Lagrangian relaxation and cell balancing algorithm. Experimental results show the efficiency of ASAP framework and a 53% reduction of buffers over the state-of-the-art method.
