Resistive RAM (ReRAM) is widely regarded as a promising platform for deep neural network (DNN) acceleration. However, the ReRAM device suffers from severe thermal problems that degrade the lifetime and inference accuracy of the ReRAM-based DNN accelerator. To address the issues, we propose a thermal-aware optimization framework for accelerating DNN on ReRAM (TOPAR). TOPAR includes 3-stage offline thermal optimization and online thermal-aware error compensation. Offline thermal optimization consists of thermal-aware weight decomposition, thermal-aware column reordering, and fine-grained weight adjustment to reduce the temperature of the ReRAM-based DNN accelerator. For online thermal-aware error compensation, we compensate conductance change according to the temperature variation. With TOPAR, the endurance degradation due to temperature rise improves up to 2.39Ã—, and inference accuracy is preserved without harming the performance of the ReRAM-based DNN accelerator.
