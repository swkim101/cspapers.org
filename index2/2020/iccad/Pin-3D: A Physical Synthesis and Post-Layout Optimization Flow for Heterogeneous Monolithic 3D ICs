In this paper, we present an optimization flow for monolithic 3D ICs called Pin-3D Optimizer. Compared with the state-of-the-art RTL-to-GDS flows that rely on ad-hoc technology file tweaks and RC scaling, Pin-3D offers a streamlined method to run commercial 2D IC tools to obtain high-quality monolithic 3D IC designs. Specifically, Pin-3D supports effective legalization, routing, timing closure, and ECO optimization for monolithic 3D IC designs. We propose a novel optimization methodology where the cells in each tier of a 3D IC are optimized using cell data and constraints of the full 3D design. The optimizations in a tier also directly influence the timing, power in the other tiers, leading to better overall PPA of the 3D IC. With the help of two industry processors designed with a 28 nm technology node, we show that Pin-3D provides up-to 9.0% smaller wirelength and 88% smaller total negative slack than die-by-die M3D flows. We also observe up-to 8.7% lower power and 26% smaller wirelength than 2D ICs. In addition, Pin-3D is the first flow that supports routing and timing optimization in heterogeneous logic-on-logic monolithic 3D ICs. We demonstrate this capability by performing area-balanced tier partitioning, routing, and timing closure of a 3D design with different technologies on each die.
