The intrinsic complexity of modern computing systems requires structured methods for analyzing and optimizing application performance. In this context, the Roofline model proposes an intuitive and visual method providing performance insight and optimization guidance for a given architecture. Although this methodology successfully models multicore and GPU performance optimizations, the original formulation does not directly apply to FPGA devices. For this reason, we propose a Roofline model analysis for reconfigurable architectures and an associated CAD tool for assisting HLS optimization of C/C++ applications. We firstly model FPGA attainable performance by means of an analytical method. Then, we integrate locality walls and a DSE engine for an enhanced optimization process. Starting from a software version of the N-body algorithm, we firstly illustrate how our methodology helps at quickly achieving performance comparable to a state-of-the-art FPGA bespoke implementation. Then, we illustrate an assisted platform porting of the Smith-Waterman sequence alignment providing a 9x speedup. Finally, we evaluated the single DSE engine on the Poly-Bench test suite and achieved performance improvements up to 14.36x compared to previous automated solutions in the literature.
