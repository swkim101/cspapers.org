Resistive crossbar arrays are known for their unique structure to implement analog in-memory vector-matrix-multiplications (VMM). However, general-purpose circuit simulators, such as HSPICE and HSIM, are too slow for large scale crossbar array simulations with consideration of circuit parasitics. Although there are some specific simulators designed for crossbar arrays, they mainly focus on area/power/delay estimation rather than accurate SPICE-level simulation, thus could not model its functionality on analog in-memory computing. In this paper, we firstly give a SPICE-level modeling of resistive crossbar array with consideration of circuit parasitics in MATLAB. We also propose efficient methods to further speedup simulations by model simplifications. Last but not least, ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 is applied to demonstrate the work. With the proposed model simplification methods, simulation speed can be improved by âˆ¼31X with tolerable errors, and more than 5X speedup is achieved on ResNet-20 while the accuracy drop is 6%.
