This paper obtains the fundamental limits on the computational precision of in-memory computing architectures (IMCs). Various compute SNR metrics for IMCs are defined and their interrelationships analyzed to show that the accuracy of IMCs is fundamentally limited by the compute SNR (SNRa) of its analog core, and that activation, weight and output precision needs to be assigned appropriately for the final output SNR SNRT → SNRa. The minimum precision criterion (MPC) is proposed to minimize the output and hence the column analog-to-digital converter (ADC) precision. The charge summing (QS) compute model and its associated IMC QS-Arch are studied to obtain analytical models for its compute SNR, minimum ADC precision, energy and latency. Compute SNR models of QS-Arch are validated via Monte Carlo simulations in a 65 nm CMOS process. Employing these models, upper bounds on SNRa of a QS-Arch-based IMC employing a 512 row SRAM array are obtained and it is shown that QS-Arch's energy cost reduces by 3.3× for every 6 dB drop in SNRa, and that the maximum achievable SNRa reduces with technology scaling while the energy cost at the same SNRa increases. These models also indicate the existence of an upper bound on the dot product dimension N due to voltage headroom clipping, and this bound can be doubled for every 3 dB drop in SNRa.
