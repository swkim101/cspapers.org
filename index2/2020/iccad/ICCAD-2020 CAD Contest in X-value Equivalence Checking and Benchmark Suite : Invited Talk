Equivalence checking is the practical industrial solution to signoff digital functionality for large-scale circuits. However, when design contains implicit and explicit X-values, the complexity of equivalence checking increases and heuristics used in binary-value equivalence checking may not be applicable for X-value equivalence checking. The goal of the ICCAD 2020 CAD contest is to ask the good algorithm and heuristic to solve the X-value equivalence checking. In this contest, we provide the benchmark suites for contestant to evaluate their program. We hope the contest result can improve industry applications and bring more research interests.
