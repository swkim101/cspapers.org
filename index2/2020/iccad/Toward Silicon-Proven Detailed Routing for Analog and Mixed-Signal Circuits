Detailed routing is an intricate and tedious procedure in design automation and has become a crucial step for advanced node enablement. Compared with its advances in digital design, detailed routing for analog/mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) is still heavily manual. In AMS designs, the sensitive net coupling issues and analog-specific constraints make detailed routing even more challenging. This work presents a novel and efficient detailed routing framework for automated AMS layout synthesis considering industrial design rules as well as analog-specific geometric and electrical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in optimizing circuit performance while satisfying the specified constraints. Post-layout simulations further prove that our detailed routing results can achieve sign-off quality.
