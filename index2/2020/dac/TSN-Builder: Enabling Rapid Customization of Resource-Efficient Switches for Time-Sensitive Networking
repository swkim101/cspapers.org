Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) emerges as a promising technique empowering deterministic forwarding on standard Ethernet without sacrificing compatibility. There are some commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) switches that support TSN recently. However, the resource partitioning on these switches is normally inefficient for the on-chip memory resource in many specific application scenarios. We observe that the critical requirements (e.g., topology, flow features) of these scenarios are pre-determined. Thus, developing a TSN switch in a Top-down approach is feasible and urgently needed.In this paper, we propose TSN-Builder, a template-based developing model for customizing resource-efficient TSN switches rapidly with targeted application-dependent requirements. TSN-Builder decomposes the integrated TSN switching function into multiple function templates. With a fine-grained resource abstraction, TSN-Builder provides platform-independent customization interfaces for developers to customize the resource parameters. We prototype TSN switches on FPGA to evaluate the resource consumption and performance under different application scenarios. Experimental results show that TSN-Builder reduces the on-chip memory by up to 80.53% under the same Quality-of-Service, compared to the resource configuration in the COTS switch.
