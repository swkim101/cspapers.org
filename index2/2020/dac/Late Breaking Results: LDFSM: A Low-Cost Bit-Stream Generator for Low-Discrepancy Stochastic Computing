Low-discrepancy (LD) bit-streams have been proposed to improve accuracy and computation speed of stochastic computing (SC) circuits. These bit-streams are conventionally generated using a quasi-random number generator such as a Sobol sequence generator and a comparator. The high hardware cost of quasi-random number generators makes the current comparator-based LD bit-stream generators expensive in terms of area and power cost. The hardware cost issue further aggravates when increasing the number of inputs and the precision of data. A finite state machine (FSM)-based LD bit-stream generator was proposed recently to mitigate this hardware cost. The proposed generator however can only generate one LD pattern which limits its application to SC circuits with only one LD bit-stream. This work proposes LDFSM, a low-cost FSM-based LD bit-stream generator that supports generation of any LD pattern. LDFSM reduces the hardware area and the area-delay product up to 80% compared to those of the state-of-the-art LD bit-stream generator.
