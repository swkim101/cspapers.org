Obtaining item frequencies in data streams with limited space is a well-recognized and challenging problem in a wide range of applications. Sketch-based solutions have been widely used to address this challenge due to their ability to accurately record the data streams at a low memory cost. However, most sketches suffer from low memory utilization due to the adoption of a fixed counter size. Accordingly, in this work, we propose a counter-cascading scheduling algorithm to maximize the memory utilization of sketches without incurring any accuracy loss. In addition, we propose an FPGA-based system design that supports sketch parameter learning, counter-cascading record and online query. We implement our designs on Xilinx VCU118, and conduct evaluations on real-world traces, thereby demonstrating that our design can achieve higher accuracy with lower storage; the performance achieved is 10× ∼ 20× better than that of state-of-the-art sketches.
