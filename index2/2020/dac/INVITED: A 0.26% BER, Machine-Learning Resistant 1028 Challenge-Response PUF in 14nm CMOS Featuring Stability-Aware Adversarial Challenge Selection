A 1028 challenge-response strong-PUF circuit is fabricated in 14nm CMOS, demonstrating modeling attack resistance across 6-million training samples. Two-stage nonlinearly cascaded PUF array organization with adversarial challenge selection increases modeling complexity by 4×, limiting ML attack accuracy to ~50%. A configurable cross-coupled inverter-based entropy source with stability-aware challenge pruning enables 9.8× higher array density, linearly-scaling enrollment data and worst-case bit-error-rate of 0.26% measured across 650-850mV, 0-100°C operation.
