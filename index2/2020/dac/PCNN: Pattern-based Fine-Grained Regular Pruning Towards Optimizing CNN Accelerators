Weight pruning is a powerful technique to realize model compression. We propose PCNN, a fine-grained regular 1D pruning method. A novel index format called Sparsity Pattern Mask (SPM) is presented to encode the sparsity in PCNN. Leveraging SPM with limited pruning patterns and non-zero sequences with equal length, PCNN can be efficiently employed in hardware. Evaluated on VGG-16 and ResNet-18, our PCNN achieves the compression rate up to 8.4× with only 0.2% accuracy loss. We also implement a pattern-aware architecture in 55nm process, achieving up to 9.0× speedup and 28.39 TOPS/W efficiency with only 3.1% on-chip memory overhead of indices.
