The DRAM technology advancement has seen success in memory density and throughput improvement, but less in access latency reduction. This is mainly due to the intrinsic limitation of capacitance based bit store and access mechanism. The reduction of access latency has been well explored in literature. However, the recently proposed DRAM techniques, such as RowClone and Half-DRAM, offer new opportunities to further optimise the access latency.In this paper, we propose an efficient access strategy to improve the performance of DRAM by optionally discarding the restore. When activating a new row, our technique makes a copy of the row leveraging the RowClone method. Next time when accessing the same row, the cloned row is opened for sensing but it is not restored as the data is preserved in the original row. To improve the efficiency of our proposed strategy, we further exploit three schemes to minimize the copy overhead and increase the reuse of the cloned row. Experimental results show that our proposed strategy can achieve 11% performance improvement on average.
