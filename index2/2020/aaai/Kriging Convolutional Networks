Spatial interpolation is a class of estimation problems where locations with known values are used to estimate values at other locations, with an emphasis on harnessing spatial locality and trends. Traditional kriging methods have strong Gaussian assumptions, and as a result, often fail to capture complexities within the data. Inspired by the recent progress of graph neural networks, we introduce Kriging Convolutional Networks (KCN), a method of combining advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and kriging. Compared to standard GNNs, KCNs make direct use of neighboring observations when generating predictions. KCNs also contain the kriging method as a specific configuration. Empirically, we show that this model outperforms GNNs and kriging in several applications.
