Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been applied in knowledge base question answering (KBQA) task. However, the pairwise connection between nodes of GCN limits the representation capability of high-order data correlation. Furthermore, most previous work does not fully utilize the semantic relation information, which is vital to reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop KBQA model based on hypergraph convolutional network. By constructing a hypergraph, the form of pairwise connection between nodes and nodes is converted to the high-level connection between nodes and edges, which effectively encodes complex related data. To better exploit the semantic information of relations, we apply co-attention method to learn similarity between relation and query, and assign weights to different relations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectivity of the model.
