Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is the most challenging area of Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and Question Answering (QA), since it not only requires natural language understanding, but also problem-solving techniques. We propose a novel method, Wrong Answer Ensemble (WAE), which can be applied to various MCQA tasks easily. To improve performance of MCQA tasks, humans intuitively exclude unlikely options to solve the MCQA problem. Mimicking this strategy, we train our model with the wrong answer loss and correct answer loss to generalize the features of our model, and exclude likely but wrong options. An experiment on a dialogue-based examination dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the results on a fine-tuned transformer by 2.7%.
