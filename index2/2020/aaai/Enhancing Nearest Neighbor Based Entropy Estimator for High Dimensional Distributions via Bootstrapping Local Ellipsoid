An ellipsoid-based, improved kNN entropy estimator based on random samples of distribution for high dimensionality is developed. We argue that the inaccuracy of the classical kNN estimator in high dimensional spaces results from the local uniformity assumption and the proposed method mitigates the local uniformity assumption by two crucial extensions, a local ellipsoid-based volume correction and a correction acceptance testing procedure. Relevant theoretical contributions are provided and several experiments from simple to complicated cases have shown that the proposed estimator can effectively reduce the bias especially in high dimensionalities, outperforming current state of the art alternative estimators.
