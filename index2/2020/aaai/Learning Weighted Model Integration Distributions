Weighted model integration (WMI) is a framework for probabilistic inference over distributions with discrete and continuous variables and structured supports. Despite the growing popularity of WMI, existing density estimators ignore the problem of learning a structured support, and thus fail to handle unfeasible conﬁgurations and piecewise-linear relations between continuous variables. We propose LARIAT , a novel method to tackle this challenging problem. In a ﬁrst step, our approach induces an SMT( LRA ) formula representing the support of the structured distribution. Next, it combines the latter with a density learned using a state-of-the-art estimation method. The overall model automatically accounts for the discontinuous nature of the underlying structured distribution. Our experimental results with synthetic and real-world data highlight the promise of the approach.
