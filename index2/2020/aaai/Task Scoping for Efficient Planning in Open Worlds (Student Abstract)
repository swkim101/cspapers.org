We propose an abstraction method for open-world environments expressed as Factored Markov Decision Processes (FMDPs) with very large state and action spaces. Our method prunes state and action variables that are irrelevant to the optimal value function on the state subspace the agent would visit when following any optimal policy from the initial state. This method thus enables tractable fast planning within large open-world FMDPs.
