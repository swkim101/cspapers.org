Existing co-localization techniques significantly lose performance over weakly or fully supervised methods in accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we overcome common drawbacks of co-localization techniques by utilizing self-supervised learning approach. The major technical contributions of the proposed method are two-fold. 1) We devise a new geometric transformation, namely point symmetric transformation and utilize its parameters as an artificial label for self-supervised learning. This new transformation can also play the role of region-drop based regularization. 2) We suggest a heat map extraction method for computing the heat map from the network trained by self-supervision, namely class-agnostic activation mapping. It is done by computing the spatial attention map. Based on extensive evaluations, we observe that the proposed method records new state-of-the-art performance in three fine-grained datasets for unsupervised object localization. Moreover, we show that the idea of the proposed method can be adopted in a modified manner to solve the weakly supervised object localization task. As a result, we outperform the current state-of-the-art technique in weakly supervised object localization by a significant gap.
