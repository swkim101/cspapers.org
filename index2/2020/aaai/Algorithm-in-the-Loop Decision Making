We introduce a new framework for conceiving of and studying algorithms that are deployed to aid human decision making: “algorithm-in-the-loop” systems. The algorithm-in-the-loop framework centers human decision making, providing a more precise lens for studying the social impacts of algorithmic decision making aids. We report on two experiments that evaluate algorithm-in-the-loop decision making and find significant limits to these systems.
