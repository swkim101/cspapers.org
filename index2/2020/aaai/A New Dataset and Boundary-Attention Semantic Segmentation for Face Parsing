Face parsing has recently attracted increasing interest due to its numerous application potentials, such as facial make up and facial image generation. In this paper, we make contributions on face parsing task from two aspects. First, we develop a high-efficiency framework for pixel-level face parsing annotating and construct a new large-scale Landmark guided face Parsing dataset (LaPa). It consists of more than 22,000 facial images with abundant variations in expression, pose and occlusion, and each image of LaPa is provided with an 11-category pixel-level label map and 106-point landmarks. The dataset is publicly accessible to the community for boosting the advance of face parsing.1 Second, a simple yet effective Boundary-Attention Semantic Segmentation (BASS) method is proposed for face parsing, which contains a three-branch network with elaborately developed loss functions to fully exploit the boundary information. Extensive experiments on our LaPa benchmark and the public Helen dataset show the superiority of our proposed method.
