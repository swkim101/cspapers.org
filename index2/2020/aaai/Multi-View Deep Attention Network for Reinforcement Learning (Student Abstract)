The representation approximated by a single deep network is usually limited for reinforcement learning agents. We propose a novel multi-view deep attention network (MvDAN), which introduces multi-view representation learning into the reinforcement learning task for the first time. The proposed model approximates a set of strategies from multiple representations and combines these strategies based on attention mechanisms to provide a comprehensive strategy for a single-agent. Experimental results on eight Atari video games show that the MvDAN has effective competitive performance than single-view reinforcement learning methods.
