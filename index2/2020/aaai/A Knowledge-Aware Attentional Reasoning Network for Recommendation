Knowledge-graph-aware recommendation systems have increasingly attracted attention in both industry and academic recently. Many existing knowledge-aware recommendation methods have achieved better performance, which usually perform recommendation by reasoning on the paths between users and items in knowledge graphs. However, they ignore the users' personal clicked history sequences that can better reflect users' preferences within a period of time for recommendation. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-aware attentional reasoning network KARN that incorporates the users' clicked history sequences and path connectivity between users and items for recommendation. The proposed KARN not only develops an attention-based RNN to capture the user's history interests from the user's clicked history sequences, but also a hierarchical attentional neural network to reason on paths between users and items for inferring the potential user intents on items. Based on both user's history interest and potential intent, KARN can predict the clicking probability of the user with respective to a candidate item. We conduct experiment on Amazon review dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed KARN model.
