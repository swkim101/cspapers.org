One key principle for assessing semantic similarity between texts is to measure the degree of semantic overlap of them by considering word-by-word alignment. However, alignment-based approaches} are inferior to the generic sentence vectors in terms of performance. We hypothesize that the reason for the inferiority of alignment-based methods is due to the fact that they do not distinguish word importance and word meaning. To solve this, we propose to separate word importance and word meaning by decomposing word vectors into their norm and direction, then compute the alignment-based similarity with the help of earth mover's distance. We call the method word rotator's distance (WRD) because direction vectors are aligned by rotation on the unit hypersphere. In addition, to incorporate the advance of cutting edge additive sentence encoders, we propose to re-decompose such sentence vectors into word vectors and use them as inputs to WRD. Empirically, the proposed method outperforms current methods considering the word-by-word alignment including word mover's distance with a big difference; moreover, our method outperforms state-of-the-art additive sentence encoders on the most competitive dataset, STS-benchmark.
