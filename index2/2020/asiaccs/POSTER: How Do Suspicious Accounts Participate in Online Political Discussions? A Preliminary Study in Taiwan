Social network platforms have become popular channels for election campaigns and political propaganda in recent years. However, some entities may employ a group of accounts to generate and shape public opinions. This study investigated the publication and commenting activities by collecting a 6-month-long user behavior data on the most extensively used online forum in Taiwan during a local election in 2018. A series of comparative studies between normal and verified malicious accounts are conducted. From the results, we find malicious authors published articles with more comments and received polarized ratings from online users.
