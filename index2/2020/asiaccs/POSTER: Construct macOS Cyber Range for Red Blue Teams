More and more malicious apps and APT attacks now target macOS, making it crucial for researchers to develop threat countermeasures on macOS. In this paper, we attempt to construct a macOS cyber range for the evaluation of red team and blue team performances. Our proposed system is composed of three fundamental components: an attack-defense association graph, a Go language-based red team emulation tool, and a toolkit for blue team performance evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed cyber range with real-world scenarios, and believe it will stimulate more research innovations on threat analysis for macOS.
