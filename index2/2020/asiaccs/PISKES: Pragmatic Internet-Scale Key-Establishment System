Denial-of-service attacks have become increasingly prevalent in the Internet. In many cases they are enabled or facilitated by the lack of source authentication?it is often easy for an attacker to spoof its own IP address and thus launch reflection attacks or evade detection. There have been attempts in the past to resolve this issue through filtering or cryptography-based techniques; however, there is still no sufficiently strong system in place today-all proposals either provide weak security guarantees, are not efficient enough, or lack incentives for deployment. In this paper we present PISKES, a pragmatic Internet-scale key-establishment system enabling firstpacket authentication. Through the PISKES infrastructure, any host can locally obtain a symmetric key to enable a remote service to perform source-address authentication. The remote service can itself locally derive the same key with efficient cryptographic operations. PISKES thus enables packet authentication for a wide variety of systems including high-throughput applications like DNS. We have implemented a prototype system that enables a DNS server to verify the source of every received packet within 85 ns, which is over 220 times faster than a system based on asymmetric cryptography. PISKES has been developed for the SCION secure Internet architecture but is also applicable to today's Internet. With its strong source-authentication properties and highly efficient operation it has the potential to finally bring network-layer authentication to the Internet
