In this paper we propose a method to detect distributed bruteforcing by modeling failed login attempts as a Poisson probability distribution. We use content similarity between known SSH connection and flow characteristics of failed login attempts to attribute a flow to SSH application and subsequently either as failure or success. Using the failed login count in a window time, we label window as either normal or containing bruteforce attempts.
