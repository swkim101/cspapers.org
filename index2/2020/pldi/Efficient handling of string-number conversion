String-number conversion is an important class of constraints needed for the symbolic execution of string-manipulating programs. In particular solving string constraints with string-number conversion is necessary for the analysis of scripting languages such as JavaScript and Python, where string-number conversion is a part of the definition of the core semantics of these languages. However, solving this type of constraint is very challenging for the state-of-the-art solvers. We propose in this paper an approach that can efficiently support both string-number conversion and other common types of string constraints. Experimental results show that it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art tools on benchmarks that involves string-number conversion.
