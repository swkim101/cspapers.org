Air quality has impacts on our health and environment extremely. To monitor air pollutants, with the maturity of wireless sensor network, low-cost air sensors are deployed to trace pollution sources and detect personal exposure. Regular quality audit of deployed sensors is essential to ensure data quality of large-scale air monitoring networks. However, inspecting tremendous sensors by professional technicians regularly will take much human resources. This paper proposed the key sensor discovery for efficient and effective quality audit of large-scale air sensor network.
