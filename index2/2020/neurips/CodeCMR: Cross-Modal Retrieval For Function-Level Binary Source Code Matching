Previous work indicates that CFG is a sensitive feature, because it changes greatly in different optimizations. However, the results have declined somewhat in our research, but within acceptable limits. To train a cross-platform model, we extract the token sequences based on IDA Pro microcode IR (Intermediate Representation). The columns are combinations of different compilers (gcc/clang), different platforms (x86/x64/arm/arm64), and different optimizations (O0/O1/O2/O3). The average recall@1 score of the 32 combinations is 88.9%. The lowest recall@1 score among the 32 combinations is 85.1% on gcc-arm64-O3, which is acceptable.
