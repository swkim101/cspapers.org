The purpose of this article is to address unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) where a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain are given. Recent advanced UDA methods attempt to remove domain-specific properties by separating domain-specific information from domain-invariant representations, which heavily rely on the designed neural network structures. Meanwhile, they do not consider class discriminate representations when learning domain-invariant representations. To this end, this article proposes a co-training framework for heterogeneous heuristic domain adaptation (CO-HHDA) to address the above issues. First, a heterogeneous heuristic network is introduced to model domain-specific characters. It allows structures of heuristic network to be different between domains to avoid underfitting or overfitting. Specially, we initialize a small structure that is shared between domains and increase a subnetwork for the domain which preserves rich specific information. Second, we propose a co-training scheme to train two classifiers, a source classifier and a target classifier, to enhance class discriminate representations. The two classifiers are designed based on domain-invariant representations, where the source classifier learns from the labeled source data, and the target classifier is trained from the generated target pseudolabeled data. The two classifiers teach each other in the training process with high-quality pseudolabeled data. Meanwhile, an adaptive threshold is presented to select reliable pseudolabels in each classifier. Empirical results on three commonly used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CO-HHDA outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
