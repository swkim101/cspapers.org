This paper studies a central issue in modern reinforcement learning, the sample efficiency, and makes progress toward solving an idealistic scenario that assumes access to a generative model or a simulator. Despite a large number of prior works tackling this problem, a complete picture of the trade-offs between sample complexity and statistical accuracy has yet to be determined. In particular, all prior results suffer from a severe sample size barrier in the sense that their claimed statistical guarantees hold only when the sample size exceeds some enormous threshold. The current paper overcomes this barrier and fully settles this problem; more specifically, we establish the minimax optimality of the model-based approach for any given target accuracy level. To the best of our knowledge, this work delivers the first minimax-optimal guarantees that accommodate the entire range of sample sizes (beyond which finding a meaningful policy is information theoretically infeasible).
