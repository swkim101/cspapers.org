Without loss of generality, we assume that the nodes are labeled such that there is no directed edge in E from later node to earlier node. Such labeling is also known as perfect/topological ordering of DAG G. Define a set of edges that are connected to node j and have opposite directions in E and E′, re(j) = {k ∈ V : ejk = ekj = 1} for j = 1, . . . , p. For k ∈ re(j), E includes an edge k → j, while E′ has the reverse edge j → k. If re(j) = ∅ for all j, there exists no pair of nodes (j, k) such that ejk = ekj = 1. This means E = E ′, because Markov equivalent DAGs have the same skeleton. We will show by mathematical induction that re(j) = ∅ for all j, which contradicts the assumption that E 6= E′. For node p that is the last element of the perfect ordering of G, we have pa(p) = pa′(p) ∪ re(p) due to the same skeleton of G and G′. Taking the difference of the equality (1) at (x1, x2, . . . , xp + 1) and (x1, x2, . . . , xp) yields, ∑
