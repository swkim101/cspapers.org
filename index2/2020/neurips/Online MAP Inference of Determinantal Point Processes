In this paper, we provide an efﬁcient approximation algorithm for ﬁnding the most likelihood conﬁguration (MAP) of size k for Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) in the online setting where the data points arrive in an arbitrary order and the algorithm cannot discard the selected elements from its local memory. Given a tolerance additive error ⌘ , our O NLINE -DPP algorithm achieves a k O ( k ) multiplicative approximation guarantee with an additive error ⌘ , using a memory footprint independent of the size of the data stream. We note that the exponential dependence on k in the approximation factor is unavoidable even in the ofﬂine setting. Our result readily implies a streaming algorithm with an improved memory bound compared to existing results.
