Intra-saliency and inter-saliency cues 3 have been extensively studied for co-saliency detection (Co-SOD). Model-based methods produce coarse Co-SOD results due to hand-crafted intra-and inter-saliency features. Current data-driven models exploit inter-saliency cues, but undervalue the potential power of intra-saliency cues. In this paper, we propose an Intra-saliency Correlation Network (ICNet) to extract intra-saliency cues from the single image saliency maps (SISMs) predicted by any off-the-shelf SOD method, and obtain inter-saliency cues by correlation techniques. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we adopt normalized masked average pooling (NMAP) to extract latent intra-saliency categories from the SISMs and semantic features as intra cues. Then we employ a correlation fusion module (CFM) to obtain inter cues by exploiting correlations between the intra cues and single-image features. To improve Co-SOD performance, we propose a category-independent rearranged self-correlation feature (RSCF) strategy. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our ICNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on Co-SOD. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our contributions.
