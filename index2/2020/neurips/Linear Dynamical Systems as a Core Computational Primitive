Single-input, single-output linear dynamical systems (SISO LDS) map a sequence of input numbers to a sequence of output numbers. We present two results which support their use as a building block for more complex RNNs. The ﬁrst result concerns computational efﬁciency. We show that reachable SISO LDS, and their gradients, can be computed in parallel across time, so they can be used on very long time series. This is possible because the eigenvectors of the LDS transition matrix have closed-form expressions in terms of the eigenvalues. The second result concerns expressive power. We show a sum of reachable SISO LDS can approximate any reachable, multiple-input, single-output (MISO) LDS, whose inputs are vectors. This construction involves randomly projecting the vectors to a single dimension.
