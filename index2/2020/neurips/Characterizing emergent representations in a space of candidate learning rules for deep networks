We apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to the dataset’s input-output correlation matrix to extract the component of the input-output mapping for different hierarchical levels. Suppose the desired (target) output matrix is given by Y as shown in the main paper Fig. 1b, and input matrix is X where examples are placed in columns. In X, each object’s perceptual representation x (a column vector, where μ = 1...P indexing objects) is encoded by a one-hot input vector (Kronecker delta δμi). Thus, the input-output correlation matrix is Σ = YX . We use SVD on Σ, i.e., Σ = USV , which results in three key elements fully characterizing the input-output mapping to be learned (visualized in Supp. Fig. 1). For the case of hierarchically structured data from a binary tree, the SVD structure conforms to hierarchical distinctions in the dataset [4]. The first element is U, a feature-synthesizer matrix in which each column (a particular semantic dimension or ‘mode’) contains positive (negative) values for semantic features that objects categorized along this mode do (do not) possess. The second element is S, a singular value matrix that has nonzero values only on the diagonal, and these values are arranged in a descending order. And the last element is V , whose rows are object-analyzer vectors, whereby a binary code is assigned to classify objects according to each semantic mode (e.g., the 2nd row of V indicates the first 4 objects are plants, while the last 4 objects are animals, see Fig. 1b in the main paper).
