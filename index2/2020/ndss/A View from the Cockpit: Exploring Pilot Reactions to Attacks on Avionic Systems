Many wireless communications systems  found  in aircraft lack standard security mechanisms, leaving them fundamentally  vulnerable  to  attack. With  affordable software-defined radios available, a novel threat has  emerged, allowing  a  wide range of attackers to easily interfere with   wireless   avionic systems. Whilst these vulnerabilities are known, concrete attacks that exploit them are still novel and not yet well understood. This is  true  in  particular  with  regards to their  kinetic impact on the handling of the attacked aircraft and consequently its safety. To investigate this, we invited 30 Airbus A320 type-rated pilots to fly simulator scenarios in which they were subjected to attacks on their avionics. We implement and analyze novel wireless attacks on three safety-related systems: Traffic Collision Avoidance  System  (TCAS),  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System (GPWS) and the Instrument Landing System (ILS). We  found that all three analyzed attack scenarios created significant control impact and cost of disruption through turnarounds,  avoidance manoeuvres, and diversions. They further increased workload, distrust in the affected  system, and in 38% of cases caused the attacked safety system to be switched off entirely. All pilots felt the scenarios were useful, with 93.3% feeling that specific simulator training for wireless attacks could be valuable.
