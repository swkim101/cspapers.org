Superoptimization is a compilation strategy that uses search to improve code quality, rather than relying on a canned sequence of transformations, as traditional optimizing compilers do. This search can be seen as a program synthesis problem: from unoptimized code serving as a specification, the synthesis procedure attempts to create a more efficient implementation. An important family of synthesis algorithms works by enumerating candidates and then successively checking if each refines the specification, using an SMT solver. The contribution of this paper is a pruning technique which reduces the enumerative search space using fast dataflow-based techniques to discard synthesis candidates that contain symbolic constants and uninstantiated instructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by improving the runtime of an enumerative synthesis procedure in the Souper superoptimizer for the LLVM intermediate representation. The techniques presented in this paper eliminate 65% of the solver calls made by Souper, making it 2.32x faster (14.54 hours vs 33.76 hours baseline, on a large multicore) at solving all 269,113 synthesis problems that Souper encounters when optimizing the C and C++ programs from SPEC CPU 2017.
