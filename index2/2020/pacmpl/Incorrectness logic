Program correctness and incorrectness are two sides of the same coin. As a programmer, even if you would like to have correctness, you might find yourself spending most of your time reasoning about incorrectness. This includes informal reasoning that people do while looking at or thinking about their code, as well as that supported by automated testing and static analysis tools. This paper describes a simple logic for program incorrectness which is, in a sense, the other side of the coin to Hoare's logic of correctness.
