Relational verification of quantum programs has many potential applications in quantum and post-quantum security and other domains. We propose a relational program logic for quantum programs. The interpretation of our logic is based on a quantum analogue of probabilistic couplings. We use our logic to verify non-trivial relational properties of quantum programs, including uniformity for samples generated by the quantum Bernoulli factory, reliability of quantum teleportation against noise (bit and phase flip), security of quantum one-time pad and equivalence of quantum walks.
