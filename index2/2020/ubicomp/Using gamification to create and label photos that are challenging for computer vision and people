It would be hard to overstate the importance of Computer Vision (CV), applications of which can be found from self-driving cars, through facial recognition to augmented reality and the healthcare industry. Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in visual-object recognition, partially ascribable to the availability of labeled data. Unfortunately, recognition of obscure, unclear and ambiguous photos that are taken from unusual angles or distances remains a major challenge, as recently shown by the creation of the ObjectNet [1]. This paper complements that work via a game in which obscure, unclear and ambiguous photos are collaboratively created and labeled by the players, who adopt the role of detectives collecting evidence against in-game criminals. The game rules enforce the creation of images that are challenging to identify for CV and people alike, as a means of ensuring the high quality of players' input.
