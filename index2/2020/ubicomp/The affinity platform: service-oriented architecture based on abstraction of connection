The Affinity Platform is an innovative Software as a Service orchestration system designed for building Service-Oriented software solutions. It challenges the modularity of regular software frameworks and microservice architectures by abstracting the connectivity layer between two services. The main benefit of utilizing this approach is that components designed to communicate through a specific interface can be easily routed to handle this communication over a different medium. A service could extract health data from a smartwatch, use Bluetooth connectivity to send it to a smartphone for pre-processing, and the result can then be transmitted over HTTP to a server for centralization (Figure 1). All this would be possible without requiring services to agree on a specific communication protocol or data format. The capabilities of the platform were enhanced to assist the development of a multi-modal solution for monitoring patients in a constantly changing environment.
