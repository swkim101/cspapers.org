Doze is an on-skin, hydrogel-based sleep mask which seeks to improve, enhance, and augment sleep through the use of programmed scent diffusion in tune with the user's cortical rhythms. Taking advantage of hydrogels' unique properties, the Doze mask encapsulates and emits therapeutic scents at a regulated pace. The release of scent is controlled by an embedded heater within the layers of the mask and communicates remotely to a smart device. This communication allows for a personalized dosage release based on the user's biometric or contextual data. Investigating both the pervasive power of smell in enhancing sleep as well as natural topical remedies, this personalized mask explores the potential for unintrusive solutions to the evergrowing rarity of a good night's sleep.
