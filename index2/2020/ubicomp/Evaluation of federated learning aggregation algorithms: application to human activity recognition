Pervasive computing promotes the integration of connected electronic devices in our living spaces in order to assist us through appropriate services. Two major developments have gained significant momentum recently: a better use of fog resources and the use of AI techniques. Specifically, interest in machine learning approaches for engineering applications has increased rapidly. \ This paradigm seems to fit the pervasive environment well. However, federated learning has been applied so far to specific services and remains largely conceptual. It needs to be tested extensively on pervasive services partially located in the fog. In this paper, we present experiments performed in the domain of Human Activity Recognition on smartphones in order to evaluate existing algorithms.
