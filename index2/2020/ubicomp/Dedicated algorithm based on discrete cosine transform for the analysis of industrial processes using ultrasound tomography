The article presents a cyber-physical system for acquiring, processing and reconstructing images from measurement data. The technology is based on process tomography, intelligent sensors, machine learning, Big Data, Cloud Computing, as well as Internet of Things as a solution for industry 4.0. Industrial tomography allows observation of physical and chemical phenomena without the need for internal penetration, in a non-destructive way and allows monitoring of manufacturing processes in real time. The application contains a dedicated algorithm based on discrete cosine transformation to solve the inverse problem and a specialized intelligent system for tomographic measurements.
