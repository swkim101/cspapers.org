This paper describes our submission as Team-Petrichor to the competition that was organized by the SHL recognition challenge dataset authors. We compared multiple machine learning approach for classifying eight different activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Car, Bus, Train, Subway). The first step was feature engineering, a wide set of statistical domain features were computed and their quality was evaluated. Finally, the appropriate machine learning model was chosen. The recognition result for the testing dataset will be presented in the summary paper of the SHL recognition challenge.
