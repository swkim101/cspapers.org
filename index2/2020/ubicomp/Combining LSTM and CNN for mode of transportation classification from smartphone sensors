The broad availability of smartphones and Inertial Measurement Units in particular brings them into focus of recent research. Inertial Measurement Unit data is used for a variety of tasks. One important task is the classification of the mode of transportation. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based algorithm, that combines long-short-term-memory (LSTM) layer and convolutional layer to classify eight different modes of transportation on the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) dataset. The inputs of our model are the accelerometer, gyroscope, linear acceleration, magnetometer, gravity and pressure values as well as the orientation information. We achieve a F1 score of 98.96 % on our private test set. We participated as team 103114102106|8 in the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge.
