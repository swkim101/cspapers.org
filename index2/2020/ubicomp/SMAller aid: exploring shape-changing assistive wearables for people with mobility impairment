Individuals with mobility impairments often discuss the challenges associated with donning and doffing shirts (i.e. putting them on and taking them off). Limited previous work has tackled this issue, but the comfort and aesthetic integrity of the shirt is often forgotten. In this paper, we co-designed an adaptive shirt with individuals with mobility impairments and personal support workers. With the insights from these discussions, we developed an augmented top that transforms wide sizes (for the easy donning and doffing) into their preferred fit. The study resulted in the design of SMAller Aid, which uses Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) springs to retract to a smaller size. The shirt adapts to their needs while retaining its aesthetic integrity to empower them with independence and no required assistance.
