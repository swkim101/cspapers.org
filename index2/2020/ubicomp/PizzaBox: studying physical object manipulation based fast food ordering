This paper presents the designing and evaluation of PizzaBox, a 3D printed, tangible food ordering system that aims to differ from conventional food ordering systems and provide an unique experience when ordering a pizza by incorporating underlying technologies that support ubiquitous computing. The PizzaBox has gone through both low and medium fidelity testing while working collaboratively with participants to co-design and refine a product that is approachable to all age groups while maintaining a simple process for ordering food from start to finish. We utilised this artefact to conduct an user study at an independent pizzeria to uncover potential opportunities. We present two of the main themes identified through the discussions: 1) end user engagement (from entertainment to education), and 2) healthy eating and living. We found that our approach could potentially utilise towards promoting a healthier lifestyle as well as an educational tool.
