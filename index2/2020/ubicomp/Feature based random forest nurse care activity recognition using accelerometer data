The The 2nd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge Using Lab and Field Data addresses the important issue about care and the need for assistance systems in the nursing profession like automatic documentation systems. Data of 12 different care activities were recorded with an accelerometer attached to the right arm of the nurses. Both, laboratory and field data were taken into account. The task was to classify each activity based on the accelerometer data. We participated as team Gudetama in the challenge. We trained a Random Forest classifier and achieved an accuracy of 61.11% on our internal test set.
