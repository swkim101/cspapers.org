2nd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge using Lab and Field Data is organized as a part of HASCA workshop and is continuation of Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge [7]. We give the description of the dataset and summarize the approaches used by the teams in this Challenge. In this challenge, data collected in both lab and real-world setting is provided to the challenge participants with an aim to bridge the gap between lab and practical field to reduce the workload of the nurses. The challenge was started on May 1, 2020 and continued until July 9, 2020. Accuracy is used as performance metric to evaluate the submissions. The winning team used k-NN classifier and achieved about 22.35% accuracy.
