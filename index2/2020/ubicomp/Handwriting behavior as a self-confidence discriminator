Receiving feedback based on the combination of self-confidence and correctness of an answer can help learners to improve learning efficiency. In this study, we propose a self-confidence estimation method using a simple touch up/move/down events that can be measured in a classroom environment. We recorded handwriting behavior during the answering vocabulary questions with a tablet and a stylus pen, estimating self-reported confidence. We successfully built a method that can predict the user's self-confidence with a maximum of 73% accuracy.
