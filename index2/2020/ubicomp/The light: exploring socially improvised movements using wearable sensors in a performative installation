This work explores the potential of a set comprised of wearable sensors, a performative lighting installation, and a public museum space, to inspire performative and collaborative social behavior among members of the public. Our installation, The Light, was first exhibited as part of the Late at Tate Britain event in 2019. In this paper we discuss the concept and technological implementation behind the work, and present an initial qualitative study of observations made of the people who interacted with it. The study provides a subjective evaluation based on people's facial expressions and body language as they improvise and coordinate their movements with one another and with the installation.
