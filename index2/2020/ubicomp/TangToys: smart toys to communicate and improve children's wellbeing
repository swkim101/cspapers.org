Children can find it challenging to communicate their emotions especially when experiencing mental health challenges. Technological solutions may help children communicate digitally and receive support from one another as advances in networking and sensors enable the real-time transmission of physical interactions. In this work, we pursue the design of multiple tangible user interfaces designed for children containing multiple sensors and feedback actuators. Bluetooth is used to provide communication between Tangible Toys (TangToys) enabling peer to peer support groups to be developed and allowing feedback to be issued whenever other children are nearby. TangToys can provide a non-intrusive means for children to communicate their wellbeing through play.
