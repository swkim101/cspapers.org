We present a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to recognising modes of transportation from smartphone motion sensor data, as part of our contribution to the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge 2020 as team noname. Our approach identifies the location where the smartphone of the test dataset is carried on the body through heuristics, after which a location-specific model is trained based on the available published data at this location. Performance on the validation data is 0.95, which we expect to be very similar on the test set, if our estimation of the location of the phone on the test set is correct. We are highly confident in this location estimation. If however it were wrong, an accuracy as low as 30% could be expected.
