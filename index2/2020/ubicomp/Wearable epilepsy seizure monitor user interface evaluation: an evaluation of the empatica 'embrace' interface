Wearable health devices have the potential to incentivize individuals in health-promoting behaviors and to assist in the monitoring of health conditions. Wearable epilepsy seizure monitoring devices are now evolving that can support individuals and their caregivers via the automated sensing, reporting and logging of epileptic seizures. This work contributes a novel reflection on the interface requirements of wearer users and non-wearer stakeholder users. We evaluate the "guessability" of the light pattern interface of the Empatica Embrace wrist-worn epileptic seizure monitor and provide box plot results for eight interface indications. We also report summarised feedback from a heuristic analysis with fourteen participant evaluators. The results indicate some satisfaction with the minimal aesthetic of a simple light pattern interface as well as some concerns about confusion between different indications, accessibility and reliance on recall.
