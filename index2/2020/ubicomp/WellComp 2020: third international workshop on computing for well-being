With the advancements in ubiquitous computing, ubicomp technology has deeply spread into our daily lives, including office work, home and house-keeping, health management, transportation, or even urban living environments. Furthermore, beyond the initial metric of computing, such as "efficiency" and "productivity", the benefits that people (users) benefit on a well-being perspective based on such ubiquitous technology has been greatly paid attention in the recent years. In our third "WellComp" (Computing for Well-being) workshop, we intensively discuss about the contribution of ubiquitous computing towards users' well-being that covers physical, mental, and social wellness (and their combinations), from the viewpoints of various different layers of computing. After big success of two previous workshops WellComp 2018 and 2019, with strong international organization members in various ubicomp research domains, WellComp 2020 will bring together researchers and practitioners from the academia and industry to explore versatile topics related to well-being and ubiquitous computing.
