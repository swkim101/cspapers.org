Respiratory related events (RE) during nocturnal sleep disturb the natural physiological pattern of sleep. This events may include all types of apnea and hypopnea, respiratory-event-related arousals and snoring. The particular importance of breath analysis is currently associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed algorithm is a deep learning model with long short-term memory cells for RE detection for each 1 minute epoch during nocturnal sleep. Our approach provides the basis for a smartwatch based respiratory-related sleep pattern analysis (accuracy of epoch-by-epoch classification is greater than 80 %), can be applied for a potential risk of respiratory-related diseases screening (mean absolute error of AHI estimation is about 6.5 events/h on the test set, which includes participants with all types of apnea severity; two class screening accuracy (AHI threshold is 15 events/h) is greater than 90 %).
