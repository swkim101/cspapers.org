There is a relative lack of affective technology to support young children in communicating their emotions, particularly in educational contexts. This paper is concerned with discussing prior design challenges and vision for creating an emotion-communication technology for young children. We describe a system - the Catbus - which conceptualizes a digital and interactive storytelling of children's emotions fed through their wristbands, as well as online resources to support adoption by educators and students.
