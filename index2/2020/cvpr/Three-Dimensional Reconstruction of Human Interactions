Understanding 3d human interactions is fundamental for fine grained scene analysis and behavioural modeling. However, most of the existing models focus on analyzing a single person in isolation, and those who process several people focus largely on resolving multi-person data association, rather than inferring interactions. This may lead to incorrect, lifeless 3d estimates, that miss the subtle human contact aspects--the essence of the event--and are of little use for detailed behavioral understanding. This paper addresses such issues and makes several contributions: (1) we introduce models for interaction signature estimation (ISP) encompassing contact detection, segmentation, and 3d contact signature prediction; (2) we show how such components can be leveraged in order to produce augmented losses that ensure contact consistency during 3d reconstruction; (3) we construct several large datasets for learning and evaluating 3d contact prediction and reconstruction methods; specifically, we introduce CHI3D, a lab-based accurate 3d motion capture dataset with 631 sequences containing 2,525 contact events, 728,664 ground truth 3d poses, as well as FlickrCI3D, a dataset of 11,216 images, with 14,081 processed pairs of people, and 81,233 facet-level surface correspondences within 138,213 selected contact regions. Finally, (4) we present models and baselines to illustrate how contact estimation supports meaningful 3d reconstruction where essential interactions are captured.
