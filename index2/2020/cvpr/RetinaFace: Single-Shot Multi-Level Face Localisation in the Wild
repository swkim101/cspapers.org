300VW [4] aims at the evaluation of 2D facial landmark localisation and tracking under variations of pose, expression, illumination, background, occlusion, and image quality. The test set of 300VW includes three scenarios (Scenario 1: 31 videos, Scenario 2: 19 videos, and Scenario 3: 14 videos) with incremental difficulty. In Fig. 2, we show one frame of the whole 300VW dataset. The proposed RetinaFace can not only predict accurate 3D vertices but also estimate precise pose.
