This paper explores how to harvest precise object segmentation masks while minimizing the human interaction cost. To achieve this, we propose an Inside-Outside Guidance (IOG) approach in this work. Concretely, we leverage an inside point that is clicked near the object center and two outside points at the symmetrical corner locations (top-left and bottom-right or top-right and bottom-left) of a tight bounding box that encloses the target object. This results in a total of one foreground click and four background clicks for segmentation. The advantages of our IOG is four-fold: 1) the two outside points can help to remove distractions from other objects or background; 2) the inside point can help to eliminate the unrelated regions inside the bounding box; 3) the inside and outside points are easily identified, reducing the confusion raised by the state-of-the-art DEXTR in labeling some extreme samples; 4) our approach naturally supports additional clicks annotations for further correction. Despite its simplicity, our IOG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular benchmarks, but also demonstrates strong generalization capability across different domains such as street scenes, aerial imagery and medical images, without fine-tuning. In addition, we also propose a simple two-stage solution that enables our IOG to produce high quality instance segmentation masks from existing datasets with off-the-shelf bounding boxes such as ImageNet and Open Images, demonstrating the superiority of our IOG as an annotation tool.
