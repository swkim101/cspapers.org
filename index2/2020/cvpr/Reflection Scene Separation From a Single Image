For images taken through glass, existing methods focus on the restoration of the background scene by regarding the reflection components as noise. However, the scene reflected by glass surface also contains important information to be recovered, especially for the surveillance or criminal investigations. In this paper, instead of removing reflection components from the mixture image, we aim at recovering reflection scenes from the mixture image. We first propose a strategy to obtain such ground truth and its corresponding input images. Then, we propose a two-stage framework to obtain the visible reflection scene from the mixture image. Specifically, we train the network with a shift-invariant loss which is robust to misalignment between the input and output images. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves promising results.
