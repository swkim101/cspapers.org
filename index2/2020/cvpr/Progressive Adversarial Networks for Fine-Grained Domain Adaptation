Fine-grained visual categorization has long been considered as an important problem, however, its real application is still restricted, since precisely annotating a large fine-grained image dataset is a laborious task and requires expert-level human knowledge. A solution to this problem is applying domain adaptation approaches to fine-grained scenarios, where the key idea is to discover the commonality between existing fine-grained image datasets and massive unlabeled data in the wild. The main technical bottleneck lies in that the large inter-domain variation will deteriorate the subtle boundaries of small inter-class variation during domain alignment. This paper presents the Progressive Adversarial Networks (PAN) to align fine-grained categories across domains with a curriculum-based adversarial learning framework. In particular, throughout the learning process, domain adaptation is carried out through all multi-grained features, progressively exploiting the label hierarchy from coarse to fine. The progressive learning is applied upon both category classification and domain alignment, boosting both the discriminability and the transferability of the fine-grained features. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarks, two of which are proposed by us, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
