State-of-the-art pedestrian detectors have performed promisingly on non-occluded pedestrians, yet they are still confronted by heavy occlusions. Although many previous works have attempted to alleviate the pedestrian occlusion issue, most of them rest on still images. In this paper, we exploit the local temporal context of pedestrians in videos and propose a tube feature aggregation network (TFAN) aiming at enhancing pedestrian detectors against severe occlusions. Specifically, for an occluded pedestrian in the current frame, we iteratively search for its relevant counterparts along temporal axis to form a tube. Then, features from the tube are aggregated according to an adaptive weight to enhance the feature representations of the occluded pedestrian. Furthermore, we devise a temporally discriminative embedding module (TDEM) and a part-based relation module (PRM), respectively, which adapts our approach to better handle tube drifting and heavy occlusions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets, Caltech, NightOwls and KAIST, showing that our proposed method is significantly effective for heavily occluded pedestrian detection. Moreover, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the Caltech and NightOwls datasets.
