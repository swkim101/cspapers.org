Some stereo matching algorithms based on deep learning have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performances since some public large-scale datasets were put online. However, the disparity in smooth regions and detailed regions is still difficult to accurately estimate simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel stereo matching method called WaveletStereo, which learns the wavelet coefficients of the disparity rather than the disparity itself. The WaveletStereo consists of several sub-modules, where the low-frequency sub-module generates the low-frequency wavelet coefficients, which aims at learning global context information and well handling the low-frequency regions such as textureless surfaces, and the others focus on the details. In addition, a densely connected atrous spatial pyramid block is introduced for better learning the multi-scale image features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale test dataset Scene Flow.
