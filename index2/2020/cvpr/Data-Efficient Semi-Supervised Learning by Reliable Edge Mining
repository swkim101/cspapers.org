Learning powerful discriminative features is a challenging task in Semi-Supervised Learning, as the estimation of the feature space is more likely to be wrong with scarcer labeled data. Previous methods utilize a relation graph with edges representing 'similarity' or 'dissimilarity' between nodes. Similar nodes are forced to output consistent features, while dissimilar nodes are forced to be inconsistent. However, since unlabeled data may be wrongly labeled, the judgment of edges may be unreliable. Besides, the nodes connected by edges may already be well fitted, thus contributing little to the model training. We propose Reliable Edge Mining (REM), which forms a reliable graph by only selecting reliable and useful edges. Guided by the graph, the feature extractor is able to learn discriminative features in a data-efficient way, and consequently boosts the accuracy of the learned classifier. Visual analyses show that the features learned are more discriminative and better reveals the underlying structure of the data. REM can be combined with perturbation-based methods like Pi-model, TempEns and Mean Teacher to further improve accuracy. Experiments prove that our method is data-efficient on simple tasks like SVHN and CIFAR-10, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CIFAR-100.
