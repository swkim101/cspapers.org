As a serious infectious disease, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major threats to human health worldwide, leading to millions of death every year. Although early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the chances of survival, it remains a major challenge, especially in developing countries. Computer-aided tuberculosis diagnosis (CTD) is a promising choice for TB diagnosis due to the great successes of deep learning. However, when it comes to TB diagnosis, the lack of training data has hampered the progress of CTD. To solve this problem, we establish a large-scale TB dataset, namely Tuberculosis X-ray (TBX11K) dataset. This dataset contains 11200 X-ray images with corresponding bounding box annotations for TB areas, while the existing largest public TB dataset only has 662 X-ray images with corresponding image-level annotations. The proposed dataset enables the training of sophisticated detectors for high-quality CTD. We reform the existing object detectors to adapt them to simultaneous image classification and TB area detection. These reformed detectors are trained and evaluated on the proposed TBX11K dataset and served as the baselines for future research.
