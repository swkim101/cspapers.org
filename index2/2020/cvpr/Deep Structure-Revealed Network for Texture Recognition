Texture recognition is a challenging visual task since various primitives along with their arrangements can be recognized from a same texture image when perceiving with different contexts. Some recent work building on CNNs exploits orderless aggregating to provide invariance to spatial arrangements. However, these methods ignore the inherent structural property of textures, which is a critical cue for distinguishing and describing texture images in the wild. To address this problem, we propose a novel Deep Structure-Revealed Network (DSR-Net) that leverages spatial dependency among the captured primitives as structural representation for texture recognition. Specifically, a primitive capturing module (PCM) is devised to generate multiple primitives from eight directional spatial contexts, in which deep features are firstly extracted under the constrains of direction map and then encoded based on the similarities of neighborhood. Next, these primitives are associated with a dependence learning module (DLM) to generate structural representation, in which a two-way collaborative relationship strategy is introduced to perceive the spatial dependencies among multiple primitives. At last, the structure-revealed texture representations are integrated with spatial ordered information to achieve real-world texture recognition. Evaluation on the five most challenging texture recognition datasets has demonstrated the superiority of the proposed model against state-of-the-art methods. The structure-revealed performances of DSR-Net are further verified on some extensive experiments, including fine-grained classification and semantic segmentation.
