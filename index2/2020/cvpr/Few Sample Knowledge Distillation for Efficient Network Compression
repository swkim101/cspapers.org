In our FSKD algorithm, we can apply the blockcoordinate descent for several iterations. However, we do not observe noticeable gains for the iteration number T > 1 over T = 1 as shown in Figure 1, so that we set T = 1 in all our following experiments. This may be due to the reason that in each iteration, the sub-problem is a linear optimization problem so that we can find exact minimization, which is consistent with the finding by [3].
