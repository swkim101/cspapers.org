In this supplementary document, we ﬁrst study the common failure cases of behavior cloning in dense urban scenarios. We then provide implementation details of the architecture and the training procedure used in the main paper. Further, we present a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach and provide additional results paired with a more in-depth analysis of the ﬁndings from the main paper. Finally, we bring to light several limitations in the NoCrash benchmark and evaluation protocol for the CARLA simulator. The supplementary video contains qualitative comparisons of our approach (DA-RB + ) against CILRS + in different weather conditions and trafﬁc scenarios
