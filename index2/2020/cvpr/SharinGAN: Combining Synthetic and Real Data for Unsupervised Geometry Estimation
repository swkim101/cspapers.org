We propose a novel method for combining synthetic and real images when training networks to determine geometric information from a single image. We suggest a method for mapping both image types into a single, shared domain. This is connected to a primary network for end-to-end training. Ideally, this results in images from two domains that present shared information to the primary network. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in two important domains, surface normal estimation of human faces and monocular depth estimation for outdoor scenes, both in an unsupervised setting.
