We present a scalable approach for learning powerful visual features for emotion recognition. A critical bottleneck in emotion recognition is the lack of large scale datasets that can be used for learning visual emotion features. To this end, we curate a webly derived large scale dataset, StockEmotion, which has more than a million images. StockEmotion uses 690 emotion related tags as labels giving us a fine-grained and diverse set of emotion labels, circumventing the difficulty in manually obtaining emotion annotations. We use this dataset to train a feature extraction network, EmotionNet, which we further regularize using joint text and visual embedding and text distillation. Our experimental results establish that EmotionNet trained on the StockEmotion dataset outperforms SOTA models on four different visual emotion tasks. An aded benefit of our joint embedding training approach is that EmotionNet achieves competitive zero-shot recognition performance against fully supervised baselines on a challenging visual emotion dataset, EMOTIC, which further highlights the generalizability of the learned emotion features.
