In this paper, we target refining the boundaries in high resolution images given low resolution masks. For memory and computation efficiency, we propose to convert the regions of interest into strip images and compute a boundary prediction in the strip domain. To detect the target boundary, we present a framework with two prediction layers. First, all potential boundaries are predicted as an initial prediction and then a selection layer is used to pick the target boundary and smooth the result. To encourage accurate prediction, a loss which measures the boundary distance in strip domain is introduced. In addition, we enforce a matching consistency and C0 continuity regularization to the network to reduce false alarms. Extensive experiments on both public and a newly created high resolution dataset strongly validate our approach.
