In recent years, cross-modal hashing (CMH) has attracted increasing attentions, mainly because its potential ability of mapping contents from different modalities, especially in vision and language, into the same space, so that it becomes efficient in cross-modal data retrieval. There are two main frameworks for CMH, differing from each other in whether semantic supervision is required. Compared to the unsupervised methods, the supervised methods often enjoy more accurate results, but require much heavier labors in data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables guiding a supervised method using outputs produced by an unsupervised method. Specifically, we make use of teacher-student optimization for propagating knowledge. Experiments are performed on two popular CMH benchmarks, i.e., the MIRFlickr and NUS-WIDE datasets. Our approach outperforms all existing unsupervised methods by a large margin.
