Existing works reduce motion blur and up-convert frame rate through two separate ways, including frame deblurring and frame interpolation. However, few studies have approached the joint video enhancement problem, namely synthesizing high-frame-rate clear results from low-frame-rate blurry inputs. In this paper, we propose a blurry video frame interpolation method to reduce motion blur and up-convert frame rate simultaneously. Specifically, we develop a pyramid module to cyclically synthesize clear intermediate frames. The pyramid module features adjustable spatial receptive field and temporal scope, thus contributing to controllable computational complexity and restoration ability. Besides, we propose an inter-pyramid recurrent module to connect sequential models to exploit the temporal relationship. The pyramid module integrates a recurrent module, thus can iteratively synthesize temporally smooth results without significantly increasing the model size. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. The source code and pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/laomao0/BIN.
