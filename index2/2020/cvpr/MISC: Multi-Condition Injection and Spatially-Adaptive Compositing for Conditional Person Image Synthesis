In this paper, we explore synthesizing person images with multiple conditions for various backgrounds. To this end, we propose a framework named ``MISC" for conditional image generation and image compositing. For conditional image generation, we improve the existing condition injection mechanisms by leveraging the inter-condition correlations. For the image compositing, we theoretically prove the weaknesses of the cutting-edge methods, and make it more robust by removing the spatially-invariance constraint, and enabling the bounding mechanism and the spatial adaptability. We show the effectiveness of our method on the Video Instance-level Parsing dataset, and demonstrate the robustness through controllability tests.
