Most of the existing person re-identification (re-ID) methods achieve promising accuracy in a supervised manner, but they assume the identity labels of the target domain is available. This greatly limits the scalability of person re-ID in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the current person re-ID community focuses on the cross-domain person re-ID that aims to transfer the knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain and exploits the specific knowledge from the data distribution of the target domain to further improve the performance. To reduce the gap between the source and target domains, we propose a Smoothing Adversarial Domain Attack (SADA) approach that guides the source domain images to align the target domain images by using a trained camera classifier. To stabilize a memory trace of cross-domain knowledge transfer after its initial acquisition from the source domain, we propose a p-Memory Reconsolidation (pMR) method that reconsolidates the source knowledge with a small probability p during the self-training of the target domain. With both SADA and pMR, the proposed method significantly improves the cross-domain person re-ID. Extensive experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID benchmarks show that our pMR-SADA outperforms all of the state-of-the-arts by a large margin.
