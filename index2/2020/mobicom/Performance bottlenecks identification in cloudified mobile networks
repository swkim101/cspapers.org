The recent trend towards cloudifying mobile networks brings more flexibility and shortens deployment times. However, it results in an architecture spanning several independent layers from the bare metal to the service level thus complicating troubleshooting and service assurance. In this work, we experimentally explore whether we can accurately and efficiently identify bottlenecks across the different locations of the network and layers of the cloudified architecture. Our findings confirm the complexity of this task and lead us to promising solutions through the use of Machine Learning.
