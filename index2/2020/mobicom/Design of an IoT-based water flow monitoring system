In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost IoT based approach to monitor the amount of water dispensed at communal clean water collection nodes called Water Filtration Plants. The design of our system caters to the limitations of low-resource settings, such as brown-outs, power surges, data connectivity issues, while our data processing methodology caters to the limitations inherent in the use of low-cost hardware installed in our deployment. Our actionable insights help the water utility of a dense Urban city in Pakistan improve the quality of service of providing clean drinking water to its residents.
