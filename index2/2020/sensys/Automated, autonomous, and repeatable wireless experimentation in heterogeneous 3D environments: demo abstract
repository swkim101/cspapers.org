The performance of wireless networking approaches degrades under user's mobility. To objectively and reliably establish their performance under mobility, one has to guarantee highly repeatable experimentation with minimized external influences, which is currently a burdensome manual process for 3-dimensional (3D) environments. To address this issue, we propose a drone-based testbed for automated, autonomous, and repeatable experimentation with mobile wireless infrastructures in heterogeneous 3D environments. The developed testbed can be easily deployed in various environments, allows for simple integration of a new System Under Test (SUT), and guarantees the absence of interference with the SUT.
