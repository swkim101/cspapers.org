To meet the content delivery requirement of the sky-rocketing increase in video requests, crowdsourced content delivery network (crowdsourced CDN) provides a new promising paradigm for low-cost and low-latency video distribution. However, due to the low contribution of storage and upload bandwidth resources from edge network owners, the resources in crowdsourced CDN are always scare. So how to incentivize crowdsourced resource supply from edge network owners are the key in the crowdsourced CDN paradigm. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism to address the challenge. More specifically, a Stackelberg game is formulated to model the âĂIJbargainâĂİ interaction between owners and content provides (CPs). With the game, we propose a genetic algorithm to reach the equibibrium. Finally, trace-driven experiments show that effectiveness of our design.
