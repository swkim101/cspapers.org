The data sharing started from the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a large amount of publicly available research data of COVID-19 have been created, their discoverability remains unsolved. The European bioinformatics institute (EMBL-EBI) aims to develop the database catalog site named COVID-19 Data Portal by collecting and organizing the relevant research data and tools information to comply with the FAIR data principles. In Japan, the lack of such venues to exemplify international efforts make the data sharing difficult. In order to facilitate the Japanese contribution and make it more findable, we developed the "COVID-19 Data Portal JAPAN" in collaboration with the original site. This site contains 75 types of research data and related information on COVID-19 from 13 research institutions. Each content is shown with a short description so as to provide user-friendly navigation. This site offers comprehensive access to research data and related information on COVID-19, mainly produced in Japan.
