Monitoring the vibration characteristics of a machine or structure provides valuable information of its health condition and this information can be used to detect problems in their incipient stage. Recently, researchers employ RFID signals for vibration sensing. However, they mainly focus on vibration frequency estimation and still face difficulties in accurately sensing the other important characteristic of vibration which is vibration amplitude in the scale of sub-millimeter. In this paper, we introduce TagSMM, a contactless RFID-based vibration sensing system which can measure vibration amplitude in sub-millimeter resolution. TagSMM employs the signal propagation theory to deeply understand how the signal phase varies with vibration and proposes a coupling-based method to amplify the vibration-induced phase change to achieve sub-millimeter level amplitude sensing for the first time. We design and implement TagSMM with commodity RFID hardware. Our experiments show that TagSMM can detect a 0.5 mm vibration, 10 times better than the state-of-the-arts. Our field studies show TagSMM can sense a drone's abnormal vibration and can also effectively detect a small 0.2 cm screw loose in a motor at a 100% accuracy.
