In the near future more and more people will have multiple implants to handle their diseases. The implants benefit from being connected using in-body sensor networks. We have previously shown that RF communication through human adipose (fat) tissue is feasible. In this poster, we argue why we believe that backscatter communication within this fat channel is possible. As security is of utmost importance for in-body communication, we also discuss how backscatter-based in-body networks can be secured.
