In this poster, we present IWannaPlay, an eye-tracking based Artificial Intelligence (AI) tutoring Chinese chess system. Through ordinary webcams, the IWannaPlay system captures the player's sight and facial expressions to acquire his/her gaze points and emotional status. Combining this information with the game situation, the system intelligently provides AI suggestions with visualizations. With the guidance of the AI, the player can strategize more thoroughly and thus make better decisions, achieving a better training outcome. When playing Chinese chess on IWannaPlay, the system interface displays a real-time game analysis and warns against potentially dangerous pieces within the game. Upon detection of the user's anxiety or after a period of long contemplation, the system intelligently provides graphic visualizations of dynamic multi-step strategies to assist the user in making decisions. We conducted experiments to verify the usability of our system, the user feedback demonstrated that IWannaPlay does provide effective guidance to players.
