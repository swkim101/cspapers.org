Input is a significant problem for wearable devices, particularly for head-mounted virtual and augmented reality systems. Contemporary AR/VR systems use in-air gestures or handheld controllers for interactivity. However, mid-air handwriting provides a natural, subtle, and easy-to-use way to input commands and text. In this demo, we propose and investigate ViFin, a new technique for input commands and text entry which tracks continuous micro finger-level writing with a commodity smartwatch through vibrations. Inspired by the recurrent neural aligner and transfer learning, ViFin recognizes continuous finger writing and works across different users and achieves an accuracy of 90% and 91% for recognizing numbers and letters, respectively. Finally, a real-time writing system with two specific applications using AR smartglasses are implemented.
