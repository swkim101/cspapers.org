Policy-based chameleon hash is a useful primitive for blockchain rewriting. It allows a party to create a transaction associated with an access policy, while another party who possesses enough rewriting privileges satisfying the access policy can rewrite the transaction. However, it lacks accountability. The chameleon trapdoor holder may abuse his/her rewriting privilege and maliciously rewrite the hashed object in the transaction without being identified. In this paper, we introduce policy-based chameleon hash with black-box accountability (PCHBA). Black-box accountability allows an attribute authority to link modified transactions to responsible transaction modifiers in case of dispute, in which any public user identifies those transaction modifiers from interacting with an access device/blackbox. We first present a generic framework of PCHBA. Then, we present a practical instantiation, showing its practicality through implementation and evaluation analysis.
