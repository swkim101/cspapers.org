In the Maximum Independent Set problem we are asked to find a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In general graphs, this classical problem is known to be NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor of $n^{1-\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$. Due to this, investigating the complexity of Maximum Independent Set in various graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active research direction. 
In $H$-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph, the problem is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever $H$ contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least four, or two vertices of degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases, where every component of $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of Maximum Independent Set remains widely open, with only a handful of polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs $H$ such as $P_5$, $P_6$, the claw, or the fork. 
We show that for every graph $H$ for which Maximum Independent Set is not known to be APX-hard and SUBEXP-hard in $H$-free graphs, the problem admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme and a subexponential-time exact algorithm in this graph class. Our algorithm works also in the more general weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function on vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.
