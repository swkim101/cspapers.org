In this work, we pose the question whether it is possible to design and train an autoencoder model in an end-to-end fashion to learn representations in the multivariate Bernoulli latent space, and achieve performance comparable with the state-of-the-art variational methods. Moreover, we investigate how to generate novel samples and perform smooth interpolation and attributes modiﬁcation in the binary latent space. To meet our objective, we propose a simpliﬁed, deterministic model with a straight-through gradient estimator to learn the binary latents and show its competitiveness with the latest VAE methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on a random hyperplane rounding for sampling and smooth interpolation in the latent space. Our method performs on a par or better than the current state-of-the-art meth-ods on common CelebA, CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.
