In logistic regression, it is often desirable to utilize regularization to promote sparse solutions, particularly for problems with a large number of features compared to available labels. In this paper, we present screening rules that safely remove features from logistic regression with $\ell_0-\ell_2$ regularization before solving the problem. The proposed safe screening rules are based on lower bounds from the Fenchel dual of strong conic relaxations of the logistic regression problem. Numerical experiments with real and synthetic data suggest that a high percentage of the features can be effectively and safely removed apriori, leading to substantial speed-up in the computations.
