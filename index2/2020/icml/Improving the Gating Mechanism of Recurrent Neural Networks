Section 4 briefly introduced chrono initialization (Tallec & Ollivier, 2018) and the ON-LSTM (Shen et al., 2018), closely related methods that modify the gating mechanism of LSTMs. We provide more detailed discussion on these in Sections B.3 and B.4 respectively. Section B.1 has a more thorough overview of related work on recurrent neural networks that address long-term dependencies or saturating gates.
