A. Semiparametric Latent Factor Model and its RFM approximation A.1. Model Definition Semiparametric Latent Factor Model (SLFM) is a Gaussian process based multiple response model (Teh et al., 2005). SLFM represents each output as a sum of C functions having different kernel functions k1, . . . , kC , where kc : x×x→ R is a kernel function. Let wmc ∈ R be a weight that the m-th output (fidelity) assigns to the c-th function. By introducing an independent term κcm > 0, the kernel function is written as
