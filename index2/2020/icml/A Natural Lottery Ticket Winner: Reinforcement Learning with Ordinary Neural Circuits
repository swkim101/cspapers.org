We propose a neural information processing sys-tem obtained by re-purposing the function of a biological neural circuit model to govern simulated and real-world control tasks. Inspired by the structure of the nervous system of the soil-worm, C. elegans , we introduce ordinary neural circuits (ONCs), deﬁned as the model of biological neural circuits reparameterized for the control of alternative tasks. We ﬁrst demonstrate that ONCs realize networks with higher maximum ﬂow compared to arbitrary wired networks. We then learn instances of ONCs to control a series of robotic tasks, including the autonomous parking of a real-world rover robot. For reconﬁguration of the purpose of the neural circuit, we adopt a search-based optimization algorithm. Ordinary neural circuits perform on par and, in some cases, signiﬁcantly surpass the performance of contemporary deep learning models. ONC networks are compact, 77% sparser than their counterpart neural controllers, and their neural dynamics are fully interpretable at the cell-level.
