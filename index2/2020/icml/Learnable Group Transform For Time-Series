We propose a novel approach to ﬁlter bank learning for time-series by considering spectral decompositions of signals deﬁned as a Group Transform. This framework allows us to generalize classical time-frequency transformations such as the Wavelet Transform, and to efﬁciently learn the representation of signals. While the creation of the wavelet transform ﬁlter-bank relies on afﬁne transformations of a mother ﬁlter, our approach allows for non-linear transformations. The transformations induced by such maps enable us to span a larger class of signal representations, from wavelet to chirplet-like ﬁlters. We propose a parameterization of such a non-linear map such that its sampling can be optimized for a speciﬁc task and signal. The Learnable Group Transform can be cast into a Deep Neural Network. The experiments on diverse time-series datasets demonstrate the expressivity of this framework, which competes with state-of-the-art performances.
