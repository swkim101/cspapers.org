ProtoSpray is a fabrication method that combines 3D printing and spray coating, to create interactive displays of arbitrary shapes. Our approach makes novel use of 3D printed conductive channels to create base electrodes on 3D shapes. This is then combined with spraying active materials to produce illumination. We demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of this combined approach in 6 evaluations exploring different shaped topologies. We analyze factors such as spray orientations, surface topologies and printer resolutions, to discuss how spray nozzles can be integrated into traditional 3D printers. We present a series of ProtoSprayed objects demonstrating how our technique goes beyond existing fabrication techniques by allowing creation of displays on objects with curvatures as complex as a Mobius strip. Our work provides a platform to empower makers to use displays as a fabrication material.
