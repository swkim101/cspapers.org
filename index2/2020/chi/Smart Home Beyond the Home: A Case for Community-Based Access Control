As smart devices are becoming commonplace in homes, we need to explore the needs of not just the residents of the home, but also of secondary stakeholders who may be granted access to these devices from outside of the home. We conducted a mixed methods study, which included a survey of 163 smart home device owners and a follow-up interview with 13 individuals who currently share their smart home devices with others outside of their home. Nearly half (47.8%) of our survey participants shared at least one smart home device with someone that did not live with them. Individuals sought greater safety and security by providing remote access to trusted family members or friends. By understanding users' perspectives about privacy and trust in relation to sharing smart home devices beyond the home, we build a case for community-based access control of smart home devices in the Internet of Things.
