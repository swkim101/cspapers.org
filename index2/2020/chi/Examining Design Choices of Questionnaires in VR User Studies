Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a musculoskeletal disease that is stimulated by Myofascial trigger points (TrPs). Exercise is recognized as one of the most essential treatment interventions for people at risk of MPS. Currently, there is an inexpensive equipment available on the online market for recording 360 videos. Meanwhile, YouTube provides free services for users to upload 360 videos. Based on these advances, the VR technique to treat MPS should have a better opportunity to reach more users. The primary aim of this research was to examine the attitudes and opinions of working-age women on VR360 videos presenting content focused on relieving MPS in the neck and shoulder area by conducting simple exercises. The 20 working-age women aged 25-40 who were considered at risk of the MPS were selected as participants of this study. The questionnaires and in-depth interviews were utilized to collect the data after the participants viewed the VR360 video, during March-April 2017. The participants were extremely satisfied with the VR360 video. They strongly agree that the VR360 video makes them concentrate on the subject seen in the face rather than the normal video, feel part of the event that they were viewing and feel free to control the direction of viewing. They also agreed that the video was interesting and well-organized, while the choice of presenter, location, emotional expression, mood and tone and duration were appropriate. Working women who watched VR360 videos with content to relieve muscle pain and fibrosis in the neck and shoulder area have a positive opinion on the subject. The combination of adequate and well-designed content and lowered costs of relevant technology make VR360 videos an acceptable method of dealing with pain.
