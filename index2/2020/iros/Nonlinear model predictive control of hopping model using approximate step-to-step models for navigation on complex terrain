We consider the motion planning problem of a hopper navigating a terrain comprising stepping stones while optimizing an energy metric. The most widely used approach of discrete searches (e.g., A-star) cannot handle boundary conditions (e.g., end path constraints on position, velocity). However, continuous optimizations can easily deal with the boundary value problem but are not widely used in motion planning because they are computationally intensive and possibly non-convex when one considers the terrain. Here we use a continuous optimization approach within a model predictive control framework. First, we generate a library comprising initial states at an instant in the locomotion cycle (e.g., apex), the controls (e.g., foot placement, amplitude of force), and the states at the same instant at the next step. Next, we fit these step-to-step models with low order polynomials (typically 2nd or 3rd order). Finally, the planner uses these low order step-to-step models to preview a fixed distance ahead and plans the optimal steps and controls. Thereafter, we implement the plan for the first step, followed by replanning. This process continues until the hopper reaches the end of the terrain. The main contributions are low-order polynomial models for fast computation and incorporation of the complex terrain as a cost function.
