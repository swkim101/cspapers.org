In this paper, we propose a formal language to specify robot skills, i.e. the elementary behaviours or functions provided by the robot platform in order to perform an autonomous mission. The advantage of the language we propose is that it integrates a wide range of elements that allows to define and provide automatic translation both to operational models, used online to control the skill execution, and descriptive models, allowing to reason about the expected skill execution, and then apply automated planning or model-checking taking skill models into account.
