Robust and accurate scene representation is essential for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as automated driving. The radar and camera are two widely used sensors for commercial vehicles due to their low-cost, high-reliability, and low-maintenance. Despite their strengths, radar and camera have very limited performance when used individually. In this paper, we propose a low-level sensor fusion 3D object detector that combines two Region of Interest (RoI) from radar and camera feature maps by a Gated RoI Fusion (GRIF) to perform robust vehicle detection. To take advantage of sensors and utilize a sparse radar point cloud, we design a GRIF that employs the explicit gating mechanism to adaptively select the appropriate data when one of the sensors is abnormal. Our experimental evaluations on nuScenes show that our fusion method GRIF not only has significant performance improvement over single radar and image method but achieves comparable performance to the LiDAR detection method. We also observe that the proposed GRIF achieve higher recall than mean or concatenation fusion operation when points are sparse.
