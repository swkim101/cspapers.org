Movement in bio-inspired robots typically relies on the use of a series of actuators and transmissions with one or more degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing asymmetrical ellipsoidal gaits for use in walking, running, swimming, and crawling. In an effort to simplify these multi-component systems, we present a novel, modular, soft, bi-stable, one DOF dome actuator platform that is capable of complex gaits through mechanical programming, driven by simple periodic fluid input. With a modular, reconfigurable design, the end effectors of these bi-stable dome actuators can be quickly modified for use on a variety of surfaces for specific applications. In the present study, we describe the finite element modeling, manufacturing, and characterization of different end effectors and outline a workflow for the implementation of these soft bi-stable dome actuators for the production of functional robotic prototypes.
