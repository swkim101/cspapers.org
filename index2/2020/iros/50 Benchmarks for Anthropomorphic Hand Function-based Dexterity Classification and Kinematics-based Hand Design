Robotic hands with anthropomorphism considerations are of prominent popularity in human-centered environment. Existing anthropomorphic robotic hands achieving part or most of human hand comparable dexterity have been applied as various robotic end-effectors and prosthetics. However, two deficiencies are evident that the design for a dexterous anthropomorphic hand is largely based on the intuition of designers and the dexterity of robotic hand is hard to evaluate. To tackle these two challenges, this paper summarizes 50 hand dexterity benchmarks (HD-marks) to evaluate hand dexterity comprehensively from three perspectives. Secondly, a novel 22-DOFs soft robotic hand (S-22) replicates human hand kinematics is used to demonstrate all the 50 HD-marks. Thirdly, 7 critical joint-based kinematic motions (K-motions) and their correlation with the 50 HD-marks are established. Therefore, a clear robotic hand design guideline is built by mapping the hand functional dexterity to the required joint kinematics.
