Passive sensing with ambient WiFi signals is a promising technique that will enable new types of human-robot interactions while preserving users' privacy. Here, we present PresSense, a system for human respiration sensing in noisy environments. Unlike existing WiFi-based respiration sensors, we employ a human presence detector, improving the robustness in scenarios where no human is present in an Area Of Interest (AOI). We also integrate our novel feature, Peak Distance Histogram (PDH), with other classic WiFi features to achieve better accuracy when someone is present in the AOI. We tested our system using commodity WiFi devices in an office room. Our PresSense outperforms the state of the arts in both respiration rate estimation and presence detection.
