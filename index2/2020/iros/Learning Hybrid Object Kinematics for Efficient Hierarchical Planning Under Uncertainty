Sudden changes in the dynamics of robotic tasks, such as contact with an object or the latching of a door, are often viewed as inconvenient discontinuities that make manipulation difficult. However, when these transitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or aid manipulation—for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully inserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require large amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as problem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different problems. By contrast, hierarchical POMDP planning-based methods scale well via plan decomposition, work well on novel problems, and directly consider uncertainty, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task decompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we propose a new method, MICAH, which given unsegmented data of an object’s motion under applied actions, (1) detects changepoints in the object motion model using action-conditional inference, (2) estimates the individual local motion models with their parameters, and (3) converts them into a hybrid automaton that is compatible with hierarchical POMDP planning. We show that model learning under MICAH is more accurate and robust to noise than prior approaches. Further, we combine MICAH with a hierarchical POMDP planner to demonstrate that the learned models are rich enough to be used for performing manipulation tasks under uncertainty that require the objects to be used in novel ways not encountered during training.
