We study a problem in vision-aided navigation in which an autonomous agent has to traverse a specified path in minimal time while ensuring extraction of a steady stream of visual percepts with low latency. Vision-aided robots extract motion estimates from the sequence of images of their on-board cameras by registering the change in bearing to landmarks in their environment. The computational burden of the latter procedure grows with the range of apparent motion undertaken by the projections of the landmarks, incurring a lag in pose estimates that should be minimized while navigating at high speeds. This paper addresses the problem of selecting a desired number of landmarks in the environment, together with the time parametrization of the path, to allow the agent execute it in minimal time while both (i) ensuring the computational burden of extracting motion estimates stays below a set threshold and (ii) respecting the actuation constraints of the agent. We provide two efficient approximation algorithms for addressing the aforementioned problem. Also, we show how it can be reduced to a mixed integer linear program for which there exist well-developed optimization packages. Ultimately, we illustrate the performance of our algorithms in experiments using a quadrotor.
