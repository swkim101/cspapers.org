In this paper, we propose a camera control system towards occasionally videoing preassigned objects. Based on the technique of real-time visual detection and tracking, using the Kalman filter and re-identification (ReID), we propose continuous composition of lens, based on the atomic rules of shots, and give the trajectory planning of the camera, to generate the PID controller to the pan-tilt. By both simulation and emulation by frame-wise cropping of video clips, we illustrate the efficiency of this method. Based on this model, we design and produce an AI automatic camera for lively photography and clip videoing.
