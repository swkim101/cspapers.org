Tendrils are common stable structures in nature and are used for sensing, actuation, and geometrical stiffness modulation. In this paper, for the first time we exploit the helical geometry of a shape memory alloy (SMA) tendril as a simple to fabricate highly dexterous robotic continuum tentacle that we called Active Tendril-Backbone Robot (ATBR). This is achieved via partial (120 deg) activation of single helix turns resulting in backbone directional bendings. A 141.5 mm prototype (130 mm when fully compressed) has been fabricated and a simple theoretical framework is proposed and experimentally validated for modeling of the tentacle configuration. The manipulator has five 2-DOF joints capable of reaching bending angles of up to 54.5 deg and angular speed of up to 6.8 deg/s. The dexterity of the manipulator is showcased empirically in reaching complex configurations and simple navigation through confined space of a curving path.
