We present a novel paradigm and algorithm for optimal design of underactuated robot platforms in highly-constrained nonconvex parameter spaces. We apply this algorithm to two variants of the mature RoboBee platform, numerically demonstrating predicted performance improvements of over 10% in some cases by algorithmically reasoning about variable effective-mechanical-advantage (EMA) transmissions, higher aspect ratio (AR) wing designs, and force-power tradeoffs. The algorithm can currently be applied to any underactuated mechanical system with one actuated degree of freedom (DOF), and can be easily extended to arbitrary configuration spaces and dynamics.
