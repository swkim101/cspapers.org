In semantic mapping, which connects semantic information to an environment map, it is a challenging task for robots to deal with both local and global information of environments. In addition, it is important to estimate semantic information of unobserved areas from already acquired partial observations in a newly visited environment. On the other hand, previous studies on spatial concept formation enabled a robot to relate multiple words to places from bottom-up observations even when the vocabulary was not provided beforehand. However, the robot could not transfer global information related to the room arrangement between semantic maps from other environments. In this paper, we propose SpCoMapGAN, which generates the semantic map in a newly visited environment by training an inference model using previously estimated semantic maps. SpCoMapGAN uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to transfer semantic information based on room arrangements to a newly visited environment. Our proposed method assigns semantics to the map of an unknown environment using the prior distribution of the map trained in known environments and the multimodal observations made in the unknown environment. We experimentally show in simulation that SpCoMapGAN can use global information for estimating the semantic map and is superior to previous methods. Finally, we also demonstrate in a real environment that SpCoMapGAN can accurately 1) deal with local information, and 2) acquire the semantic information of real places.
