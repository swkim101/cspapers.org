In this work, we propose a system for humanoid robot fast motions. When a humanoid robot performs a motion such as a tennis forehand stroke motion, a whole-body fast motion in reaction to visual information is required. There are three problems to tackle. (1) Motion is desired to be quick. (2) Real-time visual processing considering visual noises is needed. (3) Real-time joint angle modification with balance keeping is needed. To solve the problem (1), we used an offline optimization system to enhance the motion speed. To solve the problem (2), we implement a ball trajectory prediction algorithm using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To solve the trade-off between (1) and (3), we propose an offline optimization condition with an estimated balance margin. By using these methods, we achieved a non-step tennis forehand stroke motion with a humanoid robot by predicting a ball’s trajectory with stereo cameras on the robot’s head.
