Continuum robots have long held a great potential for applications in inspection of remote, hard-to-reach environments. In future environments such as the Deep Space Gateway, remote deployment of robotic solutions will require a high level of autonomy due to communication delays and unavailability of human crews. In this work, we explore the application of policy optimization methods through Actor-Critic gradient descent in order to optimize a continuum manipulatorâ€™s search method for an unknown object. We show that we can deploy a continuum robot without prior knowledge of a goal object location and converge to a policy that finds the goal and can be reused in future deployments. We also show that the method can be quickly extended for multiple Degrees-of-Freedom and that we can restrict the policy with virtual and physical obstacles. These two scenarios are highlighted using a simulation environment with 15 and 135 unique states, respectively.
