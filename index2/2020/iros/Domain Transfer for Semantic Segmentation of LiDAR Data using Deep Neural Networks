Inferring semantic information towards an understanding of the surrounding environment is crucial for autonomous vehicles to drive safely. Deep learning-based segmentation methods can infer semantic information directly from laser range data, even in the absence of other sensor modalities such as cameras. In this paper, we address improving the generalization capabilities of such deep learning models to range data that was captured using a different sensor and in situations where no labeled data is available for the new sensor setup. Our approach assists the domain transfer of a LiDAR-only semantic segmentation model to a different sensor and environment exploiting existing geometric mapping systems. To this end, we fuse sequential scans in the source dataset into a dense mesh and render semi-synthetic scans that match those of the target sensor setup. Unlike simulation, this approach provides a real-to-real transfer of geometric information and delivers additionally more accurate remission information. We implemented and thoroughly tested our approach by transferring semantic scans between two different real-world datasets with different sensor setups. Our experiments show that we can improve the segmentation performance substantially with zero manual re-labeling. This approach solves the number one feature request since we released our semantic segmentation library LiDAR-bonnetal [18].
