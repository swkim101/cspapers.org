The musculoskeletal humanoid has various biomimetic benefits, and it is important that we can embed and evaluate human reflexes in the actual robot. Although stretch reflex has been implemented in lower limbs of musculoskeletal humanoids, we apply it to the upper limb to discover its useful applications. We consider the implementation of stretch reflex in the actual robot, its active/passive applications, and the change in behavior according to the difference of parameters.
