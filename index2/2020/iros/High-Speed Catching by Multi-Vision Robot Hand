In this paper, we propose the "multi-vision hand", in which a number of small high-speed cameras are mounted on the robot hand of a common 7 degrees-of-freedom robot. Also, we propose visual-servoing control by using a multi-vision system that combines the multi-vision hand and external fixed high-speed cameras. The target task was ball catching motion, which requires high-speed operation. In the proposed catching control, the catch position of the ball, which is estimated by the external fixed high-speed cameras, is corrected by the multivision hand in real-time. In experiments, the catch operation was successfully implemented by correcting the catch position, thus confirming the effectiveness of the multi-vision hand system.
