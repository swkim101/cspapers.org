Taking inspiration from nature, the work presented in this paper aims to develop bio-inspired claws to be used for grasping and perching in flapping-wing aerial systems. These claws can be 3D printed out of two different materials and will be capable of adapt to any shape. Also, they will be soft for avoiding undesired damages on the objects when performing manipulation. These claws will be actuated by shape memory alloys (SMA) springs to get rid of the weight of traditional servos. The design of all the components will be explained in this work. Also, the challenges of being able to control SMA using only a LiPo battery on an aerial vehicle will be exposed. The solutions applied and electronics used will be also described. Lastly, experiments made both in test bench as on flight will be summarized.
