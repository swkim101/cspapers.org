In this research, we have taken a biomimetic approach to the control of musculoskeletal humanoids. A controller was designed based on the motor directional tuning phenomenon seen in the motor cortex of primates. Despite the simple implementation of the control scheme, complex coordinated movements such as reaching for target objects with its upper body was achieved, and is demonstrated in the accompanying video. The controller does not require an internal model, and instead constantly observes its body in relation to the external world to update motor commands. We claim that such an embodied approach to the control of musculoskeletal robots will be able to effectively take advantage of their complex bodies to achieve motion.
