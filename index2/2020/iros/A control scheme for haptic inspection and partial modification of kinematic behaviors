Over the last decades, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has become a widely accepted solution for the problem of robot programming. According to LfD, the kinematic behavior is "taught" to the robot, based on a set of motion demonstrations performed by the human-teacher. The demonstrations can be either captured via kinesthetic teaching or external sensors, e.g., a camera. In this work, a controller for providing haptic cues of the robot’s kinematic behavior to the human-teacher is proposed. Guidance is provided in procedures of kinesthetic coaching during inspection and partial modification of encoded motions. The proposed controller is based on an artificial potential field, designed to adjust the intensity of the haptic communication automatically according to the human intentions. The control scheme is proved to be passive with respect to robot’s velocity and its effectiveness is experimentally evaluated in a KUKA LWR4+ robotic manipulator.
