Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be an effective tool for learning the node representations of the networks and have achieved good performance on the semi-supervised node classification task. However, most existing GNNs methods fail to take networks’ temporal information into account, therefore, cannot be well applied to dynamic network applications such as the continuous-time link prediction task. To address this problem, we propose a Temporal Dependent Graph Neural Network (TDGNN), a simple yet effective dynamic network representation learning framework which incorporates the network temporal information into GNNs. TDGNN introduces a novel Temporal Aggregator (TDAgg) to aggregate the neighbor nodes’ features and edges’ temporal information to obtain the target node representations. Specifically, it assigns the neighbor nodes aggregation weights using an exponential distribution to bias different edges’ temporal information. The performance of the proposed method has been validated on six real-world dynamic network datasets for the continuous-time link prediction task. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.
