In real-world networks, nodes might have more than one type of relationship. Signed networks are an important class of such networks consisting of two types of relations: positive and negative. Recently, embedding signed networks has attracted increasing attention and is more challenging than classic networks since nodes are connected by paths with multi-types of links. Existing works capture the complex relationships by relying on social theories. However, this approach has major drawbacks, including the incompleteness/inaccurateness of such theories. Thus, we propose network transformation based embedding to address these shortcomings. The core idea is that rather than directly finding the similarities of two nodes from the complex paths connecting them, we can obtain their similarities through simple paths connecting their different roles. We employ this idea to build our proposed embedding technique that can be described in three steps: (1) the input directed signed network is transformed into an unsigned bipartite network with each node mapped to a set of nodes we denote as role-nodes. Each role-node captures a certain role that a node in the original network plays; (2) the network of role-nodes is embedded; and (3) the original network is encoded by aggregating the embedding vectors of role-nodes. Our experiments show the novel proposed technique substantially outperforms existing models.
