Distributed graph processing frameworks formulate tasks as sequences of supersteps within which communication is performed asynchronously by sending messages over the graph edges. PageRankâ€™s communication pattern is identical across all its supersteps since each vertex sends messages to all its edges. We exploit this pattern to develop a new communication paradigm that allows us to exchange messages that include only edge payloads, dramatically reducing bandwidth requirements. Experiments on a web graph of 38 billion vertices and 3.1 trillion edges yield execution times of 34.4 seconds per iteration, suggesting more than an order of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art.
