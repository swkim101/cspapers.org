Default user detection plays one of the backbones in credit risk forecasting and management. It aims at, given a set of corresponding features, e.g., patterns extracted from trading behaviors, predicting the polarity indicating whether a user will fail to make required payments in the future. Recent efforts attempted to incorporate attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) for extracting complex interactive features of users and achieved remarkable success on discovering specific default users such as fraud, cash-out users, etc. In this paper, we consider default users, a more general concept in credit risk, and propose a multi-view attributed heterogeneous information network based approach coined MAHINDER to remedy the special challenges. First, multiple views of user behaviors are adopted to learn personal profile due to the endogenous aspect of financial default. Second, local behavioral patterns are specifically modeled since financial default is adversarial and accumulated. With the real datasets contained 1.38 million users on Alibaba platform, we investigate the effectiveness of MAHINDER, and the experimental results exhibit the proposed approach is able to improve AUC over 2.8% and Recall@Precision=0.1 over 13.1% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, MAHINDER has as good interpretability as tree-based methods like GBDT, which buoys the deployment in online platforms.
