Social emotion classification is to predict the distribution of different emotions evoked by an article among its readers. Prior studies have shown that document semantic and topical features can help improve classification performance. However, how to effectively extract and jointly exploit such features have not been well researched. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end topic-enhanced self-attention network (TESAN) that jointly encodes document semantics and extracts document topics. In particular, TESAN first constructs a neural topic model to learn topical information and generates a topic embedding for a document. We then propose a topic-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode semantic and topical information into a document vector. Finally, a fusion gate is used to compose the document representation for emotion classification by integrating the document vector and the topic embedding. The entire TESAN is trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on three public datasets reveal that TESAN outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of higher classification accuracy and higher average Pearson correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the TESAN is computation efficient and can generate more coherent topics.
