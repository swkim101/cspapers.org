The seventh ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) Workshop is held virtually on November 9, 2020, in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The main objective of the workshop is to discuss novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for computer systems and network, new metric and analysis frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD, and discuss challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. New this year the workshop has incorporated a number of invited papers to capture systematization of knowledge (SoK) from experts in this field that investigate the past ten years of MTD and discuss the way forward. We have constructed an exciting and diverse program of three refereed papers, five invited papers, and two invited keynote talks that will provide the participant with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.
