Side-channel attacks have become a serious security concern for computing systems, especially for embedded devices, where the device is often located in, or in proximity to, a public place, and yet the system contains sensitive information. To design systems that are highly resilient to such attacks, an accurate and efficient design-stage quantitative analysis of side-channel leakage is needed. For many systems properties (e.g., performance, power, etc.), cycle-accurate simulation can provide such an efficient-yet-accurate design-stage estimate. Unfortunately, for an important class of side-channels, electromagnetic emanations, such a model does not exist, and there has not even been much quantitative evidence about what level of modeling detail (e.g., hardware, microarchitecture, etc.) would be needed for high accuracy. This paper presents EMSim, an approach that enables simulation of the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel signals cycle-by-cycle using a detailed micro-architectural model of the device. To evaluate EMSim, we compare its signals against actual EM signals emanated from real hardware (FPGA-based RISC-V processor), and find that they match very closely. To gain further insights, we also experimentally identify how the accuracy of the simulation degrades when key microarchitectural features (e.g., pipeline stall, cache-miss, etc.) and other hardware behaviors (e.g., data-dependent switching activity) are omitted from the simulation model. We further evaluate how robust the simulation-based results are, by comparing them to real signals collected in different conditions (manufacturing, distance, etc.). Finally, to show the applicability of EMSim, we demonstrate how it can be used to measure side-channel leakage through simulation at design-stage.
