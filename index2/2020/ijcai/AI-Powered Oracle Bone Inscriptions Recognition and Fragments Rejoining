Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) research is very meaningful for both history and literature. In this paper, we introduce our contributions in AI-Powered Oracle Bone (OB) fragments rejoining and OBI recognition. (1) We build a real-world dataset OB-Rejoin, and propose an effective OB rejoining algorithm which yields a top-10 accuracy of 98.39%. (2) We design a practical annotation software to facilitate OBI annotation, and build OracleBone-8000, a large-scale dataset with character-level annotations. We adopt deep learning based scene text detection algorithms for OBI localization, which yield an F-score of 89.7%. We propose a novel deep template matching algorithm for OBI recognition which achieves an overall accuracy of 80.9%. Since we have been cooperating closely with OBI domain experts, our effort above helps advance their research.
