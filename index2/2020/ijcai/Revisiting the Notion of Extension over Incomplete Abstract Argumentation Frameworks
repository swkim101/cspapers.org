We revisit the notion of i-extension, i.e., the adaption of the fundamental 

notion of extension to the case of incomplete Abstract 

Argumentation Frameworks.

We show that the definition of i-extension raises some concerns in the 

"possible" variant, e.g., it allows even conflicting arguments 

to be collectively considered as members of an (i-)extension.

Thus, we introduce the alternative notion of i*-extension overcoming the 

highlighted problems, and provide a thorough complexity characterization of the 

corresponding verification problem.

Interestingly, we show that the revisitation not only has beneficial effects for 

the semantics, but also for the complexity: under various semantics,

the verification problem under the possible perspective moves from NP-complete 

to P.
