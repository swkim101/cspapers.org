Contraceptive use improves the health of women and children in several ways, yet data shows high rates of discontinuation which is not well understood. We introduce an AI-based decision platform capable of analyzing event data to identify patterns of contraceptive uptake that are unique to a subpopulation of interest. These discriminatory patterns provide valuable, interpretable insights to policy-makers. The sequences then serve as a hypothesis for downstream causal analysis to estimate the effect of specific variables on discontinuation outcomes. Our platform presents a way to visualize, stratify, compare, and perform a causal analysis on covariates that determine contraceptive uptake behavior, and yet is general enough to be extended to a variety of applications.
