Among the many approaches towards efficient reasoning in description logics (DLs), consequence-preserving translations of DL theories into rule languages are among the most prominent. Table 1 gives an overview of works in this area. The natural strength of rule reasoners is their good scalability towards large sets of facts. Indeed, all of the rewritings in Table 1 are independent of the given facts (ABox), which can be used unchanged for reasoning with the rule-based theory. In general, we can describe this idea of rewriting as follows:
