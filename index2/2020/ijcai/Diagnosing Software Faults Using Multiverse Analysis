The identification of the appropriate distribution of faults is important for ensuring the reliability of a software system and its maintenance. It has been observed that different distributions explain faults in different types of software. Faults in large and complex software systems are best represented by Pareto distribution, whereas Weibull distribution fits enterprise software well. An analysis of faults in open-source software endorses generalized Pareto distribution. This paper presents a model, called the Tsallis distribution, derived using the maximum-entropy principle, which explains faults in many diverse software systems. The effectiveness of Tsallis distribution is ascertained by carrying out experiments on many real data sets from enterprise and open-source software systems. It is found that Tsallis distribution describes software faults better and more precisely than Weibull and generalized Pareto distributions, in both cases. The applications of the Tsallis distribution in (i) software fault-prediction using the Bayesian inference method, and (ii) the Goal and Okumoto software-reliability model, are discussed.
