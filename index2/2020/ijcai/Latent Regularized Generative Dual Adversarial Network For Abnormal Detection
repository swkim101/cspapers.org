With the development of adversarial attack in deep learning, it is critical for abnormal detector to not only discover the out-of-distribution samples but also provide defence against the adversarial attacker. Since few previous universal detector is known to work well on both tasks, we consider against both scenarios by constructing a robust and effective technique, where one sample could be regarded as the abnormal sample if it exhibits a higher image reconstruction error. Due to the training instability issues existed in previous generative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods, in this paper we propose a dual auxiliary autoencoder to make a tradeoff between the capability of generator and discriminator, leading to a more stable training process and high-quality image reconstruction. Moreover, to generate discriminative and robust latent representations, the mutual information estimator regarded as latent regularizer is adopted to extract the most unique information of target class. Overall, our generative dual adversarial network simultaneously optimizes the image reconstruction space and latent space to improve the performance. Experiments show that our model has the clear superiority over cutting edge semi-supervised abnormal detectors and achieves the state-of-the-art results on the datasets.
