In Boolean games, each agent controls a set of Boolean variables 

and has a goal represented by a propositional formula. We study

inference problems in Boolean games assuming the presence of a

PRINCIPAL who has the ability to control the agents and impose

taxation schemes. Previous work used taxation schemes to guide a

game towards certain equilibria. We present algorithms that show

how taxation schemes can also be used to infer agents' goals. We

present experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy our

algorithms. We also consider goal inference when only limited

information is available in response to a query.
