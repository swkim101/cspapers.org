We investigate the problem of synthesizing an agentâ€™s strategy against expected and exceptional environment behaviors. We present algorithms that synthesize winning strategies against environments operating as expected and can be considered as being best effort against exceptional environment behaviors. We formalize these concepts in the context of linear-temporal logic and show best effort strategies always exist and their synthesis is decidable.
