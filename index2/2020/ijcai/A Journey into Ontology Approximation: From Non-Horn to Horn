We study complete approximations of an ontology formulated in a

 non-Horn description logic (DL) such as ALC in a Horn DL such

 as EL. We provide concrete approximation schemes that are

 necessarily infinite and observe that in the ELU-to-EL case

 finite approximations tend to exist in practice and are guaranteed to

 exist when the source ontology is acyclic. In contrast, neither of

 this is the case for ELU_bot-to-EL_bot and for

 ALC-to-EL_bot approximations. We also define a notion of

 approximation tailored towards ontology-mediated querying, connect

 it to subsumption-based approximations, and identify a case where

 finite approximations are guaranteed to exist.
