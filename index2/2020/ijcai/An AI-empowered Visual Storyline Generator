Video editing is currently a highly skill- and time-intensive process. One of the most important tasks in video editing is to compose the visual storyline. This paper outlines Visual Storyline Generator (VSG), an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered system that automatically generates visual storylines based on a set of images and video footages provided by the user. It is designed to produce engaging and persuasive promotional videos with an easy-to-use interface. In addition, users can be involved in refining the AI-generated visual storylines. The editing results can be used as training data to further improve the AI algorithms in VSG.
