The analysis of inconsistent formulas finds an ever-increasing range of applications, that include axiom pinpointing in description logics, fault localization in software, model-based diagnosis, optimization problems, but also explainability of machine learning models. This paper overviews approaches for analyzing inconsistent formulas, focusing on finding and enumerating explanations of and corrections for inconsistency, but also on solving optimization problems modeled as inconsistent formulas.
