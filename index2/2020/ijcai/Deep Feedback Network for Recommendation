Both explicit and implicit feedbacks can reflect user opinions on items, which are essential for learning user preferences in recommendation. However, most current recommendation algorithms merely focus on implicit positive feedbacks (e.g., click), ignoring other informative user behaviors. In this paper, we aim to jointly consider explicit/implicit and positive/negative feedbacks to learn user unbiased preferences for recommendation. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep feedback network (DFN) modeling click, unclick and dislike behaviors. DFN has an internal feedback interaction component that captures fine-grained interactions between individual behaviors, and an external feedback interaction component that uses precise but relatively rare feedbacks (click/dislike) to extract useful information from rich but noisy feedbacks (unclick). In experiments, we conduct both offline and online evaluations on a real-world recommendation system WeChat Top Stories used by millions of users. The significant improvements verify the effectiveness and robustness of DFN. The source code is in https://github.com/qqxiaochongqq/DFN.
