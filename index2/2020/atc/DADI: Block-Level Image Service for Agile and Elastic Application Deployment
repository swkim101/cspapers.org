Businesses increasingly need agile and elastic
computing infrastructure to respond quickly to real world
situations. By offering efficient process-based virtualization and
a layered image system, containers are designed to enable agile
and elastic application deployment. However, creating or updating
large container clusters is still slow due to the image
downloading and unpacking process.
In this paper, we
present DADI Image Service, a block-level image service for increased agility
and elasticity in deploying applications. DADI replaces the
waterfall model of starting containers (downloading image,
unpacking image, starting container) with fine-grained on-demand
transfer of remote images, realizing instant start of
containers. DADI optionally relies on a peer-to-peer architecture
in large clusters to balance network traffic among all the
participating hosts. DADI efficiently supports various kinds of
runtimes including cgroups, QEMU, etc.,
further realizing ``build once, run anywhere''. DADI has been
deployed at scale in the production environment of
Alibaba, serving one of the world's largest ecommerce platforms. Performance
results show that DADI can cold start 10,000 containers on
1,000 hosts within 4 seconds.
