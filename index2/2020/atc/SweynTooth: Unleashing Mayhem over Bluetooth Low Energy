The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a promising short-range  communication technology for Internet-of-Things (IoT) with  reduced energy consumption. Vendors implement BLE protocols  in their manufactured devices compliant to Bluetooth Core Specification.  Recently, several vulnerabilities were discovered in the BLE protocol  implementations of a few specific products via a manual approach.  Considering the diversity and usage of BLE devices as well as the  complexity of BLE protocols, we have developed a systematic and  comprehensive testing framework, which, as an automated and  general-purpose approach, can effectively fuzz any BLE protocol  implementation. Our framework runs in a central device and tests  a BLE device when the latter gets connected to the central as a  peripheral. Our framework incorporates a state machine model  of the suite of BLE protocols and monitors the peripheralâ€™s state  through its responses. With the state machine and current state  of the central, our framework either sends malformed packets  or normal packets at a wrong time, or both, to the peripheral and  awaits an expected response. Anomalous behaviours of the  peripheral, e.g., a non-compliant response or unresponsiveness,  indicate potential vulnerabilities in its BLE protocol implementation.  To maximally expose such anomalies for a BLE device, our framework  employs an optimization function to direct the fuzzing process.  As of today, we have tested 12 devices from eight vendors and  four IoT products, with a total of 11 new vulnerabilities discovered  and 13 new Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE) IDs assigned.  We call such a bunch of vulnerabilities as SWEYNTOOTH, which  highlights the efficacy of our framework.
