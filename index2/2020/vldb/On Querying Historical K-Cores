 Many real-world relationships between entities can be modeled as temporal graphs, where each edge is associated with a timestamp or a time interval representing its occurrence.
 K
 -core is a fundamental model used to capture cohesive subgraphs in a simple graph and have drawn much research attention over the last decade. Despite widespread research, none of the existing works support the efficient querying of historical
 k
 -cores in temporal graphs. In this paper, given an integer
 k
 and a time window, we study the problem of computing all
 k
 -cores in the graph snapshot over the time window. We propose an index-based solution and several pruning strategies to reduce the index size. We also design a novel algorithm to construct this index, whose running time is linear to the final index size. Lastly, we conducted extensive experiments on several real-world temporal graphs to show the high effectiveness of our index-based solution.
