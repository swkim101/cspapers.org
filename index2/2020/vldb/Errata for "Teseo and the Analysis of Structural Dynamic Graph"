In our paper [4], we experimentally evaluated our work, Teseo, together with five other systems under the LDBC Graphalytics benchmark [6]. We developed and publicly released [2] an ad-hoc driver for the purpose. Since the time the paper was published, a bug [1] in the driver has been found. Due to this bug, we discovered that the completion times for Graphalytics have been incorrectly measured by 1 second or slightly more than their actual values. This issue involves the results of Table 2, Figure 8 and Table 3 reported in our paper [4]. Still, because the bug equally affected all systems evaluated and it is only related to the measurements, most of the comparisons and the general conclusions in the paper still hold.
