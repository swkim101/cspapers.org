We describe a new benchmark, DSB, for evaluating both workload-driven and traditional database systems on modern decision support workloads. DSB is adapted from the widely-used industrial-standard TPC-DS benchmark. It enhances the TPC-DS benchmark with complex data distribution and challenging yet semantically meaningful query templates. DSB also introduces configurable and dynamic workloads to assess the adaptability of database systems. Since workload-driven and traditional database systems have different performance dimensions, including the additional resources required for tuning and maintaining the systems, we provide guidelines on evaluation methodology and metrics to report. We show a case study on how to evaluate both workload-driven and traditional database systems with the DSB benchmark. The code for the DSB benchmark is open sourced and is available at https://aka.ms/dsb.
